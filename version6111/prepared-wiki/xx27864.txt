Premiering on November 6, 2001, the show spanned 192 episodes over eight seasons, with the series finale broadcast on May 24, 2010. In addition, a television film, 24: Redemption, was broadcast between seasons six and seven. Fox announced in May 2013 that 24 would return as a 12-episode series titled 24: Live Another Day to debut on May 5, 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/13/official-24-returns-may-2014|title=Official: '24' returns May 2014|last=Rice|first=Lynette|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=May 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/01/13/24-live-another-day-premiere-date/|title=Fox Announces Spring Premiere Dates for 24: Live Another Day, Surviving Jack and More|publisher=TVLine|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=January 13, 2014|accessdate=January 13, 2014[/tpl]
Bauer is the only character to have appeared in every episode of the series. The series begins with his working for the Los Angeles–based Counter Terrorist Unit, in which he is a highly proficient agent with an "ends justify the means" approach, regardless of the perceived morality of some of his actions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7046424/24-five-ways-Jack-Bauer-has-changed-television.html|title=24: five ways Jack Bauer has changed television|last=Smith|first=Patrick|work=The Telegraph|date=January 21, 2010|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/tv/content/wk-24_01-08-09_OTCSLIN_v11.273fe71.html|title=On TV: Hoping for change?

24 garnered critical acclaim, winning numerous awards over its eight seasons, including Best Drama Series at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards and Outstanding Drama Series at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. Nevertheless, the series has been criticized for its depictions of torture as effective and its negative depictions of Muslims. At the conclusion of its eighth and final season, 24 became the longest-running espionage-themed television drama ever, surpassing both Mission: Impossible and The Avengers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressandguide.com/articles/2010/05/27/life/doc4bf6dcf83048a624093088.txt|title=The final hours: '24' counts down to explosive series finale on Monday|publisher=Press and Guide|first=Kurt Anthony|last=Krug|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

===Premise===

24 is a serial drama which stars Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer, focusing on the efforts of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit, and their efforts to protect America from terrorism plots. Each episode typically follows Bauer, officials in the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind the events of the day, often simultaneously. The episodes take place over the course of one hour, depicting events as they happen, in real time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/110601/Columns/The_real_new_TV_seaso.shtml|title=The real new TV season starts tonight|last=Deggans|first=Eric|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl] To emphasize the real-world flow of events, a clock is prominently displayed on-screen during the show, and there is a regular use of split screens, a technique used to depict multiple scenes occurring at the same time.

===Overview===

Season one begins at 12:00 am on the day of the California presidential primary. Jack Bauer's protocol is to protect Senator David Palmer from an assassination plot, and rescue his own family from those responsible for the plot, who seek retribution for Jack's and Palmer's involvement with a covert American mission in the Balkans.
Season two, set 18 months later, begins at 8:00 am. Jack must succeed in stopping a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist President David Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat. This is necessary to avoid an unfounded war between the U.S. and three Middle Eastern countries.
Season three, set three years later, begins at 1:00 pm. Jack must re-infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel in order to seize a deadly virus being marketed underground. Meanwhile, Palmer attempts to be devoid of further political scandal which could cost him his presidency. Later, Jack and Palmer must cooperate with terrorist Stephen Saunders, who eventually gains possession of the virus, and stop him from releasing it in several American cities.
Season four, set 18 months later, begins at 7:00 am.  Jack must save the lives of his new boss Secretary of Defense James Heller and Heller's daughter Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, Habib Marwan uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in long-term consequences for both Jack and the United States.
Season five, set 18 months after, begins at 7:00 am. Jack is believed to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. They attempt to steal nerve gas in order to protect U.S. oil interests in Asia, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop them.
Season six, set 20 months later, begins at 6:00 am. Jack is released after being detained in a Chinese prison following the events of season five. Terrorists who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off suitcase nuclear devices in America and he must secure them. Later, Jack is forced to choose between those he loves and national security when the Chinese set their sights on sensitive circuitry that could trigger a war between the U.S. and Russia.
Redemption, set three-and-a-half years later, Jack finds himself caught up in a military coup in the fictional African nation of Sangala. Militants are being provided assistance from officials within the United States, where Allison Taylor is being sworn into office as president. Due to the 2007–2008 Writers' Strike, season seven was delayed one year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/arts/television/11show.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=After Strike, TV Shows Hurry Up and Wait|work=The New York Times|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=May 31, 2011[/tpl] To bridge the one-and-a-half-year gap between seasons, Redemption was produced. This television film aired on November 23, 2008.
Season seven, set 65 days after the end of Redemption, begins at 8:00 am. Jack is assisted by the FBI and covert operatives when the firewall for America's federal computer infrastructure is breached by the same people responsible for a conflict in Sangala. Jack must then uncover who is corrupted within President Taylor's administration, which has allowed for the Sangalans to raid the White House and capture Taylor. She is later blackmailed by a fictional private military company in an attempt to release biological weapons on U.S. soil. Jack must thwart these attacks so the conspirators will fail to cement their power at a government level.
Season eight, set 18 months later,[tpl]cite web|url=http://community.post-gazette.com/blogs/tunedin/archive/2009/08/07/press-tour-journal-24-plans-ahead.aspx|title=PRESS TOUR JOURNAL: '24' plans ahead|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|first=Rob|last=Owen|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2011[/tpl] begins at 4:00 pm. Jack is brought in by CTU to uncover a Russian plot to assassinate Islamic leader Omar Hassan during peace negotiations with U.S. President Taylor. Russia's contingency plan involves engineering a dirty bomb, which Islamic extremists threaten to detonate unless Hassan is handed over. Jack then seeks retribution for personal losses suffered after Charles Logan convinces Taylor to cover up these crimes in order to protect the peace agreement. Jack becomes a fugitive from Russian and American governments and disappears.
Live Another Day is set four years later, and finds the fugitive Jack in London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/10/03/24-live-another-day/2916577/|title=Jack Bauer surfaces for '24: Live Another Day'|work=USA Today|first=Jayme|last=Deerwester|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 5, 2013[/tpl]

==Production==

===Conception===

The idea for the series first came from executive producer Joel Surnow, who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season.  Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day.[tpl]cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher |title=Kiefer Sutherland — Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=14|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8[/tpl] He discussed the idea over the phone with producer Robert Cochran, whose initial response was "Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard".[tpl]cite video|people=Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran (co-creators)|title=24: The Complete First Season (Special Edition) – "The Genesis of 24"|medium=DVD|date=May 20, 2008|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] They met the next day at the International House of Pancakes in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, to discuss the idea of this action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.
The pilot for 24 was pitched to Fox who immediately bought it, saying they felt that the idea for the series was one that would "move the form of television forward".[tpl]cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher|title=Kiefer Sutherland — Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=15|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8[/tpl] The episode had a $4 million budget with filming in March 2001, mostly done in an old Chatsworth pencil factory. The set of CTU was initially done in a Fox Sports office, with the set reproduced once the series was picked up for the season.[tpl]cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher|title=Kiefer Sutherland — Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=16|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvbarn.com/tv-barn/behind-the-scenes-at-24-aka-fort-ticonderoga-ill-explain/|title=Behind the scenes at "24″ (aka Fort Ticonderoga ...

The pilot of the series was well received by critics, and was signed on for an initial thirteen episodes. Production began in July 2001, and the premiere was planned for October 30, but because of the September 11 attacks, delayed until November 6.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Flash_Fox2420000101|title=Photo Flash: Arrivals at Fox's 24 Series Finale Party|publisher=Broadway World|date=May 1, 2010|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/24-has-come-to-an-end|title=24 has come to an end|last=Gallagher|first=Brian|publisher=Movie Web|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher|title=Kiefer Sutherland — Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=160|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8[/tpl] After the first three episodes, Fox greenlit the remaining filmed 11 episodes and following Kiefer Sutherland's Golden Globe win, Fox ordered the second half of the season.[tpl]cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher|title=Kiefer Sutherland — Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=170|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8[/tpl]

===Design===

Although not the first to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing "24 episodes in a season, which each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/jacks-back-the-clock-ticks-for-24s-antihero-1027348.html|title=Jack's back: The clock ticks for 24's antihero|last=Hanks|first=Robert|publisher=Independent News & Media Limited|date=November 21, 2008|accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl] The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.
Another idea was the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.
A major concept used in the series was the idea of a running clock. This initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock which appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating beeping noise for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or a disastrous event.[tpl]Cite episode |title=On the Record, On the Set of 24|network=Fox News|airdate=November 1, 2006[/tpl]

===Setting===

The first six seasons of the show were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations—both real and fictional. Other locations have also been featured, such as Washington, D.C., for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season took place in New York City,[tpl]cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/television/15twentyfour.html|title=Another Terrorist Plot, Another Very Long Day|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|work=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100405110256/http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/television/15twentyfour.html| archivedate= April 5, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and the TV film Redemption, filmed in South Africa, was set mainly in the fictional African nation of Sangala.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/821/821061p1.html|title=IGN: 24: The Dead Rise|publisher=IGN|first=Eric|last=Goldman|date=September 19, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2008[/tpl]
The main setting of the show is the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit. Its office consists of two main departments: Field Operations, which involves confronting and apprehending suspects, and Communications, which gathers intelligence and assists those that work in Field Operations. CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to "Divisions", and Divisions reporting to the "District". While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the National Counterterrorism Center, have emerged since the show's debut on television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28525607|title=24 ups the ante in Washington, D.C. |date=June 1, 2009|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011[/tpl]
The set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in an old pencil factory in Chatsworth. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but was redesigned before the start of the fourth season, and again before the start of the eighth season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as Charles Logan's presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the White House bunker shown in season six.

===Series conclusion===

On March 26, 2010, a statement was issued from Fox which explained that season eight would conclude the original series. Kiefer Sutherland gave a statement:
Executive producer and showrunner Howard Gordon was also a part of the decision. He was quoted saying:
Peter Rice, Chairman of Entertainment at Fox Networks Group said, "24 is so much more than just a TV show – it has redefined the drama genre and created one of the most admired action icons in television history." Kevin Reilly, President of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company added, "We are extremely proud of this groundbreaking series and will be forever thankful to Kiefer, the producers, the cast and crew for everything they've put into 24 over the years. It's truly been an amazing and unforgettable eight days.[tpl]cite press release|publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company|title="24: Day Eight" Will Be the Award-Winning Series' Final Season|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100326fox02|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010[/tpl]
The final episode of season 8 aired on May 24, 2010.

===Relation to other productions===

Immediately prior to 24, series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced La Femme Nikita for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, and the lead characters of both series are placed in situations where they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between 24 and La Femme Nikita. Several actors from La Femme Nikita have portrayed similar roles on 24, a number of story concepts from La Femme Nikita have been revisited on 24, and many of the creative personnel from La Femme Nikita worked on 24 in their same role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/813094--goodbye-mr-bauer|title=Goodbye, Mr. Bauer|last=Brioux|first=Bill|date=May 22, 2010|work=The Star|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001184,00.html|title=Television: The Time Of Their Lives|last=McDowell|first=Jeane|date=November 12, 2001|work=Time|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2003598190_loceff05.html|title="24"/ 7 Seattle-area TV writer always has Jack Bauer on his mind|last=Krug|first=Kurt Anthony|date=March 5, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl]
Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 featured the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One).  Air Force One was featured in 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, Jürgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/search/name?roles=tt0285331,tt0118571|title=Most Popular People Credited in "24 (2001 TV Series)" And Credited in "Air Force One (1997)"|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=May 30, 2011[/tpl] The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.[tpl]cite video |title=24: Season Four: Commentary track|people=Spicer, Bryan (director); Vosloo, Arnold (actor)|publisher=20th Century Fox|medium=DVD|date=December 6, 2005[/tpl]

===Aborted feature film===

A feature film adaptation of 24 was originally planned for the hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons.

It was later decided that the film would begin after the conclusion of the eighth and final season. It was to be set and shot on-location in Europe.

In April 2010, Kiefer Sutherland said in an interview at a BAFTA event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/04/19/24-movie-script-ready|title=24 Movie Script Ready|first=Chris|last=Tilly|publisher=IGN|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=June 5, 2010[/tpl]  Sutherland described the film production as "exciting" because, "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so we were not going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show."[tpl]cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/kiefer-sutherland-dishes-on-the-24-movie|title=Kiefer Sutherland Dishes on the 24 Movie!|publisher=Sky1|date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl]

The use of torture and the negative portrayal of Muslims affected the decisions of some actors who intended to join the series. Janeane Garofalo, who portrayed Janis Gold on the series, initially turned down the role because of the way the series depicted torture, but later took up the role, saying that "being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/24/24-its-a-chloejanis-rivalryor-26069.aspx | title=24: It's A Chloe-Janis Rivalry--Or Not, As It Seems | publisher=BuddyTV |date=February 2, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/arts/television/16twen.html?_r=1|title=Deep Inside the Grim '24,' Two Comics' Inside Joke|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=February 15, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 21, 2011[/tpl] Shohreh Aghdashloo, who portrayed Dina Araz, initially had reservations about taking on the role, as she initially felt that taking on the role of a Muslim terrorist would alienate people who support her as an activist, as she had spent many years in Iran advocating for women's rights and fought against the stereotyping of Muslim-Americans. However, she took on the role as she felt that people would understand that the show was fiction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/arts/television/23rhod.html|title=Playing Against (Stereo)type|last=Rhodes|first=Joe|date=January 23, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite episode |title=24 Inside - Shohreh Aghdashloo and executive producer Peter Lenkov |series=24 |network=Fox |airdate=January 31, 2005[/tpl]

On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said:
When asked of any regrets, Gordon responded:
After the series finale, the Los Angeles Times characterized the series as "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer in the role of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision."

24 was distributed across the globe.

The release of 24 on DVD had a significant impact on the success of the television series. In an interview with IGN in 2002, Sutherland revealed, "24's success in UK was phenomenal. It was the biggest show the BBC has ever had. It was the number one DVD there, knocking off Lord of the Rings, which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available. And that's because they showed it without commercials."[tpl]cite web|first=Steve|last=Head|title=A Conversation with Kiefer Sutherland|publisher=IGN|date=October 28, 2002|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/375/375598p1.html|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] The U.S. sales of the season one DVDs increased the audience size of season two by 25%.[tpl]cite web|first=David|last=Lambert|title=24's TV-on-DVD success leads to new DVD concepts|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD|date=October 22, 2003|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/24/764|accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl]
