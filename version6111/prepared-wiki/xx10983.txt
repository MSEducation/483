This is a list of science fiction and fantasy artists, 20th- and 21st-century artists who have created book covers or interior illustrations for books, or who have published their own books or comic books of fantastic art with science fiction or fantasy themes. Artists known exclusively for their work in comic books are not included. Many of the artists are known for their work in both the fantasy and sf fields.
