==History==

The Rio Santiago Shipyard started its activities on June 15 of 1953, by the Decree N° 10.627 that established the creation of Astilleros y Fábricas Navales del Estado (AFNE), a company integrated by the Astillero Rio Santiago (ARS) and by the Fabrica Naval de Explosivos Azul (FANAZUL), dependent of the Marine Minister.
When the construction was completed, the Rio Santiago Shipyard had many workshops that produced essential elements. These include a machine shop for bolts and adjustments, furnaces for iron and copper, electronics, and sections for carpentry and paint.
It had a sustained growth during its first years. In 1969 it modified its society status and became an Anonymous Society of the State. Between 1970 and 1976, the shipyard signed and started the construction of five cargo ships with 9,000 tons of displacement built for the Empresa Líneas Marítimas Argentinas (ELMA), two petroleum ships of 60,000 tons each for YPF, two bulk-carriers with 23,700 tons of displacement and four cargo boats with 14,450 tons of displacement, also for ELMA.
It constructed diesel motors and cranes for its ships and other shipyards and train motors for Ferrocarriles Argentinos (Argentinian Railroads). It also constructed elements for hydraulic turbines, nuclear components (through a license with Atomic Energy of Canada), and bogies for railroads (through a license with American Steel Foundry).
In the mid 70’s it employed approximately 5,500 employees and nearly 3,000 employees hired by distant client companies that directly affected production.

==Recently==

After suffering the third change of direction in two years, the Santiago River Shipyard is back to work at full capacity for the first time in two decades. The new contracts signed with Venezuela are not the only ones that will revive the naval factory, there are also numerous projects already started, that require the immediate incorporation of 250 new workers.
This factory, the Largest in Latin America, suffered its worst crisis in the '90s when it almost became private, finally ending up as a part of the Buenos Aires province.
In March 2006, the "Madrisa" was launched, a cargo ship, technically called bulk carrier, built for a German client. After that the construction of a new ship with similar characteristics was started and finally began on February 2007, the first of four tanker ships for Venezuela.
The shipyard has been given offers to build oil platforms that will require, in case the job is acquired, that it share part of the work with another shipyard that is currently closed. The Corrientes Shipyard is being kept in mind for this job, since it already has experience building offshore platforms for Thailand.
January 18 of 2008 was the starting date of construction for the first block of the "Eva Perón", one of the two platforms being built for PDVSA.usará barcos “made in Argentina”'' [tpl]es[/tpl]
