[[PLK4]]

Serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK4 also known as polo-like kinase 4 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PLK4 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: PLK4 polo-like kinase 4 (Drosophila)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10733| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

This gene encodes a member of the polo family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The protein localizes to centrioles, complex microtubule-based structures found in centrosomes, and regulates centriole duplication during the cell cycle.

==As a cancer drug target==

Inhibitors of the enzymatic activity PLK4 have potential in the treatment of cancer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/71/8_MeetingAbstracts/LB-215 | title = Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 4 as an anti-cancer strategy  | author = Mason J,  Wei S, Luo X, Nadeem V, Kiarash R, Huang P, Awrey D, Leung G, Beletskaya I, Feher M, Forrest B, Laufer R, Sampson P, Li S-W, Liu Y, Lang Y, Pauls H, Mak T, Pan JG | date = | format = | work = Abstract LB-215 | publisher = Cancer Research | pages = LB-215 [/tpl] The PLK4 inhibitor R1530 down regulates the expression of mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1 that in turn leads to polyploidy rendering cancer cells unstable and more sensitive to cancer chemotherapy.  Furthermore normal cells are resistant to the polyploidy inducing effects of R1530.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tovar C, Higgins B, Deo D, Kolinsky K, Liu JJ, Heimbrook DC, Vassilev LT | title = Small-molecule inducer of cancer cell polyploidy promotes apoptosis or senescence: Implications for therapy | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 9 | issue = 16 | pages = 3364–75 |date=August 2010 | pmid = 20814247 | doi = 10.4161/cc.9.16.12732 [/tpl]

==Interactions==

PLK4 has been shown to interact with Stratifin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rual JF, Venkatesan K, Hao T, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Dricot A, Li N, Berriz GF, Gibbons FD, Dreze M, Ayivi-Guedehoussou N, Klitgord N, Simon C, Boxem M, Milstein S, Rosenberg J, Goldberg DS, Zhang LV, Wong SL, Franklin G, Li S, Albala JS, Lim J, Fraughton C, Llamosas E, Cevik S, Bex C, Lamesch P, Sikorski RS, Vandenhaute J, Zoghbi HY, Smolyar A, Bosak S, Sequerra R, Doucette-Stamm L, Cusick ME, Hill DE, Roth FP, Vidal M | title = Towards a proteome-scale map of the human protein-protein interaction network | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7062 | pages = 1173–8 |date=October 2005 | pmid = 16189514 | doi = 10.1038/nature04209 [/tpl]
