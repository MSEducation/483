[[Beverley Street]]

CATEGORIES: Streets in Toronto

Beverley Street is a minor thoroughfare located in the central area of Toronto, Ontario. It is a two-lane road serving both directions with additional bicycle lanes along the curb side of the fully paved roadway. Due to these exclusive "bike lanes," the road acts as the principle north-south cyclist route for the western side of Toronto's downtown area. Beginning at Queen Street West and terminating at College Street, the road continues northbound turning into St. George Street, which runs through the main campus of The University of Toronto. The street is approximately one kilometre in length. Points of interest along the street include: the Grange Park, the Art Gallery of Ontario, The Italian Consulate General, the George Brown House, and the Polish Combatants of WW2 Hall. It is of general consensus among locals that the road acts as the division between the Grange and Baldwin Village neighbourhoods on the east side of the street and Toronto's main Chinatown on the west side, respectively. It is designated bicycle route #35 in Toronto's cycle network.
