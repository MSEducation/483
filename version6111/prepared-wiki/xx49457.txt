[[Gymnastics at the 1904 Summer Olympics]]

CATEGORIES: Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics, 1904 Summer Olympics events

At the 1904 Summer Olympics of Saint Louis, Missouri, eleven gymnastics events were contested, all for men only.
The 1904 Games had a confusing program of events spread out over several months, and the gymnastics competition was no different.  The International Olympic Committee considers two sets of events as "Olympic":
The individual all-around was a combination of the gymnastic triathlon competition and the athletics triathlon.  The team competition was a combination of individual scores from the individual all-around.
The parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, and pommel horse scores for each gymnast were summed to get the "combined" score.
