Mary Jane "Mae" West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980)[tpl]cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank |coauthors=Hackman, Florence; McNeilly, Donald|title=Vaudeville, Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=1183|isbn=0-415-93853-8[/tpl] was an American actress, singer, playwright, screenwriter and sex symbol whose entertainment career spanned seven decades.
Known for her bawdy double entendres, West made a name for herself in vaudeville and on the stage in New York before moving to Hollywood to become a comedienne, actress and writer in the motion picture industry. In consideration of her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute named West 15th among the greatest female stars of all time. One of the more controversial movie stars of her day, West encountered many problems, including censorship. When her cinematic career ended, she continued to perform on stage, in Las Vegas, in the United Kingdom, on radio and television, and recorded rock and roll albums. Asked about the various efforts to impede her career, West said, "I believe in censorship. I made a fortune out of it." [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

Her eldest sibling, Katie, died in infancy. The other siblings were Mildred Katherine West, later known as Beverly (December 8, 1898 – March 12, 1982), and John Edwin West, II (sometimes inaccurately called "John Edwin West, Jr."; February 11, 1900 – October 12, 1964).[tpl]cite book|last=Watts|first=Jill|title=Mae West: An Icon in Black and White|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2003|pages=12, 289|isbn=0-19-516112-2[/tpl] During her childhood, West's family moved to various parts of Woodhaven, Queens, as well as the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn. It was in Woodhaven, at Neir's Tavern (87-48 78th Street), which opened in the 1830s and is still extant, that West first performed in a bar.amNew York, Thursday, September 5, 2013, p. 23.
West was five when she first entertained a crowd at a church social, and she started appearing in amateur shows at the age of seven.

Mae West Empress of Sex. ISBN 0-00-637471-9; pp. 33–34 The Times reviewer wrote that a "girl named Mae West, hitherto unknown, pleased by her grotesquerie and snappy way of singing and dancing." West next appeared in a show called Vera Violetta, whose cast featured Al Jolson. In 1912 she appeared in the opening performance of A Winsome Widow as a "baby vamp" named La Petite Daffy.[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Mae West: It Ain't No Sin| publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|pages=50, 452|isbn=0-312-34878-9[/tpl]
She was encouraged as a performer by her mother, who, according to West, always thought that anything Mae did was fantastic.Biery, Ruth, "The Private Life of Mae West: Part One", Movie Classic, January 1934, pp. 106–08 Other family members were less encouraging, including an aunt and her paternal grandmother. They are all reported as having disapproved of her career and her choices. In 1918, after exiting several high-profile revues, West finally got her break in the Shubert Brothers revue Sometime, opposite Ed Wynn.[tpl]cite book|last=Tuska|first=Jon|title=The Complete Films of Mae West|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1992|pages=25–26|isbn=0-8065-1359-4[/tpl] Her character Mayme danced the shimmy,[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Mae West: It Ain't No Sin|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|pages=78, 79, 452|isbn=0-312-34878-9[/tpl] and her photograph appeared on an edition of  the sheet music for the popular number "Ev'rybody Shimmies Now".
Eventually, she began writing her own risqué plays using the pen name Jane Mast.[tpl]cite book|last=Yeatts|first=Tabatha|title=The Legendary Mae West|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2000|page=77|isbn=0-9679158-1-3[/tpl]  Her first starring role on Broadway was in a 1926 play she entitled Sex, which she wrote, produced, and directed.

Her next play, The Drag, dealt with homosexuality, and was what West called one of her "comedy-dramas of life".[tpl]cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Marybeth|title=When I'm Bad, I'm Better: Mae West, Sex, and American Entertainment|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|pages=57, 67|isbn=0-520-21094-8[/tpl] After a series of try-outs in Connecticut and New Jersey, West announced she would open the play in New York.[tpl]cite book|last=Chauncey|first=George|title=Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=312|isbn=0-465-02621-4[/tpl] However, The Drag never opened on Broadway due to efforts by the Society for the Prevention of Vice to ban any attempt by West to stage it.[tpl]cite book|last=Eells|first=George|coauthor=Musgrove, Stanley|title=Mae West: A Biography|publisher=Morrow|year=1982|pages=66–68|isbn=0-688-00816-X[/tpl] West was an early supporter of the women's liberation movement, but said she was not a feminist.

West continued to write plays, including The Wicked Age, Pleasure Man and The Constant Sinner. Her productions aroused controversy, which ensured that she stayed in the news, which also often resulted in packed houses at her performances.[tpl]cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank|coauthors=Hackman, Florence; McNeilly, Donald|title=Vaudeville, Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=1187|isbn=0-415-93853-8[/tpl] Her 1928 play, Diamond Lil, about a racy, easygoing lady of the 1890s, became a Broadway hit.[tpl]cite book|last=Eells|first=George|coauthor=Musgrove, Stanley|title=Mae West: A Biography|publisher=Morrow|year=1982|pages=78, 79, 81|isbn=0-688-00816-X[/tpl] This show enjoyed an enduring popularity and West would successfully revive it many times throughout the course of her career.[tpl]cite book|last=Eells|first=George|coauthor=Musgrove, Stanley|title=Mae West: A Biography|publisher=Morrow|year=1982|pages=223, 228, 229|isbn=0-688-00816-X[/tpl]

==Motion pictures==

In 1932, West was offered a motion picture contract by Paramount Pictures despite being close to 40. This was an unusually high age to begin a movie career, especially for women, but she nonetheless managed to keep this fact ambiguous for some years. She made her film debut in Night After Night starring George Raft. At first, she did not like her small role in Night After Night, but was appeased when she was allowed to rewrite her scenes.[tpl]cite book|last=Eells|first=George|coauthor=Musgrove, Stanley|title=Mae West: A Biography|publisher=Morrow|year=1982|pages=105–106|isbn=0-688-00816-X[/tpl] In West's first scene, a hat check girl exclaims, "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds." West replies, "Goodness had nothing to do with it, dearie."[tpl]cite book|last=Ashby|first=LeRoy|title=With Amusement for All: A History of American Popular Culture Since 1830|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|page=224|isbn=0-8131-2397-6[/tpl] Reflecting on the overall result of her rewritten scenes, Raft is said to have remarked, "She stole everything but the cameras."
She brought her Diamond Lil character, now renamed Lady Lou, to the screen in She Done Him Wrong (1933).[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Sarah|title=Children, Cinema and Censorship: From Dracula to the Dead End Kids|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=55|isbn=1-85043-813-7[/tpl] The film is also notable as one of Cary Grant's first major roles, which boosted his career. West claimed she spotted Grant at the studio and insisted that he be cast as the male lead.[tpl]cite book|last=McCann|first=Graham|title=Cary Grant: A Class Apart|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998|page=73|isbn=0-231-10885-0[/tpl] She claimed to have told a Paramount director "If he can talk, I'll take him!" The film was a box office hit and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.[tpl]cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frederick G.|title=Hollywood Musicals Nominated for Best Picture|publisher=McFarland & Co.|year=2003|page=54|isbn=0-7864-1290-9[/tpl] The success of the film most likely saved Paramount from bankruptcy.[tpl]cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2002|page=256|isbn=0-19-515797-4[/tpl]
Her next release, I'm No Angel (1933), paired her with Grant again. I'm No Angel was also a financial success, a film that proved to be her most successful film of her entire movie career.[tpl]cite book|last=Eells|first=George|coauthors=Musgrove, Stanley|title=Mae West: A Biography|publisher=Morrow|year=1982|page=127|isbn=0-688-00816-X[/tpl] By 1933, West was the eighth-largest U.S. box office draw in the United States[tpl]cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=St. James Press|year=2000|page=116|isbn=1-55862-405-8[/tpl] and, by 1935, the second-highest paid person in the United States (after William Randolph Hearst).[tpl]cite book|last=West|first=Mae|coauthor=Schlissel, Lillian|title=Three Plays by Mae West: Sex, the Drag, the Pleasure Man|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=24|isbn=0-415-90933-3[/tpl] On July 1, 1934, the censorship of the Production Code began to be seriously and meticulously enforced, and her screenplays were heavily edited. Her next film was Belle of the Nineties (1934). Originally titled It Ain't No Sin, the title was changed due to the censors' objections.[tpl]cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas Patrick|title=Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American cinema, 1930–1934| publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|page=338|isbn=0-231-11095-2[/tpl] Despite Paramount's early objections regarding costs, she insisted the studio hire Duke Ellington and his orchestra to accompany her in the film's musical numbers. Their collaboration was a success; the classic "My Old Flame" was introduced in this picture. Her next film, Goin' to Town (1934), received mixed reviews.[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Mae West: It Ain't No Sin| publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|page=279|isbn=0-312-34878-9[/tpl]
Her following effort, Klondike Annie (1935) dealt, as best it could given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy.[tpl]cite book|last=Black|first=Gregory D.|title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|pages=228, 229|isbn=0-521-56592-8[/tpl] Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece.[tpl]cite book|last=Bavar|first=Michael|title=Mae West|publisher=Pyramid Communications|year=1975|page=87|isbn=0-515-03868-7[/tpl] That same year, West played opposite Randolph Scott in Go West, Young Man.

West next starred in Every Day's a Holiday (1937) for Paramount before their association came to an end. After the film failed at the box office, West was put on a list of actors called "Box Office Poison" by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners Association. Others on the list were Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire, Dolores del Río, Katharine Hepburn, and James Cagney. The attack was published as a paid advertisement in the Hollywood Reporter and was taken seriously by studio executives. The association argued that these stars' high salaries and extreme public popularity didn't affect their ticket sales and thus hurt the exhibitors.[tpl]cite book|last=Jewell|first=Richard B.|title=RKO Radio Pictures: A Titan Is Born|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JKgBbzjCNogC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=1|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=0-520-27179-3|page=153|chapter=7[/tpl]
In 1939, Universal Pictures approached West to star in a film opposite W. C. Fields. The studio was eager to duplicate the success of Destry Rides Again starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart with a vehicle starring West and Fields.[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.

Fields: A Biography|publisher=A.A. Knopf|year=2003|page=399|isbn=0-375-40217-9[/tpl] and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a moderate box office success, but the film outgrossed Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940).[tpl]cite book|last=Gehring|first=Wes D.|title=Parody as Film Genre: "Never Give a Saga an Even Break"|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|page=39|isbn=0-313-26186-5[/tpl]
West's next film was The Heat's On (1943) for Columbia Pictures. She initially didn't want to do the film but after producer and director Gregory Ratoff pleaded with her and claimed he would go bankrupt if she didn't, West relented.[tpl]cite book|last=Tuska|first=Jon|title=The Complete Films of Mae West|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1992|page=153|isbn=0-8065-1359-4[/tpl] The movie opened to bad reviews and failed at the box office. West was so chastened by the experience that she would not attempt another film role for the next quarter-century.[tpl]cite book|last=Dick|first=Bernard F.|title=The Merchant Prince of Poverty Row: Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1993|page=130|isbn=0-8131-1841-7[/tpl]

==Radio==

On December 12, 1937, West appeared in two separate sketches on ventriloquist Edgar Bergen's radio show The Chase and Sanborn Hour.[tpl]cite book|last=Hilmes|first=Michele|coauthors=Loviglio, Jason|title= Radio Reader: Essays in the Cultural History of Radio|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=137|isbn=0-415-92821-4[/tpl] By the second half of the 1930s, West's popularity was dwindling and she went on the show eager to promote her latest movie, Every Day's a Holiday.7 Appearing as herself, West flirted with Charlie McCarthy, Bergen's dummy, using her usual brand of wit and risqué sexual references. West referred to Charlie as "all wood and a yard long" and commented that his kisses gave her splinters.[tpl]cite book|last=Pendergrast|first=Mark|title=Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|page=200|isbn=0-465-05467-6[/tpl]
More outrageous still was a sketch written by Arch Oboler, starring West and Don Ameche as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden on NBC. She told Ameche in the show to "get me a big one... I feel like doin' a big apple!" This ostensible reference to the then-current dance craze was one of the many double entendres in the dialogue. Days after the broadcast, the studio received letters calling the show "immoral" and "obscene".[tpl]cite book|last=Dunning|first=John|title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-time Radio|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1998|page=229|isbn=0-19-507678-8[/tpl] Women's clubs and Catholic groups admonished the show's sponsor, Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company, for "prostituting" their services for allowing "impurity to invade the air". The Federal Communications Commission later deemed the broadcast "vulgar and indecent" and "far below even the minimum standard which should control in the selection and production of broadcast programs".[tpl]cite book|last=Ohmart|first=Ben|title=Don Ameche: The Kenosha Comeback Kid|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2007|page=50|isbn=1-59393-045-3[/tpl] There is some debate regarding the reaction to the skit. Catholic groups took umbrage far more swiftly than the mainstream. These groups already had it in for West, whom they despised, for her outspoken use of sexuality and sexual imagery, which she had employed in her career since at least the Pre-Code films she had made in the early 1930s. The groups reportedly warned the sponsor of the program they would be protest her appearance.[tpl]cite book|last=Craig|first=Steve|title=Out of Eden: The Legion of Decency, the FCC, and Mae West's 1937 Appearance on The Chase and Sanborn Hour|publisher=Journal of Radio Studies (November 2006)[/tpl]
NBC blamed West personally for the incident and banned her (and the mention of her name) from their stations.[tpl]cite book|last=Hilmes|first=Michele|coauthor=Loviglio, Jason|title=Radio Reader: Essays in the Cultural History of Radio|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=138|isbn=0-415-92821-4[/tpl] They claimed it was not the content of the skit, but West's tonal inflections that gave it the controversial context. West would not perform in radio for a dozen years, until January 1950, in an episode of The Chesterfield Supper Club, which was hosted by Perry Como.[tpl]cite book|last=Curry|first=Ramona|title=Too Much of a Good Thing: Mae West as Cultural Icon|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=1996|page=81|isbn=0-8166-2791-6[/tpl] Ameche's career did not suffer any serious repercussions, however.

==Middle years==

After appearing in The Heat's On in 1943, West remained active during the ensuing years. Among her stage performances was the title role in Catherine Was Great (1944) on Broadway, in which she spoofed the story of Catherine the Great of Russia, surrounding herself with an "imperial guard" of tall, muscular young actors.[tpl]cite book|last=Shafer|first=Yvonne|title=American Women Playwrights, 1900–1950|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|year=1995|page=419|isbn=0-8204-2142-1[/tpl] The play was produced by Mike Todd and ran for 191 performances.[tpl]cite book|last=Bloom|first=Ken|title=Broadway: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2004|page=480|isbn=0-415-93704-3[/tpl] In the 1950s, she also starred in her own Las Vegas stage show, singing while surrounded by bodybuilders.[tpl]cite book|last=Robertson|first=Pamela|title=Guilty Pleasures: Feminist Camp from Mae West to Madonna|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=1996|page=27|isbn=1-86064-088-5[/tpl] Jayne Mansfield met and later married one of West's muscle men, a former Mr. Universe, Mickey Hargitay.[tpl]cite book|last=Strodder|first=Chris |title=Swingin' Chicks of the '60s: A Tribute to 101 of the Decade's Defining Women|publisher=Cedco Publishing Company|year=2000|page=83|isbn=0-7683-2232-4[/tpl]
When casting the role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder offered the 57-year old West the role. Still smarting from the failure of The Heat's On, she declined, claiming  to be offended at the notion. Wilder later said, "The idea of casting Mae West was idiotic because we only had to talk to  her to find out that she thought she was as great, as desirable, as sexy as she had ever been."[tpl]cite book|last=Staggs|first=Sam|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard: Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the Dark Hollywood Dream|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|page=8|isbn=0-312-30254-1[/tpl] After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast.[tpl]cite book|last=Meade|first=Marion|title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1997|page=245|isbn=0-306-80802-1[/tpl]

The April 18, 1969 issue of Life featured West at age 75. The article detailed her views on homosexuals, her generosity to certain charities, her vast real estate holdings and her desire to continue an active career in the upcoming decade. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
After a 27-year absence from motion pictures, West appeared as Leticia Van Allen in Gore Vidal's Myra Breckinridge (1970) with Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Farrah Fawcett, and Tom Selleck in a small part. The movie was a deliberately campy sex change comedy that was both a box office and critical failure. Vidal later called the film "an awful joke".[tpl]cite book|last=Hoberman|first=J.|coauthor=Jonathan Rosenbaum|title=Midnight Movies|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1991|page=268|isbn=0-306-80433-6[/tpl] Despite Myra Breckinridge's mainstream failure, it did find an audience on the cult film circuit where West's films were regularly screened and West herself was dubbed "the queen of camp".[tpl]cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Marybeth|title=When I'm Bad, I'm Better: Mae West, Sex, and American Entertainment|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|page=263|isbn=0-520-21094-8[/tpl]

Despite her determination, Hughes noted that West sometimes appeared disoriented and forgetful and found it difficult to follow his directions. Her now-failing eyesight made navigating around the set difficult. Hughes eventually began shooting her from the waist up to hide the out-of-shot production assistant crawling on the floor, guiding her around the set.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919666,00.html|title=At 84 Mae West Is Still Mae West|last=Clarke|first=Gerald|date=1978-05-22|publisher=Time|accessdate=2008-11-15[/tpl] Upon its release, Sextette was a critical and commercial failure.[tpl]cite book|last=Kashner|first=Sam|coauthor=MacNair, Jennifer|title=The Bad & the Beautiful: Hollywood in the Fifties|publisher=W.

She insisted they have separate bedrooms and she soon sent him away in a show of his own in order to get rid of him. She obtained a legal divorce on July 21, 1942, during which Wallace withdrew his request for separate maintenance, and West testified that she and Wallace had lived together for only "several weeks".[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Mae West: It Ain't No Sin|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|pages=350–1|isbn=0-312-34878-9[/tpl] The final divorce decree was granted on May 7, 1943.[tpl]cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|title=Mae West: It Ain't No Sin|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006|page=351|isbn=0-312-34878-9[/tpl]
In August 1913, she met an Italian-born vaudeville headliner and star of the piano-accordion, Guido Deiro. Her affair went "very deep, hittin' on all the emotions.

The similarly named Walter Wincher, a writer for Accordion News magazine, corrected the error: "In a recent radio broadcast, Walter Winchell conveyed the information that Pietro Deiro had been married to Mae West for four years. As one Walter to another, I must set him right. Pietro was never married to the 'come up and see me sometime' girl.
