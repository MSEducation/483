</ref> Starting from just a few kg before the event, maximum size had reached ~50&nbsp;kg a few million years later, and ~750&nbsp;kg by the end of the [[Paleocene]]. This trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 Ma ago (in the late [[Eocene]]), suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached, after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude.<ref name = "F.A.Smith"/> However, when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation, the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of ''[[Indricotherium]]'' 30 Ma ago. (Since generation time scales with ''body mass''<sup>0.259</sup>, increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs. time plot to curve downward from a linear fit.)<ref name = "Evans">

Megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10 000Â kg. The largest of these, indricotheres and proboscids, have been hindgut fermenters, which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes.[ref]
