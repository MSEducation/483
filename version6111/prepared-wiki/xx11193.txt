The Saxifragales order, as it is now understood, is based upon the results of molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences. It is not part of any of the classification systems based on plant morphology. The group is much in need of comparative anatomical study, especially in light of the recent expansion of the family Peridiscaceae to include Medusandra, a genus that before 2009 had usually not been placed in Saxifragales.Kenneth J. Wurdack and Charles C. Davis. 2009. "Malpighiales phylogenetics: Gaining ground on one of the most recalcitrant clades in the angiosperm tree of life." American Journal of Botany 96(8):1551-1570. (see External links below)
The order is divided into suprafamilial groups as shown on the phylogenetic tree below. These groups are informal and are not understood to have any particular taxonomic rank.

==Families==

Saxifragales contain about 2470 species.Shuguang Jian, Pamela S. Soltis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Michael J. Moore, Ruiqi Li, Tory A. Hendry, Yin-Long Qiu, Amit Dhingra, Charles D. Bell, and Douglas E. Soltis. 2008. "Resolving an Ancient, Rapid Radiation in Saxifragales". Systematic Biology 57(1):38-57. (see External links below). These are distributed into 15 families, or into 12 families if Haloragaceae sensu lato is recognized as a family consisting of Haloragaceae sensu stricto, Penthorum, Tetracarpaea, and Aphanopetalum. About 95% of the species are in five families: Crassulaceae (1400), Saxifragaceae  (500), Grossulariaceae (150 - 200), Haloragaceae (150), and Hamamelidaceae (100). Most of the families are monogeneric. The number of genera in each family is:
Some authors do not recognize Choristylis as a separate genus from Itea.Klaus Kubitzki. 2007. "Iteaceae". pages 202-204. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. Similarly, some authors sink Liquidambar and Semiliquidambar into Altingia.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2005.12.003 | last1 = Ickert-Bond | first1 = Stephanie M. | last2 = Wen | first2 = Jun | year = 2006 | title = Phylogeny and biogeography of Altingiaceae: Evidence from combined analysis of five non-coding chloroplast regions | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 512–528 | pmid = 16439163 [/tpl] Thus Altingiaceae and Iteaceae are monogeneric in some classifications.

==History==

Within the Saxifragales is a suprafamilial group known as the Saxifragaceae alliance. It comprises four families: Pterostemonaceae, Iteaceae, Grossulariaceae, and Saxifragaceae. These have long been known to be related to each other, but the circumscription of Saxifragaceae has changed dramatically. It is now a much smaller family than it had been.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3298639 | last1 = Soltis | first1 = Douglas E. | last2 = Kuzoff | first2 = Robert K. | last3 = Mort | first3 = Mark E. | last4 = Zanis | first4 = Michael | last5 = Fishbein | first5 = Mark | last6 = Hufford | first6 = Larry | last7 = Koontz | first7 = Jason | last8 = Arroyo | first8 = Mary K. | year = 2001 | title = Elucidating deep-level phylogenetic relationships in Saxifragaceae using sequences for six chloroplastic and nuclear DNA regions | jstor = 3298639| journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 669–693 [/tpl] Crassulaceae Joachim Thiede and Urs Eggli. 2007. "Crassulaceae". pages 83-118. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. and Tetracarpaeaceae [tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2444685 | last1 = Hils | first1 = Matthew H. | last2 = Dickison | first2 = William C. | last3 = Lucansky | first3 = Terry W. | last4 = William Louis | first4 = Stern | year = 1988 | title = Comparative anatomy and systematics of woody Saxifragaceae: Tetracarpaea | jstor = 2444685| journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 75 | issue = 11| pages = 1687–1700 [/tpl] have long been associated with Saxifragaceae. Penthorum has usually been associated with Crassulaceae, but sometimes with Saxifragaceae.Joachim Thiede. 2007. "Penthoraceae". pages 292-296. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.
Two members of the core Saxifragales had sometimes been placed near Saxifragaceae, but usually elsewhere. Aphanopetalum was often placed in Cunoniaceae, a family in Oxalidales, even though there were good reasons to put it in Saxifragales.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.1994.tb01930.x | last1 = Dickison | first1 = William C. | last2 = Hils | first2 = Matthew H. | last3 = Lucansky | first3 = Terry W. | last4 = William Louis | first4 = Stern | year = 1994 | title = Comparative anatomy and systematics of woody Saxifragaceae: Aphanopetalum | url = | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 114 | issue = 2| pages = 167–182 [/tpl] Aphanopetalum is now excluded from Cunoniaceae.Jason C. Bradford, Helen C. Fortune-Hopkins, and Richard W. Barnes. 2004. "Cunoniaceae". pages 91-111. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume VI. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. Haloragaceae was often thought to be a family in Myrtales,Klaus Kubitzki. 2007. "Haloragaceae". pages 184-190. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. but it is no longer included in that order.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.94.12.2005 | last1 = Moody | first1 = Michael L. | last2 = Les | first2 = Donald H. | year = 2007 | title = Phylogenetic systematics and character evolution in the angiosperm family Haloragaceae | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 94 | issue = 12| pages = 2005–2025 | pmid = 21636395 [/tpl]
Cercidiphyllaceae had for a long time been associated with Hamamelidaceae and Trochodendraceae and was often thought to be closer to the latter.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2399115 | last1 = Endress | first1 = Peter K. | year = 1986 | title = Floral structure, systematics and phylogeny in Trochodendrales | jstor = 2399115| journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 297–324 [/tpl] Cercidiphyllaceae is now known to be a member of the woody clade of Saxifragales, along with Hamamelidaceae, Altingiaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae, but Trochodendraceae is in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ode.2006.08.001 | last1 = Worberg | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Quandt | first2 = Dietmar | last3 = Anna- | first3 =  Anna-Magdalena| last4 = Barniske | first4 = Magdalena | last5 = Löhne | first5 = Cornelia | last6 = Hilu | first6 = Khidir W. | last7 = Borsch | first7 = Thomas | year = 2007 | title = Phylogeny of basal eudicots: Insights from non-coding and rapidly evolving DNA | url = | journal = Organisms Diversity and Evolution | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 55–77 [/tpl] Altingiaceae was usually not separated from Hamamelidaceae until phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion might make Hamamelidaceae paraphyletic. The recognition of Altingiaceae as a separate family received strong statistical support in 2008.
Daphniphyllum was always thought to have an anomalous combination of characters [tpl]cite journal | last1 = Tseng-Chieng | first1 = Huang | year = 1965 | title = Monograph of Daphniphyllum (I) | url = | journal = Taiwania | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 57–98 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Tseng-Chieng | first1 = Huang | year = 1966 | title = Monograph of Daphniphyllum (II) | url = | journal = Taiwania | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 137–234 [/tpl] and it was placed in several different orders before molecular phylogenetic analysis showed it to belong to Saxifragales.Klaus Kubitzki. 2007. "Daphniphyllaceae". pages 127-128. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.
Paeoniaceae possesses many unique features and its taxonomic position was for a long time controversial.Michio Tamura. 2007. "Paeoniaceae". pages 265-269. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. The idea has long persisted that Paeonia belongs in Ranunculales, close to Glaucidium.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK.Josef J. Halda and James W. Waddick. 2004. The genus Paeonia. Timber Press: Oregon, USA. Paeoniaceae has been shown unequivocally to belong in Saxifragales, while Glaucidium is in the family Ranunculaceae.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ppees.2009.01.001 | author = Wei Wang | coauthors = An-Ming Lu, Yi Ren, Mary E. Endress, and Zhi-Duan Chen | year = 2009 | title = Phylogeny and Classification of Ranunculales: Evidence from four molecular loci and morphological data | url = | journal = Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 81–110 [/tpl]
The family Peridiscaceae underwent radical shifting and recircumscription from 2003 to 2009. Originally, it consisted of two closely related genera, Peridiscus and Whittonia. The APG II system placed the family in Malpighiales, based on a DNA sequence for the rbcL gene from Whittonia. This sequence turned out to be not from Whittonia, but from other plants whose DNA had contaminated the sample.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.2.262 | last1 = Davis | first1 = Charles C. | last2 = Chase | first2 = Mark W. | year = 2004 | title = Elatinaceae are sister to Malpighiaceae; Peridiscaceae belong to Saxifragales | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 262–273 | pmid = 21653382 [/tpl] After Peridiscaceae was finally placed in Saxifragales, it was expanded to include Soyauxia in 2007,[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Soltis | first1 = Douglas E. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Joshua W. | last3 = Davis | first3 = Charles C. | last4 = Gitzendanner | first4 = Matthew A. | last5 = Cheek | first5 = Martin | last6 = Savolainen | first6 = Vincent | last7 = Amorim | first7 = André M. | last8 = Soltis | first8 = Pamela S. | year = 2007 | title = Monophyly and relationships of the enigmatic family Peridiscaceae | url = | journal = Taxon | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 65–73 [/tpl] and expanded again to include Medusandra in 2009.
