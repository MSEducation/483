===AutoCash===

On September 13, 2010, Gaia announced the introduction of AutoCash.[ref]
</ref>
AutoCash is an optional feature where GaiaOnline members can sign up to buy Gaia Cash on a reoccurring monthly schedule. The current cost per month for the feature is $10; users are given a generous amount[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] of content for the monthly fee. AutoCash can be charged to a credit card or debit card and members may also pay for the feature using a PayPal account. The service can be canceled at any time; staying past three months offers users the bonus of receiving items specifically designed and made for those that continue to use the AutoCash feature. The benefits of using AutoCash include:
Users can still purchase Gaia Cash via GaiaOnline and do not have to purchase Gaia Cash via the AutoCash feature. Users that sign up for the AutoCash feature will notice that any items they purchase using Gaia Cash will be frozen for 7 days. The item(s) purchased are usable but cannot be sold or gifted to other members. Currently the system that is in place is not able to determine the source of the Gaia Cash so if a user signed up for the monthly feature and also purchased Gaia Cash via another source (like a  cash card, PayPal, or on site purchase) any items bought with Gaia Cash will be frozen for 7 days.

===Market===

Sales within the Gaian market can be divided into four areas: Gold Shops, Cash Shops, Trade, and Marketplace.

===Notable items===

====Monthly Collectibles====

Monthly Collectibles (previously known as Donation Items, also referred to as MCs)  are special items that can be bought with real money meant to support Gaia's maintenance and costs. Established in June 2003 after users of Gaia Online petitioned for a "donation system" in an attempt to increase site revenue, for every US $2.50 a user gives to the site, he or she receives an item known as a "Sealed Envelope" in his or her inventory.
Sealed Envelopes go on sale the first day of every month and are released on the 15th of each month. During August and September 2008, the envelopes were unsealed on the 8th, but on October 2, 2008 it was decided that the release date should be returned to the fifteenth. The Sealed Envelope disappears from the user's inventory and is replaced by a "Thank You Letter" for the current paid month (for example, a "Thank You Letter for August 2004" represents a payment made in that month of that year). Users are then able to open these virtual letters to choose one of two or three limited-edition items to be granted into their inventory from each letter.  These items were known as Donation Items until potential legal problems prompted the name change.[ref]
</ref> Monthly Collectible items and the "Thank You" letter items they are found in are specific to the month that they were released in: for example, the items found in the "Thank You" letter for April 2006 can only be found in that letter, and one could only purchase that letter in April 2006.
Letters can be purchased over the phone, with a text message from a mobile phone, via PayPal, credit card, traditional mail or with Gaia Cash through the Cash Shop, "La Victoire". Envelopes and letters can be later bought and sold through user trades or through Marketplace.

====Evolving Items====

Evolving Items, commonly abbreviated to EIs, are items which change or evolve over time. Items begin with one set of item poses, but with each new evolution, a different set of poses become available instead. Additionally, with each subsequent evolution a re-release of the item becomes available at the Cash Shop as a "next generation" release. When the item has fully evolved all previous poses become available for the item. Times between evolutions are different for each EI, and can be anywhere between a few weeks to a few months. Recent additions of "Rapid Evolving Items" evolve twice a week. New evolution updates are noted in regular site announcements as "Evolving Item Reports" present by the NPC, Dr. Singh. All EIs are available from the Cash Shop "La Victoire", and can be later sold through trading or in the Marketplace. EIs are removed from the Cash Shop sometime after their final evolution becomes available.

====Chance Items/Random Item Generators====

With Chance Items, commonly referred to as CIs (previously known as Random Item Generators, or RIGs), users play a chance mini-game and the item they are granted depends on their success with completing the game, when they decide to stop playing and collect an item, or their failure to complete the game. Games will vary depending on the RIG - some may require users to choose a "correct" response, while some are simply a choice between continuing the game or stopping and collecting an item. RIGs are available from the Cash Shop "La Victoire" and are eventually rotated out of the shop.

====Random Event Items====

Occasionally, random gift items can be found floating across web pages while browsing the site. Each random gift grants users a rare or uncommon clothing and accessory items that cannot be bought from any store. There are 7 different types of random items:

==Other site features==

===Site-wide events===

Gaia holds various special events throughout the year - some are yearly, regular holiday events, while some are and Gaia-specific events which may or may not be run yearly. In the past, these have included: April Fools, Halloween, Easter, Christmas, Valentine's Day, GaiaOnline's Site Anniversary, yearly Summer festivities, and the Gaian Prom. During the majority of events, users take part in site-wide mini-games and tasks, such as carol-singing during Christmas events by visiting NPC-owned stores to eventually collect commemorative Christmas items. The 2009 Halloween event saw the introduction of the Aquarium Overseer in his human form along with his nemesis, Sentinel. During the event, users were to ally themselves with either The Overseer or Sentinel, and perform certain tasks in order combat the opposing side. Events such as these can determine storyline outcomes.

===Offline Events & Conventions===

Starting in 2006 Gaia Online ran numerous special fan focused events and panels at conventions across the United States, Canada and Europe. These events were all hosted by Chris Castagnetto aka DJ Helsing who was the official spokesperson of Gaia Online. Not only did Gaia Online host official panels and events at Pop Culture conventions but they also held a number of their own events in 2010 and 2011 labeled Gaia Meet Ups. All of the Gaia Offline events focused on the community and bringing the fans together in fun and enjoyable ways. DJ Helsing became a fan favorite among Gaia Online driving internet fandom for his dancing and his personable attitude always going the extra mile for the fans of Gaia. Notable events included San-Diego & New York Comic-Con.

===Guilds===

Users can form guilds, which are clubs specially devoted to certain topics. These include hangout guilds, role playing guilds and guilds for various discussion topics. In previous years, guilds were simply run using a thread in the Guilds forum, however Gaia later expanded on this, allowing users to create private forums for guilds. Joining a guild can depend on the guidelines set by a guild captain and their crew  - some may require a payment to join, others are completely free, while some may be invitation-only. Some guilds are public (viewable by everyone and anyone can post in it), private (viewable by everyone, but only members can post), and some are hidden (only viewable by members). The guild captain, vice captain(s), and crew are responsible for moderating threads within their guilds. Guilds cost 20,000 gold to create, and additional sub-forums may be purchased for 2,500 gold.

====Clans====

Clans are like guilds in many ways but users can only join one clan at a time and clans were made specifically for zOMG! http://www.gaiaonline.com/clans/

===Gaia Houses===

Users are able to own their own Gaia House situated in Gaia Towns. Houses are available in three different styles: Round, Square, and Long. To purchase a house is free; however future changes to the style of the house costs 500 gold, and after that, 10,000 for the largest style. Users are also able to relocate their home to a different Town postcode at a cost of 1000 gold. A range of decorative furniture items can be bought from the NPC-run store, "The Faktori", such as include floor and wall tiles, tables, chairs, lamps, among others. Rare housing items can be found in Enchanted Wooden Trunks and Enchanted Golden Trunks randomly found floating across site pages.

===Gaia Cars===

On June 18, 2007, Gaia Online and Scion announced a partnership that allowed users to create a virtual Scion with customizable wheels, decals, fog lights, tail lights, and spoilers."Marketers Grapple with Giving Teens More Control Online" - MediaShift Other car choices available were the fictional Possum and Musculero. The Scion tC, Scion xD, UFO and Kiki Car (which is available only with Cash) were later released, bringing the total to seven possible cars to choose from. Users can own up to 3 cars, which are stored in their Garage. Parts and decals for cars (such as paint color and antenna ornaments), as well as car bases, can be purchased from the NPC-run store, "Sam's Body and Parts". Cars are used as part of the Rally game available on the website.

===Gaia Aquarium===

Users can maintain fish and other creatures in Gaia Aquariums. Fish and tank accessories can be purchased with both Gaia Cash and Gold from the NPC-run store, "Phin Phang". At certain times, the fish inside a tank (from a different owner, commonly as a signature under a post in the forums) will "glow", enabling the Booty Grab mini-game. Aquarium item bundles (which include various fish and tank items) can be purchased from the main Cash shop, "La Victoire". Items can also be bought at the marketplace.

===Arenas===

There are four main arenas on Gaia Online: Housing, Art, Avatar and Writing - with some of these arenas having subcategories.  Members can vote in the arenas and comment on art, avatars, houses or written works which have been submitted by other users. Entering the Avatar Arena costs 10,000 Gold and rewards up to 150,000 gold for winners.  Entries to the Writing Arena costs 10000 Gold (recently changed from 100g to lower so many trash entries). Entering the Art and Housing Arena is free, and no prizes are awarded.

===Sponsor Quests===

The Gaia Quest system grants users items for performing certain tasks. Although previously quests for doing tasks around the website (similar to Gaia's current Achievement system), quests on the site are now for promotional purposes, granting items related to a featured movie, video game, or series for watching trailers or advertisements. Movies, video games, and other products that are promoted by the Gaia Quest system include Gracie, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, The Golden Compass, Nancy Drew, The Last Mimzy,"Valley of the Virtual Dolls" - Business Week The Spiderwick Chronicles, Kung Fu Panda, Bee Movie, Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce, You Don't Mess With The Zohan, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, The Sims 3, Sonic and the Black Knight, Harry Potter, August Underground's Mordum, PopStar Guitar, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, among many others.

The game utilizes special rings to activate abilities, such as throwing fireballs or conjuring up a defense. Users do not level up the traditional way via experience points, but instead, through collecting Charge Orbs and empowering their rings with them. zOMG was made public and open to beta testing in November 2008, and since then a number of updates have been made to the rings and flow of the game."Focus testing Gaia's 'zOMG" - CNET"Interview: Talking Gaia MMOG with Dave Georgeson, Sr. Producer" - Virtual Worlds News

==Virtual worlds==

===Towns===

Gaia Towns (often simply called Towns) is a virtual world where avatars may move and interact with each other. While in Towns users can pick up various items. Bugs, litter, and flowers can be collected while in towns, these items can later be made into other items for a small cost. Shaking trees, rocks, and shrubs can yield small amounts of gold to be collected.. Users may use a virtual chat system while in the towns. Homes can be found throughout Towns and more than one user can visit someone else's home. The towns often host events such as snowball fights and trick-or-treating.

===Sponsored Worlds===

Since 2009, Gaia has been implementing virtual worlds, similar to Towns, for various site sponsors. These have included a rainbow-styled world for a Skittles sponsor, a castle for an Alice in Wonderland film promotion, a large forest tree for the Legend of the Guardians film, and a tree house for the TV show "Adventure Time" among many others. Users can interact with certain NPCs in these areas, and are often awarded prizes for visiting these areas.
