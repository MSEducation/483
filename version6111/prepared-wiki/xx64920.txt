[[Middle management]]

CATEGORIES: Management

Middle management is the intermediate management of a hierarchical organization, being subordinate to the senior management but above the lowest levels of operational staff.  Operational supervisors may be considered middle management or may be categorized as non-management staff, depending upon the policy of the particular organization.[tpl]citation | title=Middle Managers | author=Peter Aucoin | publisher=Institute of Public Administration of Canada | year=1989 | page=191 | isbn=9780920715024[/tpl]
Middle management may be reduced in organizations as a result of reorganization.  Such changes include downsizing, delayering and outsourcing.  The changes may be made in order to reduce costs, as middle management is commonly paid more than junior staff, or the changes may be made to make the organization flatter â€” empowering the employees and making the organization more innovative and flexible.
