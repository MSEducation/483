Niobium, formerly columbium, is a chemical element with the symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus.
Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum, and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.
It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1%, that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines. Niobium is used in various superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also containing titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics and jewelry. In the last two applications, niobium's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodization are particular advantages.

==History==

Niobium was discovered by the English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801.[ref]See:
Subsequently, there was considerable confusion[tpl]cite journal|title = On the Identity of Columbium and Tantalum|pages = 246–252|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|first = William Hyde|last = Wollaston|authorlink = William Hyde Wollaston|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1809.0017| jstor = 107264|volume = 99|year = 1809[/tpl] over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918 g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8 g/cm3, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe), and pelopium (from Pelops).[tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber die Zusammensetzung der Tantalite und ein im Tantalite von Baiern enthaltenes neues Metall|pages = 317–341|journal = Annalen der Physik|authorlink = Heinrich Rose|language=German|first = Heinrich|last = Rose|doi = 10.1002/andp.18441391006|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15148n/f327.table|volume = 139|issue = 10|year = 1844|bibcode = 1844AnP...139..317R [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber die Säure im Columbit von Nordamérika|language=German|pages = 572–577|first = Heinrich|last = Rose|journal = Annalen der Physik|doi = 10.1002/andp.18471460410|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15155x/f586.table |year=1847| volume = 146|issue = 4|authorlink = Heinrich Rose|bibcode = 1847AnP...146..572R [/tpl] This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium and dianium[tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber eine eigenthümliche Säure, Diansäure, in der Gruppe der Tantal- und Niob- verbindungen|first = V.|last = Kobell|journal =Journal für Praktische Chemie|volume = 79|issue = 1|pages = 291–303 |doi=10.1002/prac.18600790145|year = 1860[/tpl] were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.
The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865[tpl]cite journal|title = Tantalsäure, Niobsäure, (Ilmensäure) und Titansäure|journal = Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry|volume = 5|issue = 1|year = 1866|doi = 10.1007/BF01302537|pages = 384–389|author= Marignac, Blomstrand, H. Deville, L. Troost und R. Hermann[/tpl] and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac[tpl]cite journal|journal = Annales de chimie et de physique|title = Recherches sur les combinaisons du niobium|pages = 7–75|authorlink = Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|language=French| first = M. C.|last= Marignac|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34818t/f4.table|year= 1866|volume = 4|issue = 8[/tpl] in 1866, who all proved that there were only two elements. Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871.[tpl]cite journal|title = Fortgesetzte Untersuchungen über die Verbindungen von Ilmenium und Niobium, sowie über die Zusammensetzung der Niobmineralien (Further research about the compounds of ilmenium and niobium, as well as the composition of niobium minerals)|first = R.|last = Hermann|journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie|language=German|volume = 3|issue = 1|pages =373–427|doi = 10.1002/prac.18710030137|year = 1871[/tpl]
De Marignac was the first to prepare the metal in 1864, when he reduced niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen.[tpl]cite web|url = http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e04100.html|title = Niobium|publisher = Universidade de Coimbra|accessdate = 2008-09-05[/tpl] Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially, in incandescent lamp filaments. This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten, which has a higher melting point and thus is preferable for use in incandescent lamps. The discovery that niobium improves the strength of steel was made in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use. In 1961 the American physicist Eugene Kunzler and coworkers at Bell Labs discovered that niobium-tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields,Geballe et al. (1993) gives a critical point at currents of 150 kiloamperes and magnetic fields of 8.8 tesla. making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrically powered machinery. This discovery would allow — two decades later — the production of long multi-strand cables that could be wound into coils to create large, powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery, particle accelerators, or particle detectors.[tpl]cite journal|last = Geballe|first = Theodore H.| title = Superconductivity: From Physics to Technology|journal = Physics Today|volume = 46|issue = 10|date=October 1993|pages=52–56|url =|doi=10.1063/1.881384[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|volume = 95|pages = 1435–1435|year = 1954|title = Superconductivity of Nb3Sn|first = B.

===Naming of the element===

Columbium (symbol Cb[tpl]cite journal|title = Reaction of Tantalum, Columbium and Vanadium with Iodine|first = F.|last = Kòrösy|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|year = 1939|volume = 61|issue = 4|pages = 838–843|doi = 10.1021/ja01873a018[/tpl]) was the name originally given to this element by Hatchett, and this name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by American Chemical Society with columbium in its title dates from 1953[tpl]cite journal|title = Photometric Determination of Columbium, Tungsten, and Tantalum in Stainless Steels| first = Luther|last = Ikenberry|coauthors = Martin, J.

To end this confusion, the name niobium was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949.[tpl]cite journal |first = Geoff|last = Rayner-Canham|coauthors = Zheng, Zheng|title = Naming elements after scientists: an account of a controversy|journal = Foundations of Chemistry|volume = 10|issue = 1|year = 2008|doi = 10.1007/s10698-007-9042-1|pages = 13–18[/tpl] A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name Columbium. The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Science|year = 1914|title = Columbium Versus Niobium|pages = 139–140|first = F.

Not everyone agreed, and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations refer to it by the official IUPAC name, many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and the United States Geological Survey still refer to the metal by the original "columbium".[tpl]cite journal|journal = Catalysis Today|year = 2003|title = Vanadium to dubnium: from confusion through clarity to complexity|pages = 5–11|last = Norman N.|first = Greenwood|doi = 10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00318-8 |volume = 78|issue = 1–4[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Physical===

Niobium is a lustrous, grey, ductile, paramagnetic metal in group 5 of the periodic table (see table), although it has an atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells compared to the rest of the members. (This can be observed in the neighborhood of ruthenium (44), rhodium (45), and palladium (46).)
Niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors: 9.2 K.[tpl]cite journal|title = A Superconducting Nb3Sn Coated Multicell Accelerating Cavity|first = M.|last = Peiniger|coauthors = Piel, H.|journal = Nuclear Science|year= 1985|volume= 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TNS.1985.4334443|page = 3610|bibcode = 1985ITNS...32.3610P [/tpl] Niobium has the largest magnetic penetration depth of any element. In addition, it is one of the three elemental Type II superconductors, along with vanadium and technetium. The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal.[tpl]cite journal|title=Melting And Purification Of Niobium|first=Hernane R.|last = Salles Moura|coauthor=Louremjo de Moura, Louremjo |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|year=2007|issue=927(Single Crystal – Large Grain Niobium Technology)|pages=165–178|publisher=American Institute of Physics|issn=0094-243X|url=http://link.aip.org/link/?APCPCS/927/165/1[/tpl] When very pure, it is comparatively soft and ductile, but impurities make it harder.
The metal has a low capture cross-section for thermal neutrons;[tpl]cite journal|title = Columbium Alloys Today| last = Jahnke| first = L.P.|coauthors = Frank, R.G.; Redden, T.K.|year = 1960|journal = Metal Progr.|volume = 77|issue = 6|pages = 69–74|osti = 4183692[/tpl] thus it is used in the nuclear industries.[tpl]cite journal|first = A. V.|last = Nikulina|title = Zirconium-Niobium Alloys for Core Elements of Pressurized Water Reactors|journal = Metal Science and Heat Treatment|volume = 45|issue = 7–8|year = 2003|doi = 10.1023/A:1027388503837|pages = 287–292[/tpl]

===Chemical===

The metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods.[tpl]cite book|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|first = David R.|last = Lide|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8493-0485-9| pages = 4–21|edition = 85|chapter = The Elements[/tpl] Despite presenting a high melting point in elemental form (2,468 °C), it has a low density in comparison to other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.
Niobium is slightly less electropositive and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, owing to the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table.[tpl]cite book|title = Extractive Metallurgy of Niobium|first = C. K.|last = Gupta|coauthors = Suri, A. K.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1994 |isbn = 0-8493-6071-4|pages = 1–16[/tpl] Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, its lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding uses such as linings in chemical plants.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring niobium is composed of one stable isotope, 93Nb.[tpl]cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.[/tpl] As of 2003, at least 32 radioisotopes have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most stable of these is 92Nb with a half-life of 34.7 million years. One of the least stable is 113Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30 milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 93Nb tend to decay by β+ decay, and those that are heavier tend to decay by β- decay, with some exceptions. 81Nb, 82Nb, and 84Nb have minor β+ delayed proton emission decay paths, 91Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and 92Nb decays by both β+ and β- decay.
At least 25 nuclear isomers have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only 96Nb, 101Nb, and 103Nb do not have isomers. The most stable of niobium's isomers is 93mNb with a half-life of 16.13 years. The least stable isomer is 84mNb with a half-life of 103 ns. All of niobium's isomers decay by isomeric transition or beta decay except 92m1Nb, which has a minor electron capture decay chain.

===Occurrence===

Niobium is estimated to be the 33rd most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20 ppm.[tpl]cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first=John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 0-19-850340-7|chapter = Niobium|pages = 283–286[/tpl] Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, but that the "missing" niobium may be located in the Earth’s core due to the metal's high density. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals.[tpl]cite journal|title=Niobium Compounds: Preparation, Characterization, and Application in Heterogeneous Catalysis|author=Nowak, Izabela; Ziolek, Maria|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=1999|volume=99|issue=12|pages=3603–3624|doi=10.1021/cr9800208|pmid=11849031[/tpl]
Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum.  Examples include columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6) and columbite–tantalite (or coltan, (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)2O6). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements.  Examples of such niobates are pyrochlore ((Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of pyrochlore.[tpl]cite journal|title = Geochemical alteration of pyrochlore group minerals: Pyrochlore subgroup|year = 1995|first = Gregory R.|last = Lumpkin|coauthor = Ewing, Rodney C.|journal = American Mineralogist|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1995/Lumpkin_p732-743_95.pdf|volume = 80|pages = 732–743[/tpl] 
The two largest deposits of pyrochlore were found in the 1950s in Brazil and Canada, and both countries are still the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates. The largest deposit is hosted within a carbonatite intrusion at Araxá, Minas Gerais Brazil, owned by CBMM ([tpl]lang|pt|Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração[/tpl]); the other deposit is located in Goiás and owned by Anglo American plc (through its subsidiary Mineração Catalão), also hosted within a carbonatite intrusion. Altogether these two Brazilian mines produce around 75% of world supply. The third largest producer of niobium is the carbonatite-hosted Niobec Mine, Saint-Honoré near Chicoutimi, Quebec owned by Iamgold Corporation Ltd, which produces around 7% of world supply.[tpl]cite web|url = http://tesla.desy.de/new_pages/TESLA_Reports/2001/pdf_files/tesla2001-27.pdf|title = Niob für TESLA|accessdate = 2008-09-02|first= J|last = Kouptsidis|coauthors =Peters, F.; Proch, D.; Singer, W.|publisher = Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY|language = German[/tpl] Kenya's deposits found in Kwale are ranked amongst the top six in the world.http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Cortec-Mining-to-build-Sh12-8bn-factory-/-/539552/1882130/-/158j4v2z/-/index.html

==Production==

After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum Ta2O5 and niobium Nb2O5 are obtained. The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with hydrofluoric acid:
The first industrial scale separation, developed by de Marignac, exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K2NbOF5·H2O) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K2TaF7) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents like cyclohexanone. The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the organic solvent with water and either precipitated by the addition of potassium fluoride to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with ammonia as the pentoxide:
Followed by:
Several methods are used for the reduction to metallic niobium. The electrolysis of a molten mixture of K2NbOF5 and sodium chloride is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with sodium. With this method niobium with a relatively high purity can be obtained. In large scale production the reduction of Nb2O5 with hydrogen or carbon is used. In the process involving the aluminothermic reaction a mixture of iron oxide and niobium oxide is reacted with aluminium:
To enhance the reaction, small amounts of oxidizers like sodium nitrate are added. The result is aluminium oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production.[tpl]cite journal|title = Progress in Niobium Markets and Technology 1981–2001|author = Tither, Geoffrey|url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/oppening.pdf|journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = The Production of Ferroniobium at the Niobec mine 1981–2001|first = Claude|last = Dufresne|coauthor = Goyette, Ghislain| url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_1/images/pdfs/start.pdf|accessdate =|journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF[/tpl] The ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% of niobium. Without addition of iron oxide, aluminothermic process is used for the production of niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys.
