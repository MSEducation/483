Steve Caton is a professional guitarist/singer, song writer, producer, and visual artist, whose career has spanned almost three decades.
Catons first time in a band was in Tedd Armstrongs' band "PEGASUS" in the late 1970s into early 1980s. Even as a beginner, Caton's talent as a lead guitarist was apparent. Songs like "California Girl" and "At First Sight" and the cover or J. Kidds "Shakin All Over" with Armstrong as lead vocal rhythm guitar and composer, Matt Rydell keyboards, Jim Bender bass and Van Harter drums. Can be heard at Teddarmstrong.com.
Caton came to wider public attention while playing in a band called Y Kant Tori Read with then-unknown singer Tori Amos.http://www.yessaid.com/timeline6.html He played with various bands and artists throughout the 80's including Human Drama, The Boxboys, Al Kooper, Sandra Bernhard, Francis X and the Bushman, Mercury 5, and Sphinx In Cairo. Eventually Caton worked on many of Amos's subsequent albums, including Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink, and toured with her from 1996 to 1999. His last collaboration with Amos was To Venus and Back. 
Released on A Piano: The Collection, Amos wrote a song that is believed to be about Caton called "Not David Bowie." It is about how she thinks he was latching onto her for fame and then blamed her when he didn't get famous too.
He was signed to a publishing agreement with Famous Music (Paramount Pictures) from the late 1980s through the 1990s and has written songs for movies and TV productions such as the big-screen hit Point Break starring Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and the well-known TV series' Beverly Hills, 90210 and 21 Jump Street featuring Johnny Depp.
Called "Caton" by friends, he started the band Binge in 1997 with drummer Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses fame, and eventually parted ways with Amos at the end of 2000.http://thedent.com/binge.htmlhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB722196CBE5F9D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM San Jose Mercury News (CA), September 11, 1998  - Google News Archive
