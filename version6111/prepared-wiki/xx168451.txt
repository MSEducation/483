===Classification leadership===

In the 1949 Giro d'Italia there were two major classifications. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.
In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. This classification did not award a jersey to the leader.
