[[Freya (spider)]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Freya is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). All except one species occur in Central and South America. F. dyali is only found in Pakistan; it is very likely that this results from taxonomic error. This distribution artifact is very similar to that of the genus Jollas, where also one species is found in Pakistan, and all others in Central to South America.

==Name==

The genus name is derived from Freya, the fertility goddess of Norse mythology.
