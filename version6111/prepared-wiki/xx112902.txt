The My Little Pony franchise debuted in 1982, the creation of American illustrator and designer Bonnie Zacherle. Together with sculptor Charles Muenchinger and manager Steve D'Aguanno, Bonnie submitted a design patent in August 1981 for "an ornamental design for a toy animal". She was then working for Hasbro. The patent was granted in August 1983.

==Related pony types==

===Flutter Ponies===

Flutter Ponies are ponies with tiny bodies, curly hair, longer legs than regular ponies and fairy-like wings. They were first released in 1986. The Flutter Ponies may appear delicate, but in truth, they possess a powerful ability called the Utter Flutter, which allows them to blow away everything in their path by flapping their wings in a rapid speed. They are rarely seen, preferring to live in seclusion, usually in Flutter Valley. Honeysuckle, Morning Glory and Rosedust were the only notable ones in the first My Little Pony series.

===Seaponies/Baby Seaponies===

The Seaponies are brightly colored seahorse-like creatures who dwell in the rivers and lakes of Dream Valley. They love underwater polo and can perform elaborate songs and dance numbers. They were first released in 1983 and only appeared in the two Generation 1 Specials. The Seaponies are based on the Hippocamp, a mythological creature shared by Phoenician and Greek mythology. A sub-line of the Seaponies called Baby Seaponies debuted later in 1985 and later in My Little Pony: The Movie.

===Breezies===

The Breezies are small fairy ponies living in Breezy Blossom. These ponies usually have butterfly-like wings and antennae on their heads. Notable ones in the franchise were Tiddly Wink, Tra La La and Zipzee. They were first released in 2006. In G4, they've been also mentioned by Fluttershy in the episode called Three's A Crowd and they are featured in episode It Ain't Easy Being Breezies where they are shown to have their own language.

===Crystal Ponies===

Crystal Ponies are inhabitants of the Crystal Empire in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.  They appear as Earth Ponies with a few distinctive features. Their form changes depending on their mood.  When they're in a sad, depressed mood, their manes and tails are flat and unstyled, their ears are always folded down, and their coats have a greyish hue. When they're in a happy mood (without the Crystal Heart), their manes and tails revert to different styles, their ears are up as normal, and their coats have a brighter hue. Additionally, mares get their decorations on their heads/hair. When in a more jubilant mood (with the Crystal Heart fully powered), all the Crystal Ponies retain their "happy mood" form and their bodies magically transform into a translucent crystallized form. The Crystal Heart also crystallizes the Mane Six, Spike, Shining Armor, and Princess Cadance as well, albeit briefly (possibly reverting them back to their original forms as they exit the Crystal Empire).

===Other related pony types===

The Pony Friends is a sub-line of My Little Pony, first released in 1986. They are composed of animals bearing the same brushable hair and cutie marks as the ponies, such as a giraffe, lion, camel, kangaroo, llama and other animals. Each of the Pony Friends never made an appearance in the animated series, until My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The first one in the show was a zebra.
The Fairy Tails is a short-lived sub-line, consisting of My Little Pony-esque birds, which are the titular Fairy Tails. The line was in stores from 1986 to 1987, corresponding with Year Five of Generation 1. This Year saw the release of the Pony Friends in the My Little Pony line, making it a distinct possibility that they and Fairy Tails were part of the same investigation into an expansion of My Little Pony that offered more than only ponies. Neither concept went very far, but the Fairy Tails toys have become a popular extra to the collections of My Little Pony enthusiasts.
Dream Beauties is another sub-line of My Little Pony, released in 1988. These were Hasbro's attempt at a more realistic version of My Little Pony.
In 1984, Takara (Later merged with Tomy to form Takara Tomy) released a line of My Little Pony toys, which were released in two types: [tpl]nihongo|Osharena Pony|おしゃれなポニー|Osharena ponī[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|Kawaii Pony|かわいいポニー|Kawaī ponī[/tpl]. Only released in Japan, this is a more anthropomorphic take on the toyline and considered as the most rarest of the G1 collection due to how they were released. Bushiroad would eventually acquire the property from Takara Tomy 27 years later.
