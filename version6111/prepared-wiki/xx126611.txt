==History==

During the Second World War, in 1941, a RAF station was built in the townland of Kinrush in Ardboe. RAF Cluntoe was initially used by the Royal Air Force, but quickly handed over as a training station for the United States Army Air Forces, and by 1943, over 3,500 troops were stationed there. By 1946 the war was over and the Americans had left. The RAF kept the airfield ticking over and it was reopened in 1952 as a training station for pilots going to the Korean War. By 1955 it closed for good.[tpl]cite web | title=Ardboe | work=Culture Northern Ireland | url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/town_Home.aspx?co=4&to=178&ca=0&sca=0&navID=1 | accessdate=2007-11-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080111024440/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/town_Home.aspx?co=4&to=178&ca=0&sca=0&navID=1| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=John McAliskey |title=Cluntoe Airfield | work=Your Place and Mine - BBC NI | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/tyrone/cluntoe_airfield_ardboe.shtml | accessdate=2007-11-29[/tpl] Remains of the Cluntoe Airfield around Ardboe can still be seen.
