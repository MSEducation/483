Erik Bredal (1608 – 18 May 1672) was a Danish-born Norwegian Lutheran bishop.
He was born in Rudkøbing, Denmark. He served as bishop in Trondhjem from 1643 until his death. His zealous reform efforts led to clashes of interests with local priests on a series of issues, such as the appointment of resident curates, the status of priests' widows, and duties and quality of education.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Erik Bredal|first= |last= |encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Erik_Bredal |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Erik Bredal |encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon|first=Trygve |last=Lysaker |authorlink= |editor=Helle, Knut|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://nbl.snl.no/Erik_Bredal/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]
