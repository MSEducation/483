==Changes in ownership==

In 1980, Warner Communications (now part of Time Warner) purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million.  The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million.  However, Warner retained Eastern Mountain Sports, a retailer that The Franklin Mint had acquired in the 1970s, as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[tpl]cite book |last=Dinger |first=Ed |title=International Directory of Company Histories  |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5202/is_1998/ai_n19122709 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |volume=69 |date= |year=1998 |month= |publisher= |location= |chapter=The Franklin Mint [/tpl]  API was renamed Roll International in 1993. During the early 2000s, Roll International wound down much of the Franklin Mint business. On August 31, 2006, Roll International Corp sold the remaining assets of The Franklin Mint to a group including a private equity investor and The Morgan Mint.

==Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund vs Franklin Mint==

Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was granted intellectual property rights over her image.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4537799.stm |title=Diana's lost millions |publisher=BBC News |first=Rajan | last = Datar |date=2005-05-13 |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl] In 1998, after refusing the Franklin Mint an official license to produce Diana merchandise, the fund sued the company, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates and jewellery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bond.org.uk/funding/guide/diana.htm |title=BOND funding guide: Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund |work=Bond.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed on behalf of a dead person, but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate, and upon losing the case were counter sued by Franklin Mint in 2003. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Diana Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US $21.5 million) to charitable causes on which both sides agreed.[tpl]cite web |title=Frequently asked questions |url=http://www.theworkcontinues.org/page.asp?id=131 |work=The Work Continues |accessdate=2012-11-22[/tpl]  In addition to this, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million (US $6.5 million) in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.
