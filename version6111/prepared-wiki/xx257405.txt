Discrete logarithm records are the best results achieved to date in solving the discrete logarithm problem, which is the problem of finding solutions x to the equation gx = h given elements g and h of a finite cyclic group G.  The difficulty of this problem is the basis for the security of several cryptographic systems, including Diffie–Hellman key agreement, ElGamal encryption, the ElGamal signature scheme, the Digital Signature Algorithm, and the elliptic curve cryptography analogs of these.  Common choices for G used in these algorithms include the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, the multiplicative group of a finite field, and the group of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field.

==Integers modulo p==

On 18 Jun 2005, Antoine Joux and Reynald Lercier announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 130-digit (431-bit) strong prime in  three weeks, using a 1.15 GHz 16-processor HP AlphaServer GS1280 computer and a number field sieve algorithm.Antoine Joux, “Discrete logarithms in GF(p) – 130 digits,” June 18, 2005, http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0506&L=nmbrthry&T=0&P=20.
On 5 Feb 2007 this was superseded by the announcement by Thorsten Kleinjung of the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 160-digit (530-bit) safe prime, again using the number field sieve.  Most of the computation was done using idle time on various PCs and on a parallel computing cluster.Thorsten Kleinjung, “Discrete logarithms in GF(p) – 160 digits,” February 5, 2007, http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0702&L=NMBRTHRY&P=R45&D=0&I=-3&T=0.

==Finite fields==

The current record (as of January 2014) in a finite field of characteristic 2 was announced by Robert Granger, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel on 31 January 2014.  This team was able to compute discrete logarithms in GF(29234) using about 400,000 core hours.  New features of this computation include a modified method for obtaining the logarithms of degree two elements and a systematically optimized descent strategy.Jens Zumbrägel, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^9234)", 31 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;9aa2b043.1401.

The current record (as of 2013) in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by the CARAMEL group on April 6, 2013.  They used the function field sieve to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2809 elements.

The previous record in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by Antoine Joux and Reynald Lercier on 23 Sep 2005.  They used the function field sieve to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2613 elements.  The computation took 17 days on four 16-processor (1.3 GHz) nodes of the Itanium 2-based Bull computer Teranova.Antoine Joux, “Discrete logarithms in GF(2607) and GF(2613),” September 23, 2005, http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0509&L=NMBRTHRY&P=R1490&D=0&I=-3&T=0.
The current record (as of 2014) for a field of characteristic 3 was announced by Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez on 27 January 2014.  The computation used Joux's algorithm to compute discrete logarithms in the 1303-bit field GF(36 · 137), taking 918 CPU hours.  This work did not exploit any "special" aspects of the field such as Kummer or twisted-Kummer properties.Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, “Announcement,” 27 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;763a9e76.1401.

The previous record was announced in 2012 by a joint Fujitsu, NICT, and Kyushu University team, that computed a discrete logarithm in the field of 36 · 97 elements and a size of 923 bits,[ref]Kyushu University, NICT and Fujitsu Laboratories Achieve

==Elliptic curves==

Certicom Corp. has issued a series of Elliptic Curve Cryptography challenges.  Level I involves fields of 109-bit and 131-bit sizes.  Level II includes 163, 191, 239, 359-bit sizes. All Level II challenges are currently believed to be computationally infeasible.Certicom Corp., “The Certicom ECC Challenge,” http://www.certicom.com/index.php/the-certicom-ecc-challenge.
The Level I challenges which have been met are:Certicom Research, Certicom ECC Challenge (Certicom Research, November 10, 2009), http://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf.
None of the 131-bit (or larger) challenges have been met as of 2010.
In July 2009, Joppe W. Bos, Marcelo E. Kaihara, Thorsten Kleinjung, Arjen K. Lenstra and Peter L. Montgomery announced that they had carried out a discrete logarithm computation on an elliptic curve modulo a 112-bit prime.  The computation was done on a cluster of over 200 PlayStation 3 game consoles over about 6 months.  They used the common parallelized version of Pollard rho method.1. Joppe W. Bos and Marcelo E.
