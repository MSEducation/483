==Legal==

In May, 2013, Warner Brothers Television Network and the co-creators of hit television series, Smallville, which aired from 2001-2011, settled a multimillion-dollar lawsuit "... concerning profits from the long-running television series. The agreement was announced Monday during a status hearing, but Hollywood Esq. reports no paperwork has been signed."  
Series creators and executive producers Gough and Millar, along with series producers Tollin/Robbins Productions, sued WBTV in 2010.  "... They accused the company of licensing Smallville to its co-owned WB and CW networks 'for unreasonably low' fees, thereby cutting the plaintiffs out of tens of millions of dollars. ..."
Though Warner Brothers had settled in January, 2013 with Tollin/Robbins, "... Millar and Gough’s portion of the lawsuit had been headed for a June jury trial. The plaintiffs were seeking more than $100 million in damages. The terms of the settlement haven’t been made public. ... 
Gough and Millar left the series in 2008 after seven seasons."
