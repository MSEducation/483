Anthony Ernest (Tony) Gallo (born February 3, 1939) (R) 21 is an American playwright.  He has written over 60 dramatic works starting in 1997 and is currently filming his first motion picture which is based on one of his plays.

==Early life==

Tony Gallo was born on February 3, 1939, and raised in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania (also the title of one of his plays), a steel town 40 miles north of Pittsburgh, the son of an impoverished factory worker. His parents were Domenic and Saveria Raso Gallo. R21 His father suffered poor health, largely the result of his only other son’s death in a house fire in 1940.  This tragedy was to have a major impact on Gallo's life, evident in most of his plays.  Largely on the basis of scholarships and full-time work, Gallo graduated from both the College of William and Mary and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Masters degree. He then went through a series of careers as a banker, college professor R12, and well-published economist with the Federal government. Link (EL) 10 He was also a pioneer in the renovation of historic homes in the Capitol Hill Historic District in Washington, DC. R10 His career as a playwright began in 1980 when, as a full fledged atheist, Gallo took a purely secular trip to Israel, had a religious epiphany and became “re-spiritualized.”  From then on, he became deeply involved in Judea-Christian studies, as well as the study of other world religions.  As he approached sixty, Gallo decided to go full-time into religion, and after much introspection, decided to make the theater his stage. R18 His decision was very much influenced by his good friend, Herbert Stein, President Richard Nixon’s Chief Economic Advisor, who felt economics as a field of study was not the end all, and that the next step was the study of philosophy or related disciplines.  Upon retirement, Gallo turned his attention to playwrighting and has been a prolific playwright, dubbed the "Wharton School Playwright" by some of his peers, perhaps the only one in its history. In 2007, he married Susan Flaum Hesser, an information technology executive, and has one son from a previous marriage, Thomas Augustus Gallo.

==Writing career==

Gallo is a prolific producer, director and dramatist with over 60 works completed since he left his distinguished career as a nationally recognized food marketing economist in 1996. 10 Gallo owns his own theater company, the Seventh Street Playhouse 3, and motion picture company, Eastern Market Studios 8. While he defines himself as a Judea-Christian playwright, all of his plays are meant for general audiences. His only guiding maxim is that there are a million roads to God, “and I hope I am on the right one.” Two of his plays are Holocaust dramas (Margherita,  Eugenio); two are Biblical (The Agony of  David, The Last Days of King Solomon); and five are  about the American civilization (Vandergrift!, Lincoln and God, Better than the Best, Charleston Revisited, and the Botticelli Cruise).  His play, Paul, is an examination of the life of the Apostle.  Heathcliff is his first absurdist comedy R18.  Gallo’s plays have been staged nearly 100 times in 40 venues including in Washington, DC: The Kennedy Center Reference (AR) Y, The National Press Club R16, Woolly Mammoth Theatre, Cosmos Theatre R3, The Universalist Stage, The Warehouse Theater, The Corner Store Stage, and the Capital Fringe Festival; in New York City: New York University, New York International Midtown Festival/Dorothy Strelsin Stage, The Dramatists Guild of America R5, Casa Italiana, Where Eagles Dare Theatre, Abingdon Theatre, and Midtown International Theatre Festival where one of his actresses won best supporting actress; in Maryland:  The Greenbelt Arts Center W, Silver Spring Stage/PF, and St. John's Church; as well as other venues in Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.  Three of his plays (Margherita, Eugenio, and Lincoln and God)are under contract to the Nederlander Producing Group for production in New York City.  Margherita is scheduled to be jointly produced by Brown-Nederlander and the Seventh Street Playhouse in 2012.

==Film==

The playwright is also very much involved in filmmaking and screenwriting. The Eastern Market Studios in Washington is currently shooting a feature film, Charleston Revisited, based on Gallo's successful stage play, and is scheduled for release in late 2012. The film is directed by veteran director Roland Branford Gomez. The distinguished German cinematographer, Albert Liesegang, is the Director of Photography. The film stars veteran actors Bonnie Jourdan, Colin Davies, Jan Forbes, and Mellicent Singham.
Two other films are scheduled for 2012 and 2013, Eugenio and Margherita, both based on Gallo's stage plays.  In addition, the playwright is preparing three other screenplays for future production: The Beech Forrest, Apart, and Vandergrift!
