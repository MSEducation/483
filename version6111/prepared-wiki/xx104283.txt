Conservatoires UK is a group that represents eight of the nine British conservatoires.

==Members==

==CUKAS==

In conjunction with UCAS, Conservatoires UK runs a clearing house for undergraduate and postgraduate music courses at seven of its member institutions called CUKAS (Conservatoires UK Admissions Service). Only the Guildhall School of Music and Drama does not accept applications through CUKAS.  CUKAS allows applicants to submit one online application when applying to conservatoires, rather than a separate application for each institution (as was previously the case).

==CUK Big Band==

The CUK Big Band is a unique ensemble bringing together some of the most talented young musicians from music colleges across the UK. The group has performed three times in Leeds College of Music's 'The Venue' as part of the Leeds International Jazz Conference and in 2008 performed at the annual International Association for Jazz Education Conference (IAJE) in Toronto. The band is co-directed by Mark Donlon and Issie Barratt and has performed world premieres of works by leading jazz composers such as Issie Barratt, Matt Bourne, Kenny Wheeler, Mark Donlon, Julian Joseph, Bob Mintzer, Mike Gibbs and Tim Garland. Compositions are commissioned through the PRSF funded Creative Exchange project, which also funds an annual Creative Exchange Student Composer Award.http://www.lcm.ac.uk/research-conference/cuk-big-band.htmhttp://www.lcm.ac.uk/news/cuk-big-band-toronto.htm
