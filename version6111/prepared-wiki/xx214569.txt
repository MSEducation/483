Arcanum is a Catholic encyclical written in 1880 by Pope Leo XIII on the topic of Christian marriage.  It was considered the forerunner to Pope Pius XI's 1930 Casti Connubii and Pope Paul VI's 1968 Humanae Vitae.[tpl]cite book |last=Shivanandan |first=Mary |title=Crossing the Threshold of Love |year=1999 |publisher=T&T Clark |location=New York |id=ISBN 056708678X[/tpl]

==Summary==

Arcanum outlines the role of marriage in modern time, and goes through those actions which weaken the marriage contract such as polygamy and divorce.  The encyclical also posits the Church as a protector of marriage, and not one interfering in the marital relationship.
