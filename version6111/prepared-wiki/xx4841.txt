An inch (plural: inches; abbreviation or symbol: in or ″ – a double prime) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. Historically an inch was also used in a number of other systems of units. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but now the imperial or US customary inch is defined to be exactly 25.4 mm. There are 12 inches in a foot and therefore 36 inches in a yard.

The international standard symbol for inch is in (see ISO 31-1, Annex A) but traditionally the inch is denoted by a double prime, which is often approximated by double quotes, and the foot by a prime, which is often approximated by an apostrophe.  For example [tpl]nowrap|three feet two inches[/tpl] can be written as 3′ 2″.  Subdivisions of an inch are typically written using dyadic fractions with odd number numerators; for example, [tpl]nowrap|two and three eighths of an inch[/tpl] would be written as [tpl]sfrac|2|3|8[/tpl]″ and not as 2.375″ nor as [tpl]sfrac|2|6|16[/tpl]″.

==Etymology==

The English word inch comes from Latin uncia meaning "one-twelfth part" (in this case, one twelfth of a foot); the word ounce (one twelfth of a troy pound) has the same origin. The vowel change from u to i is umlaut; the consonant change from c (pronounced as k) to ch is palatalisation (see Old English phonology).
In some other languages, the word for "inch" is similar to or the same as the word for "thumb"; for example, [tpl]lang-ca|polzada[/tpl] inch, polze thumb; [tpl]lang-fr|pouce[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-it|pollice[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-es|pulgada[/tpl] inch, pulgar thumb; [tpl]lang-pt|polegada[/tpl] inch, polegar thumb; [tpl]lang-sv|tum[/tpl] inch, tumme thumb;  [tpl]lang-nl|duim[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-af|duim[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-cs|palec[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-sk|palec[/tpl] inch/thumb; [tpl]lang-hu|hüvelyk[/tpl] inch/thumb, Danish and [tpl]lang-no|tomme[/tpl] / tommer inch/inches and tommel thumb.
Given the etymology of the word "inch", it would seem that the inch is a unit derived from the foot unit in Latin in Roman times.

==History==

The earliest known reference to the inch in England is from the Laws of Æthelberht dating to the early 7th century, surviving in a single manuscript from 1120.[tpl]cite book|last1=Goetz|first1=Hans-Werner|last2=Jarnut|first2=Jörg|last3=Pohl|first3=Walter|authorlink3=Walter Pohl|title=Regna and Gentes: The Relationship Between Late Antique and Early Medieval Peoples and Kingdoms in the Transformation of the Roman World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RovRlJkrncEC&pg=PA33|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12524-7|page=33[/tpl] Paragraph LXVII sets out the fine for wounds of various depths: one inch, one shilling, two inches, two shillings, etc. "Gif man þeoh þurhstingð, stice ghwilve vi scillingas.

An Anglo-Saxon unit of length was the barleycorn. After 1066, 1 inch was equal to 3 barleycorn, which continued to be its legal definition for several centuries, with the barleycorn being the base unit.[tpl]cite book|title=The world of measurements: masterpieces, mysteries and muddles of metrology|author=H. Arthur Klein|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1974[/tpl]  One of the earliest such definitions is that of 1324, where the legal definition of the inch was set out in a statute of Edward II of England, defining it as "three grains of barley, dry and round, placed end to end, lengthwise".
Similar definitions are recorded in both English and Welsh medieval law tracts.[tpl]cite book|pages=310|title=Northumbria's Golden Age|author=Jane Hawkes and Susan Mills|publisher=Sutton|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7509-1685-1[/tpl]  One, dating from the first half of the 10th century, is contained in the Laws of Hywel Dda which superseded those of Dyvnwal, an even earlier definition of the inch in Wales.  Both definitions, as recorded in Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales (vol i., pp. 184,187,189), are that "three lengths of a barleycorn is the inch".[tpl]cite book|title=The Traditionary Annals of the Cymry|author=John Williams|chapter=The civil arts — mensuration|pages=243–245|location=Tenby|publisher=R.

King David I of Scotland in his Assize of Weights and Measures (c. 1150) is said to have defined the Scottish inch as the width of an average man's thumb at the base of the nail, even including the requirement to calculate the average of a small, a medium, and a large man's measures.[tpl]cite book|last1=Swinton |first1 = John| author-link1=John Swinton, Lord Swinton|title=A proposal for uniformity of weights and measures in Scotland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kHhbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA134|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=1789|publisher=printed for Peter Hill|page=134[/tpl] However, the oldest surviving manuscripts date from the early 14th century and appear to have been altered with the inclusion of newer material.[tpl]cite book|author1=Elizabeth Gemmill|author2=Nicholas Mayhew|title=Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: A Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t1hmrzOSEagC&pg=PA113|accessdate=27 February 2012|date=22 June 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02709-0|page=113[/tpl]
Charles Butler, a mathematics teacher at Cheam School, in 1814 recorded the old legal definition of the inch to be "three grains of sound ripe barley being taken out the middle of the ear, well dried, and laid end to end in a row", and placed the barleycorn, not the inch, as the base unit of the English Long Measure system, from which all other units were derived.[tpl]cite book|pages=61|title=An Easy Introduction to the Mathematics|author=Charles Butler|location=Oxford|publisher=Bartlett and Newman|year=1814[/tpl]   John Bouvier similarly recorded in his 1843 law dictionary that the barleycorn was the fundamental measure.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=John Bouvier|article=Barleycorn|year=1843|encyclopedia=A Law Dictionary: With References to the Civil and Other Systems of Foreign Law|pages=188|location=Philadelphia|publisher=T. & J. W. Johnson[/tpl]  Butler observed, however, that "as the length of the barley-corn cannot be fixed, so the inch according to this method will be uncertain", noting that a standard inch measure was now (by his time) kept in the Exchequer chamber, Guildhall, and that was the legal definition of the inch. This was a point also made by George Long in his 1842 Penny Cyclopædia, observing that standard measures had since surpassed the barleycorn definition of the inch, and that to recover the inch measure from its original definition, in the event that the standard measure were destroyed, would involve the measurement of large numbers of barleycorns and taking their average lengths.  He noted that this process would not perfectly recover the standard, since it might introduce errors of anywhere between one hundredth and one tenth of an inch in the definition of a yard.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|page=436|article=Weights & Measures, Standard|encyclopedia=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|author=George Long|year=1842|location=London|publisher=Charles Knight & Co.[/tpl]

===Scottish inch===

The now obsolete Scottish inch ([tpl]lang-gd|òirleach[/tpl]), [tpl]sfrac|12[/tpl] of a Scottish foot, was about 1.0016 imperial inches (about [tpl]convert|1.0016|in|cm|4|disp=output only[/tpl]). It was used in the popular expression [tpl]lang|sco|Gie im an inch, an he'll tak an ell.[/tpl], in English "Give him an inch and he'll take an ell.", first published as "For when I gave you an inch, you tooke an ell." by John Heywood in 1546.[tpl]cite book|last=Heywood|first=John|title=A dialogue conteinying the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the englishe tongue, compacte in a matter concernyng two maner of mariages, etc.|year=1546|publisher=Thomas Berthelet|location=London[/tpl] Full text of 1874 reprint (The ell, equal to 37 inches (about 94 cm), was in use in England until 1685.)[tpl]cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=A.

===Continental inches===

Before the adoption of the metric system, several European countries had customary units whose name translates into "inch". The French pouce measured 2.70 cm, at least when applied to describe the calibre of artillery pieces (see also: Units of measurement in France). The Amsterdam foot (voet) consisted of 11 Amsterdam inches (duim) (see Dutch units of measurement). The Amsterdam foot is about 8% shorter than an English foot.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

The current internationally accepted value for the imperial and US customary inch is exactly 25.4 millimetres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/on-what-basis-is-one-inch-exactly-equal-to-25.4-mm-has-the-imperial-inch-been-adjusted-to-give-this-exact-fit-and-if-so-when-(faq-length)|title=On what basis is one inch exactly equal to 25.4 mm?

In the United Kingdom and most countries of the British Commonwealth the inch was defined in terms of the Imperial Standard Yard. The United States adopted the conversion factor 1 metre = 39.37 inches by an act in 1866, and in 1893 Mendenhall ordered the physical realization of the inch be based on the international prototype metres numbers 21 and 27, which had been received from the CGPM together with the previously adopted conversion factor.[tpl]cite web| author=T.

In 1930 the British Standards Institution adopted an inch of exactly 25.4 mm. The American Standards Association followed suit in 1933. By 1935 industry in 16 countries had adopted the "industrial inch" as it came to be known.[tpl]cite book|author1=National Conference on Weights and Measures|author2=United States.

In 1946 the Commonwealth Science Congress recommended a yard of exactly 0.9144 metres for adoption throughout the British Commonwealth.  This was adopted by Canada in 1951.[tpl]cite book|author1=National Conference on Weights and Measures|author2=United States.

However, the United States retains the [tpl]sfrac|1|39.37[/tpl]-metre definition for survey purposes creating a slight difference between the international and US survey inches; the difference is exactly 2 parts in a million, so 1,000,000 international inches is equal to 999,998 US survey inches. This is approximately [tpl]sfrac|1|8[/tpl]-inch in a mile.
