Diphtheria is fatal in between 5% and 10% of cases. In children under five years and adults over 40 years, the fatality rate may be as much as 20%. As of 2010 it caused about 2,900 deaths down from 6,300 in 1990.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|first3=K|first4=S|first5=K|first6=V|first7=J|first8=T|first9=R|first10=SY|first11=M|first12=HR|first13=LM|first14=KG|first15=C|first16=LM|first17=S|first18=DH|first19=ML|first20=EJ|first21=D|first22=K|first23=B|first24=A|first25=G|first26=F|first27=I|first28=S|first29=C|first30=M[/tpl]
Outbreaks, though very rare, still occur worldwide, including in developed nations, such as Germany and Canada. After the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s, vaccination rates in its constituent countries fell so low that there was an explosion of diphtheria cases. In 1991, there were 2,000 cases of diphtheria in the USSR. By 1998, according to Red Cross estimates, there were as many as 200,000 cases in the Commonwealth of Independent States, with 5,000 deaths.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol4no4/vitek.htm | title=Diphtheria in the Former Soviet Union: Reemergence of a Pandemic Disease |accessdate= |work= |publisher=CDC, Emerging Infectious Diseases |date=1998-10-01 [/tpl] This was so great an increase that diphtheria was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as "most resurgent disease".[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

==History==

In 1613, Spain experienced an epidemic of diphtheria. The year is known as "El Año de los Garotillos" (The Year of Strangulations) in history of Spain.[tpl]cite journal|last=LAVAL|first=Enrique|title=El garotillo (Difteria) en España (Siglos XVI y XVII)|journal=Revista chilena de infectología|date=March 2006|volume=23|doi=10.4067/S0716-10182006000100012|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0716-10182006000100012&lng=en&nrm=iso|accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl]
In 1735, a diphtheria epidemic swept through New England.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Boston Gazette|date=March 18, 1735[/tpl]
Before 1826, diphtheria was known by different names across the world. In England, it was known as Boulogne sour throat, as it spread from France. In 1826, Pierre Bretonneau gave the name to disease as diphtérite (from Greek diphthera "leather") describing the appearance of pseudomembrane in the throat.[tpl]cite web|title=Diphtheria|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diphtheria|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl]

In 1878, Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Alice and her family became infected with it, causing two deaths, Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Alice herself.
In 1883, Edwin Klebs identified the bacterium and named it Klebs-Loeffler bacterium. The club shape of bacterium helped Edwin to differentiate it from other bacteria. Over the period of time, it was called Microsporon diphtheriticum, Bacillus diphtheriae and Mycobacterium diphtheriae. Current nomenclature is Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
Friedrich Loeffler was the first one to cultivate Corynebacterium diphtheriae in 1884. He used Koch's postulates to prove association between Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Diphtheria. He also showed that the bacillus produces an exotoxin.
Joseph P. O’Dwyer introduced O'Dwyer tube for laryngeal intubation in patients with obstructed larynx in 1885. It soon replaced tracheostomy as emergency diphtheric intubation method.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Robert R.|title=The O'Dwyer tube; development and use in laryngeal diphtheria|journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila)|date=March 1970|volume=9|issue=3|pages=179–185|doi=10.1177/000992287000900313|pmid=4905866|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4905866|accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl]

In 1890, Shibasaburo Kitasato and Emil von Behring immunized guinea pigs with heat-treated diphtheria toxin. Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria. Over the Christmas holiday in 1891 in Berlin, the first attempt to cure a person of diphtheria was made. It succeeded. ... it was the first cure." John M.

In 1897, Paul Ehrlich developed a standardized unit of measure for diphtheria antitoxin. This was first ever standardization of biological product and played an important factor in future developmental work on sera and vaccines.
In 1901, 10 out of 11 inoculated St. Louis children died from contaminated diphtheria antitoxin. The horse from which the antitoxin was derived died of tetanus.

In 1905, Franklin Royer, from Philadelphia’s Municipal Hospital, published a paper urging timely treatment for diphtheria and adequate doses of antitoxin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Royer|first=Franklin|title=The Antitoxin Treatment of Diphtheria, with a Plea for Rational Dosage in Treatment and in Immunizing|year=1905[/tpl] In the same year, Clemens Pirquet and Bela Schick described serum sickness in children receiving large quantities of horse-derived antitoxin.
Between 1910 and 1911 Béla Schick developed the Schick test to detect preexistent immunity to diphtheria in an exposed person. Only those who were not exposed to diphtheria were preferably vaccinated. A massive five-year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick. As a part of the campaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company with an appeal to parents to "Save your child from diphtheria." A vaccine was developed in the next decade, and deaths began declining in earnest in 1924.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.healthsentinel.com/graphs.php?id=14&event=graphs_print_list_item | title=United States mortality rate from measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, whooping cough, and diphtheria from 1900–1965 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work= |publisher=HealthSentinel.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508025250/http://www.healthsentinel.com/graphs.php?id=14&event=graphs_print_list_item  |archivedate = 2008-05-08[/tpl]
In 1919, in Dallas, Texas, U.S.A., 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxic antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department.

In the 1920s, there were an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 cases of diphtheria per year in the United States, causing 13,000 to 15,000 deaths per year. Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities. One of the most famous outbreaks of diphtheria was in Nome, Alaska; the "Great Race of Mercy" to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
In 1926, Alexander Thomas Glenny increased the effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid by treating it with aluminum salts.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/diseases-and-vaccines#EVT_102226 | title=History of Vaccines | accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
In 1943, diphtheria outbreaks accompanied war and disruption in Europe. There were 1 million cases in Europe, with 50,000 deaths.
In 1949, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid.
