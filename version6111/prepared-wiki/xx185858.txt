His first film, in 2002, was Thamizh with Prashanth and Simran. Film critic Balaji commented that it was "one of the few movies in recent times where a lot of importance seems to have been attached to the script. In spite of the flimsy story and routine screenplay where a youth grows to be a 'dada', the dialogs elevate the quality of the movie and make it very enjoyable".[tpl]cite web|author=Balaji Balasubramaniam |url=http://www.bbthots.com/reviews/ |title=Balaji's Tamil Movie Reviews |publisher=Bbthots.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10[/tpl] His second film Saamy under Kavithaalaya banner starred Vikram.
