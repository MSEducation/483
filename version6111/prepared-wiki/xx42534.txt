===Altercation with Jonny Fairplay===

On October 2, 2007, Bonaduce was involved in an altercation with infamous Survivor show participant Jon "Jonny Fairplay" Dalton during the Fox Reality Awards.October 3, 2007. http://www.knbc.com/news/14268886/detail.html Toward the end of the awards show, Dalton appeared onstage and was booed by the audience. Bonaduce walked on stage and explained that the audience reaction was "because they hate you." Bonaduce was walking off the stage as Dalton called him back. Dalton then jumped on Bonaduce to hug him and Bonaduce stated later that he was uncomfortable with Dalton's hands near his throat. Bonaduce, a black belt in Tang Soo Do, adjusted his balance and grip, and threw Dalton over Bonaduce's head. Dalton fell to the floor, face first. Dalton stood up after a few moments and staggered before slowly walking off stage, his back to the audience. Bonaduce then smiled and proceeded to make faces and exaggerated shrugging motions at the audience before walking off stage.
Bonaduce later said the two had never previously had any negative altercations or words, but that they had met occasionally in the past. He said he had never liked Dalton, mostly because Dalton, in true "Jonny Fairplay" form, had lied about his grandmother's death during his first run on Survivor. While Bonaduce did not believe Dalton was significantly hurt at the time, TMZ.com confirmed that Fairplay bled significantly, lost some teeth and suffered a broken toe.
Dalton chose to press charges, and a felony battery investigation was opened by the police. On October 5, 2007, the L.A. District Attorney's office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove Bonaduce had committed a battery, because the contact had been initiated by Dalton and Bonaduce had acted in self-defense.http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1004_bonaduce_wm_opt.pdf

===Arrests===

Bonaduce had several arrests following his Partridge Family days, but two were especially high-profile incidents.
On March 9, 1990, he was arrested while attempting to buy cocaine in Daytona Beach, Florida. Ironically, Bonaduce was there to host an event for D.A.R.E., an anti-drug campaign aimed at children.http://articles.philly.com/1990-03-12/news/25905179_1_partisan-politics-partridge-family-tv-crack Bonaduce was suspended from WEGX, and then reinstated under the condition he attend therapy and drug rehabilitation. He was eventually fired from WEGX and moved to a shift at KKFR-FM in Phoenix, Arizona.
On March 31, 1991, he was arrested on charges of robbing and beating a transvestite prostitute in Phoenix. Police found him hiding in a closet in his apartment. Police alleged he had picked up the prostitute in his car. According to the police report, Bonaduce beat and kicked the prostitute before taking his money back. Residents heard screaming and called police.
"When I picked him up," Bonaduce later explained, "I thought he was a girl. I picked him up, he got in my car. As soon as he got in and the dome light hit him, it was obvious. He wasn't a good transvestite. If he was a good transvestite, I might never had known. I was wasted. He gets in the car and I said, 'Oh, sorry, wrong car.' And he says, 'Well you took me off my corner, give me $40.00.' I said 'Dude, wrong car, hop out!' This went on for 6 or 7 minutes and he still wouldn't get out. So I get out of the car, opened his door and pulled him out of the car. But when I did, I see he's this huge guy, about 220 pounds. I weighed 150 pounds! I attacked him first, not because I wanted to, I just thought I was going to have to and I'm too small to take the punishment from a 220-pound man. If he had hit first, I would have gone down and stayed down. So I attacked him and it turned into a fight".http://www.nndb.com/people/720/000022654/ Following his arrest, he was fired by KKFR.
In 2010, while appearing on a reunion of famous TV families on NBC's Today, David Cassidy remarked, "Whenever Bonaduce gets arrested, for some reason, people call me." The two remain friends and have performed together on many occasions in the years following the Partridge Family.
