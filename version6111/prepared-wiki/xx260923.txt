Upon graduating from UCLA, Wallentine joined the victorious campaign of California State Assembly candidate Jim Morrissey and became a member of Morrissey's staff as his Legislative Director in the California State Capitol.  He joined the Dole-Kemp campaign for President in 1996.  In 1997, Wallentine became Chief of Staff to Assemblyman Roy Ashburn.
