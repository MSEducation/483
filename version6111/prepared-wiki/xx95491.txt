The Good Old Days was a popular BBC television light entertainment programme which ran from 1953 to 1983.
It was performed at the Leeds City Varieties and recreated an authentic atmosphere of the Victorianâ€“Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed by present-day performers in the style of the original artistes.
The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing, especially "Down at the Old Bull and Bush" which closed the show. The show was compered by Leonard Sachs.  In the course of its run it featured about 2,000 performers.
