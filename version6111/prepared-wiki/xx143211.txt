GALSI ([tpl]lang-it| Gasdotto Algeria Sardegna Italia[/tpl]) is a planned natural gas pipeline from Algeria to Sardinia and further northern Italy. 

==History==

The feasibility study was completed in 2005.  The intergovernmental agreement on the GALSI pipeline was signed between Italy and Algeria on 14 November 2007.
Early in 2008 one of the project founders, Wintershall, sold its share to other shareholders and left the project.
In 2007, while surveying the proposed route between Sardinia and Algeria, sonar data from an Underwater Autonomous Vehicle revealed a large wreck, later determined to be the French battleship Danton, sunk in 1917.

==Route==

The pipeline will start from the Hassi R'mel field in Algeria and the [tpl]convert|640|km|mi[/tpl] section will run to Koudiet Draouche at the coast of Mediterranean Sea. The [tpl]convert|285|km|mi[/tpl] offshore section with two legs will be laid between Koudiet Draouche and Porto Botte (CI), Sardinia. The Sardinian section is planned approximately [tpl]convert|300|km|mi|-1[/tpl] from the south to Olbia. The offshore section between Sardinia and Italian mainland is [tpl]convert|280|km|mi[/tpl] and the landfall will be Piombino (LI). It will be connected to the existing Italian gas grid in Tuscany. 
The exact offshore route will be selected by Dutch engineering contractor Fugro by July 2008.

==Technical features==

The pipeline diameter will vary between [tpl]convert|22|in|mm|-1[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|48|in|mm|-1[/tpl]. The initial capacity will be 8 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per annum.  Total estimated costs of project are €2 billion. The pipeline is expected to become operational in 2014.  The Italian section will be built by Snam Rete Gas.

==Project company==

The project company Galsi S.p.A. was incorporated on 29 January 2003 in Milan. The current shareholders of Galsi are: 
According to the agreement between Sonatrach and Russian Gazprom, it's possible that Gazprom will have a stake in the Galsi pipeline.
