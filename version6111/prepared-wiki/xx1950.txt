Sulfuric acid in liquid form is strongly polar. It is known to be abundant in the clouds of Venus, in the form of aerosol droplets. In a biochemistry that used sulfuric acid as a solvent, the alkene group (C=C), with two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, could function analogously to the carbonyl group (C=O) in water-based biochemistry.
A proposal has been made that life on Mars may exist and be using a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide as its solvent. A 61.2% (by weight) mix of water and hydrogen peroxide has a freezing point of −56.5 °C, and also tends to super-cool rather than crystallize. It is also hygroscopic, an advantage in a water-scarce environment.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EPSC2007/00439/EPSC2007-J-00439.pdf|format=PDF| journal=EPSC Abstracts| volume= 2| id= EPSC2007-A-00439| year=2007| publisher=European Planetary Science Congress 2007| title=The H2O2-H2O Hypothesis: Extremophiles Adapted to Conditions on Mars?| first=Joop M.| last= Houtkooper| coauthors= Dirk Schulze-Makuch| bibcode=2007epsc.conf..558H|  pages=558[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001109/| title=Europlanet : Life's a bleach| date=2007-08-24| first=Doug| last= Ellison| publisher=Planetary.org[/tpl]

===Non-green photosynthesizers===

Physicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html |title=NASA – NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-29[/tpl][ref]
