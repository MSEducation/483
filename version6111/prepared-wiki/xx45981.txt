In Hinduism and Buddhism, "Bhakti" (also spelled Bhakthi;Tamil:பக்தி  [tpl]lang-sa|भक्ति[/tpl]) is a technical term meaning "portion, share", from the root bhaj- "to partake in, to receive one's share".See Monier-Williams, Sanskrit Dictionary, 1899. It refers to religious devotion in the form of active involvement of a devotee in worship of the divine. Within monotheistic Hinduism, it is the love felt by the worshipper towards the personal God, a concept expressed in Hindu theology as Iṣṭa-devatā (also as Svayam Bhagavan in Gaudiya Vaishnavism).
Bhakthi can be used of either tradition of Hindu monotheism, Shaivaism or Vaishnavism.[tpl]cite book|last=Rinehart|first=Robin|title=Contemporary Hinduism: ritual, culture, and practice|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=45|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA45|year=2004[/tpl]
While bhakti as designating a religious path is already a central concept in the Bhagavad Gita,Prentiss, p. 5, it rises to importance in the medieval history of Hinduism, where the Bhakti movement  saw a rapid growth of bhakti beginning in Southern India with the Vaisnava Alvars (6th-9th century CE) and Saiva Nayanars (5th-10th century CE), who spread bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th-18th century CE.[tpl]cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|pages=131|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&pg=PA131[/tpl]
The Bhagavata Purana is text associated with the Bhakti movement which elaborates the concept of bhakti as found in the Bhagavad Gita.
The Bhakti movement reached North India in the Delhi Sultanate and throughout the Mughal era contributed significantly to the characteristics of Hinduism as the religion of the general population under the rule of a Muslim elite. After their encounter with the expanding Islam religion, Bhakti proponents—who were traditionally called "saints"—"elaborated egalitarian doctrine that transcended the caste system and encouraged individuals to seek personal union with the divine."Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 120. Its influence also spread to other religions during this period,[tpl]cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=The Blackwell companion to Hinduism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=185|isbn=978-0-631-21535-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qSfneQ0YYY8C&pg=PA185[/tpl]Neusner, p. 135.[tpl]cite book|last=Neill|first=Stephen|title=A history of Christianity in India, 1707-1858|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|pages=412|isbn=978-0-521-89332-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xi-tvrYbYxMC&pg=PA412[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kelting|first=Mary Whitney|title=Singing to the Jinas: Jain laywomen, Maṇḍaḷ singing, and the negotiations of Jain devotion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|pages=87|isbn=978-0-19-514011-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=elcn1IEJ3CEC&pg=PA87[/tpl] and became an integral aspect of Hindu culture and society in the modern era.

Bhakti emphasises religious devotion and sentiment above ritual and orthopraxy. In this sense it parallels the early 20th century movement of  Pentecostalism in Christian history, where direct personal experience of God was also emphasized over liturgy or ritual.

terms of human relationships, most often as beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master-servant.[tpl]cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|pages=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=veSItWingx8C&pg=PA1[/tpl] It may refer to devotion to a spiritual teacher (Guru) as guru-bhakti,[tpl]cite book|last=Sivananda|first=Swami|title=Guru Bhakti Yoga|publisher=Divine Life Society|year=2004|isbn=81-7052-168-8[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|year=1970| url =http://www.dlshq.org/download/gurubhaktiyoga.htm | pages=62[/tpl] to a personal form of God,

==History==

Scholarly consensus sees bhakti as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the era of Indian epic poetry."Scholarly consensus today tends to view bhakti as a post-Vedic development that took place primarily in the watershed years of the epics and Puranas." Prentiss, p. 17. The Bhagavad Gita is the first text to explicitly use the word "bhakti" to designate a religious path, using it as a term for one of three possible religious approaches.Prentiss, p. 5. The Bhagavata Purana develops the idea more elaborately, while the Shvetashvatara Upanishad evidences a fully developed Shiva-bhakti (devotion to Shiva) and signs of guru-bhakti.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl][/ref] An early sutra by Pāṇini (c. 5th century BCE) is considered by some scholars as the first appearance of the concept of bhakti, where the word "vun" may refer to bhakti toward "Vasudevarjunabhya" (with implied reference to Krishna Vasudeva).[tpl]cite book|last=Bryant|first=Edwin Francis|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2007|page=17 fn|isbn=978-0-19-514891-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HVDqCkW1WpUC&pg=PA17[/tpl] Other scholars question this interpretation.[tpl]cite book|last=Singh|first=Nagendra Kr|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|publisher=Anmol Publications |year=1997|pages=2462|chapter=Vasudeva Worship: Pāṇini's Evidence|isbn=978-81-7488-168-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dbXDocmylYgC&pg=PA2462[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Dahlaquist|first=Allan|title=Megasthenes and Indian Religion|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1996|pages=23|isbn=978-81-208-1323-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xp35-8gTRDkC&pg=PA23[/tpl]
The Bhakti Movement was a rapid growth of bhakti beginning in Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars (4th-10th century CE)[tpl]cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas | authorlink=Ainslie Embree|coauthors=Stephen N. Hay, William Theodore De Bary|title=Sources of Indian Tradition|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1988|pages=342|isbn=978-0-231-06651-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=An5mD6KMiSIC&pg=PA342[/tpl] and the Vaisnava Alvars (3rd-9th century CE) who spread bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing the praises of Vishnu. They established temple sites (Srirangam is one) and converted many people to Vaishnavism. Their poems were collected in the 10th century as the Four Thousand Divine Compositions also referred to as Dravida Veda or Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, which became an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Alwars and Nayanmars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. For the first time, Bagwan or God reached the masses and the masses were able to associate themselves with the religion. Another significant thing was that the Alwars and Naynmars came from various background and castes including that of the Sudras (working class). The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on a more emotional bhakti, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though there is no definitive evidence of this.[tpl]cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=qrtYYTjYFY8C[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=van Buitenen | first=J.

Like the Alvars the Saiva Nayanar poets softened the distinctions of caste and gender. The Tirumurai, a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, Appar (7th century CE), Campantar (7th century) and Cuntarar (9th century), were compiled into the Tevaram, the first volumes of the Tirumurai. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva.[tpl]cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2007|pages=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&pg=PA231[/tpl] Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets quoted the Black Yajurveda specifically.Prentiss, pp. 17-18.
By the 12th to 18th centuries, the bhakti movement had spread to all regions and languages of India. Bhakti poetry and attitudes began to color many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society.  Prominent bhakti poets such as Ravidas, eknath and Kabir wrote against the hierarchy of caste.Rinehart, p. 257.

===Ramayana===

In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, Rama describes the path as ninefold (nava-vidha bhakti):
 Such pure devotion is expressed in nine ways, . First is satsang or association with love-intoxicated devotees. The second is to develop a taste for hearing my nectar-like stories. The third is service to the guru (...) Fourth is to sing my kirtan (communal chorus) (...) Japa or repetition of my Holy name and chanting my bhajans are the fifth expression (...) To follow scriptural injunctions always, to practice control of the senses, nobility of character and selfless service, these are expressions of the sixth mode of bhakti. Seeing me manifested everywhere in this world and worshipping my saints more than myself is the seventh mode of bhakti. To find no fault with anyone and to be contented with one's lot is the eighth mode of bhakti. Unreserved surrender with total faith in my strength is the ninth and highest stage. Shabari, anyone who practices one of these nine modes of my bhakti pleases me most and reaches me without fail.[tpl]cite book|last=Keshavadas|first=Sadguru Sant|title=Ramayana at a Glance|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1988|page=124|chapter=Aranya Kanda|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3XIatVGyjmQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA124|isbn=978-81-208-0545-3[/tpl]

  (1) śravaṇa ("listening" to the scriptural stories of [tpl]IAST|Kṛṣṇa[/tpl] and his companions), (2) kīrtana ("praising", usually refers to ecstatic group singing), (3) smaraṇa ("remembering" or fixing the mind on Viṣṇu), (4) pāda-sevana (rendering service), (5) arcana (worshiping an image), (6) vandana (paying homage), (7) dāsya (servitude), (8) sākhya (friendship), and (9) ātma-nivedana (self-surrender).
