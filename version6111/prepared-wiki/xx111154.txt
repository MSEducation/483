Penaeus is a genus of prawns, including the giant tiger prawn (P. monodon), the most important species of farmed crustacean worldwide. The genus has been reorganised following a proposition of Pérez Farfante and Kensley based on morphological differences, in particular the genital characteristics of these animals,[tpl]cite book |author=Isabel Pérez Farfante, Brian Frederick Kensley |year=1997 |title=Penaeoid and Sergestoid Shrimps and Prawns of the World: Keys and Diagnoses for the Families and Genera |volume=175 |series=Mémoires du Muséum national d'histoire naturelle |publisher=Muséum national d'histoire naturelle |isbn=9782856535103 |pages=1–233[/tpl] although this revision has not been universally accepted.[tpl]cite journal |author=Patsy A.
