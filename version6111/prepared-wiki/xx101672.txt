Burnt Weeny Sandwich is an album by The Mothers of Invention, released in 1970. It consists of both studio album and live elements.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&pg=PA77&dq=Burnt+Weeny+Sandwich#v=onepage&q=Burnt%20Weeny%20Sandwich&f=false | title = The Words and Music of Frank Zappa | isbn = 0803260059 | author1 = Lowe | first1 = Kelly Fisher | year = 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&pg=PA138&dq=Burnt+Weeny+Sandwich#v=onepage&q=Burnt%20Weeny%20Sandwich&f=false | title = Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z) | isbn = 9780946719792 |editor1=Ben Watson |editor2=Esther Leslie |year = 2005[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Q9AkNKdIuEcC&pg=PA133&dq=Burnt+Weeny+Sandwich#v=onepage&q=Burnt%20Weeny%20Sandwich&f=false | title = Necessity Is: The Early Years of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention | isbn = 9780946719518 | author1 = James | first1 = Billy | date = 2002-10-01[/tpl] In contrast to Weasels Ripped My Flesh, which is predominately live and song-oriented, most of Burnt Weeny Sandwich focuses on studio recordings and tightly arranged compositions.
The LP included a large triple-folded black and white poster ("The Mothers Of Invention Sincerely Regret To Inform You") which has never been reproduced in any of the CD reissues.  Until the 2012 Zappa Family Trust reissue campaign, CD editions had a severe dropout at the beginning of "The Little House I Used to Live In" that wasn't present on the original LP pressing.

The album's unusual title, Zappa would later say in an interview, comes from an actual snack that he enjoyed eating, consisting of a burnt Hebrew National hot dog sandwiched between two pieces of bread with mustard.
Burnt Weeny Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh were also reissued together on vinyl as 2 Originals of the Mothers of Invention, with the original covers used as the left and right sides of the inner spread, and the front cover depicting a pistol shooting toothpaste onto a toothbrush.

==Album Information==

The album was essentially a 'posthumous' Mothers release having been released after Frank Zappa dissolved the band.[tpl]cite book |title=Necessity Is . . .: The Early Years of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention |edition=2nd |first1=Billy |last1=James |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |year=2002 |isbn=0-946719-51-9 |page=133 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q9AkNKdIuEcC[/tpl], Extract of page 133 
Ian Underwood's contributions are significant on this album. The album, like its counterpart Weasels Ripped My Flesh, comprises tracks from the Mothers vault that were not previously released. Whereas Weasels mostly showcases the Mothers in a live setting, much of Burnt Weeny Sandwich features studio work and structured Zappa compositions, like the centerpiece of the album, "The Little House I Used to Live In", which consists of several movements and employs compound meters such as 11/8 with an overlaid melody in 10/8.
The guitar solo portion of the "Theme from Burnt Weeny Sandwich" is an outtake from an unused extended version of "Lonely Little Girl" from the 1967 sessions for the We're Only in It for the Money LP. Zappa and Art Tripp later added multiple percussion overdubs for the released version.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] 
"Valarie" was originally intended to be released as a single coupled with "My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama". However, either Zappa or his label, Reprise Records, cancelled its release, resulting in its  inclusion on the LP.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
"Igor's Boogie" is a reference to a major Zappa influence, composer Igor Stravinsky.
Cal Schenkel has noted that his unique cover art for Burnt Weeny Sandwich was originally commissioned for the cover of an Eric Dolphy release.
The piano introduction of "The Little House I Used to Live in" appears in Yvar Mikhashoff's four CD set "Yvar Mikhashoff's Panorama of American Piano Music".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moderecords.com/catalog/262-265-mikhashoff.html  |title=Yvar Mikhashoff's Panorama of American Piano Music |publisher=Mode Records |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]
