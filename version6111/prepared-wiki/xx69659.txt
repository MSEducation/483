CATEGORIES: Shinagawa, Tokyo, Wards of Tokyo

[tpl]nihongo|Shinagawa|品川区|Shinagawa-ku[/tpl] is a special ward located in Tokyo Metropolis, Japan. While somewhat misleadingly referred to as Shinagawa City in bureaucratic English translations (it is not a city in its own right, but a subsection of the city of Tokyo), in natural English it is more commonly known simply as Shinagawa, as Shinagawa Ward or (particularly in street addresses) as Shinagawa-ku. The ward is home to nine embassies.
As of 2008, the ward has an estimated population of 344,461 and a population density of 15,740 persons per km². The total area is 22.72 km².

==Geography==

Shinagawa includes natural uplands and lowlands, as well as reclaimed land. The uplands are the eastern end of the Musashino hills. They include Shiba Shiroganedai north of the Meguro River, Megurodai between the Meguro and Tachiai Rivers, and Ebaradai south of the Tachiai River.
The ward lies on Tokyo Bay. Its neighbors on land are all special wards of Tokyo: Kōtō to the east, Minato to the north, Meguro to the west, and Ōta to the south.
The ward consists of five districts:

==History==

Most of Tokyo east of the Imperial Palace is reclaimed land. A large portion of reclamation happened during the Edo period. Following the Meiji restoration and the Abolition of the han system, Shinagawa prefecture was instituted in 1869. The prefectural administration was planned to be set up in present-day Shinagawa in the Ebara district. In 1871, Shinagawa prefecture was integrated into Tokyo Prefecture.
The ward was founded on March 15, 1947 through the administrative amalgamation of the former Ebara Ward with the former Shinagawa Ward. Both Ebara Ward and Shinagawa Ward had been created in 1932, with the outward expansion of the municipal boundaries of the Tokyo City following the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake.
In the Edo period, Shinagawa was the first post town a traveler would reach after setting out from Nihonbashi on the Tōkaidō highway from Edo to Kyoto. The post-town function is retained today with several large hotels near the train station offering 6,000 hotel rooms, the largest concentration in the city. The Tokugawa shogunate maintained the Suzugamori execution grounds in Shinagawa.
The Tōkaidō Shinkansen began serving Shinagawa Station from 2003.

==Politics and government==

Shinagawa is run by a city assembly of 40 elected members. The mayor as of 2007 is Takeshi Hamano, an independent. Liberal Democratic Party together with New Komeito currently forms government.
