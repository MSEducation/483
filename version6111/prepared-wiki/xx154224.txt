Hi-5, an Australian children's television program, was first shown on the Nine Network in 1999 and is based on the children's music group Hi-5. Hi-5 is a children's pop music group much like peer children's entertainers The Wiggles. Hi-5 has been shown in approximately 80 countries.
Each series has 45 episodes with nine weekly themes. In 2004 (Series 6), the show was marked by reduced episodes than normal, with 30 episodes in six weekly themes due to the band concentrating more on touring. In 2012, no new series was filmed, with a repeat of Series 13 being shown instead.
In 2009 was marked the beginning of the "second generation" of Hi-5, with all of the original members having departed in 2006-2008. The series 
was renewed for another five years with the 
new cast by the Nine Network, which would have the contract expire in 2013.
In 2013, a new Hi-5 television show, Hi-5 House was created as a continuation/replacement of the original series.

==Origins of the program==

In 1999, Producer Helena Harris, creator of Bananas in Pajamas, created "Hi-5" when her two children outgrew the Bananas. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans decided the new show would be aimed at children of all ages, would include educational trends as fun and games, and would feature music and movement that would attract children's attention. Hi-5 aims to cater to a wide range of young children with a wide range of cognitive abilities and learning styles.
Child-development experts work with writers on every script. Each show is built around a simple theme like colours, music, animals, or numbers. Each show is then divided into segments that teach the concept in different ways. Music is seen as the method of joining the segments of the program together as well as highlighting the concepts and themes of each program.
The auditions for the Australian hosts were held in 1998 and the first program was broadcast in 1999. Since then, the original Australian show won five ARIA awards for "Best Children's Album" (as of 2005), won three consecutive Australian Logie Awards (the Australian awards for Television performance and production recognition) for "Most Outstanding Children's Preschool Program" as of 2005.

In order, first to last:

===Replacement of cast===

In 2006, Kathleen de Leon Jones became pregnant and Sun Park was found to temporarily replace Kathleen while she went on maternity leave. The beginning of series 9 showed Kathleen introducing the audience to Sun and asking her to look after her space while she had the baby. Later in the series, Kathleen returned to introduce everyone to her baby, Mikayla. In July 2007, Kathleen made the decision to permanently leave the group to focus on being a mom. Also in 2007, Tim Harding was involved in a serious motorcycle accident which left him with injuries that required intensive care and rehabilitation. Just prior to this, Stevie Nicholson was hired as an understudy to both Tim and Nathan Foley, so he took Tim's place when he decided he could no longer continue with the group. In February 2008, Charli Robinson announced that she would be leaving Hi-5, having just completed filming series 10, and would stay with the group until a suitable replacement was found. Soon after, Casey Burgess was hired as Charli's replacement and began touring with the group. In October 2008, Kellie Crawford (n√©e Hoggart) announced that she would be leaving the group at the end of the year. A month later, Nathan Foley announced that he would be leaving with Kellie, and rumours swirled that the pair had been fired in favour of younger, cheaper alternatives. These rumours would never come to be confirmed. In December 2008, Sun stated that Nathan and Kellie had not been pressured to leave and announced that she too would be leaving at the end of the year. The trio's final performance was at the 2008 Carols by Candlelight. Auditions were then held to find three new Hi-5 members. In February 2009, on Mornings with Kerri-Anne, the new line-up was revealed, with Lauren Brant, Tim Maddren and Fely Irvine joining the cast. The cast remained the same for three years until December 2011, when Fely left the group. Her final performance was at the 2011 Carols by Candlelight. Dayen Zheng replaced Fely and the group spent the year touring. Then, in December 2012, Casey and Tim announced that the year's Carols by Candlelight would be their last with Hi-5 and they would be leaving the group early in the new year. In January 2013, Ainsley Melham and Mary Lascaris were announced as Tim and Casey's replacements. Hi-5's first movie 'Some Kind of Wonderful' was released in March 2013 and showed the audition process for Dayen, Ainsley and Mary, as well as taking a look back at the history of Hi-5.

===Roles===

==Live tours==

The band tours annually and have visited several countries in which they are popular, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, Malaysia and Philippines.

===Tours===

===Christmas Eve concert===

Since 2000, Hi-5 have performed annually at Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight. For a few years, they held their own short concert before Carols by Candlelight, but they currently just perform as a part of the carols. Several cast have noted the Christmas Eve concerts as one of their highlights and because of this, it is often the last performance of departing members.
As of 2013, Hi-5 will no longer be performing at Carols by Candlelight. Stevie announced the news via Twitter, stating, "Sad news. Not doing Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne this year. No more Santa Claus is Coming. :( #tradition #xmas #hi5". The reason would be the new commitment of a tour in Malaysia from December 27 (comparing the absence of the new season in 2012 for commitment of a Holiday tour, and/or 15 new episodes not recorded from Series 6 in 2004 for same thing). It will be the first time for many years have not performed at Carols by Candlelight.

==Hi-5 CDs==

All Hi-5 CDs are released in Australia by SonyBMG. At least four of them gone platinum and gold and one of the top ten music in Australia. Hi-5 CDs are sold in UK and Australia

==Episodes and series==

In every series there are nine feature songs, termed 'Songs of the Week' (the titles of which are shown below). Each series has run for nine weeks allowing five episodes to be shown a week (45 episodes) To date, there have been 570 episodes aired with more 25 new episodes from Hi-5 House . Except for series 6 which had just 30 episodes. Accordingly the Series 6 was composed of 6 songs of the week and various segments which had been filmed in 2002 and 2003. The lack of a new series in 2012 was also due to the same reason.
Each section indicates the year in which each season aired, the title of the song on the album and the title used in the show. each song focuses on teaching the audience general common values in life and childhood, such as love, growth, imagination, fun, acceptance, adventure and more. Each week, there is a theme of the week that the song goes along with... The theme is given in the beginning of each episode in animation.
From Series 1 -10 orange people participate in activities that goes along with the theme of that week. From Series 11 -13, it always includes a dinosaur on wheels and a caterpillar on wheels participating in some activity that goes with the theme. The theme name appears in colorful letters, children's voices announce the theme and then the show begins. Hi-5 House however has five weekly themes each theme lasting five days for 25 episodes.
