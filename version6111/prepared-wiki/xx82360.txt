[[Punic language]]

CATEGORIES: Punic language, Extinct languages of Africa, Phoenician language, Carthage

The Punic language, also called Carthaginian or Phoenicio-Punic, is an extinct variety of the Phoenician language, a Canaanite language of the Semitic family. It was spoken in the Carthaginian empire in North Africa and several Mediterranean islands by the Punic people from about 800 BC to 600 AD. The Punics stayed in contact with Phoenicia until the destruction of Carthage by the Roman Republic in 146 BC.

==Description==

Punic is known from inscriptions (most of them religious formulae) and personal name evidence.  The play Poenulus by Plautus contains a few lines of vernacular Punic, which have been subject to some research because, unlike inscriptions, they largely preserve the vowels.[tpl]cite book |title= Les passages puniques en transcription latine dans le Poenulus de Plaute |last= Sznycer |first= Maurice |year= 1967 |publisher= Librairie C.

Augustine of Hippo is generally considered the last major ancient writer to have some knowledge of Punic, and is considered "our primary source on the survival of late Punic". According to him, the Punic language was still spoken in his region (Northern Africa) in the 5th century AD, centuries after the fall of Carthage, and there were still people who called themselves "chanani" (Canaanite, i.e.: Carthaginian) at that time.[tpl]cite book |title=  Late Punic epigraphy: an introduction to the study of Neo-Punic and Latino-Punic inscriptions |author= Jongeling. Karel; & Kerr, Robert M. |year= 2005 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |isbn= 3-16-148728-1 |pages= 4 [/tpl] Writing around AD 401, he says:
 Quae lingua si improbatur abs te, nega Punicis libris, ut a viris doctissimis proditur, multa sapienter esse mandata memoriae. Poeniteat te certe ibi natum, ubi huius linguae cunabula recalent.  
 And if the Punic language is rejected by you, you virtually deny what has been admitted by most learned men, that many things have been wisely preserved from oblivion in books written in the Punic tongue. Nay, you ought even to be ashamed of having been born in the country in which the cradle of this language is still warm. (Ep. xvii)

Besides Augustine, the only proof of Punic-speaking communities at such a late period is a series of trilingual funerary texts found in the Christian catacombs of Sirte, Libya. The gravestones are carved in Classical Greek, Latin and Punic.  It may have even survived the Arabic conquest of North Africa: the geographer al-Bakrī describes a people speaking a language that was not Berber, Latin or Coptic in Sirte, a region where spoken Punic survived well past written use.http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/vtw/jongeling/latpun/LPINTRO.htm However it is likely that Arabization of the Punics was facilitated by their language belonging to the same group (the Semitic languages group) as that of the conquerors, and thus having many grammatical and lexical similarities.Jongeling and Kerr, p. 71
The idea that Punic exerted an influence on the modern Maltese language was first raised in 1565.[tpl]cite web | title=The Maltese Language Academy | url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 | author=L-Akkademja tal-Malti[/tpl] This theory has been mostly discredited; mainstream theories hold Maltese to be derived from Siculo-Arabic, with a large number of loanwords from Italian. Punic was indeed spoken on the island of Malta at some point in its history, as evidenced by the Cippi of Melqart, integral to the decipherment of Punic after its extinction, and other inscriptions found on the islands.

==Phonology==

The Punic language has 20 consonants.
