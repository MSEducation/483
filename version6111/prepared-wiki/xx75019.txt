</ref> Meanwhile, it became clear that AltaVista's portal strategy was unsuccessful, and the search service began losing market share, especially to [[Google]].  After a series of layoffs and several management changes, AltaVista gradually shed its portal features and refocused on search.  By 2002, AltaVista had improved the quality and freshness of its results and redesigned its user interface.<ref>

In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by Overture Services, Inc.[ref]

In July 2003, Overture was taken over by Yahoo!.[tpl]cite web|title=Yahoo to acquire Overture |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1102.html |date=July 13, 2003[/tpl]
In December 2010, a Yahoo! employee leaked PowerPoint slides indicating that the search engine would be shut down as part of a consolidation at Yahoo!.[ref]

==Free services==

AltaVista provided  Babel Fish, a web-based machine translation application  that translates text or web pages from one of several languages into another. It was later superseded by Yahoo! Babel Fish and now redirects to Bing's translation service.  They also provided free email which wedded users to the Altavista brand.  The arbitrary shutdown of the email service was a disastrous decision in hindsight because competition was beginning to grow.  Users deserted Altavista in large numbers and Altavista was never to fully recover.
