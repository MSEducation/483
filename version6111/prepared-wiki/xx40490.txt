</ref> Buechner was a retired colonel with the [[U.S. Army]] who served in World War II and had written a book about the [[Dachau massacre]]. He claims he was contacted by a former [[U-boat]] submariner, the pseudonymous “Capt. Wilhelm Bernhart”, who claimed the spear currently on display in Vienna is a fake. "Bernhart" said the real spear was sent by Hitler to [[New Swabia|Antarctica]] along with other Nazi treasures, under the command of Col. [[Maximilian Hartmann]]. In 1979 Hartmann allegedly recovered the treasures. Bernhart presented Buechner with the log from this expedition as well as pictures of the objects recovered, claiming that after the Spear of Destiny was recovered, it was hidden somewhere in Europe by a Nazi secret society. After contacting most of the members of the alleged expedition and others involved, including [[Hitler Youth]] Leader [[Artur Axmann]], Buechner became convinced the claims were true.

===U-534===

Another theory is that the real spear was on board the German U-boat U-534, the last U-boat that departed from the harbour of Kiel, Germany, in the final days of World War II and was sunk nearby the Danish island of Anholt by a Royal Air Force bomber on 5 May 1945.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] This claim, however, has been disputed by Danish businessman Karsten Ree who financed the salvage of U-534 in 1993.
