[[MASH-1]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic hash functions

MASH-1 (Modular Arithmetic Secure Hash) is a hash function based on modular arithmetic.

==History==

Despite many proposals, few hash functions based on modular arithmetic have withstood attack, and most that have tend to be relatively inefficient.  MASH-1 evolved from a long line of related proposals successively broken and repaired.

==Standard==

Committee Draft ISO/IEC 10118-4 (Nov 95)

==Description==

MASH-1 involves use of an RSA-like modulus M, whose bitlength affects the security.  M should be difficult to factor, and for M of unknown factorization, the security is based in part on the difficulty of extracting modular roots.  M also determines the block size for processing messages.
