The 1996 Football League Cup Final took place on 24 March 1996 at Wembley Stadium and was contested between Aston Villa and Leeds United. This was the 35th final and the 29th to be played at Wembley. Aston Villa had won the trophy two years earlier, while Leeds' last victory was in their only final appearance in 1968.
In the first half the teams could only be separated by a superb strike from Savo Milošević. After half-time, Leeds United tired and Aston Villa took advantage to eventually win 3–0. Goals from Ian Taylor and Dwight Yorke completed the scoring.[tpl]cite news|title=Milosevic gives Villa a touch of magic|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/milosevic-gives-villa-a-touch-of-magic-1343925.html|publisher=The Independent|date=25 March 1996|accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl] This was the beginning of the end for Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson, as he was heckled by the clubs fans for his and the team's failure. However it was Villa's fifth success in the competition, at the time equalling the record set by Liverpool.
