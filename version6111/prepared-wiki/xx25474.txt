==Active organizations==

===Nation of Islam===

In the 1930s, the Nation of Islam emerged, coming to prominence during the 1960s, when charismatic minister (Black civil right activist) Malcolm X became a spokesman for the movement. The group's founders, "Master Fard" Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad, preached the Doctrine of Yakub, which held that the Original Man was an "Asiatic black man". White people, it contended, were "grafted" from black people 6,000 years ago by an ancient black scientist named Yakub.Muhammad, Elijah. "The Making of Devil".
The belief in sacrificial killing and ritualistic murder was part of the early Nation of Islam doctrine. Fard thought explicitly that it was the duty for every Muslim to offer as sacrifice four "Caucasian devils".[tpl]cite book|first=Steven|last=Tsoukalas|authorlink=Steven Tsoukalas|year=2001|title=The Nation of Islam - Understanding the "Black Muslims"|pages=23–24|publisher=P&R Publishing[/tpl] A portion of Fard's lesson reads as follows:
[tpl]bquote|Why does Fard Mohammad and any Moslem murder the devil? What is the duty of each Moslem in regard to four devils? What reward does a Moslem receive by presenting the four devils at one time? — Because he is one hundred percent wicked and will not keep and obey the laws of Islam. His ways and actions are like a snake of the grafted type. So Mohammad learned that he could not reform the devils, so they had to be murdered. All Moslems will murder the devil because they know he is a snake and also if he be allowed to live, he would sting someone else. Each Moslem is required to bring four devils, and by bringing and presenting four at one time his reward is a button to wear on the lapel of his coat, also a free transportation to the Holy City of Mecca.|||Master Fard Mohammad, Lesson #1.[tpl]cite book|first=Mattias|last=Gardell|authorlink=Mattias Gardell|year=1996|title=In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam|pages=56|location=Durham, N.C. |publisher= Duke University Press[/tpl][/tpl]
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan later argued that the lessons about murdering devils was only a metaphor designed to "rally NOI members to 'slay whites' psychological and social grip on them"[tpl]cite book|first=Arthur J.|last=Magida|authorlink=Arthur J. Magida|year=1996|title=Prophet of Rage: A Life of Louis Farrakhan and His Nation|pages=52|location=New York|publisher= HarperCollins[/tpl] but Fard's lessons on the murder of white people in at least one instance were taken literally and verbatim:
 One afternoon in the early 1970s, when Ali K. Muslim, then Charles 41x, was guarding the temple, a man carrying a sack asked to meet a temple official. The man, thoroughly confused about Elijah Muhammad's teachings, believed that if he killed four white "devils" he would win a trip to the Holy Land. He had come to redeem his prizes. In the sack, Ali K. Muslim says, were four severed heads.[tpl]cite book|first=Steven|last=Barbosa|authorlink=Steven Barbosa|year=1993|title=American Jihad: Islam after Malcolm X|pages=115–116|publisher=New York: Doubleday[/tpl] 
This teaching also culminated in the creation of the Death Angels, a small splinter group of the Nation of Islam. Between 1972 and 1974, the Death Angels murdered 14 white people in the San Francisco Bay Area. These murders later would become known as the Zebra murders because the police used Radio Z to communicate about the case.Lubinskas, James. "Remembering the Zebra Killings". Front Page Magazine. 30 August 2001.Hodge, Damon. "Alien Nation: Louis Farrakhan, Phone Home". Las Vegas Weekly. undated.
Elijah Muhammad also preached black self-reliance, black separatism, cooperative economics, strict moral and physical discipline, and opposition to black-white miscegenation. Since its founding, the NOI has gone through reorganizations and internal conflicts, but even as it moves closer to the mainstream of Islamic belief and practice, the NOI leadership has not rejected formally any of Fard's doctrines. It opposes any changes in the major beliefs and programs that were instituted by Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad, including the annual "Savior's Day".Gudel, Joseph P. and Larry Duckworth.

Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report''. Fall 2000.
Members of the NOI have been publicly criticized by the leadership for making anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic anti-white and anti-homosexual statements,"Nation of Islam ". 2001. and for urging the murder of such people.  Farrakhan has been banned from entering the UK since 1986 because of his "racist and anti-Semitic views"."Farrakhan British ban stays ". British Broadcasting Corporation. 30 April 2002.
Most historians and social scientists[tpl]Nonspecific|date=December 2007[/tpl] classify the Nation of Islam as a black nationalist, or black separatist, organization. The Southern Poverty Law Center headed by Morris Dees placed the Nation of Islam on its list of hate groups."U.S. Hate Groups in 2005. Southern Poverty Law Center. 2005. Retrieved 25 December 2006.

===Nation of Yahweh===

The Nation of Yahweh is a black supremacist religious group that is an offshoot of the Black Hebrew Israelites line of thought[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl], and was founded by Yahweh ben Yahweh, meaning "God the Son of God" in Hebrew, formerly known as Hulon Mitchell Jr. At its height, the Nation of Yahweh controlled an $8 million empire of properties, including a Miami headquarters known as the Temple of Love and temples in 22 states."Nation of Yahweh " Apologetics Index. undated. Followers of the Nation of Yahweh view black people as the only "true Jews" and believe that White Jews are the spawn of Satan."Popularity and Populism ". Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report. Winter 2001.
According to the Crime Library, followers of the Nation of Yahweh formed a secret group called "The Brotherhood". To become a member of The Brotherhood, applicants had to kill a "white devil" and bring Mitchell a body part - an ear, nose or finger - as proof of the kill. Several Nation of Yahweh members were convicted of conspiracy in more than a dozen anti-white murders, among them Robert Rozier, a former pro football player and member of the secret Brotherhood, who admitted to the killing of seven white people.Scheeres, Julie. "The Yahweh Ben Yahweh Cult ". The Crime Library. undated. Mitchell started a private school for his followers and held sex classes for boys and men in which he showed them movies of white women having sex with animals to dissuade them from lusting after white females.

===New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense===

The New Black Panther Party (NBPP), whose formal name is the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, is a U.S.-based black supremacist organization founded in Dallas, Texas in 1989.

===The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ===

The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ (ICGJC), formerly known as the Israeli Church of Universal Practical Knowledge, is a Black Hebrew Israelite Christian group which accepts the Old and New Testaments as well as the Apocrypha, as inspired Scripture, and which believes that specific people of African and West Indian descent are the lost 12 tribes of Israel and are the true racial and Biblical Jews. They have historically claimed racial superiority to Caucasians, and claim to have divine favor and inspiration. ICGJC World Headquarters is located in New York City, New York, United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=941 |title='Ready for War' |accessdate=2008-11-22 |date=Fall 2008 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center [/tpl]Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) - Religious Tolerance. Retrieved 7 November 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecomforter.info|title=ICGJC World Headquarters|publisher=Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ|accessdate=2012-04-15[/tpl]
The ICGJC and its various splinter groups can be loosely grouped together as sects which advocate a King-James-Version-only approach to the Bible (i.e. they only endorse the KJV as scripture), and the belief that Caucasians are Edomites. The Israelite Church is nontrinitarian, but believes that Jesus Christ is God's divine Son and Messiah, and Redeemer for sinful Israelites. The ICGJC also holds to strong apocalyptic views of the end of the world.

===United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors===

The United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors was founded by Dwight York. The Nuwaubians believe in black people's superiority to white people, that white people are "devils," devoid of both heart and soul, that the color of white people is the result of leprosy and genetic inferiority, and that the ancestors of white people are the sexual partners of dogs and jackals.Moser, Bob. "'Savior' in a Strange Land". Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report. Fall 2002.
White people are said in one myth to have been originally created as a race of killers to serve black people as a slave army.

==Black supremacist theories==

===Melanin theory===

Some black supremacists justify supremacist assertions by assigning dubious properties to melanin based on pseudo-science and distortions of scientific fact or speculation. This body of belief is known generally as "Melanin theory". The central idea of the Melanin theory is that the levels of melanin in dark skin naturally enhance intelligence and emotional, psychic and spiritual sensitivity.[ref]Skeptinq, Ortiz de Montellano, B.

==Alliances with white supremacist groups==

Due to some commonly held separatist ideologies, some black supremacist organizations have found limited common cause with white supremacist or extremist organizations. In 1961 and 1962 George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party, for example, was invited to speak by Elijah Muhammad at a Nation of Islam rally.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Messenger Passes |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917218,00.html |work= |publisher=Time magazine |date=March 10, 1975 |accessdate=2007-08-19 [/tpl]
