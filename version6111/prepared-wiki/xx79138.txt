Debenhams plc is a multinational retail chain operating under a department store format in the United Kingdom and Ireland with franchise stores in other countries. The company was founded in the eighteenth century as a single store in London and has now grown to 172 locations across the UK, Ireland and Denmark. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. Since 1993 it has also been known for the Designers at Debenhams brand range.

==History==

The business was formed in 1778 by William Clark, who began trading at 44 Wigmore Street in London as a drapers' store.[tpl]cite web |title=History of Debenhams |url=http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/contentView?filepath=/DebenhamsUKSite/Static/history_debenhams_uk.xml&storeId=10701&langId=-1 |publisher=Debenhams |accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl] In 1813, William Debenham became a partner and the corporate name changed to Clark & Debenham.  In 1818 the company opened a second store in Cheltenham, and in 1851, Clement Freebody became a partner so the name changed again to Debenham & Freebody.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.debenhamsplc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=196805&p=history| title=History| publisher=Debenhams| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl] The business was incorporated as Debenhams Limited in 1905.[tpl]cite web| title=Business History of Department Stores: Interesting Dates| url=http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm| publisher=KIPnotes| date=1 October 2008| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl]
The modern Debenhams group grew from the acquisition of department stores in towns and cities throughout the UK, under the leadership of its chairman, Ernest Debenham. The first of these purchases, Marshall & Snelgrove at Oxford Street in London, was acquired in 1919.  Later purchases included Harvey Nichols in London's Knightsbridge in 1920. Most of the acquired stores  retained their former identities until a unified corporate image was rolled out. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1928.
In 1976 the company acquired Browns of Chester. It remains the only UK store to have retained an individual identity.
In 1985 the company was acquired by the Burton Group.
Debenhams demerged from the Burton Group in January 1998 and was once again listed as a separate company on the London Stock Exchange.[tpl]cite news |title=New look for Debenhams |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/84099.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 April 1998 |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] It expanded under the leadership of Belinda Earl who was appointed CEO in 2000.[tpl]cite news| title=The Queen of Retail makes a dull brand shine| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/dec/15/retail| author=Jane Martinson| publisher=The Guardian| date=14 December 2006| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl]

On 4 November 1989, it opened a store at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Brierley Hill.

==Incidents involving the Animal Liberation Front==

Debenhams was targeted three times during the 1980s by the Animal Liberation Front in protest at the sale of animal furs in stores. Stores in Romford, Luton, and Harrow were fire-bombed by members, the worst attack being on the Luton store. As a result, the company stopped selling clothes with animal furs.[tpl]cite news |title=Undercover policeman 'fire-bombed shop,' MPs told |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18423441 |newspaper=BBC News |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]
It was alleged by Caroline Lucas MP in  a debate in Westminster Hall that Rob Lambert, a then undercover police officer, planted the fire bomb that caused £340,000 worth of damage to the Harrow branch of Debenhams in 1987. It is unclear if anything has come of these allegations as of March 2014.[tpl]cite news |title=Undercover policeman 'fire-bombed shop,' MPs told |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18423441 |newspaper=BBC News |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=MP Caroline Lucas names undercover officer as shop fire bomber |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18426368 |newspaper=BBC News |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Undercover cop alleged to have fire-bombed Debenhams for ALF |url=http://www.constabulary.org.uk/2012/06/13/undercover-cop-alleged-to-have-fire-bombed-debenhams-for-alf/ |newspaper=Constabulary |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Caroline Lucas Exposes Allegations Ex-Undercover Cop Bob Lambert Firebombed Debenhams London Store |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/06/13/caroline-lucas-undercover-policeman-bob-lambert-firebombing_n_1592661.html?view=print |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]

==Products and services==

In 1993 the company introduced the 'Designers at Debenhams' brand, the creation of then CEO Belinda Earl, Ben de Lisi and Spencer Hawken.[tpl]cite web| title=Designers at Debenhams| url=http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category_10001_10001_125651_-1| publisher=Debenhams| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl] The idea put designer names and brands at High Street prices, including Jasper Conran, John Rocha, Betty Jackson Black, Butterfly by Matthew Williamson, H! by Henry Holland, Star by Julien Macdonald, Frost French, Erickson Beamon, Eric Van Peterson, Janet Reger, Pip Hackett, Melissa Odabash, Ted Baker, St George by Duffer, Jeff Banks, and Ben de Lisi. The brand Designers at Debenhams was the saving grace for the company which had been in decline since the late 1980s. The company also sells goods under a number of brand names that it owns.
In October 2010, Debenhams announced the launch of four new designer names to its fashion range; Jonathan Saunders, Preen, Jonathan Kelsey, and Roksanda Ilincic, who will be working with the retailer on a new concept called Edition.[tpl]cite web| title=Four new designers join Debenhams for ‘Edition’| url=http://blog.debenhams.com/four-new-designers-join-debenhams-for-edition/womens-fashion/| publisher=Debenhams blog| date=21 October 2010| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl]
In the UK the company operates a retail website, as well as a mobile-enabled website and mobile apps that allow customers to shop the online range and scan product barcodes in store.[tpl]cite press release| title=Shopping goes truly mobile| url=http://presscentre.debenhams.com/Press-Releases/Shopping-goes-truly-mobile-150.aspx| date=16 September 2011| publisher=Debenhams| accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl] Localised retail websites for Ireland and Germany have also been introduced. 
Debenhams provide store card and credit card services, operated by NewDay. Insurance products are also provided under the Debenhams brand by other financial companies. Debenhams also operate bureau de changes in selected stores.
In October 2013 the company launched an online ticket service known as Debenhams Box Office[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/debenhams-offers-new-ticketbuying-service-8870888.html|title=Debenhams Offers New TicketBuying Service| publisher=London Evening Standard[/tpl]powered by a number of ticket providers, including notable primary ticket outlets such as Skiddle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.skiddle.com/skiddle-affiliates-get-ready-for-nye/|title=Skiddle Affiliates Get Ready for NYE| publisher=Skiddle Blog[/tpl]

Debenhams occupies the most sites of any of the traditional department store groups in the UK.

All department stores in the group now trade as "Debenhams" except Browns in Chester. New stores are usually located within wider town and regional shopping centre developments. Stores amalgamated into the group include:
