[[Brown recluse spider]]

CATEGORIES: Sicariidae, Spiders of North America, Venomous spiders, Animals described in 1940

The brown recluse spider or fiddleback spider, Loxosceles reclusa, Sicariidae (formerly placed in a family "Loxoscelidae") is a spider with a venomous bite.
Brown recluse spiders are usually between 6–20 mm ([tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl] in and [tpl]frac|3|4[/tpl] in), but may grow larger. While typically light to medium brown, they range in color from cream-colored to dark brown or blackish gray. The cephalothorax and abdomen may not necessarily be the same color. These spiders usually have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider, resulting in the nicknames fiddleback spider, brown fiddler, or violin spider.

==Description==

The violin pattern is not diagnostic, as other spiders can have similar markings (e.g. cellar spiders and pirate spiders). For definitive identification it is imperative to examine the eyes.  While most spiders have eight eyes, recluse spiders have six eyes arranged in pairs (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs. Only a few other spiders have three pairs of eyes arranged in this way (e.g., scytodids). Recluses have no obvious coloration patterns on the abdomen or legs, and the legs lack spines.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vetter R | title = Identifying and misidentifying the brown recluse spider. | journal = Dermatol Online J | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | page = 7 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10673460 | url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/DOJvol5num2/special/recluse.html | doi = 10.2340/00015555-0082 | last2 = Shay | first2 = M | last3 = Bitterman | first3 = O[/tpl] The abdomen is covered with fine short hairs that, when viewed without magnification, give the appearance of soft fur. The leg joints may appear to be a slightly lighter color.

==Life-cycle==

Adult brown recluse spiders often live about one to two years.  Each female produces several egg sacs over a period of two to three months, from May to July, with approximately fifty eggs in each sac.  The eggs hatch in about one month.  The spiderlings take about one year to grow to adulthood.  The brown recluse spider is resilient and can tolerate up to six months of extreme drought and scarcity or absence of food. On one occasion it survived in controlled captivity for over five seasons without food.[tpl]cite journal|author=Horner, N.V. & Stewart, K.W.|title=Life history of the brown spider, Loxosceles reclusa, Gertsch and Muliak|journal=Texas Journal of Science|volume=19|year=1967|page=333[/tpl]

==Behavior==

A brown recluse's stance on a flat surface is usually with all legs radially extended. When alarmed it may lower its body, withdraw the forward two legs straight rearward into a defensive position, withdraw the rearmost pair of legs into a position for lunging forward, and stand motionless with pedipalps raised. The pedipalps in mature specimens are dark, quite prominent, and are normally held horizontally forward. When threatened it usually flees, seemingly to avoid a conflict, and if detained may further avoid contact with quick horizontal rotating movements. The spider does not usually jump unless touched brusquely, and even then its avoidance movement is more of a horizontal lunge rather than a vaulting of itself entirely off the surface. When running the brown recluse does not appear to leave a silk line behind, which at any rate might make it more easily tracked when it is being pursued. Movement at virtually any speed is an evenly paced gait with legs extended. When missing a leg or two it appears to favor this same gait, although (presumably when a leg has been injured) it may move and stand at rest with one leg slightly withdrawn.  During travel it stops naturally and periodically when renewing its internal hydraulic blood pressure that, like most spiders, it requires to renew strength in its legs.

==Habitat==

Brown recluse spiders build asymmetrical (irregular) webs that frequently include a shelter consisting of disorderly thread. They frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, plenum spaces, cellars, and other places that are dry and generally undisturbed.  When dwelling in human residences they seem to favor cardboard, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they inhabit naturally. They have also been encountered in shoes, inside dressers, in bed sheets of infrequently used beds, in clothes stacked or piled or left lying on the floor, inside work gloves, behind baseboards and pictures, in toilets, and near sources of warmth when ambient temperatures are lower than usual. Human-recluse contact often occurs when such isolated spaces are disturbed and the spider feels threatened. Unlike most web weavers, they leave these lairs at night to hunt. Males move around more when hunting than do females, which tend to remain nearer to their webs. The spider will hunt for firebrats, crickets, cockroaches, and other soft-bodied insects.

==Distribution==

The  range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, it is native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky.[tpl]cite web | author=Jone SC | title=Ohio State University Fact Sheet: Brown Recluse Spider.| url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2061.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Swanson D, Vetter R | title = Bites of brown recluse spiders and suspected necrotic arachnidism. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 7 | pages = 700–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15716564 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra041184[/tpl]

There are other species of the genus Loxosceles native to the southwestern part of the United States, including California, that may resemble the brown recluse, but these species have never been documented as medically significant. The number of "false positive" reports based on misidentifications is considerable; in a nationwide study where people submitted spiders that they thought were brown recluses, of 581 from California only 1 was a brown recluse—submitted by a family that moved from Missouri and brought it with them (compared to specimens submitted from Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma, where between 75% and 90% were recluses).[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1603/0022-2585(2005)0420512:ASASBR2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Vetter | first1 = R.S. | year = 2005 | title = Arachnids submitted as suspected brown recluse spiders (Araneae: Sicariidae): Loxosceles species are virtually restricted to their known distributions but public perception is that they exist throughout the United States | url = | journal = J.

A similar study documented that various arachnids were routinely misidentified by physicians, pest control operators, and other non-expert authorities, who told their patients or clients that the spider they had was a brown recluse when in fact it was not.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.04.021 | last1 = Vetter | first1 = R.S. | year = 2009 | title = Arachnids misidentified as brown recluse spiders by medical personnel and other authorities in North America | url = | journal = Toxicon | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 545–547 | pmid = 19446575 [/tpl] Despite the absence of brown recluses from the Western U.S., physicians in the region commonly diagnose "brown recluse bites", leading to the popular misconception that the spiders inhabit those areas.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00173-9 | last1 = Vetter | first1 = R.S. | last2 = Cushing | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Crawford | first3 = R.L. | last4 = Royce | first4 = L.A. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2003 | title = Diagnoses of brown recluse spider bites (loxoscelism) greatly outnumber actual verifications of the spider's presence in four western American states | url = | journal = Toxicon | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 413–418 | pmid = 14505942 [/tpl]

==Bite==

As suggested by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders were removed from a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived there for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them."An Infestation of 2,055 Brown Recluse Spiders (Araneae: Sicariidae) and No Envenomations in a Kansas Home: Implications for Bite Diagnoses in Nonendemic Areas" by Richard S. Vetter and Diane K. Barger, J. Med. Entomol. 39(6): 948Ð951(2002); available online at http://docserver.esa.catchword.org/deliver/cw/pdf/esa/freepdfs/00222585/v39n6s25.pdf[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20110628/NEWS20/106260379/Fact-Checker-brown-recluse-your-bathtub-?nclick_check=1|title=Fact Checker: Is that a brown recluse in your bathtub?|last1=Robison|first1=Mark|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=22 May 2013[/tpl] The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes that had not been worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. However, the fangs of the brown recluse are so tiny they are unable to penetrate most fabric.[tpl]cite book|author=Sandidge, J.S.|year=2009|title=Brown recluse spiders: A knowledge based guide to control and elimination|publisher=BRS Pest Control|location=McLouth|authorlink=Jamél S. Sandidge[/tpl]
The bite frequently is not felt initially and may not be immediately painful, but it can be serious. The brown recluse bears a potentially deadly hemotoxic venom. Most bites are minor with no necrosis. However, a small number of brown recluse bites do produce severe dermonecrotic lesions (i.e. necrosis); an even smaller number produce severe cutaneous (skin) or viscerocutaneous (systemic) symptoms. In one study of clinically diagnosed brown recluse bites, skin necrosis occurred 37% of the time, while systemic illness occurred 14% of the time.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leach J, Bassichis B, Itani K |title=Brown recluse spider bites to the head: three cases and a review |journal=Ear Nose Throat J |volume=83 |issue=7 |pages=465–70 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15372917 |doi= |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brown+recluse+spider+bites+to+the+head%3A+three+cases+and+a+review-a0124261634[/tpl], in turn citing: Wright SW, Wrenn KD, Murray L, Seger D. Clinical presentation and outcome of brown recluse spider bite. Ann Emerg Med 1997;30: 28–32. In these cases, the bites produced a range of symptoms common to many members of the Loxosceles genus known as loxoscelism, which may be cutaneous and viscerocutaneous. In very rare cases, bites can even cause hemolysis—the bursting of red blood cells.[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2007 |title=Greta Binford 1997- |journal=Biography Today |volume=17 |issue=1 |page=14|publisher=Omnigraphics, Inc.|issn=1058-2347 |doi= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl]
Around 49% of brown recluse bites do not result in necrosis or systemic effects. When both types of loxoscelism do result, systemic effects may occur before necrosis, as the venom spreads throughout the body in minutes. Children, the elderly, and the debilitatingly ill may be more susceptible to systemic loxoscelism. The systemic symptoms most commonly experienced include nausea, vomiting, fever, rashes, and muscle and joint pain. Rarely, such bites can result in hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, organ damage, and even death.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wasserman G | title = Bites of the brown recluse spider | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 19 | pages = 2029–30; author reply 2029–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15892198 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200505123521922[/tpl] Most fatalities are in children under the age of sevenTenn.

While the majority of brown recluse spider bites do not result in any symptoms, cutaneous symptoms occur more frequently than systemic symptoms. In such instances, the bite forms a necrotizing ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. These bites usually become painful and itchy within 2 to 8 hours. Pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite, and the necrosis develops over the next few days.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wasserman G, Anderson P | title = Loxoscelism and necrotic arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 21 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 451–72 | year =1983–1984 | pmid = 6381752 | doi = 10.3109/15563658308990434[/tpl] Over time, the wound may grow to as large as 25 cm (10 inches). The damaged tissue becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs away.

===Validity of necrosis claims===

It is estimated that 80% of reported brown recluse bites have been misdiagnosed. There is now an ELISA-based test for brown recluse venom that can determine whether a wound is a brown recluse bite, although it is not commercially available and not in routine clinical use. Clinical diagnoses often use Occam's razor principle in diagnosing bites based on what spiders the patient likely encountered and previous similar diagnoses.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gomez H, Krywko D, Stoecker W | title = A new assay for the detection of Loxosceles species (brown recluse) spider venom | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–74 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11973553 | doi = 10.1067/mem.2002.122914 | pmc = 3201721[/tpl]
There are numerous documented infectious and noninfectious conditions that produce wounds that have been initially misdiagnosed as recluse bites by medical professionals, including:

| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" style="border:0"|
Many of these conditions are far more common and more likely to be the source of necrotic wounds, even in areas where brown recluse spiders actually occur. The most important of these is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterium whose necrotic lesions are very similar to those induced by recluse bites, and which can be lethal if left untreated.Spider Bite: Coroner's Office Says Pomona Teen died of Staph Infection, Not Spider Bite - ktla.com Misdiagnosis of MRSA as spider bites is extremely common (nearly 30% of patients with MRSA reported that they initially suspected a spider bite), and can have fatal consequences.Moran GJ, et al. 2006. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections among patients in the emergency department. New England J. Med. 355: 666–74
Reported cases of brown recluse bites occur primarily in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There have been many reports of brown recluse bites in California—though a few related species may be found there, none of these are known to bite humans. To date, the reports of bites from areas outside of the spider's native range have been either unverified, or, if verified, the spiders have been moved to those locations by travelers or commerce. Many arachnologists believe that a large number of bites attributed to the brown recluse in the West Coast are either from other spider species or not spider bites at all. For example, the bite of the hobo spider, found in the northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, has been reported to produce similar symptoms as the brown recluse bite. However, the toxicity of hobo spider venom has been called into question as bites have not been proven to cause necrosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vetter R, Isbister G | title = Do hobo spider bites cause dermonecrotic injuries? | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 605–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15573036 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.03.016[/tpl]
Numerous other spiders have been associated with necrotic bites in medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the desert recluse (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1636/RSt08-06.1 | last1 = Vetter | first1 = R.S. | year = 2008 | title = Spiders of the genus Loxosceles (Araneae, Sicariidae): a review of biological, medical and psychological aspects regarding envenomations | url = | journal = The Journal of Arachnology | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 150–163 [/tpl] The hobo spider and the yellow sac spider have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bennett RG, Vetter RS |title=An approach to spider bites. Erroneous attribution of dermonecrotic lesions to brown recluse or hobo spider bites in Canada |journal=Canadian Family Physician |volume=50 |issue= 8|pages=1098–101 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15455808 |pmc=2214648 |doi= |url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/reprint/50/8/1098.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=James H.

There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of these spiders. In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when "questionable" identifications were excluded from the sample set.[tpl]cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Gray MR |title=White-tail spider bite: a prospective study of 130 definite bites by Lampona species |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=199–202 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12914510 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/179_04_180803/isb10785_fm.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Hirst D |title=A prospective study of definite bites by spiders of the family Sparassidae (huntsmen spiders) with identification to species level |journal=Toxicon |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=163–71 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12906887 |doi= 10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00129-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0041010103001296[/tpl] (For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider bites, see the list of spiders having medically significant venom.)

===Bite treatment===

First aid involves the application of an ice pack to control inflammation and prompt medical care. If it can be easily captured, the spider should be brought with the patient in a clear, tightly closed container so it may be identified.
Routine treatment should include immobilization of the affected limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used with varying degrees of success, including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom.[tpl]cite journal |author=Maynor ML, Moon RE, Klitzman B, Fracica PJ, Canada A |title=Brown recluse spider envenomation: a prospective trial of hyperbaric oxygen therapy |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=184–92 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9063544 |doi= 10.1111/j.1553-2712.1997.tb03738.x|url= |accessdate= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Maynor ML, Abt JL, Osborne PD |title=Brown Recluse Spider Bites: Beneficial Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen |journal=J. Hyperbaric Med |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=89–102 |year=19892 |month= |issn=0884-1225 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4477 |accessdate=2008-07-22[/tpl] None of these treatments have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.
Outpatient palliative care following discharge often consists of a weak-moderate strength opioid (e.g. codeine and tramadol, respectively) depending on pain scores, an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. naproxen, cortisone), and an antispasmodic (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, diazepam), for a few days to a week. If the pain and/or spasms have not resolved by this time, a second medical evaluation is generally advised, and differential diagnoses may be considered. Occasionally but not always, an antibiotic is prescribed as well.
Cases of brown recluse venom travelling along a limb through a vein or artery are rare, but the resulting tissue mortification[tpl]dn|date=December 2013[/tpl] can affect an area as large as several inches and in extreme cases require excising of the wound.

====Specific treatments====

In presumed cases of recluse bites, dapsone is often used for the treatment of necrosis, but controlled clinical trials have yet to demonstrate efficacy.Elston DM, Miller SD, Young RJ 3rd, Eggers J, McGlasson D, Schmidt WH, Bush A.

Arch Dermatol 2005; 141(5):595–7. However, dapsone may be effective in treating many "spider bites" because many such cases are actually misdiagnosed microbial infections.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vetter R, Bush S | title = The diagnosis of brown recluse spider bite is overused for dermonecrotic wounds of uncertain etiology | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 544–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11973562 | doi = 10.1067/mem.2002.123594[/tpl] There have been conflicting reports about its efficacy in treating brown recluse bites, and some have suggested it should no longer be used routinely, if at all.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bryant S, Pittman L | title = Dapsone use in Loxosceles reclusa envenomation: is there an indication? | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–90 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12563594 | doi = 10.1053/ajem.2003.50021[/tpl]
Wound infection is rare. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is a credible diagnosis of infection.[tpl]cite journal | author = Anderson P | title = Missouri brown recluse spider: a review and update | journal = Mo Med | volume = 95 | issue = 7 | pages = 318–22 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9666677[/tpl]
Studies have shown that surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcome. Excision may delay wound healing, cause abscesses, and lead to scarring.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rees R, Altenbern D, Lynch J, King L | title = Brown recluse spider bites. A comparison of early surgical excision versus dapsone and delayed surgical excision | journal = Ann Surg | volume = 202 | issue = 5 | pages = 659–63 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4051613 | pmc = 1250983 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-198511000-00020[/tpl]
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the application of nitroglycerin patches can be beneficial.[tpl]cite web | author=Burton K |title=The Brown Recluse Spider: Finally stopped in its tracks | url=http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/2021/recluse/intro.html | accessdate=2006-09-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060420183312/http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/2021/recluse/intro.html|archivedate=2006-04-20[/tpl] Brown recluse venom is a vasoconstrictor, and nitroglycerin causes vasodilation, allowing the venom to be diluted into the bloodstream and fresh blood to flow to the wound, theoretically preventing necrosis (as vasoconstriction may contribute to necrosis). However, one scientific animal study found no benefit in preventing necrosis, with the study's results showing it increased inflammation and caused symptoms of systemic envenoming. The authors concluded the results of the study did not support the use of topical nitroglycerin in brown recluse envenoming. [tpl]cite journal | author = Lowry B, Bradfield J, Carroll R, Brewer K, Meggs W | title = A controlled trial of topical nitroglycerin in a New Zealand white rabbit model of brown recluse spider envenomation | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–5 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11174233 | doi = 10.1067/mem.2001.113031[/tpl]
Antivenom, available in South America for the venom of other species of recluse spiders, appears to be the most promising therapy. They are most effective if given early. However, the bites, often being painless, usually do not present symptoms until 24 or more hours after the event, possibly limiting the effect of this intervention.[tpl]cite journal | author = Isbister G, Graudins A, White J, Warrell D | title = Antivenom treatment in arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 291–300 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12807312 | doi = 10.1081/CLT-120021114[/tpl]

==Survival==

Due to increased fear of these spiders prompted by greater public awareness of their presence in recent years, extermination of domestic brown recluses is performed frequently in the lower midwestern United States. Brown recluse spiders possess a variety of adaptive abilities, including the abilities to maintain homeostasis for several seasons with no food or water and to survive after losing limbs.[tpl]cite journal|title=Brown Recluse Spiders: A Review of Biology, Life History and Pest Management|author=Sandidge, J.S. and Hopwood, J.L.|journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science|volume=108|issue=3/4|year=2005|pages=99–108|jstor=20058665|doi=10.1660/0022-8443(2005)1080099:BRSARO2.0.CO;2|issn=0022-8443[/tpl] Additionally, these spiders survive significantly longer in a relatively cool, thermally stable environment.[tpl]cite journal|title=Observations on the Longevity of the Brown Recluse Spider, Loxosceles reclusa Gertsch & Mulaik|author=Elzinga, R.J.|journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|volume=50|issue=2|year=1977|pages=187–8|jstor=25082920|authorlink=R.J.

Brown recluses' abilities to survive starvation and thirst, and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations, make extermination of this species particularly challenging. Many chemicals that have proven effective have now been made illegal or restricted in the U.S., making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical. Chemicals that do not kill the spider may cause disruption to its nervous system or other systems, inducing undesirable aggressive behavior.
