[[Vi veri universum vivus vici]]

CATEGORIES: Latin quotations, Latin words and phrases, Faust

Vi veri universum vivus vici (also written as "'Vi veri veniversum vivus vici'") is a Latin phrase meaning: "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe".
The English occultist Aleister Crowley took this phrase as his magickal motto as a "Magister Templi," (or so much He disclosed to the Exempt Adepts.)"The Vision and the Voice", Aleister Crowley
The phrase has been made popular as a result of the movie version of the graphic novel V for Vendetta. In the graphic novel, the initials "V.V.V.V.V." appear embossed in an arch of V's hideout the "Shadow Gallery" â€” the character of "V" explains that these stand for the phrase Vi veri veniversum vivus vici."V for Vendetta", Alan Moore and David Lloyd, page 43 In the film, this phrase appears instead on a mirror, also inside V's Shadow Gallery. (In addition to prominently featuring the letter 'V', the phrase contains five words, which in Roman numerals is represented as 'V'). While the film attributes the quotation to the work Faust (without stating more specifically which version of Faust),Clip from the film version of "V for Vendetta" the graphic novel attributes the phrase to "a German gentleman named Dr. John Faust"."V for Vendetta", Alan Moore and David Lloyd, vol. 2 of 10, page 11
As a result of the claim in the film, this quote is often incorrectly attributed to Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, or to Goethe's Faust. However, no use of the phrase appears in either work, as the true origin of the term is from the privately published German work, Das Erotische in Goethes Faust und die Tantriks.
