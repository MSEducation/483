==History==

===Formation, planning and construction===

In 1958 the Michigan Legislature commissioned a study that demonstrated a need for a four-year college in the Grand Rapids area, Michigan's second largest metropolitan region. Local businessman Bill Seidman created a committee to study the report and spearhead the planning and promotion to create such an institution. In the following year the Michigan Legislature established the college. A naming contest was held, and out of 2500 submissions, "Grand Valley State College" was chosen. Private donations, including $350,000 to purchase land and $1,000,000 for construction, were secured from 5,000 individuals, organizations, and business throughout West Michigan. In 1961, the Grand Valley State College Board of Control chose a [tpl]convert|876|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] site in Ottawa County near the Grand River for the new campus, and construction of academic buildings began the following year.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/05/bill_seidman_remembered_as_man.html|title=Bill Seidman remembered as man who embraced family, education, banking and his Grand Rapids roots|date=May 14, 2009|publisher=The Grand Rapids Press|accessdate=5 January 2010|location=Grand Rapids, MI[/tpl]

===Early years===

Grand Valley State College accepted its first class of 225 students in 1963 and held its first graduation of 138 students on June 18, 1967. The middle-late 1960s saw the addition of the first dormitories and construction of new academic buildings, including the Zumberge Library, named for the university's first president, James Zumberge.
In 1969, the Grand Valley Lanthorn printed an issue containing several vulgarities and obscenities. After complaints from some at Grand Valley State College and the surrounding communities, the Ottawa County, Michigan, sheriff arrested the editor, and the prosecutor closed down the newspaper office. The university, then a co-ed college, sued the sheriff and prosecutor for closing the Lanthorn offices. Eventually, Michigan's Attorney General settled the case out of court, ruling in favor of Grand Valley State College.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gvsu.edu/anniversary/history-colleges-history-1964-1969--26.htm|title=IV. The Arrival of Arend Lubbers|publisher=Grand Valley State University|accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl]
During the 1970s Grand Valley used a multiple college concept: "College of Arts and Sciences," "Thomas Jefferson College," "William James College," "Seidman College of Business," and "College IV." Former Michigan Governor William Milliken signed into law for the name to be changed to Grand Valley State Colleges in 1973. However the "s" was dropped and the name was reverted to Grand Valley State College in 1983 when the academic programs were reorganized into divisions.

===Continued growth===

In 1987 the Michigan Legislature passed a law renaming the college to "Grand Valley State University."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-390-861|title=Act 21 of 1963|publisher=2009 Legislative Council, State of Michigan|accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] The 1980s and 1990s saw addition of satellite campuses or centers in downtown Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Holland and Traverse City. In 2004, the Board of Control reorganized the University structure again into a college system consisting of College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Interdisciplinary Studies, College of Community and Public Service, College of Education, College of Health Professions, Kirkhof College of Nursing, Seidman College of Business, and Seymour and Esther Padnos College of Engineering and Computing. The fall semester of 2010 began a year-long celebration of the university's first 50 years of history and change. Grand Valley completed its first 50 years with a comprehensive campaign that raised almost $100 million from over 17,000 donors, making it the university's largest campaign to date. Money raised from the campaign has helped fund many new construction projects on campus, including the Mary Idema Pew Library and L. William Seidman Center.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mibiz.com/news/education/18162-gvsu-announces-totals-for-record-setting-campaign.html|title=GVSU Announces Totals for Record Setting Campaign|publisher=Michigan Business News and Information|accessdate=12 October 2011[/tpl]
