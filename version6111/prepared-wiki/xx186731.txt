Rho GTPase activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) also known as GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal Adhesion Kinase (GRAF) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARHGAP26 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ARHGAP26 Rho GTPase activating protein 26| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=23092| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hildebrand JD, Taylor JM, Parsons JT | title = An SH3 domain-containing GTPase-activating protein for Rho and Cdc42 associates with focal adhesion kinase | journal = Mol.

==Function==

GRAF is a multidomain protein that is necessary for the CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway,[tpl]cite journal | author = Lundmark R, Doherty GJ, Howes MT, Cortese K, Vallis Y, Parton RG, McMahon HT | title = The GTPase-Activating Protein GRAF1 Regulates the CLIC/GEEC Endocytic Pathway | journal = Curr. Biol. | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | pages = 1802–8 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 19036340 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.10.044 | url = | pmc = 2726289 [/tpl] the most prevalent clathrin-independent endocytic pathway discovered to date.  By virtue of an N-terminal BAR domain, GRAF1 sculpts the endocytic membranes of this pathway into 40 nm diameter tubules and vesicles that allow uptake of extracellular fluid, GPI-linked proteins and certain bacterial exotoxins into cells.  The role of dynamin in the CLIC/GEEC pathway is controversial, but GRAF1 interacts strongly with this protein and acute inhibition of dynamin action abrogates CLIC/GEEC endocytosis.  There are several members of the GRAF family of proteins, including GRAF2, GRAF3, and oligophrenin, all of which likely playing similar roles during clathrin-independent endocytic events.  Mutations of both GRAF1 and oligophrenin are strongly implicated in causing human disease (leukaemia and mental retardation, respectively).

==Interactions==

ARHGAP26 has been shown to interact with PKN3.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shibata H, Oishi K, Yamagiwa A, Matsumoto M, Mukai H, Ono Y | title = PKNbeta interacts with the SH3 domains of Graf and a novel Graf related protein, Graf2, which are GTPase activating proteins for Rho family | journal = J.
