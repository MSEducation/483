[[Pisang Island]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of Johor

Pulau Pisang ([tpl]lang-en|Banana Island[/tpl]) is a small island situated off the western coast of the Malaysian state of Johor.
The island, which is about 12 kilometres from the town of Pontian Kechil and 5 kilometres from Benut town, is the site of the Pulau Pisang Light, a lighthouse guiding ships into the western entrance of the busy Singapore Strait. The lighthouse is currently operated by Singapore, and whilst the republic has publicly announced recognition that the island is Malaysian, the recent International Court of Justice decision in favour of Singapore over Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu Puteh) dispute have given rise to fears that Singapore may one day lay claim to Pulau Pisang as well.Pulau Pisang won't be another Batu Puteh
