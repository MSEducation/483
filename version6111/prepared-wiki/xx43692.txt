[[Hastings, New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Hastings, New Zealand, Populated places in the Hawke's Bay Region

The city of Hastings is one of two major urban areas in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island of New Zealand. Hastings city is the administrative centre of the Hastings District. Hastings is some 20 km inland from the neighbouring port city of Napier.
Less than twenty kilometres separate the centres of Hastings and Napier, and as such the two are often grouped together as "The Twin Cities" or "The Bay Cities", and are increasingly treated together in official statistics. Their combined population is [tpl]NZ population data|Napier-Hastings|y[/tpl], making the combined urban area the fifth-largest by population in New Zealand, between Hamilton ([tpl]NZ population data|Hamilton|y[/tpl]) and Tauranga ([tpl]NZ population data|Tauranga|y[/tpl]).
The principal settlements in the Hastings District are the city of Hastings itself and the nearby towns of Flaxmere and Havelock North. These main centres are surrounded by thirty-eight rural settlements, including Clive, Haumoana and Bridge Pā. Hastings District covers an area of [tpl]convert|5229|km2|sqmi[/tpl] and has [tpl]Decimals|[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Hastings District|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl]/[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|New Zealand|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl]*100|1[/tpl] % of the population of New Zealand, ranking it fourteenth in size out of the seventy-four territorial authorities. Since the merger of the surrounding and satellite settlements, Hastings District Council has grown to become part of the two large urban areas in Hawke's Bay.
The Hastings district has a long history of a food producing region, and is commonly referred to as the 'Fruit Bowl of New Zealand'. The fertile plains surrounding the city have grow an abundance of stone fruit, vegetables, and more recently has become the base of New Zealand's red wine industry. Associated business included food processing, agricultural services, rural finance, and freight. Hastings also is the major service centre for the surrounding inland pastoral communities while the service industry and tourism is growing rapidly.

==History==

===Māori history===

Near the fourteenth century AD, Māori arrived in Heretaunga or Hawke's Bay, settling in the river valleys and along the coast where food was plentiful. It is believed that Maori came to Heretaunga by canoe, travelling down the coast from the north, landing at Wairoa, Portland Island, the Ahuriri Lagoon at Westshore, and at Waimarama. Their culture flourished, along with gradual deforestation of the land, making this one of the few regions of New Zealand where sheep could be brought in without felling the bush first. In the sixteenth century, Taraia, great-grandson of the great and prolific chief Kahungunu, established the large tribe of Ngāti Kahungunu, which eventually colonised the eastern side of the North Island from Poverty Bay to Wairarapa. They were one of the first Māori tribes to come in contact with European settlers.

===European settlers' history===

The Māori owners leased approximately seventy square kilometres on the Heretaunga Plains to Thomas Tanner in 1867; Tanner had been trying to purchase the land since 1864. In 1870, twelve people, known as the "12 apostles", formed a syndicate to purchase the land for around £1 10s an acre (£371 per km²). Many local people firmly believe that Hastings was originally named Hicksville, after Francis Hicks, who bought a [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] block of land, which now contains the centre of Hastings, from Thomas Tanner. However, this story is apocryphal. The original name of the location which was to become the town centre was Karamu.
In 1871, the New Zealand Government decided to route the new railway south of Napier through a notional Karamu junction in the centre of the Heretaunga Plains. This location was on Francis Hicks's land. The decision on the railway route was based largely on two reports by Charles Weber, the provincial engineer and surveyor in charge of the railway. Karamu junction was renamed Hastings in 1873. (On 7 June 1873, the Hawke's Bay Herald reported: "The name of the new town is to be Hastings. We hear it now for the first time.") Exactly who chose the name has been disputed, although Thomas Tanner claimed that it was him (see Hawke's Bay Herald report 1 February 1884) and that the choice was inspired by his reading the trial of Warren Hastings. In any event, the name fitted well with other place names in the district (Napier, Havelock and Clive), which were also named after prominent figures in the history of British India.[tpl]sfn|Boyd|1984|pp=16–21[/tpl] In 1874, the first train took the twelve-mile (19 km) trip from Napier to Hastings, opening up Hastings as an export centre, through Port Ahuriri. A big jump in the local economy occurred when Edward Newbigin opened a brewery in 1881. By the next year, there were 195 freeholders of land in the town and with around six hundred people, the town was incorporated as a borough on 20 October 1886.
Hastings first received power in 1912,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hawkesbaytoday.co.nz/news/drive-to-provide-electricity/1519903/ |title=Historic HB: Drive to provide electricity |work=Hawke's Bay Today |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012[/tpl] followed by Napier in 1913.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=604 |title=Napier Physical Development History |work=Napier City Council |year=2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012[/tpl]
In 1918, nearly 300 people died of a flu epidemic that swept Hawke's Bay.

===1931 earthquake===

On 3 February 1931, at 10:47 am, most of Hastings (and nearby Napier) was levelled by an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale. In Hastings city ground subsidence of 1m occurred. The collapses of buildings and the ensuing fires killed 258 people (93 in Hastings). The centre of the town was destroyed by the earthquake, and was subsequently rebuilt in the Art Deco and Spanish Mission styles, both popular at that time. Although Hastings did not suffer the crippling fires that Napier did, most deaths were attributed to collapsing buildings, namely Roaches' Department Store in Heretaunga Street where 17 people perished.History Napier and Taradale – Napier City – Hawke's Bay – New Zealand

===Modern history===

During World War II, Allied troops were billeted at the Army, Navy and Air Force (ANA) Club, and in private homes. One hundred and fifty members belonging to sixteen different local clubs packed supplies to be sent to allied soldiers. In 1954, Hastings was the first city in New Zealand to introduce fluoridation of its water supply.http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/AB32B58A8D61D9DACC256F47007C32BB The intention was to compare the effect on tooth decay with that in the unfluoridated city of Napier over a ten-year period. The study was criticised for its methodology and results, and remains controversial. http://www.fannz.org.nz/text/potted_history_nz.htm
On 10 September 1960, the Hastings Blossom Parade (at the time a significant national event) was cancelled at 11 am for the first time in its history due to rain. Parade attendees drank in bars for several hours and when, subsequently, an 'impromptu' parade began at 2 pm, a riot started as police tried to arrest those intoxicated in public. This was a great social event in New Zealand with modern youth rebellion culture being labelled antisocial, and was subsequently much publicised with the national election later that year.
Hastings grew rapidly throughout the 1960s and 1970s (Hastings at this time was the fastest growing city in New Zealand), and there was a major issue dealing with encroachment of suburban expansion on highly productive land. Flaxmere was established as a satellite town to absorb rapid growth and was built upon the stony arid soils of the abandoned course of the Ngaruroro River. Although the land seemed worthless back then, it has subsequently proved highly valued for grape growing, and now is a prized region of red wine varietals in the world-famous Gimblett Gravels wine-growing region. Starting with economic decline nationally in the late 1970s, coupled with agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s, Hastings went into deep recession with high unemployment and low economic growth. It was not until the late 1990s that the economy of Hastings began to turn around.
During the 1989 local government reforms Hastings City was amalgamated with Havelock North Borough and Hawke's Bay County to form the modern Hastings District. The County Council offices in Napier were closed and new Hastings District Council offices were located in Hastings on two sites. The Napier City boundary was expanded to include Bay View and Meeanee. However, unlike largely urban Napier (population density 540.0 per km2), much of the Hastings District is rural and sparsely populated (population density 14.0 per km2), and the two local authorities serve a similar population; the Hastings District has approximately [tpl]NZ population data|Hastings District |y|y|y|(|)[/tpl] residents. Because of their proximity to each other and their relatively small populations, Napier and Hastings are often seen as possible candidates for further amalgamation. This has already been attempted with the 1999 Amalgamation Referendum where 75% of Napier residents opposed, and 64% of Hastings residents approved. There has been a slight trend towards greater approval since however.
At 11.25 pm on 25 August 2008, the city was hit by an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale. The epicenter was based only 10 km south of the city, near Mt Erin at a depth of 32 km. The earthquake caused minor damage to shops, where stock was shaken off shelves. Minor power outages were also reported. This was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region since the 5.6 Napier/Taradale earthquake in 1980.
In 2010, the city, together with New Plymouth became one of the two walking and cycling "model communities", qualifying for further co-funding by the national government to improve its walking paths and cycleways, and encourage people to use active forms of transport.[tpl]cite news|title=Bay cycling's 'without equal'|url=http://www.hawkesbaytoday.co.nz/local/news/bay-cyclings-without-equal/3929420/|accessdate=12 November 2010|newspaper=Hawke's Bay Today|date=10 November 2010[/tpl]
In 2011, Hastings hosted the Hawke's Bay Chatter Ring Reunion.Chatter Rings return to Hawke's Bay

==Commerce and Industry==

Hastings District, as one of the largest apple, pear and stone fruit producing areas in New Zealand, has an important relationship with the Napier Port. It has also become an important grape growing and wine production area with the fruit passing from the growers around Metropolitan Hastings and then to Napier for exporting. Napier is an important service centre for the agriculture and pastoral output of the predominantly rural Hastings District. Shopping is heavily weighted by large format retail in Hastings City, whereas in contrast, Havelock North, Taradale and central Napier retail areas have a more vibrant boutique flavour.

===Redevelopment===

By the end of the twentieth century, Hastings was declining, suffering economic downturn with industries and freezing works closing due to the agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s. However, after multi-million dollar regeneration projects and the employment of artists, Hastings has seen a change in its aesthetics. A CBD strategy was enforced to revitalise the central retail core, while promoting Havelock North as a 'luxury boutique' destination. The strategy was successful and Hastings vacancy rates ended up lower by 2005. The current goal of the council is to continue developing Hastings CBD to attract more recognised national chains. Attracting more cafes and entertainment venues is currently active in the Eastern blocks of Heretaunga St.
A controversial idea by the Hastings District Council is to relocate the Nelson Park sports ground to a new facility on the edge of the Hastings urban area to make way for a large megacentre, also known as 'Large Format Stores'. A comprehensive study was conducted before the sale concluding that retaining big box development within the CBD will help boutique stores prosper as opposed to locating the development on a greenfield site. Charter Hall, the developers behind 'Home HQ Hawkes Bay', have confirmed as of August 2010, the major anchors of the development will be Hawkes Bay's largest 'The Warehouse' and the relocation of the cities' Mitre 10 Mega. The new sports park is proposed as a regional facility and includes a velodrome, all-weather athletics track and sports grounds for most other sporting codes represented in NZ sport.

===Tourism===

Hastings District is quite historic and is very welcoming of tourists, and features a tourism industry based on 'lifestyle' activities rather than attractions. The majority of tourists are domestic, usually 'weekenders' from Auckland or Wellington. Scheduled airline services to Hawke's Bay operate through Hawke's Bay Airport, though Hastings Aerodrome is available for private planes is nearby.
Hastings' largest draw card is the wine and food trail established around the productive hinterland. There are over 75 wineries in the surrounding area, including New Zealand's oldest winery restaurant (Vidal Estate). Boutique food industries are becoming popular with cheese, fine meats, and locally produced delicacies seen on display at the Hawkes Bay Farmer's Market (New Zealand's oldest and largest weekly farmer's market). Outdoor leisure activities dominate, with beaches, river, mountain biking, tramping, and golf, being popular. In summer, many large scale events attract domestic tourists including the Spring Racing Carnival, The Blossom Parade, Harvest Hawkes Bay Weekend, and various concerts and events usually held at wineries. The Blossom Festival was once a large national event in the mid 20th century, with charter trains from Wellington and Auckland coming for the event. This however has slowly declined in popularity.
Hastings' specialist attractions include: Hawke's Bay's largest amusement park, a water park called 'Splash Planet', which replaced 'Fantasyland' near the turn of the millennium, Cape Kidnappers (the world's largest mainland gannet colony), Te Mata Peak, and access to an abundance of nature reserves and mountain treks. Architecturally speaking, Hastings suffered similar to Napier in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. However, because of the lesser damage by fire, Hastings maintained more pre earthquake buildings. Both towns gained a legacy from the disaster by rebuilding in the then-fashionable and highly distinctive Art Deco style, similar to that of Miami, FL, USA. Hastings also processes a large percentage of Spanish Mission architecture (popular as with Art Deco in the early 1930s). Sadly, Hastings succumbed to rapid redevelopment in the 1960s–70s which saw many 1930s buildings replaced.

====Horse of the Year show====

Hawkes Bay A&P Showgrounds in Hastings is the home to the annual NZ Horse of the year show, held in March. It is one of the biggest sporting events in the southern hemisphere, and attracts 2500 horse and rider combinations competing in 19 disciplines including Dressage, Showhunter, Eventing, Showjumping and polocrosse and many breed classes to name a few. It has a budget of around $NZD3million, and attracts over 70,000 visitors from over NZ and internationally over the 5-day show.

==Geography==

Located on New Zealand's east coast, to the east of the Central Plateau and the rain shadow of the Kaweka Ranges, Hastings is situated on the fertile alluvial Heretaunga Plains. The plains were originally covered in swamp and mangroves, but have since been drained for agriculture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] The local area is very productive, with orchards, farms and vineyards, and lies upon New Zealand's second most economically valuable aquifer.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentPage12535.aspx |title=Economic value of groundwater aquifers |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Ministry of Economic Development |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629181944/http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentPage12535.aspx |archivedate=29 Jun 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl] Hastings lies roughly 250 km north-east of the nation's capital Wellington.

===Climate===

Hastings has a Warm-Maritime climate (according to Köppen climate classification). It is a common misconception that it is a Mediterranean climate, mainly due to hot summers and low annual rainfall. However, the driest month, November, has more than one third of the rainfall of the wettest month hence it is not a true Mediterranean climate. Sunshine hours rank over 2200 annually while rainfall averages less than 800 mm (31.5 in). It is one of the country's warmest annually and the hottest urban area in summer with New Zealand's highest January maximum average of 26 °C (79 °F): Alexandra has 23.5 °C (74 °F) and Christchurch 22.5 °C (73 °F). Because of its location [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] inland, the sea breeze does not tend to have the same effect on Hastings' climate as it does on Napier. It is not uncommon for the temperature to be over 35°C (95 °F) on summer days, while in winter, lows of 3.6 °C (37 °F) are frequent, and occasionally will exceed -3.5 °C (25 °F) with south-west winds.

===Demographics===

Hastings District encompasses a large area of Hawke's Bay. The Urban Area population of Hastings District is 64,700 (population density 14.0 per km2) which includes the surrounding Heretaunga Plains from Clive to Bridge Pa. The central urban area however which is specifically the population centre of Hastings, Flaxmere, and Havelock North is around 58,758 (at the 2006 census). Due to restrictions on encroachment of land, satellite suburbs have absorbed the residential expansion of the city. Hastings has grown relatively slowly over the past 150 years.The gridiron city planning system, crisscrossed by the railway line running northeast–southwest and the main southeast–northwest artery, Heretaunga Street, which also links the city with its suburban centres of Havelock North and Flaxmere.
Many Hastings residents work in the city, and the area is populated by middle-to-upper income families in the eastern suburbs and areas, and then middle-to-lower income families in other areas, especially towards Camberley and the north end of Flaxmere.
At the 2006 census, Hastings District had a population of 70,842, an increase of 3,414 people, or 5.1 percent, since the 2001 census. There were 25,557 occupied dwellings, 1,920 unoccupied dwellings, and 273 dwellings under construction.[tpl]NZ Quickstats|2000030|Hastings District[/tpl] Hastings's ethnicity was made up of (national figure in brackets): 67.0 percent European (67.6 percent), 23.8 percent Maori (14.7 percent), 2.85 percent Asian (9.2 percent), 5.1 percent Pacific Islanders (6.9 percent), 0.5 percent Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (0.9 percent), and 12.1 percent 'New Zealanders'. Hastings had an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent of people 15 years and over, compared to 5.1 percent nationally. The average annual income of all people 15 years and over in Hastings was $22,600, compared to $24,400 nationally. Of those, 45.5 percent earned under $20,000 annually, compared to 43.2 percent nationally, while 14.4 percent earned over $50,000 annually, compared to 18.0 percent nationally.

===Suburbs===

==Sister cities==

The Hastings' relationship with the Chinese city Guilin started in 1977, after a research scientist, Dr. Stuart Falconer identified a number of common areas of interest between the two cities, including horticulture and their rural-urban mix.
