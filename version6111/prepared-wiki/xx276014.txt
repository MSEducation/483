[[Spiegelbach]]

The Spiegelbach is a river in the southern Palatinate.  It arises as a diversion of the Queich, which rises in the Palatinate forest, and thus has no separate source.  It flows into the Rhine at Sondernheim.
After a devastating flood in 1745, in which the mills on the Altbach and Brühlgraben were flooded, it was decided to create a diversion from the Queich towards Bellheim, in order to provide the newly built mills with a steady supply of water.  From the weir on the boundary of the districts Ottersheim and Knittelsheim, the Spiegelbach flows 9.2 km before reaching the Old Rhine at Sondernheim.
