The principal deity temple of Shiva has a 5 feet diameter by 5 feet tall Shiva Linga. Within the holy enclosure of the Kopineshwar temple are six small temple shrines dedicated to Brahma Dev, Rama, Maruti, Shitala Devi (Thatakai), Uttareshwar (Kashi Viswalingeswar) and Kalika Devi. Opposite to the shrine of Kalika Devi is another shrine dedicated to Gayatri Devi. Many of these shrine temples as still picturesque and still maintain the old red roof tile and wooden structure. The entire temple complex is quite & peaceful unlike the busy Thane station road surroundings.
As Thane is rightly known as the City of Lakes & as per Vaastu principles that the Canals, lakes, rivers are best if they are in north or east of the house/Temple - this ancient temple was also nestled on the banks of the Masunda Lake popularly known as Talao Pali. But a Municipal garden & road now running next to the Temple Complex reclaimed the land from the lake thus separating the lake.
