[[Self-ionization of water]]

CATEGORIES: Water chemistry, Equilibrium chemistry, Acid-base chemistry

The self-ionization of water (also autoionization of water, and autodissociation of water) is an ionization reaction in pure water or an aqueous solution, in which a water molecule, H2O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus of one of its hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH−. The hydrogen nucleus, H+, immediately protonates another water molecule to form hydronium, H3O+. It is an example of autoprotolysis, and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.

==Equilibrium constant==

Chemically pure water has an electrical conductivity of 0.055 µS∙cm−1. According to the theories of Svante Arrhenius, this must be due to the presence of ions. The ions are produced by the self-ionization reaction
This equilibrium applies to pure water and any aqueous solution.
Approximating activities by concentrations, the chemical equilibrium constant, Keq, for this reaction is given by:
If the concentration of dissolved solutes is low, the concentration H2O can be taken as being constant at c. 55.5M.McMurry, John. (2004) Organic Chemistry, p. 44
Expressed with activities [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl], instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the water ionization reaction is:
which is numerically equal to the more traditional thermodynamic equilibrium constant written as:
under the assumption that the sum of the chemical potentials of H+ and H3O+ is formally equal to twice the chemical potential of H2O at the same temperature and pressure."Release on the Ionization Constant of H2O" The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, Lucerne, Switzerland, August 2007.
In infinitely dilute aqueous solution, the activity of water solvent is unity.
The ionization constant, dissociation constant, self-ionization constant, or ionic product of water, symbolized by Kw may be given by:
where H3O+ is the concentration of hydrogen or hydronium ion, and OH− is the concentration of hydroxide ion.
The ionic product of water can be also expressed on activity basis as:IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson.

At 25 °C Kw is equal to [tpl]val|1.0|e=-14[/tpl].

==Dependence on temperature, pressure and ionic strength==

The dependence of the water ionization on temperature and pressure has been investigated thoroughly.International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) The value of pKw decreases as temperature increases from the melting point of ice to a minimum at c. 250 °C, after which it increases up to the critical point of water c. 374 °C. It  decreases with increasing pressure.
With electrolyte solutions, the value of pKw is dependent on ionic strength of the electrolyte. Values for sodium chloride are typical for a 1:1 electrolyte. With 1:2 electrolytes, MX2, pKw decreases with increasing ionic strength.[tpl]cite book|last1=Harned|first1=H.S. |last2=Owen, |first2=B.B. |title=The Physical Chemistry of Electrolytic Solutions|edition=£rd.|year=1958|publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corp., |location=New York|pages=634–649, 752–754[/tpl]
The value of Kw is usually of interest in the liquid phase. Example values for superheated steam (gas) and supercritical water fluid are given in the table.

==Isotope effects==

Heavy water, D2O, self-ionizes less than normal water, H2O; 
This is attributed to oxygen forming a slightly stronger bond to deuterium because the larger mass of deuterium difference results in a lower zero-point energy, a quantum mechanical effect.
The dissociation constant and the ionic product of heavy water is given by:

===Ionization equilibria in water - heavy water mixtures===

In water - heavy water mixtures equilibria several species are involved:H2O, HDO, D2O, H3O+, D3O+, H2DO+, HD2O+, HO-, DO-.

==Mechanism==

The rate of reaction for the dissociation 
depends on the activation energy, ΔE‡. According to the Boltzmann distribution the proportion of water molecules that have sufficient energy, due to thermal population, is given by
where [tpl]mvar|k[/tpl] is the Boltzmann constant. Thus some dissociation can occur because sufficient thermal energy is available. The following sequence of events has been proposed on the basis of electric field fluctuations in liquid water.[tpl]cite journal | author = Geissler, P. L.; Dellago, C.; Chandler, D.; Hutter, J.; Parrinello, M. | year = 2001 | title = Autoionization in liquid water | journal = Science | volume = 291 | pages = 2121–2124 | doi = 10.1126/science.1056991 | pmid = 11251111 | issue = 5511|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.2121G [/tpl] Random fluctuations in molecular motions occasionally (about once every 10 hours per water molecule[tpl]cite journal | author = Eigen, M.; de Maeyer, L. | year = 1955 | title = Untersuchungen über die Kinetik der Neutralisation I | journal = Z. Elektrochem. | volume = 59 | pages = 986[/tpl]) produce an electric field strong enough to break an oxygen–hydrogen bond, resulting in a hydroxide (OH−) and hydronium ion (H3O+); the hydrogen nucleus of the hydronium ion travels along water molecules by the Grotthuss mechanism and a change in the hydrogen bond network in the solvent isolates the two ions, which are stabilized by solvation. Within 1 picosecond, however, a second reorganization of the hydrogen bond network allows rapid proton transfer down the electric potential difference and subsequent recombination of the ions. This timescale is consistent with the time it takes for hydrogen bonds to reorientate themselves in water.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stillinger, F. H. | year = 1975 | journal = Adv. Chem.

==Relationship with the neutral point of water==

Water molecules dissociate into equal amounts of H3O+ and OH−, so their concentrations are equal to [tpl]val|1.00|e=-7|u=mol∙dm−3[/tpl] at 25 °C. A solution in which the H3O+ and OH− concentrations equal each other is considered a neutral solution.  In general, the pH of the neutral point is numerically equal to pKw/2.
Pure water is neutral, but most water samples contain impurities. If an impurity is an acid or base this will affect the concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion. Water samples which are exposed to air will absorb the acid carbon dioxide and the concentration of H3O+ will increase. The concentration of OH− will decrease in such a way that the product H3O+OH− remains constant for fixed temperature and pressure.
