Uptown Village at Cedar Hill is a [tpl]convert|725000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] open-air regional shopping mall in Cedar Hill, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. It is located at FM 1382 and U.S. Highway 67 adjacent to Uptown Boulevard and Pleasant Run Road.
Uptown Village opened on March 12, 2008, becoming the first mall to open in the suburban region known as the Best Southwest, which includes the cities of Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville, and Lancaster. Prior to its opening, there was only one mall in the southern portion of Dallas County – Southwest Center Mall (formerly Red Bird Mall) in the Red Bird neighborhood of Dallas.
Unlike a traditional mall, Uptown Village was designed in the new urbanism style. Other shopping centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with this similar design include the Firewheel Town Center in Garland, Southlake Town Center in Southlake, and The Shops at Legacy in Plano.
