It is defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm:
The numerical value of the Euler–Mascheroni constant, to 50 decimal places, is

==Appearances==

The Euler–Mascheroni constant appears, among other places, in the following ('*' means that this entry contains an explicit equation):
For more information of this nature, see Gourdon and Sebah (2004).

===Relation to gamma function===

This is equal to the limits:
Further limit results are (Krämer, 2005):
A limit related to the beta function (expressed in terms of gamma functions) is

===Relation to the zeta function===

Other series related to the zeta function include:
The error term in the last equation is a rapidly decreasing function of n. As a result, the formula is well-suited for efficient computation of the constant to high precision.
Other interesting limits equaling the Euler–Mascheroni constant are the antisymmetric limit (Sondow, 1998)
and de la Vallée-Poussin's formula
Closely related to this is the rational zeta series expression. By peeling off the first few terms of the series above, one obtains an estimate for the classical series limit:
where ζ(s,k) is the Hurwitz zeta function. The sum in this equation involves the harmonic numbers, Hn. Expanding some of the terms in the Hurwitz zeta function gives:

===Integrals===

An interesting comparison by J. Sondow (2005) is the double integral and alternating series
The two constants are also related by the pair of series (see Sondow 2005 #2)
where N1(n) and N0(n) are the number of 1's and 0's, respectively, in the base 2 expansion of n.
We have also Catalan's 1875 integral (see Sondow and Zudilin)

===Series expansions===

In 1910, Vacca found the closely related series:
In 1926 he found a second series:
From the Kummer-expansion of the gamma function we get:
Series of prime numbers:

===Asymptotic expansions===

The third formula is also called the Ramanujan expansion.

===Relations with the reciprocal logarithm===

The reciprocal logarithm function (Krämer, 2005)
Gregory coefficients are similar to Bernoulli numbers and satisfy the asymptotic relation
and the integral representation
Euler's constant has the integral representations
A very important expansion of Gregorio Fontana (1780) is:
which is convergent for all n.
Weighted sums of the Gregory coefficients give different constants:

===eγ===

This restates the third of Mertens' theorems. The numerical value of eγ is:
Other infinite products relating to eγ include:
These products result from the Barnes G-function.
We also have
where the nth factor is the (n+1)st root of
This infinite product, first discovered by Ser in 1926, was rediscovered by Sondow (2003) using hypergeometric functions.

==Generalizations==

Euler's generalized constants are given by

gives rise to the Stieltjes constants, and
gives

A two-dimensional limit generalization is the Masser–Gramain constant.
Euler-Lehmer constants are given by summation of inverses of numbers in a common

==Published digits==

Euler initially calculated the constant's value to 6 decimal places. In 1781, he calculated it to 16 decimal places. Mascheroni attempted to calculate the constant to 32 decimal places, but made errors in the 20th–22nd decimal places; starting from the 20th digit, he calculated ...1811209008239 when the correct value is ...0651209008240.
