Icehenge is a science fiction novel by American author Kim Stanley Robinson, published in 1984.
Though it was published almost ten years before Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy and takes place in a different version of the future, Icehenge contains elements which appears also in the Mars series: extreme human longevity, Martian political revolution, historical revisionism, and shifts between primary characters are all present.

==Plot==

Icehenge is set in three distinct time periods. The story shifts from a failed Martian political revolution of 2248, to an expedition to explore a mysterious monument on the north pole of Pluto three centuries later, and ultimately to a space station orbiting Saturn, home to a reclusive and wealthy woman who may hold the key to solving a mystery spanning centuries.
