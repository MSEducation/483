CATEGORIES: Philippine soups

Tinola in Tagalog or Cebuano, or la uya in Ilocano is a soup-based dish served as an appetizer or main entrée in the Philippines.[tpl]cite web | title=Tinola: A Favorite Philippine Cuisine | publisher=Philippines Insider| url=http://www.philippinesinsider.com/filipino-cuisine/recipes/tinola-a-favorite-philippine-cuisine/ | accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]  Traditionally, this dish is cooked with chicken, wedges of green papaya, and leaves of the siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce. A common variant substitutes pork for chicken, chayote instead of papaya, or moringa leaves known as marungay or malunggay or kamunggay (in Cebuano), instead of pepper leaves.[tpl]cite web | title=Pork tinola| publisher=Home Cooking Rocks!| url=http://pinoycook.net/pork-tinola/ | accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]  However, an all-vegetable broth in Cebu with kamunggay in prominence is called utan kamunggay or utan bisayâ. Another variation is Tinolang Tahong, a soup made with mussels, ginger, onion, garlic and bird's eye chili.
The exact origins of Tinola is obscure. One of the earliest mentions of the dish is in José Rizal's first novel, Noli Me Tangere,where Kapitan Tiago served it to Crisostomo Ibarra upon arriving from Europe.He was given breasts,to dismay of the corrupt Spanish friar,Padre Damaso,who got chicken neck,the least favored chicken part.
