==Plot==

On May 8, 1938, the day Hitler visited Mussolini in Rome, Antonietta (Loren) stays home doing some domestic tasks while her fascist husband and six children take to the streets to follow the parade. The building is empty but for a neighbor across the complex (Mastroianni). He is a radio broadcaster who has been dismissed from his job and is about to be deported to Sardinia because of his anti-fascist stance and his homosexuality. They meet by chance and began to talk. Antonietta is surprised by his opinions and, unaware of his sexual orientation, flirts with him.
Despite their differences, they warm to each other and eventually have sex before he is arrested and her family comes back home.Review - A Special Day Channel 4.A Special Day

==Special scenes==

A number of unusual cinematic techniques are used in this film.  A long take scene introduces Antonietta and her family: the camera enters through the kitchen window and moves into the rooms. Deep focus is utilised in a scene in which the camera is in Antonietta's room with her in the frame and through a far distant window Gabriele can be seen moving in his house in the same frame.
