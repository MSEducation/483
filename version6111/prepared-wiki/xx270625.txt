The Class 92 was procured under a Malaysian Government initiative,  National Key Result Area (NKRA) to reduce congestion and improve public transport with a specific RM2 billion allocation to KTMB to improve commuter rail efficiency. A sum of RM 1.894 billion was spent to procure these trains, with the remainder being spent on the improvement of signalling along the Putra-Mid Valley stretch and a ticketing system upgrade.[tpl]cite web|last=Ministry of Transport|title=NKRA  Urban Public Transport|url=http://www.mot.gov.my/en/NKRA/Pages/NKRA.aspx|publisher=MOT|accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl] 

==Operation==

The class 92 is set to complement and replace the earlier 3 coach class 8x commuter trains. It will operate along the two komuter lines and is expected to service all 53 stations. However, the Rawang-Tanjung Malim route is usually not serviced by this coach. At certain stretches, it will operate at its service operational speed of 120 km/h. During current 15-minute frequency operations, as many as 25 class 92 sets are used while the remaining sets are kept in reserve. In the future (10-minute frequency operations), it is expected for the total maximum of concurrently used sets to increase to 36 with 2 to remain in reserve.  
During festivities, such as the "homecoming" exodus, saw class 92 sets operating intercity routes, such as the KL Sentral-Ipoh route complementing the ETS train service.

===Maintenance and Depot===

The Class 92 sets will be maintained by its manufacturer CSR Zhuzhou. The maintenance facility will be based mainly at KTM’s Sentul Komuter Depot while a minor secondary base will be located at Tanjung Malim.[tpl]cite web|title=南车株机造中国首个城际动车组4S店在吉隆坡开业|url=http://hn.rednet.cn/c/2012/02/23/2525976.htm|work=Rednet.cn|publisher=RedNet|language=Chinese|accessdate=4 March 2012|quote=the main base in Kuala Lumpur Sentul depot, sub-base is located in Perak, the Tanjong Malim[/tpl] The Batu Gajah Rail depot will continue its role as the testing place for new Class 92 sets.
On top of all that, a new special [tpl]convert|16.34|ha|acre|lk=in|sigfig=2[/tpl] commuter maintenance depot is being built (completion by Sept 2013) in the vicinity of Seremban station to house the class 92. The depot will have a capacity of stabling 19 six coach Class 92 sets and be able to conduct simultaneous maintenance work on up to 6 sets of commuter trains. The depot will also have up to 15 tracks of 6km each to store and maintain trains. The depot will also stage other Rawang-Seremban line rolling stocks.[tpl]cite web|last=Randal|first=Simon|title=Commuter train maintenance depot to built in Seremban|url=http://www.mmail.com.my/story/commuter-train-maintenance-depot-built-seremban|work=The Malay Mail|publisher=MalayMail|accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl]

==Design and Construction==

The Class 92 is designed for low dwell times and high passenger seating capacity, being built with three double leaf doors per side and having full longitudinal seating at its cab-coaches. Its middle coaches feature a mixture of longitudinal and traverse 2+2 seating. It has wide gang-ways interconnecting each coach, allowing passengers to distribute effectively throughout the length of the train. However, two middle coaches of the class 92 is designated women's only coaches by its operator KTM. Thus, limiting full interactivity within the train set. Dynamic route maps located above doors details trains position relative to station in real-time. CCTVs and 3-pin power outlets are provided as further features. Since the train is to operate in the tropics, the trains have an over-head air-conditioning systems, to provide ventilation, dehumidification and comfortable temperature control.
The exterior and interior of the class 92 is fully designed in Germany by Tricon Design AG for CSR Zhuzhou.Featuring a Malaysian tiger inspired front motif and tiger fur side coating. It was then assembled in CSR Zhuzhou's Electric Plant train factory in China. While power traction units and other electrical systems were built by Siemens subsidiaries in China. Certain niche components were made in Siemens factories in Germany.[tpl]cite web|last=Miabo|first=Nikolai|title=Quick arrival in the Klang Valley|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/quick-arrival-in-the-klang-valley.html|work=RailwayGazette|publisher=Railway Gazette International|accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl]

==Corruption Investigation==

The purchase of the KTM class 92 was notably under investigation by the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) over its tender process. In 2008, the Chinese railway manufacturer Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co Ltd, being the lowest bidder, was originally awarded the tender to build 3 car sets at the cost of RM 13.7 million. This figure later increased to RM 48 million per 6 car set. According to the details revealed to the press about the investigation, the re-negotiation process was held directly with the manufacturer and there was certain irregularities in pricing. The investigation is still on-going.[tpl]cite news|last=Charles, Lourdes|title=MACC probes purchase of Electric Multiple Units|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/8/6/nation/6810125&sec=nation|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=The Star Online|date=6 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Dzhulkefly|first=Ahmad|title=PAC wants MACC to investigate purchase of KTMB trains.|url=http://blog.drdzul.com/2010/08/04/pac-wants-macc-to-investigate-purchase-of-ktmb-trains/|accessdate=8 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Maria|first=Stephannie|title=EMU train ready, MACC still lingering|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/18/emu-train-ready-macc-still-lingering/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Free Malaysia Today|date=18 July 2011[/tpl] 
This is not the only set of irregularities in railway procurement occurring in Malaysia. In 2009, the Malaysian Ministry of Transport was under investigation over the purchase of used diesel multiple units. Following the investigation and general consensus at parliament at the time. The purchase of used these diesel multiple units was eventually canceled.[tpl]cite news|title=SPRM diminta siasat pembelian tren komuter|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2009&dt=1110&pub=Utusan_Malaysia&sec=Terkini&pg=bt_70.htm|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=10 November 2009|language=Malay[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Purchase Of DMU Trains Questionable, MACC Asked To Probe|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v6/newsgeneral.php?id=454123|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Bernama|date=10 November 2009[/tpl]

==Operational Issues==

There has been a number of issues related to the Class 92. In a comment by KTMB's incumbent president, Elias Kadir has noted that the class 92 is "not up to standard".[tpl]cite web|last=Kauer|first=Shauren|title=KTMB's revival on shaky tracks?|url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/20120802001831/Article/index_html#ixzz22JrbYdtP|work=BusinessTimes|publisher=btimes.com.my|accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl] In other related incidents, in which Class 92 sets malfunctioned was due reportedly to poor maintenance and non-payment to suppliers.

==Vandalism==

Immediately, following its launch a number of KTM Class 92 were intentionally damaged, at least 20 side windows are cracked or holed, due a number of stone throwing incidents. [tpl]cite web|last=Ismail|first=Azizul|title=More Komuter trains by July and less waiting time|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/335871|work=The Sun|publisher=thesundaily.my|accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl] This has culminated in a number of media reports. Despite the incidents, KTMB has no intention of installing shatter proof glass[tpl]cite web|last=Kaos|first=Joseph|title=New trains vandalised|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/7/4/nation/11599820&sec=nation|work=The Star Online|publisher=The Star|accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl]  to counter these incident. This implies that the glasses used are not shatter proof and poses a certain danger to commuters traveling on the SCS.
