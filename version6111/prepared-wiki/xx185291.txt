WGCY is one of the few remaining commercial radio stations in North America to feature the Beautiful Music format, consisting chiefly of a mix of instrumental covers of pop songs and soft vocals (including softer Top 40 oldies, standards, and album cuts by MOR artists). In addition to its easy listening music, WGCY features frequent local newscasts, farm reports, and sports play-by-play and hourly newscasts from CBS Radio. 
The station expanded its broadcast schedule to 24 hours a day in the early 2000s after having signed off at night since it began broadcasting. Popular on-air features include local high school sports, Radiofied Ads (a Tradio-type feature), 'and The Tom Benefiel Show (big band, jazz, swing, and 1940s and 1950s oldies) Friday nights. WGCY broadcasts the Chicago Bears, and the Super Bowl and the NCAA Final Four from Westwood One..

In April 2011, station owner Gary McCullough was recognized by the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association as a hall of fame member due to his long career of broadcasting high school basketball games.
