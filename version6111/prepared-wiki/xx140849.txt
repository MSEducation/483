==History==

The station started in 1947 as KCNC (which is now used by the CBS operated-and-owned TV station). The station changed its call letters to KJIM in 1957, airing a beautiful music format inspired by Dallas' KIXL-AM/FM, which evolved into an MOR format in the early 1970s.  In 1975 KJIM adopted a country music format.
In 1984, the station dropped the KJIM call letters and the country music format and began using the call letters KFJZ with a Standards music format. The call letters KFJZ had been used in Fort Worth for 40 years on the frequency of 1270 AM. 
In 1986, KAAM has picked up their previous format so that KFJZ could switch to Spanish music and was branded Super Tejano 870. Two years later, AM 870 switched to a Catholic-religion format under the Spanish language. KFJZ filed for bankruptcy in 1994, but still remains on the air, only during daytime hours due to the fact that it shares the same frequency as clear-channel station WWL-AM in New Orleans, Louisiana.
In the Summer of 2008, Garden City Broadcasting sold this station to SIGA Broadcasting. 
In year 2009, it changed formats and branding to Radio Salam Namaste (Indian Community Radio).
