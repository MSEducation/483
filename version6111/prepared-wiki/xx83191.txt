The Royal Conservatory of Music, branded as The Royal Conservatory, is a music education organization and performance venue headquartered in Toronto, Canada. It was founded in 1886 by Edward Fisher as The Toronto Conservatory of Music. In 1947, King George VI incorporated the organization through royal charter.
Its Toronto home was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995 in recognition of the institution's significant influence on music education in Canada.Royal Conservatory of Music,  Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaRoyal Conservatory of Music, National Register of Historic Places

==History==

The Conservatory was founded in 1886 as The Toronto Conservatory of Music and opened in September 1887, located on two floors above a music store at the corner of Dundas Street and Yonge Street.There's Music In These Walls By Ezra Schabas, pub. Dundurn Press Ltd, 2005 Its founder Edward Fisher was a young organist born in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001222 |title=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada: Fisher, Edward |publisher=Canadianencyclopedia.ca |date=11 September 1905 |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] The Conservatory became the first institution of its kind in Canada: a school dedicated to the training of singers and musicians, and also to instilling a love of music in young children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rcmusic.ca/ContentPage.aspx?name=RCM_History |title=History of the Royal Conservatory of Music |publisher=Rcmusic.ca |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl]
The Conservatory's initial intake was just over 100, and by its second quarter this number had grown to nearly 300 as its reputation quickly spread.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0003050 |title=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada: Royal Conservatory of Music |publisher=Canadianencyclopedia.ca |date=11 September 1905 |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] In 1897, the organization purchased a new property at College Street and University Avenue to accommodate its rapid expansion. From its earliest days it was affiliated with the University of Toronto with the purpose of preparing students for degree examinations and shared its premises with the University's Faculty of Music from 1919.
In 1906, Frank Welsman – who became the principal of The Conservatory – founded and directed the Toronto Conservatory Orchestra, which became the Toronto Symphony Orchestra two years later. In 1924, the Canadian Academy of Music merged with The Conservatory. Glenn Gould – arguably its most outstanding pupil – studied theory, organ, and piano, graduating at the age of 12 in 1946 with an ARCT diploma of the highest honours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glenngould.com |title=Glenn Gould official website: timeline |publisher=Glenngould.com |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl]
In 1947, King George VI awarded The Conservatory its royal charter in recognition of its status as one of the Commonwealth's greatest music schools. The Toronto Conservatory of Music became The Royal Conservatory of Music.
During Ettore Mazzoleni's term as principal (1945–68), The Conservatory grew rapidly. Mazzoleni had been director of the Conservatory Orchestra since 1934. Two other prominent figures who contributed to the achievements of this period were chairman of the board Edward Johnson (who served from 1947–59) and Arnold Walter, who was appointed director of the new Senior School in 1946. The Senior School offered a two-year program with professional performance training combined with related courses in theory and history. The initial success of the project gave rise to a three-year program leading to an Artist Diploma, as well as The Conservatory's Opera School (begun in 1946), which provided training in all aspects of opera production. These developments led to the creation of the Royal Conservatory Opera Company, which went on to become the Canadian Opera Company in 1959.
With space now a major problem, the University of Toronto sold the College Street property to Ontario Hydro in 1962 and The Conservatory moved to 273 Bloor Street West, the original site of McMaster University. The concert and recital halls of the College Street site were only partially replaced in the move, and the library, residence, and all three pipe organs were lost.Academic Dictionaries & Encyclopedias: Royal Conservatory of Music
The Conservatory was governed by the University of Toronto from 1963 until 1991, at which time it became a wholly independent institution again, taking control of its building and diverse music programs. Peter Simon was appointed President of The Conservatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rcmusic.ca/ContentPage.aspx?name=Peter_Simon_bio |title=The Royal Conservatory of Music: Biography of Dr Peter Simon |publisher=Rcmusic.ca |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl]
Also in 1991, the conservatory developed a master plan to renovate its historic building and expand it with the construction of new facilities on the same site. The plan was carried out by Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB) in stages, initially with the 1997 renovation of Mazzoleni Concert Hall in the historic Ihnatowycz Hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=1800?name=World_Architecture_News |title=World Architecture News 7 January 2008: Performing in Toronto |publisher=Worldarchitecturenews.com |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] The new construction is named the TELUS Centre for Performance and Learning and features academic and performance spaces; the acoustically sound, 1,135-seat Koerner concert venue; studios; classrooms; a new-media centre; a library; and a rehearsal hall.CBC 21 December 2005: Royal Conservatory revamp earns architecture award[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] During the renovations, The Conservatory temporarily moved to the former location of the Toronto District School Board's Ursula Franklin Academy in the Dufferin and Bloor West area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dufferinpark.ca/neighbourhood/nhoodarchive2005.html#rcmopen |title=Friends of Dufferin Grove Park Neighbourhood: Royal Conservatory Opens Up to Neighbourhood |publisher=Dufferinpark.ca |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt48.html |title=Croatians in Toronto |publisher=Tgmag.ca |date=10 April 1939 |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] In September 2008, The Conservatory returned to a newly renovated and expanded headquarters at 273 Bloor Street West near Avenue Road.
