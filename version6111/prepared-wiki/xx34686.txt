[[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)]]

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1868, Parliamentary constituencies in Norfolk, North Norfolk

North Norfolk is a parliamentary constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.
Formerly a safe seat for the Conservatives, it has been represented by the Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb since 2001.  This marked the first time that a Liberal aligned candidate had won a seat in Norfolk since 1929.  This was to be followed by the election of Simon Wright in Norwich South in 2010.
At the May 2005 general election the seat was one of the Conservatives' top targets as Lamb was defending a majority of just 483 against a relatively high-profile Tory, Iain Dale. However, Lamb instead increased his majority to 10,606. Although the seat had been Labour for 25 years since World War II, Labour have slumped to a distant third in recent years.
The seat often has the highest turnout of any constituency across the eastern counties in general elections at well over 70%.
North Norfolk was described by the Earl of Leicester as "the one constituency  in England where, in 1964, it was so feudal that it had to be explained to the electors that the ballot was secret."Obituary of Bert Hazell in The Independent by Tam Dalyell; 22 January 2009[tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

===Boundary review===

Following a review of parliamentary representation in Norfolk in 2007, the Boundary Commission for England created a new constituency of Broadland based on the local government district of that name. However, the boundaries of the constituency do not match the local authority, with six wards (Raynham, Wemsum, Walsingham, Astley, Fakenham South and North) now removed from the North Norfolk constituency and placed in the new Broadland seat.The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007
