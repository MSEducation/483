[[Benzothiazole]]

CATEGORIES: Benzothiazoles, Aromatic bases

Benzothiazole is an aromatic heterocyclic compound with the chemical formula [tpl]Chem|C|7|H|5|N||S[/tpl]. It is colorless, slightly viscous liquid. Although the parent compound, benzothiazole is not widely used, many of its derivatives are found in commercial products or in nature. A derivative of benzothiazole is the light-emitting component of luciferin, found in fireflies.

==Structure and preparation==

Benzothiazoles consist of a 5-membered 1,3-thiazole ring fused to a benzene ring.  The nine atoms of the bicycle and the attached substituents are coplanar. 
Benzothiazole are prepared by treatment of 2-aminobenzenethiol with acid chlorides:T. E. Gilchrist "Heterocyclic Chemistry" 3rd Edition, Longman, 1992.

==Uses==

This heterocyclic scaffold is readily substituted at the unique methyne centre in the thiazole ring.  Its a thermally stable electron-withdrawing moiety with numerous applications in dyes such as thioflavin.  Some drugs contain this group, an example being riluzole. The heterocycle is found in nature.Lucille Le Bozec, Christopher J. Moody "Naturally Occurring Nitrogen–Sulfur Compounds.
