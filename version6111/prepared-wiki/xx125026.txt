==Work==

During World War I, Kraus worked on topics in relation to war and ethics and wrote important works in the field of Public international law. 
Influenced by Brentano, Kraus developed an apriori value theory, which was formulated in opposition to marxistic value theory. He also applied this method on economics, 
Based on his ideas on law and duty he developed a juristic hermeneutics in the field of Jurisprudence, and criticized historism and positivism.
Kraus was also known for his criticism of the theory of relativity, which was according to him an accumulation of "absurdities" (like the constancy of the speed of light) and "mathematical fictions".
