Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM; [tpl]zh|t=中醫|s=中医|p=zhōng yī|l=Chinese medicine[/tpl]) is a broad range of medicine practices sharing common concepts which have been developed in China and are based on a tradition of more than 2,000 years, including various forms of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (Tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy.Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine: An Introduction
The doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon and the Treatise on Cold Damage, as well as in cosmological notions such as yin-yang and the five phases. Starting in the 1950s, these precepts were standardized in the People's Republic of China, including attempts to integrate them with modern notions of anatomy and pathology. Nonetheless, the bulk of these precepts, including the model of the body, or concept of disease, are not supported by science or evidence-based medicine. TCM is not based upon the current body of knowledge related to health care in accordance with the scientific community.
TCM's view of the body places little emphasis on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate digestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as harmonious interaction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis aims to trace symptoms to patterns of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin, and eyes, and looking at the eating and sleeping habits of the person as well as many other things.
In traditional Chinese herbal medicine, plant elements are by far the most commonly, but not solely, used substances; animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized. The effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine remains poorly documented. There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese medicinals that consist of plants, animal parts, and minerals. There is a lack of existing cost-effectiveness research for TCM. Although some TCM textbooks recommend preparations containing animal substances, little research to justify the claimed clinical efficacy of many TCM animal products have been done. Poachers hunt restricted or endangered species animals to supply the black market with TCM products. With an eye to the Chinese market, pharmaceutical companies have explored the potential for creating new drugs from traditional remedies. Successful results have however been scarce: artemisinin, for example, which is an effective treatment for malaria, was fished out of a herb traditionally used to treat fever. Although advocates have argued that research had missed some key features of TCM, such as the subtle interrelationships between ingredients, it is largely pseudoscience, with no valid mechanism of action for the majority of its treatments.

==History==

Traces of therapeutic activities in China date from the Shang dynasty (14th–11th centuries BCE).[tpl]Cite book|last=Unschuld|first=Paul U.|title=Medicine in China: A History of Ideas|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-05023-5[/tpl] Though the Shang did not have a concept of "medicine" as distinct from other fields, their oracular inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells refer to illnesses that affected the Shang royal family: eye disorders, toothaches, bloated abdomen, etc.,[tpl]Cite book|last=Peng|first=Bangjiong 彭邦炯 (ed.)|title=Jiaguwen yixue ziliao: shiwen kaobian yu yanjiu 甲骨文医学资料: 释文考辨与研究 data in the oracle bones: translations, philological analysis, and research|year=2008|publisher=Renmin weisheng chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-117-09270-8[/tpl] which Shang elites usually attributed to curses sent by their ancestors. There is no evidence that the Shang nobility used herbal remedies. According to a 2006 overview, the "Documentation of Chinese materia medica (CMM) dates back to around 1,100 BC when only dozens of drugs were first described. By the end of the 16th century, the number of drugs documented had reached close to 1,900. And by the end of the last century, published records of CMM have reached 12,800 drugs."[tpl]cite pmid | 16787890[/tpl]
Stone and bone needles found in ancient tombs led Joseph Needham to speculate that acupuncture might have been carried out in the Shang dynasty.[tpl]Cite book|last=Lu|first=Gwei-djen|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=Celestial Lancets: A History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=|isbn=978-0-700-71458-2[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Harper|first=Donald|title=Early Chinese Medical Literature: The Mawangdui Medical Manuscripts|year=1998|publisher=Kegan Paul International|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-7103-0582-4[/tpl] But most historians now make a distinction between medical lancing (or bloodletting) and acupuncture in the narrower sense of using metal needles to treat illnesses by stimulating specific points along circulation channels ("meridians") in accordance with theories related to the circulation of Qi.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Epler|first=Dean|year=1980|title=Blood-letting in Early Chinese Medicine and its Relation to the Origins of Acupuncture|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=54|issue=3|pages=337–67|pmid=6998524[/tpl] The earliest public evidence for acupuncture in this sense dates to the second or first century BCE.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Liao|first=Yuqun 廖育群|year=1991|title=Qin Han zhi ji zhenjiu liaofa lilun de jianli" 秦漢之際鍼灸療法理論的建立 formation of the theory of acumoxa therapy in the Qin and Han periods|journal=Ziran kexue yanjiu 自然科學研究 in the natural sciences|volume=10|pages=272–79[/tpl]
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon, the oldest received work of Chinese medical theory, was compiled around the first century BCE on the basis of shorter texts from different medical lineages.[tpl]Cite book|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|chapter=Huang-ti nei-ching 黃帝內經|pages=196–215|title=Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide|year=1993|publisher=Institute for East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley|location=Los Angeles and Berkeley|editor-last=Loewe|editor-first=Michael|isbn=978-1-55729-043-4[/tpl] Written in the form of dialogues between the legendary Yellow Emperor and his ministers, it offers explanations on the relation between humans, their environment, and the cosmos, on the contents of the body, on human vitality and pathology, on the symptoms of illness, and on how to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in light of all these factors. Unlike earlier texts like Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments, which was excavated in the 1970s from a tomb that had been sealed in 168 BCE, the Inner Canon rejected the influence of spirits and the use of magic. It was also one of the first books in which the cosmological doctrines of Yinyang and the Five Phases were brought to a mature synthesis.
The Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders and Miscellaneous Illnesses was collated by Zhang Zhongjing sometime between 196 and 220 CE, at the end of the Han dynasty. Focusing on drug prescriptions rather than acupuncture,[tpl]Cite book|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|title=Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China|year=1987|publisher=Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=978-0-89264-074-4[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Ergil|first=Marnae C.|last2=Ergil|first2=Kevin V.|url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=kdZ1rFKW-LEC|title=Pocket Atlas of Chinese Medicine|year=2009|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|isbn=978-3-13-141611-7[/tpl] it was the first medical work to combine Yinyang and the Five Phases with drug therapy. This formulary was also the earliest public Chinese medical text to group symptoms into clinically useful "patterns" (zheng 證) that could serve as targets for therapy. Having gone through numerous changes over time, the formulary now circulates as two distinct books: the Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders and the Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Casket, which were edited separately in the eleventh century, under the Song dynasty.[tpl]Cite book|last=Goldschmidt|first=Asaf|title=The Evolution of Chinese Medicine: Song Dynasty, 960–1200|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-415-42655-8[/tpl]
In the centuries that followed the completion of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon, several shorter books tried to summarize or systematize its contents. The Canon of Problems (probably second century CE) tried to reconcile divergent doctrines from the Inner Canon and developed a complete medical system centered on needling therapy. The AB Canon of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (Zhenjiu jiayi jing 針灸甲乙經, compiled by Huangfu Mi sometime between 256 and 282 CE) assembled a consistent body of doctrines concerning acupuncture; whereas the Canon of the Pulse (Maijing 脈經; ca. 280) presented itself as a "comprehensive handbook of diagnostics and therapy."
In 1950, Chairman Mao Zedong made a speech in support of traditional Chinese medicine which was influenced by political necessity. In 1952, the president of the Chinese Medical Association said that, "This One Medicine, will possess a basis in modern natural sciences, will have absorbed the ancient and the new, the Chinese and the foreign, all medical achievements—and will be China’s New Medicine!"[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/10/traditional_chinese_medicine_origins_mao_invented_it_but_didn_t_believe.html|title=Chairman Mao Invented Traditional Chinese Medicine|first=Alan|last=Levinovitz|publisher=Slate (magazine)|date=22 October 2013|accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]

==Philosophical background==

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on Yinyangism (i.e., the combination of Five Phases theory with Yin-yang theory),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011[/tpl] which was later absorbed by Daoism.Liu, Zheng-Cai (1999): "A Study of Daoist Acupuncture & Moxibustion" Blue Poppy Press, first edition. ISBN 978-1-891845-08-6

===Yin and yang===

Yin and yang are ancient Chinese concepts which can be traced back to the Shang dynastyMen, J. & Guo, L. (2010) "A General Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine" Science Press. ISBN 978-1-4200-9173-1 (1600–1100 BC). They represent two abstract and complementary aspects that every phenomenon in the universe can be divided into. Primordial analogies for these aspects are the sun-facing (yang) and the shady (yin) side of a hill. Two other commonly used representational allegories of yin and yang are water and fire. In the yin-yang theory, detailed attributions are made regarding the yin or yang character of things:
The concept of yin and yang is also applicable to the human body; for example, the upper part of the body and the back are assigned to yang, while the lower part of the body are believed to have the yin character. Yin and yang characterization also extends to the various body functions, and – more importantly – to disease symptoms (e.g., cold and heat sensations are assumed to be yin and yang symptoms, respectively).Wiseman, N. & Ellis, A. (1996): "Fundamentals of Chinese medicine Paradigm Publications. ISBN 978-0-912111-44-5 Thus, yin and yang of the body are seen as phenomena whose lack (or overabundance) comes with characteristic symptom combinations:
TCM also identifies drugs believed to treat these specific symptom combinations, i.e., to reinforce yin and yang.

===Five Phases theory===

Five Phases (五行, [tpl]zh|p=wǔ xíng[/tpl]), sometimes also translated as the "Five Elements" theory, presumes that all phenomena of the universe and nature can be broken down into five elemental qualities – represented by wood (木, [tpl]zh|p=mù[/tpl]), fire (火[tpl]zh|p=huǒ[/tpl]), earth (土, [tpl]zh|p=tǔ[/tpl]), metal (金, [tpl]zh|p=jīn[/tpl]), and water (水, [tpl]zh|p=shuǐ[/tpl]).Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): "Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture". Thieme Medical Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4 In this way, lines of correspondence can be drawn:
Strict rules are identified to apply to the relationships between the Five Phases in terms of sequence, of acting on each other, of counteraction etc. All these aspects of Five Phases theory constitute the basis of the zàng-fǔ concept, and thus have great influence regarding the TCM model of the body. Five Phase theory is also applied in diagnosis and therapy.
Correspondences between the body and the universe have historically not only been seen in terms of the Five Elements, but also of the "Great Numbers" (大數, [tpl]zh|p=dà shū[/tpl]) For example, the number of acu-points has at times been seen to be 365, in correspondence with the number of days in a year; and the number of main meridians – 12 – has been seen in correspondence with the number of rivers flowing through the ancient Chinese empire.[tpl]cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |ref=harv [/tpl]"There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints acu-points...

==Model of the body==

TCM's view of the human body is only marginally concerned with anatomical structures, but focuses primarily on the body's functionsMatuk, C. "Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration", JBC Vol. 32, No. 1 2006, page 5 (such as digestion, breathing, temperature maintenance, etc.):
These functions are aggregated and then associated with a primary functional entity – for instance, nourishment of the tissues and maintenance of their moisture are seen as connected functions, and the entity postulated to be responsible for these functions is xuě (blood). These functional entities thus constitute concepts rather than something with biochemical or anatomical properties"For example, term Xue is used rather than Blood, since the latter implies the blood of Western medicine, with its precise parameters of biochemistry and histiology. Although Xue and blood share some common attributes, fundamentally, Xue is a different concept." As seen at: Flaws 1984, pp. 12–13[tpl]full|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The primary functional entities used by traditional Chinese medicine are qì, xuě, the five zàng organs, the six fǔ organs, and the meridians which extend through the organ systems.Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, p. 19  These are all theoretically interconnected: each zàng organ is paired with a fǔ organ, which are nourished by the blood and concentrate qi for a particular function, with meridians being extensions of those functional systems throughout the body.
Attempts to reconcile these concepts with modern science – in terms of identifying a physical correlate of them – have so far failed."... Even more elusive is the basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of qi, the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture."

Quackwatch stated that:
[tpl]quote|TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses. Even if they could agree, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html |author=Stephen Barrett, M.D. |title=Be Wary of Acupuncture, Qigong, and "Chinese Medicine" |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl][/tpl]

===Qi===

TCM distinguishes several kinds of qi ([tpl]zh|p=qì|s=气|t=氣|[/tpl]). In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five "cardinal functions":Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, pp 11–12 "氣的生理功能...(一)推動作用...(二)溫煦作用...(三)防御作用...(四)固攝作用...(五)氣化作用 functions of qi: 1.)

Function of transformation ...as seen at [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zgxl.net/sljk/imgbody/zyrt/qi.htm |title=氣|author=郭卜樂|date=24 October 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Qi|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090108191112/http://www.zgxl.net/sljk/imgbody/zyrt/qi.htm |archivedate = 8 January 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Vacuity of qi will especially be characterized by pale complexion, lassitude of spirit, lack of strength, spontaneous sweating, laziness to speak, non-digestion of food, shortness of breath (especially on exertion), and a pale and enlarged tongue.
Qi is believed to be partially generated from food and drink, and partially from air (by breathing).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/what_is_qi#jing |title=What is Qi? Qi in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl] Another considerable part of it is inherited from the parents and will be consumed in the course of life.
TCM uses special terms for qi running inside of the blood vessels and for qi that is distributed in the skin, muscles, and tissues between those. The former is called yíng-qì ([tpl]zh|s=营气|t=營氣[/tpl]); its function is to complement xuè and its nature has a strong yin aspect (although qi in general is considered to be yang).[tpl]cite web |url=http://taoism.about.com/od/qi/a/Qi_Forms.htm |title=Qi (Chi): Various Forms Used In Qigong & Chinese Medicine – How Are The Major Forms Of Qi Created Within The Body? |author=Elizabeth Reninger |accessdate=6 December 2010[/tpl] The latter is called weì-qì ([tpl]zh|t=衛氣[/tpl]); its main function is defence and it has pronounced yang nature.
Qi also circulates in the meridians. Just as the qi held by each of the zang-fu organs, this is considered to be part of the 'principal' qi (元氣, [tpl]zh|p=yuánqì[/tpl]) of the body"...元氣生成後，通過三焦而流行分布於全身，內至髒腑，外達腠理肌膚... yuan-qi is created, it disperses over the whole body, to the zang-fu in the interior, to the skin and the space beneath it on the exterior... as seen in [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zgxl.net/sljk/imgbody/zyrt/qi.htm |title=氣|author=郭卜樂|date=24t October 2009 |accessdate=6 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Qi|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090108191112/http://www.zgxl.net/sljk/imgbody/zyrt/qi.htm |archivedate = 8 January 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] (also called 真氣 [tpl]zh|p=zhēn qì[/tpl], ‘’true‘’ qi, or 原氣 [tpl]zh|p=yuán qì[/tpl], ‘’original‘’ qi)."1、元氣 元氣又稱為"原氣"、"真氣"，為人體最基本、最重要的氣，..."

===Xue===

In contrast to the majority of other functional entities, xuè (血, "blood") is correlated with a physical form – the red liquid running in the blood vessels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl] Its concept is, nevertheless, defined by its functions: nourishing all parts and tissues of the body, safeguarding an adequate degree of moisture,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/blood_theory_and_disharmonies |title=The Concept of Blood (Xue) in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010[/tpl] and sustaining and soothing both consciousness and sleep.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl]
Typical symptoms of a lack of xuě (usually termed "blood vacuity" [tpl]zh|p=xuě xū[/tpl]) are described as: Pale-white or withered-yellow complexion, dizziness, flowery vision, palpitations, insomnia, numbness of the extremities; pale tongue; "fine" pulse.Wiseman, N. & Ellis, A. (1996): "Fundamentals of Chinese medicine Paradigm Publications. ISBN 978-0-912111-44-5, p. 147

====Jinye====

Closely related to xuě are the jīnyė (津液, usually translated as "body fluids"), and just like xuě they are considered to be yin in nature, and defined first and foremost by the functions of nurturing and moisturizing the different structures of the body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001–2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=9 December 2010[/tpl] Their other functions are to harmonize yin and yang, and to help with the secretion of waste products."三、津液的功能 ...（三）调节阴阳 ...（四）排泄废物 ..."

===Zang-fu===

The zàng-fǔ ([tpl]zh|s=脏腑|t=臟腑[/tpl]) constitute the centre piece of TCM's systematization of bodily functions. Bearing the names of organs, they are, however, only secondarily tied to (rudimentary) anatomical assumptions (the fǔ a little more, the zàng much less).[tpl]cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China – Chinese Medicine – Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=8 January 2011[/tpl] As they are primarily defined by their functions, they are not equivalent to the anatomical organs – to highlight this fact, their names are usually capitalized.
The term zàng (臟) refers to the five entities considered to be yin in nature – Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney –, while fǔ (腑) refers to the six yang organs – Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gallbladder, Urinary Bladder, Stomach and Sānjiaō.by citation from the Huangdi Neijing's Suwen: ‘’言人身臟腑中陰陽，則臟者為陰，腑者為陽。‘’the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang.

Since their concept was developed on the basis of Wǔ Xíng philosophy, each zàng is paired with a fǔ, and each zàng-fǔ pair is assigned to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases).Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, pp 15–16 These correspondences are stipulated as:
The zàng-fǔ are also connected to the twelve standard meridians – each yang meridian is attached to a fǔ organ and five of the yin meridians are attached to a zàng. As there are only five zàng but six yin meridians, the sixth is assigned to the Pericardium, a peculiar entity almost similar to the Heart zàng.Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D.

"the Twelve Vessels") and 奇经八脉 ([tpl]zh|p=qí jīng bā mài[/tpl]) respectively."（三）十二经脉 ...（四）奇经八脉 ..." The Twelve Vessels ... (4.)

==Concept of disease==

In general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment. Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified. Thus, "pattern discrimination" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis. It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.
In order to determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice."Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)[tpl]Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989[/tpl] For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: "Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.".Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji. "Some acupuncture points which treat disorders of blood", Journal of Chinese Medicine He might then go on to prescribe treatments designed to clear heat or supplement the Lung.

===Disease entities===

In TCM, a disease has two aspects: "bìng" and "zhèng".Clavey, Steven (1995): "Fluid physiology and pathology in traditional Chinese medicine". Elsevier. 2nd edition, 2003. ISBN 978-0-443-07194-2 The former is often translated as "disease entity", "disease category", "illness", or simply "diagnosis". The latter, and more important one, is usually translated as "pattern" (or sometimes also as "syndrome"). For example, the disease entity of a common cold might present with a pattern of wind-cold in one person, and with the pattern of wind-heat in another.
From a scientific point of view, most of the disease entitites (病, [tpl]zh|p=bìng[/tpl]) listed by TCM constitute mere symptoms. Examples include headache, cough, abdominal pain, constipation etc.
Since therapy will not be chosen according to the disease entity but according to the pattern, two people with the same disease entity but different patterns will receive different therapy. Vice versa, people with similar patterns might receive similar therapy even if their disease entities are different. This is called 异病同治，同病异治 ([tpl]zh|p=yì bìng tóng zhì, tóng bìng yì zhì[/tpl],"different diseases, same treatment; same disease, different treatments").

===Patterns===

In TCM, "pattern" (证, [tpl]zh|p=zhèng[/tpl]) refers to a "pattern of disharmony" or "functional disturbance" within the functional entities the TCM model of the body is composed of. There are disharmony patterns of qi, xuě, the body fluids, the zàng-fǔ, and the meridians. They are ultimately defined by their symptoms and "signs" (i.e., for example, pulse and tongue findings).
In clinical practice, the identified pattern usually involves a combination of affected entitiesFlaws, Bob (1990): "Sticking to the Point" Blue Poppy Press. 10th Printing, 2007. ISBN 978-0-936185-17-0 (compare with typical examples of patterns). The concrete pattern identified should account for all the symptoms a person has.Flaws, B., & Finney, D., (1996): "A handbook of TCM patterns & their treatments" Blue Poppy Press. 6th Printing 2007. ISBN 978-0-936185-70-5

====Six Excesses====

The Six Excesses (六淫, [tpl]zh|p=liù yín[/tpl], sometimes also translated as "Pathogenic Factors",[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WbThUt45ZXgC&pg=PA159&dq=tcm+six#v=onepage&q=tcm%20six&f=false|title=Foundations for integrative musculoskeletal medicine: an east-west approach|author=Marcus & Kuchera|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2004|accessdate=22 March 2011|isbn=978-1-55643-540-9[/tpl] p. 159 or "Six Pernicious Influences"; with the alternative term of  六邪, [tpl]zh|p=liù xié[/tpl], – "Six Evils" or "Six Devils") are allegorical terms used to describe disharmony patterns displaying certain typical symptoms. These symptoms resemble the effects of six climatic factors. In the allegory, these symptoms can occur because one or more of those climatic factors (called 六气, [tpl]zh|p=liù qì[/tpl], "the six qi") were able to invade the body surface and to proceed to the interior. This is sometimes used to draw causal relationships (i.e., prior exposure to wind/cold/etc. is identified as the cause of a disease), while other authors explicitly deny a direct cause-effect relationship between weather conditions and disease, pointing out that the Six Excesses are primarily descriptions of a certain combination of symptoms translated into a pattern of disharmony. It is undisputed, though, that the Six Excesses can manifest inside the body without an external cause. In this case, they might be denoted "internal", e.g., "internal wind" or "internal fire (or heat)".
The Six Excesses and their characteristic clinical signs are:
Six-Excesses-patterns can consist of only one or a combination of Excesses (e.g., wind-cold, wind-damp-heat). They can also transform from one into another.

====Typical examples of patterns====

For each of the functional entities (qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc.), typical disharmony patterns are recognized; for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi; blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xuĕ; Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen zàng; wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.
TCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings. For example:

====Basic principles of pattern discrimination====

The process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called 辩证 ([tpl]zh|p=biàn zhèng[/tpl], usually translated as "pattern diagnosis", "pattern identification" or "pattern discrimination"). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the "Eight Principles" (八纲, [tpl]zh|p=bā gāng[/tpl]).
These eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang. Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance. The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found. In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:
After the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects. By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected. This evaluation can be done
There are also three special pattern diagnosis systems used in case of febrile and infectious diseases only ("Six Channel system" or "six division pattern" [tpl]zh|p=liù jīng biàn zhèng[/tpl]; "Wei Qi Ying Xue system" or "four division pattern" [tpl]zh|p=weì qì yíng xuě biàn zhèng[/tpl]; "San Jiao system" or "three burners pattern" [tpl]zh|p=sānjiaō biàn zhèng[/tpl]).

====Considerations of disease causes====

Although TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect,Ross, Jeremy (1984) "Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine" Elsevier. First edition 1984. ISBN 978-0-443-03482-4 pattern discrimination can include considerations regarding the disease cause; this is called 病因辩证 ([tpl]zh|p=bìngyīn biàn zhèng[/tpl], "disease-cause pattern discrimination").
There are three fundamental categories of disease causes (三因, [tpl]zh|p=sān yīn[/tpl]) recognized:

==Diagnostics==

In TCM, there are five diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation, olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.[tpl]cite book | last =Cheng | first = X. | title = Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion (1st ed.) | year = 1987 | publisher = Foreign Languages Press | isbn = 7-119-00378-X[/tpl]

===Tongue and pulse===

Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in TCM. Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the zàng-fŭ. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Liver.
Pulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the radial artery (Cun, Guan, Chi, located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain zàng-fŭ.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like "floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick"; each of these qualities indicate certain disease patterns. Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.[tpl]cite book |author=Wright, Thomas; Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= 53–4|isbn=0-393-31213-5 |oclc= [/tpl]

==Herbal medicine==

The term "herbal medicine" is misleading in so far as plant elements are by far the most commonly, but not solely used substances in TCM; animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized. Thus, the term "medicinal" (instead of herb) is usually preferred.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/?id=uRdIuISvjo4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=wiseman+chinese#v=onepage&q=medicinal&f=false |title=Introduction to English Terminology of Chinese Medicine |author=Nigel Wiseman & Ye Feng |accessdate=10 June 2011|isbn= 9780912111643|date= 2002-08-01[/tpl] 

===Prescriptions===

Typically, one batch of medicinals is prepared as a decoction of about 9 to 18 substances."Nach der Erfahrung des Verfassers bewegen sich in der VR China 99% der Rezepturen in einem Bereich zwischen 6 und 20 Kräutern; meist sind es aber zwischen 9 und 18,... ("According to the author's experience, 99% of prescriptions in the PR of China range from 6 to 20 herbs; in the majority, however, it is 9 to 12,...") A seen at: Kiessler, (2005), p. 24 Some of these are considered as main herbs, some as ancillary herbs; within the ancillary herbs, up to three categories can be distinguished."Innerhalb einer Rezeptur wird grob zwischen Haupt- und Nebenkräuter unterschieden. Bei klassischen Rezepturen existieren sehr genaue Analysen zur Funktion jeder einzelnen Zutat, die bis zu drei Kategorien (Chen, Zun und Chi) von Nebenkräutern differenzieren." ("Regarding the content of the prescription, one can roughly differentiate between main herbs and ancillary herbs. For classical prescriptions, detailed analyses exist for the function of each single ingredient, discriminating between up to three categories (Chen, Zun, and Chi) of ancillary herbs.")

====Human body parts====

Traditional Chinese Medicine also includes some human parts: the classic Materia medica (Bencao Gangmu) describes the use of 35 human body parts and excreta in medicines, including bones, fingernail, hairs, dandruff, earwax, impurities on the teeth, feces, urine, sweat, organs, but most are no longer in use."Human Drugs" in Chinese Medicine and the Confucian View: An Interpretive Study, Jing-Bao Nie, Confucian Bioethics, 2002, Volume 61, Part III, 167–206, [tpl]doi|10.1007/0-306-46867-0_7[/tpl], http://www.springerlink.com/content/r3371v1625353774/ [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]THE HUMAN BODY AS A NEW COMMODITY, Tsuyoshi Awaya, The Review of Tokuyama, June, 1999Commodifying bodies, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Loïc J.

===Toxicity===

From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materiae medicae. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. Traditional Chinese herbal remedies are conveniently available from grocery stores in most Chinese neighborhoods; some of these items may contain toxic ingredients, are imported into the U.S. illegally, and are associated with claims of therapeutic benefit without evidence.[tpl]cite pmid | 8779214[/tpl] For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Planta Medica|year=2012|volume=76|issue=17|pages=2012–8|title=Toxicological risks of Chinese herbs|author=Shaw D|pmid=21077025|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1250533[/tpl] The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it couldn't (i.e., in Curculigo).

However, many adverse reactions are due misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns.

===Drug research===

With an eye to the enormous Chinese market, pharmaceutical companies have explored the potential for creating new drugs from traditional remedies.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1038/448106a|title=Hard to swallow|year=2007|journal=Nature (journal)|volume=448|issue=7150|pages=105[/tpl] Successful results have however been scarce: while this simply is because TCM is largely pseudoscience, without a rational mechanism of action for the majority of its treatments; advocates have argued that it is because research had missed some key features of TCM, such as the subtle interrelationships between ingredients.
One of the few successes was the development in the 1970s of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which is a processed extract of Artemisia annua, a herb traditionally used as a fever treatment.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.024|title=Artemisinin: Discovery from the Chinese Herbal Garden|year=2011|last1=Miller|first1=Louis H.|last2=Su|first2=Xinzhuan|journal=Cell|volume=146|issue=6|pages=855–8|pmid=21907397|pmc=3414217[/tpl] Researcher Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. She says she was influenced by a traditional source saying that this herb should be steeped in cold water, after initially finding high-temperature extraction unsatisfactory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title=Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery | Science/AAAS | News |publisher=News.sciencemag.org |accessdate=2014-01-07[/tpl] The extracted substance, once subject to detoxification and purification processes, is a usable antimalarial drug – a 2012 review found that artemisinin-based remedies were the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=22855752|year=2012|last1=Fairhurst|first1=RM|last2=Nayyar|first2=GM|last3=Breman|first3=JG|last4=Hallett|first4=R|last5=Vennerstrom|first5=JL|last6=Duong|first6=S|last7=Ringwald|first7=P|last8=Wellems|first8=TE|last9=Plowe|first9=CV|last10=Dondorp|first10=AM|title=Artemisinin-resistant malaria: Research challenges, opportunities, and public health implications|volume=87|issue=2|pages=231–41|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-0025|pmc=3414557|journal=The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene[/tpl] Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population.

===Cost-effectiveness===

==Acupuncture and moxibustion==

Acupuncture means insertion of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) – usually at acupuncture points (acupoints) – and their subsequent manipulation; this aims at influencing the flow of qi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm |publisher=National Institutes of Health |title=Acupuncture – Consensus Development Conference Statement|date=5 November 1997[/tpl] According to TCM it relieves pain and treats (and prevents) various diseases.[tpl]cite book |author1=Novak, Patricia D. |author2=Dorland, Norman W. |author3=Dorland, William Alexander Newman |title=Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1995 |edition=25th |isbn=978-0-7216-5738-7 |oclc=33123537 [/tpl]
Acupuncture is often accompanied by moxibustion – the Chinese characters for acupuncture ([tpl]zh|s=针灸|p=zhēnjiǔ[/tpl]) literally meaning "acupuncture-moxibustion" – which involves burning mugwort on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acupuncturetoday.com/abc/moxibustion.php |title=Moxibustion, Acupuncture Today |publisher=Acupuncturetoday.com |accessdate=2011-05-17[/tpl] According to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that moxibustion is effective in preventing or treating cancer or any other disease".
In electroacupuncture, an electrical current is applied to the needles once they are inserted, in order to further stimulate the respective acupuncture points.[tpl]cite book |last1= Robertson |first1=Valma J |last2=Robertson |first2=Val |last3=Low |first3=John |last4=Ward |first4=Alex |last5=Reed |first5=Ann |title=Electrotherapy explained: principles and practice |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2006  |isbn=978-0-7506-8843-7[/tpl]

===Efficacy===

A 2013 editorial found that the inconsistency of results of acupuncture studies (i.e. acupuncture relieved pain in some conditions but had no effect in other very similar conditions) suggests false positive results, which may be caused by factors like biased study designs, poor blinding, and the classification of electrified needles (a type of TENS) as a form of acupuncture. The same editorial suggested that given the inability to find consistent results despite more than 3,000 studies of acupuncture, the treatment seems to be a placebo effect and the existing equivocal positive results are noise one expects to see after a large number of studies are performed on an inert therapy. The editorial concluded that the best controlled studies showed a clear pattern, in which the outcome does not rely upon needle location or even needle insertion, and since "these variables are those that define acupuncture, the only sensible conclusion is that acupuncture does not work."[tpl]cite journal | last = Colquhoun | first = D | authorlink = David Colquhoun |author2= Novella S | pmid = 23709076 | url = http://www.dcscience.net/Colquhoun-Novella-A&A-2013.pdf | format = pdf | title = Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth | journal = Anesthesia & Analgesia | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | year = 2013 | pages = 1360–1363 | doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e31828f2d5e[/tpl]

==Tui na==

Tui na (推拿) is a form of massage akin to acupressure (from which shiatsu evolved). Oriental massage is typically administered with the person fully clothed, without the application of grease or oils. Choreography often involves thumb presses, rubbing, percussion, and stretches.

==Qigong==

Qìgōng (气功 or 氣功) is a TCM system of exercise and meditation that combines regulated breathing, slow movement, and focused awareness, purportedly to cultivate and balance qi.[tpl]cite book |last=Holland |first=Alex |year=2000 |title=Voices of Qi: An Introductory Guide to Traditional Chinese Medicine |publisher= North Atlantic Books |isbn=1-55643-326-3[/tpl] One branch of qigong is qigong massage, in which the practitioner combines massage techniques with awareness of the acupuncture channels and points.Silva, L., Schalock, M., Ayres, R., Bunse, C., & Budden, S.

==Other therapies==

===Cupping===

Cupping (拔罐) is a type of Chinese massage, consisting of placing several glass "cups" (open spheres) on the body. A match is lit and placed inside the cup and then removed before placing the cup against the skin. As the air in the cup is heated, it expands, and after placing in the skin, cools, creating lower pressure inside the cup that allows the cup to stick to the skin via suction. When combined with massage oil, the cups can be slid around the back, offering "reverse-pressure massage".
It has not been found to be effective for the treatment of any disease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/cupping|title=Cupping|date=November 2008|accessdate=4 October 2013|publisher=American Cancer Society[/tpl] The 2008 Trick or Treatment book said that no evidence exists of any beneficial effects of cupping for any medical condition.[tpl]cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Simon|authorlink1=Simon Singh|last2=Ernst|first2=Edzard|authorlink2=Edzard Ernst|title=Trick or Treatment|year=2008|publisher=Transworld Publishers|isbn=9780552157629|page=368[/tpl]

===Gua Sha===

Gua Sha is abrading the skin with pieces of smooth jade, bone, animal tusks or horns or smooth stones; until red spots then bruising cover the area to which it is done. It is believed that this treatment is for almost any ailment including cholera. The red spots and bruising take 3 to 10 days to heal, there is often some soreness in the area that has been treated.Gua Sha, Guasha.com, Arya Nielsen, Fellow – National Academy of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, former Chair of the New York State Board for Acupuncture, Gua Sha ( Guasha ) Chinese medicine and acupuncture treatment by Arya Nielsen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcmwell.com/TCMNaturalTherapy/GuashaCupping/GuaSha-Treatment-of-Disease.html |title=GuaSha Treatment of Disease |publisher=Tcmwell.com |accessdate=2011-05-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://thechifarm.com/legacy/acupuncture_treatment/pdf/gua_sha.pdf |title=Gua Sha: A Clinical Overview, Arya Nielson, Chinese Medicine Times |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-17[/tpl]The effect of Gua Sha treatment on the microcirculation of surface tissue: a pilot study in healthy subjects, A Nielsen, N Knoblauch, GJ Dobos, Elsevier

===Die-da===

Diē-dá (跌打) or bone-setting is usually practiced by martial artists who know aspects of Chinese medicine that apply to the treatment of trauma and injuries such as bone fractures, sprains, and bruises. Some of these specialists may also use or recommend other disciplines of Chinese medical therapies (or Western medicine in modern times) if serious injury is involved. Such practice of bone-setting (整骨 or 正骨) is not common in the West.

==Regulations==

Many governments have enacted laws to regulate TCM practice.

===Australia===

From 1 July 2012 Chinese medicine practitioners must be registered under the national registration and accreditation scheme with the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and meet the Board's Registration Standards, in order to practise in Australia.http://www.chinesemedicineboard.gov.au Chinese Medicine Board of Australia

===Hong Kong===

The Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong was established in 1999. It regulates the medicinals and professional standards for TCM practitioners. All TCM practitioners in Hong Kong are required to register with the Council. The eligibility for registration includes a recognised 5-year university degree of TCM, a 30-week minimum supervised clinical internship, and passing the licensing exam.The Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong Hong Kong Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioner licensure requirements

===Malaysia===
