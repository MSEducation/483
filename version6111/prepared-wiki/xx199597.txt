Earthquake simulation applies a real or simulated vibrational input to a structure that possesses the essential features of a real seismic event.  Earthquake simulations are generally performed to study the effects of earthquakes on man-made engineered structures, or on natural features which may present a hazard during an earthquake.
Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical – as with shake-table testing – or virtual (based on computer simulation).  In all cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, researchers prefer to deal with so called 'real time-histories' though the last cannot be 'real' for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements.

==Shake-table testing==

Studying a building's response to an earthquake is performed by putting a model of the structure on a shake-table that simulates the seismic loading. The earliest such experiments were performed more than a century ago.[tpl]cite book|title= Seismic Experiments on the Fracturing and Overturning of Columns|author=Omori, F.|year=1900|publisher=Publ.

==Computational approaches==

Another way is to evaluate the earthquake performance analytically. 
The very first earthquake simulations were performed by statically applying some horizontal inertia forces, based on scaled peak ground accelerations, to a mathematical model of a building.[tpl]cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author=Lindeburg, Michael R.; Baradar, Majid|year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=1-888577-52-5[/tpl] With the further development of computational technologies, static approaches began to give way to dynamic ones.[tpl]cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Clough, Ray W.; Penzien, Joseph|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-011394-7[/tpl]
Traditionally, numerical simulation and physical tests have been uncoupled and performed separately.  So-called hybrid testing systems employ rapid, parallel analyses using both physical and computational tests.
