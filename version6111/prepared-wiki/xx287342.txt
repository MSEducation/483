==History==

Originally known as Coaticook Stadium, it was built in 1963. The wooden seats located in the dugouts were purchased from the Montreal Royals. The stadium was originally home to the Coaticook Canaidans of the Provincial League.
The provincial championships of Bantam-level were held at the stadium in 1973. The Sherbrooke A's of the Ligue de Baseball Junior Majeur moved to Coaticook for the 1981 and 1982 seasons while Amedée Roy Stadium was being renovated.
The Senior-level provincial championships were held in the stadium in 1991 and 1992, while the Senior-level national championships were held in 1993.
In 1995, 650 new bleachers were added as well as a new Bar-VIP section. Coaticook Stadium changed its name to Julien Morin Stadium in 1997.
Julien Morin Stadium co-hosted the 2002 World Junior Baseball Championship with Amedée Roy Stadium in nearby Sherbrooke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://permaline.ca/media.htm|title=Between specialists, one understands...|last=Richard|first=Jean-Paul|date=2002-07-31|publisher=La Tribune|language=(translated from french)|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Sherbrooke[/tpl] As a result of this event, a grass infield was added as well as a new warning-track in the outfield.
During 2010, the stadium was again renovated in preparation for the 2013 Canada Games. A new scoreboard, sound system, fence and new bleachers were added.
