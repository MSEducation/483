[[List of male tennis players]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of sportsmen, Lists of tennis players, Male tennis players

This is a list of top international male tennis players, both past and present.
To keep the list at a reasonable length, it includes only players who have been officially ranked among the top 25 singles players in the world during the "Open Era"; been ranked in the top five prior to the Open Era; have been a singles quarterfinalist or better at a Grand Slam tournament; have reached the finals of the Masters Grand Prix/ATP Tour World Championships/Tennis Masters Cup/ATP World Tour Finals; have been singles medalists at the Olympics; have won a Grand Slam or Olympic doubles title; or have been ranked world no. 1 in doubles.
Drawsheets for many pre-World War II Grand Slam tournaments and complete ATP rankings prior to 1983 are both unavailable, so this list may remain incomplete.
Players who have won more than one Grand Slam singles title or have been ranked world no. 1 in singles, and singles Grand Slam and Olympic championships, have been put in bold font. Players who still play on the tour have been put in italics.
