===Facilities===

The station consists of two platforms located either side of the railway tracks. While it is no longer manned for transport purposes, the original office area is open as a tea room during the morning peak, six days a week. Apart from Burwood station, Riversdale is the only station on the Alamein line to have electronic next train signage. It also has car parking spaces, though few other facilities, due to its unmanned status.
The station is close to other means of transport, with a tram stop of route 70 on Riversdale Road, and a bus stop nearby in Prospect Hill Road. It is also only 400 m away from Willison station. The Camberwell High School and Riversdale Park are also close by. Platform 1 has a large weatherboard building while platform 2 has a smaller building to platform 1. A large Metcard machine is located at the entrance to platform 1, which is able to dispense most ticketing options available and also accepts notes and coins. Additional coin-only Metcard and myki ticket vending machines are located at the entrances to platform 1 and platform 2.
Some trains also terminate at Riversdale after morning and evening peaks and return to Camberwell for stabling. The morning services are run purely for operational reasons, do not appear in timetables and Metro Trains are not penalised if they run late or not at all.
