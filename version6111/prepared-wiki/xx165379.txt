James Alger Wilson (February 20, 1922 in San Diego, California – September 2, 1986 in Newport Beach, California) was a professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of twelve seasons in Major League Baseball between 1945 and 1958 for the Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Braves, Milwaukee Braves, Baltimore Orioles, and Chicago White Sox.
On June 12, 1954, while with the Braves, Wilson no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies 2–0 at Milwaukee County Stadium. The 32-year old right-hander beat future Hall of Famer Robin Roberts in the one-hour and 43-minute contest. The no-hitter was the first in the franchise's Milwaukee history; they had moved from Boston after the 1952 season.
Jim Wilson was also the general manager of the Milwaukee Brewers during the 1973 and 1974 seasons. After leaving the GM position in 1974, he went on to be the Chief of the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau.
