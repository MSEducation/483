Volán FC is a now defunct Hungarian football team from the Rákospalota neighborhood of Budapest, named after one of the main bus companies in the country Borsod Volán. Volán played six seasons in the first division of the Hungarian League, the Nemzeti Bajnokság I., mostly during the 1980s, in which time it was relegated four times and never finished higher than 11th place as in the first season. Following the last relegation in 1991 the club folded. 
The successor to Volán is Rákospalotai EAC, which was formed from some pieces of the former team. However, REAC is Just the de facto successor and only took over Volán's league spot. It does not carry any of Volán's records, but sees itself as modern extension of the REAC formed early in the 20th century and which was dissolved in the course of World War II.
