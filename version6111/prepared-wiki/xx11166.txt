One of the lingering problems in estimating the Shia population is that unless the Shia form a significant minority in a Muslim country, the entire population is often listed as Sunni. Shiites are estimated to be 21–35 percent of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the Islamic schools and branches and practice of taqiyya by Shias.Momen, Moojan, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p.277

Saudi Arabia hosts a number of distinct Shia communities, including the Twelver Baharna in the Eastern Province and Nakhawila of Medina, and the Ismaili Sulaymani and Zaidiyyah of Najran.

According to Shia Muslims, one of the lingering problems in estimating Shia population is that unless Shia form a significant minority in a Muslim country, the entire population is often listed as Sunni. The reverse, however, has not held true, which may contribute to imprecise estimates of the size of each sect. For example, the 1926 rise of the House of Saud in Arabia brought official discrimination against Shia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/oct2001/saud-o08.shtml |title=Discrimination towards Shia in Saudi Arabia |publisher=Wsws.org |date=2001-10-08 |accessdate=2011-05-04[/tpl]
