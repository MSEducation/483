==Criticism==

The scientific community considers creationism to be pseudoscience.Finding the Evolution in Medicine, Cynthia Delgado, NIH Record,  July 28, 2006.[ref]As reported by Newsweek: "By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'," in "Keeping God out of the Classroom (Washington and bureau reports)",
