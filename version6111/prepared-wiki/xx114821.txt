Rocky Gap State Park is a [tpl]convert|3000|acre|adj=on[/tpl] Maryland state park in Allegany County.

The park includes the man-made Lake Habeeb and the privately owned and operated Rocky Gap Resort Casino. Rocky Gap offers year-round recreation including swimming, camping, fishing, boating, and hiking.

==Activities and amenities==

===Resort===

The Rocky Gap Resort and Golf Course was developed in 1998 by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO), an agency created in 1984 that allows the State of Maryland to directly own or develop property for economic benefit. The facility opened in April 1998 at a cost of $53.9 million. The resort failed to sustain its early success, began posting losses, and became dependent on MEDCO subsidies to stay in operation. In 2009, the state's initial effort to open a casino in the park failed when the only bidder, Empire Resorts, did not pay the required $4.5 million licensing fee. Empire's contingent bid was based on Maryland altering its 67 percent tax on casinos—one of the highest in the United States. In 2011, legislators lowered the state’s share of slots revenue at Rocky Gap from 67 percent to 50 percent. A casino license was awarded in April 2012 to a subsidiary of Lakes Entertainment of Minnetonka, Minnesota, who completed purchase of the existing resort, including the 200-room lakeside lodge, the Jack Nicklaus-designed 18-hole golf course, and other features, from the state in August 2012. The sale price was reported at less than $7 million. The renamed Rocky Gap Casino Resort opened on May 22, 2013, with 558 slot machines and 10 live table games. 

===Lake Habeeb===

The park's man-made Lake Habeeb covers [tpl]convert|243|acre[/tpl] and sports white sand beaches. It sits below Evitts Mountain and is fed by Rocky Gap Run. Boats (electric motors only) are allowed on Lake Habeeb 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a fee is assessed. The park offers paddle boats, kayaks, and canoes for rent. Fish most commonly caught by anglers at Lake Habeeb include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, rainbow trout, brown trout, channel catfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, and pumpkinseed.

===Trails===

Hiking trails include the four-mile (6 km) Lakeside Trail and the five-mile (8 km) Evitt's Homesite Trail, which climbs Evitts Mountain amid streams with hemlock, mountain laurel and rhododendron growing nearby. The quarter-mile Touch of Nature Trail is a paved route to an accessible fishing dock. 

===Amphitheater===

The park's amphitheater and concert stage can be rented. Its seating capacity  is 3,000, and the stage area is [tpl]convert|42|ft|m[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|60|ft|m[/tpl]. The stage was built as a permanent home for the Rocky Gap Country Bluegrass Festival (1988-2001) but was never used for those shows. 
Rocky Gap is served by the Volunteer Team, Inc., a group of Western Maryland and surrounding community citizens that participate in daily operations in the park.
