Eilat (Hebrew: [tpl]lang-he-a|אֵילַת|Eilat.ogg[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|إيلات[/tpl]) is Israel's southernmost city, a busy port and  popular resort located at the northern tip of the Red Sea, on the Gulf of Aqaba.
Home to about 47,700 people, Eilat is part of the Southern Negev Desert, at the southern end of the Arava, adjacent to the Egyptian village of Taba to the south, the Jordanian port city of Aqaba to the east, and within sight of Saudi Arabia to the south-east, across the gulf.
Eilat's arid desert climate and low humidity are moderated by proximity to a warm sea. Temperatures often exceed [tpl]convert|40|°C[/tpl] in summer, and [tpl]convert|21|°C[/tpl] in winter, while water temperatures range between [tpl]convert|20|and|26|C|F[/tpl]. Eilat averages 360 sunny days a year.Discovering the World of the Bible, LaMar C. Berrett, (Cedar Fort 1996), page 204
The city's beaches, coral reef, nightlife and desert landscapes make it a popular destination for domestic and international tourism.

==Geography==

The geology and landscape are varied: igneous and metamorphic rocks, sandstone and limestone; mountains up to [tpl]convert|892|m[/tpl] above sea level; broad valleys such as the Arava, and seashore on the Gulf of Aqaba. With an annual average rainfall of [tpl]convert|28|mm[/tpl] and summer temperatures of [tpl]convert|40|C|F[/tpl] and higher, water resources and vegetation are limited. "The main elements that influenced the region's history were the copper resources and other minerals, the ancient international roads that crossed the area, and its geopolitical and strategic position. These resulted in a settlement density that defies the environmental conditions."Avner, U. 2008. Eilat Region. In, A. Stern (ed.). The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavation in the Holy Land, Volume 5 (Supplementary). Jerusalem. 1704–1711.

==History==

===Etymology===

The origin of the name Eilat is not definitively known, but likely comes from the Hebrew root A–Y–L ([tpl]lang-he|א. י. ל.[/tpl]), which is also the root for the word Elah ([tpl]lang-he|אלה[/tpl]), meaning Pistacia tree. Like numerous other localities, Eilat is mentioned in the Bible both in singular (possibly construct state) and plural form (Eilot).[tpl]cite journal|author=Grinzweig, Michael|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Meir|editor2-last=Schiller|editor2-first=Eli|year=1993|title=From the Items of the Name Eilat|issue= 93–94: Eilat – Human, Sea and Desert|journal=Ariel|publisher=Ariel Publishing|page=110[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]

===Antiquity===

The original settlement was probably at the northern tip of the Gulf of Eilat.Dr. Muhammed Abdul Nayeem, (1990). Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula. Hyderabad. ISBN. Archaeological excavations uncovered impressive prehistoric tombs dating to the 7th millennium BC at the western edge of Eilat, while nearby copper workings and mining operations at Timna Valley are the oldest on earth. Ancient Egyptian records also document the extensive and lucrative mining operations and trade across the Red Sea with Egypt starting as early as the Fourth dynasty of Egypt. Eilat is mentioned in antiquity as a major trading partner with Elim, Thebes' Red Sea Port, as early as the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt.Michael Rice(1990). Egypt's Making. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-06454-6. Trade between Elim and Eilat furnished frankincense and myrrh, brought up from Ethiopia and Punt; bitumen and natron, from the Dead Sea; finely woven linen, from Byblos; and copper amulets, from Timna; all mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. In antiquity Eilat bordered the states of Edom, Midian and the tribal territory of the Rephidim, the indigenous inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula.

===Israelite period===

Eilat is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Exodus.  The first six stations of the Exodus are in Egypt. The 7th is the crossing of the Red Sea and the 9th–13th are in and around Eilat,  after the exodus from Egypt and crossing the Red Sea. Station 12 refers to a dozen campsites in and around Timna in Modern Israel near Eilat.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] When King David conquered Edom,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gideon.022.co.il|title=ישראל המקדשית|publisher=Gideon.022.co.il|date=|accessdate=2011-09-16[/tpl] which up to then had been a common border of Edom and Midian, he took over Eilat, the border city shared by them as well. The commercial port city and copper based industrial center were maintained by Egypt until reportedly rebuilt by Solomon at a location known as Ezion-Geber (I Kings 9:26). In 2 Kings 14:21–22 "All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. He rebuilt Elath, and restored it to Judah, after his father's death." And again in 2 Kings 16:6: "At that time the king of Edom recovered Elath for Edom, and drove out the people of Judah and sent Edomites to live there, as they do to this day."

===Roman and Muslim periods===

During the Roman period a road was built to link the area with the Nabataean city of Petra (in modern-day Jordan). The remains of a large copper smelting and trading community which flourished during the Umayyad Period (700–900 CE) were also found between what is now Eilat's industrial zone and nearby Kibbutz Eilot.
In the writings of medieval Muslim scholars, such as Al-Waqidi, it is told that Muhammad made a treaty with Eilat's (Ayla) population, Jews and Christians. In the treaty, Muhammad offered protection to the Jews and the Christians, preserving their self-rule over the city, in exchange for an annual tax.Moshe Gil. "A History of Palestine, 634–1099". Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp.29–31
Another reference to the Eilat in Islamic texts is believed to appear in the Quran, sura 7:163–169. In these Ayats appears a story about "a town by the sea" where the Jewish residents were tested by God to check if they truly observe the Shabbat. Once they didn't, they were turned into apes.The Quran, sura 7:163–167. http://quran.com/7/163-169 
The Darb el Hajj or "Pilgrim's Road", from Africa through Egypt to Mecca, passed out of Sinai from the west at Umm Al-Rashrash, the modern Arabic name for Eilat, before skirting the sea and continuing south into Arabia.  A British police post was established in this area in 1906.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gabriel Warburg|title=The Sinai Peninsula borders 1906–1947|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=14|year=1979|pages=677–692|doi=10.1177/002200947901400406[/tpl]
An Islamic village of 250–400 residents flourished at the northern edge of modern Eilat during the 7th and 8th centuries.  It was excavated in 1989 to make way for an industrial area.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yehudah Rapuano | title = An Early Islamic Settlement and a Possible Open-Air Mosque at Eilat | journal = 'Atiqot | year = 2013 | volume = 75 | pages = 129–165[/tpl]

===After the establishment of the State of Israel===

The area was designated as part of the Jewish state in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The Arab village of Umm Al-Rashrash was taken without a fight on March 10, 1949, as part of Operation Uvda.[tpl]Citation needed| date=July 2012[/tpl]
The Timna Copper Mines[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sGkh__5q9ncJ:www.timna.co.il/+%22timmna+copper+mines%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=il|title=Timna Copper Mines homepage[/tpl] near Timna valley were opened, a port was constructed, the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline laid, and tourism began. Construction of the city and the Port of Eilat began shortly after the end of the war. The port became vital to the fledgling country's development. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War Arab countries maintained a state of hostility with Israel, blocking all land routes; Israel's access to and trade with the rest of the world was by air and sea alone. Further, Egypt denied passage through the Suez Canal to Israeli-registered ships or to any ship carrying cargo to or from Israeli ports. This made Eilat and its sea port crucial to Israel's communications, commerce and trade with Africa and Asia, and for oil imports. Without recourse to a port on the Red Sea Israel would have been unable to develop its diplomatic, cultural and trade ties beyond the Mediterranean basin and Europe. This happened in 1956 and again in 1967, when Egypt's closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping effectively blockaded the port of Eilat. In 1956, this led to Israel's participation alongside Britain and France in the war against Egypt sparked by the Suez Crisis, while in 1967 it was cited by Israel as an additional casus belli leading to the outbreak of the Six-Day War. Following peace treaties signed with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, Eilat's borders with its neighbors were finally opened.

====Future development plans====

In July 2012, Israel signed an agreement with China to cooperate in building the high-speed railway to Eilat, a railway line which will serve both passenger and freight trains. It will link Eilat with Beersheba and Tel Aviv, and will run through the Arava Valley and Nahal Zin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000762276&fid=1725 |title=Israel, China agree to build Eilat railway |publisher=Globes |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]
Currently, there are plans to vacate and dismantle Eilat Airport due to the plans for Timna Airport, and develop the area. Hotels and apartment buildings, containing a total of 2,080 hotel rooms and 1,000 apartments will be constructed on the site, as well as 275 dunams of public space and pedestrian paths. The plans also set aside space for the railway line and an underground railway station. The plan's goal is to create an urban continuum between the city center and North Beach, as well as tighten the links between the city's neighborhoods, which are currently separated by the airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000738696&fid=1124 |title=Hotels, 1,000 apartments planned for Eilat Airport site |publisher=Globes |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]
In addition, there are plans to move the Port of Eilat and the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline terminal to the northern part of the city, as well as to turn it into a university town of science and research, and brand it an international sports city. All these projects are part of a plan to turn Eilat into a metropolitan area of 150,000 people and 35,000 hotel rooms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000630285&fid=1725 |title=Despite Japan, IEC chairman urges nuclear power |publisher=Globes |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]

===Tourism===

Eilat offers a wide range of accommodations, from hostels and luxury hotels to Bedouin hospitality. In recent years Eilat has been the target of millitants from Egypt and Gaza causing a reduced tourist inflow to the region. Attractions include:

===Dive tourism===

Skin and Scuba diving, with equipment for hire on or near all major beaches. Scuba diving equipment rental and compressed air are available from diving clubs and schools all year round. Eilat is located in the Gulf of Aqaba, one of the most popular diving destinations in the world. The coral reefs along Eilat's coast remain relatively pristine and the area is recognized as one of the prime diving locations in the world.  About 250,000 dives are performed annually in Eilat's [tpl]convert|11|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] coastline, and diving represents 10% of the tourism income of this area.Artificial Reefs and Dive Tourism in Eilat, Israel Dan Wilhelmsson, Marcus C. Öhman, Henrik Ståhl and Yechiam Shlesinger Ambio, Vol. 27, No. 8, Building Capacity for Coastal Management (Dec., 1998), pp. 764–766 Published by: Allen Press on behalf of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences http://www.jstor.org/stable/4314831  In addition, given the proximity of many of these reefs to the shore, non-divers can encounter the Red Sea's reefs with relative ease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Regional%20Projects/Gulf%20of%20Aqaba-%20Tourism|title=MFA, Gulf of Aqaba- Tourism, 30 Sep 1997|publisher=Mfa.gov.il|accessdate=January 28, 2011[/tpl] Water conditions for SCUBA divers are good all year round, with water temperatures around 21–25 C°, with little or no currents and clear waters with an average of 20–30 meters visibility.

==Museums==

==Film==

Eilat has been utilized as a location by many films and television production teams, most notably in the early 90s as a tropical locale for season 2 of the Canadian production Tropical Heat. It was also used in Rambo 3.

==Archaeology==

Despite harsh conditions, the region has supported large populations as far back as 8,000 BCE.
Exploration of ancient sites began in 1861, but only 7% of the area has undergone serious  archaeological excavation. Some 1,500 ancient sites are located in a [tpl]convert|1200|km2|sqmi|sing=on[/tpl] area. In contrast to the gaps found in settlement periods in the neighbouring Negev Highlands and Sinai, these sites show continuous settlement for the past 10,000 years.
