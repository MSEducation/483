[[Extreme value theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Articles containing proofs, Theorems in calculus, Theorems in real analysis

In calculus, the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f is continuous in the closed and bounded interval a,b, then f must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers c and d in a,b such that:
A related theorem is the boundedness theorem which states that a continuous function f in the closed interval a,b is bounded on that interval. That is, there exist real numbers m and M such that:
The extreme value theorem enriches the boundedness theorem by saying that not only is the function bounded, but it also attains its least upper bound as its maximum and its greatest lower bound as its minimum.
The extreme value theorem is used to prove Rolle's theorem.  In a formulation due to Karl Weierstrass, this theorem states that a continuous function from a compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum.

==History==

The extreme value theorem was originally proven by Bernard Bolzano in the 1830s in a work Function Theory but the work remained unpublished until 1930.  Bolzano's proof consisted of showing that a continuous function on a closed interval was bounded, and then showing that the function attained a maximum and a minimum value.  Both proofs involved what is known today as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem [tpl]harv|Rusnock| Kerr-Lawson|2005[/tpl]. The result was also discovered later by Weierstrass in 1860[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl].

==Functions to which theorem does not apply==

The following examples show why the function domain must be closed and bounded in order for the theorem to apply.  Each fails to attain a maximum on the given interval.
Defining ƒ(0) = 0 in the last two examples shows that both theorems require continuity on a, b.

==Extension to semi-continuous functions==

If the continuity of the function f is weakened to semi-continuity, then the corresponding half of the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem hold and the values –∞ or +∞, respectively, from the extended real number line can be allowed as possible values. More precisely:
Theorem: If a function f : a,b → [–∞,∞) is upper semi-continuous, meaning that
for all x in a,b, then f is bounded above and attains its supremum.
Proof: If f(x) = –∞ for all x in a,b, then the supremum is also –∞ and the theorem is true. In all other cases, the proof is a slight modification of the proofs given below. In the proof of the boundedness theorem, the  upper semi-continuity of f at x only implies that the limit superior of the subsequence {f(xnk)} is bounded above by f(x) nk)} is bounded above by f(d), but this suffices to conclude that f(d) = M. ∎
Applying this result to −f proves:
Theorem: If a function f : a,b → (–∞,∞] is lower semi-continuous, meaning that
for all x in a,b, then f is bounded below and attains its infimum.
A real-valued function is upper as well as lower semi-continuous, if and only if it is continuous in the usual sense. Hence these two theorems imply the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem.

==Topological formulation==

In general topology, the extreme value theorem follows from the general fact that compactness is preserved by continuous functions, and the fact that a subset of the real line is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.

==Proving the theorems==

We look at the proof for the upper bound and the maximum of f. By applying these results to the function –f, the existence of the lower bound and the result for the minimum of f follows. Also note that everything in the proof is done within the context of the real numbers.
We first prove the boundedness theorem, which is a step in the proof of the extreme value theorem. The basic steps involved in the proof of the extreme value theorem are:

===Proof of the boundedness theorem===

===Proof of the extreme value theorem===

By the boundedness theorem, f is bounded from above, hence, by the  Dedekind-completeness of the real numbers, the least upper bound (supremum) M of f exists. It is necessary to find a d in a,b such that M = f(d). Let n be a natural number. As M is the least upper bound, M – 1/n is not an upper bound for f. Therefore, there exists dn in a,b so that M – 1/n n). This defines a sequence {dn}. Since M is an upper bound for f, we have M – 1/n n) ≤ M for all n.  Therefore, the sequence {f(dn)} converges to M.

===Alternative proof of the extreme value theorem===

The set [tpl]nowrap|1= {y ∈ R : y = f(x) for some x ∈ a,b[/tpl]} is a bounded set. Hence, its least upper bound exists by least upper bound property of the real numbers. Let M = sup(f(x)) on a, b.  If there is no point x on a, b so that f(x) = M then
f(x) However, to every positive number ε, there is always some x in a, b such that M − f(x) 1/(M − f(x)) > 1/ε, which means that 1/(M − f(x)) is not bounded.  Since every continuous function on a b is bounded, this contradicts the conclusion that 1/(M − f(x)) was continuous on a, b.  Therefore there must be a point x in a, b such that f(x) = M. ∎

===Proof using the hyperreals===

Hence ƒ(c) ≥ ƒ(x), for all real x, proving c to be a maximum of ƒ.  See [tpl]harvtxt |Keisler|1986|p=164[/tpl].
