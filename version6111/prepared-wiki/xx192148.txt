==Changes from 2007–08==

===Structural changes===

Starting with the 2008–09 season, two-legged relegation playoffs between the third last team of the Bundesliga and the third team of the Second Bundesliga at the end of the regular season were re-introduced.
Due to the restructuring of European competitions, the third-placed team qualified for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, entering in a separate qualifying round for non-champions. The fourth-placed team and the winner of the 2008–09 DFB-Pokal qualified for the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League play-off round; the fifth-placed team qualified for the third qualifying round. The sixth-placed team did not qualify for any European competitions as the UEFA Intertoto Cup will not be continued after its final edition in 2008.

===Promotion and relegation===

FC Nuremberg, Hansa Rostock, and MSV Duisburg finished the 2007–08 season in 16th through 18th place and thus were relegated to the Second Bundesliga. They were replaced by the best three teams of Second Bundesliga 2007–08: Borussia Mönchengladbach, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim and FC Köln.
