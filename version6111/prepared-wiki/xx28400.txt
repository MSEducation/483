[[Euler's theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Modular arithmetic, Theorems in number theory, Articles containing proofs

In number theory, Euler's theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem or Euler's totient theorem) states that if n and a are coprime positive integers, then
where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. (The notation is explained in the article Modular arithmetic.)  In 1736, Euler published his proof of Fermat's little theorem,[ref]See:
There is a converse of Euler's theorem: if the above congruence is true, then a and n must be coprime.
The theorem is a generalization of Fermat's little theorem, and is further generalized by Carmichael's theorem.
The theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo n. For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of 7222, i.e. 7222 (mod 10). Note that 7 and 10 are coprime, and [tpl]nowrap|1=φ(10) = 4[/tpl]. So Euler's theorem yields [tpl]nowrap|74 ≡ 1 (mod 10)[/tpl], and we get 7222 [tpl]nowrap|≡ 74 × 55 + 2[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|≡ (74)55 × 72[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|≡ 155 × 72[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|≡ 49 ≡ 9 (mod 10)[/tpl].
In general, when reducing a power of a modulo n (where a and n are coprime), one needs to work modulo φ(n) in the exponent of a:
Euler's theorem also forms the basis of the RSA encryption system: encryption and decryption in this system together amount to exponentiating the original text by [tpl]nowrap|kφ(n) + 1[/tpl] for some positive integer k, so Euler's theorem shows that the decrypted result is the same as the original.

==Proofs==

1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups:Ireland & Rosen, corr. 1 to prop 3.3.2 
The residue classes (mod n) that are coprime to n form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n for details.) Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case φ(n). If a is any number coprime to n then a is in one of these residue classes, and its powers a, a2, ..., ak ≡ 1 (mod n) are a subgroup. Lagrange's theorem says k must divide φ(n), i.e. there is an integer M such that kM = φ(n). But then,
2. There is also a direct proof:Hardy & Wright, thm. 72Landau, thm. 75 Let R = {x1, x2, ..., xφ(n)} be a reduced residue system (mod  n) and let a be any integer coprime to n. The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by a permutes the xi: in other words if axj  ≡ axk  (mod n) then j = k. (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n.See Bézout's lemma) That is, the sets R and aR = {ax1, ax2, ..., axφ(n)}, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod n), are identical (as sets - they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in R is congruent (mod n) to the product of all the numbers in aR:
