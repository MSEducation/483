James M. Swift was raised in Massachusetts, where American football went through much of its early development, and he is credited with introducing "scientific football" to Michigan State Normal School.[tpl]citation |title=The Aurora |publisher=Michigan State Normal School |year=1893 |page=85[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AHoAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=Trafford+Harvard+football&source=bl&ots=SNxcjo2ooB&sig=m6bQIRHowI_KQxaFDercn48OxLo&hl=en&ei=e54kTePIMYP68AaY57XSAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Trafford%20Harvard%20football&f=false |title=Harvard alumni bulletin, Issue 17 |publisher=Harvard Alumni Association |page=207 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |year=1914[/tpl] Modern records credit Swift as the school's first football coach, holding that position for the 1891 season.[tpl]Cite web|last=Shafer|first=Ian|title=Eastern Michigan University (All seasons results)|publisher=College Football Reference|url=http://cfreference.net/cfr/school.s?m=viewAllSeasons&id=202|accessdate=2011-01-25 |deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Following Swift, the football team was coached by a series of men who held the position for a single year each, none of whom were professional coaches in today's sense. About Deane W. Kelley (1892), Verne S. Bennett (1894), Enoch Thorne (1898), Dwight Watson (1899), Hunter Forest (1903), Daniel Lawrence (1904–1905), Clare Hunter (1909), Curry Hicks (1910), Dwight Wilson (1911), Leroy Brown (1912–1913; basketball also), and Thomas Ransom (1914; basketball also) little is known beyond the years they held the position, the team's schedule, and occasional tidbits from The Aurora, the school yearbook. Other early coaches went on to great success in other fields. Ernest P.

In 1906, in response to charges of professionalism at major college football programs, the faculty at Michigan ruled Schulte and two other football players academically ineligible. As a result, Schulte missed the 1906 season.[tpl]cite web |title=Schulte Barred |work=Michigan Alumnus |year=1906 |page=322 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zIQqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl]

===Elmer Mitchell (1915-1916)===

Elmer Mitchell attended the University of Michigan, where he played on the varsity baseball team for three years, and he was the team captain in 1912, his senior year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kQ_iAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA418&lpg=PA418&dq=Union+High+School+(Grand+Rapids,+Michigan)+Elmer+Mitchell&source=bl&ots=9uK-Auif42&sig=oiZKzk9dK0QvOwgHTyuLxU8tCPM&hl=en&ei=tJM1TbKpOMP98Aao5eiACQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Union%20High%20School%20(Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan)%20Elmer%20Mitchell&f=false |accessdate=2011-01-25 |title=The Michigan Alumnus |volume=23 |year=1917 |publisher=Alumni Association of the University of Michigan |page=418[/tpl] In the fall of 1912, he was hired as a teacher and coach at Union High School, where "he developed state title contenders in baseball, football, and basketball".

===Elton Rynearson (1917, 1919-1920, 1925-1948)===

Following the smallpox-shortened 1916 season,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heritage.com/articles/2010/04/14/ypsilanti_courier/news/doc4bc6482aee7c8010235545.txt |title=From the Archives: Smallpox sweeps over Eastern Michigan campus |date=2010-04-14 |work=Ypsilanti Courier |publisher=Heritage Newspapers |last=Bien |first=Laura |quote=When the 1916 Normal College (EMU) football season was cut short in October, it wasn't due to injuries, or lack of funds, or academic suspensions...The November 3, 1916 Toronto World said, "Coach Mitchell and four members of the Ypsilanti Normal College football eleven were stricken with smallpox yesterday . . .

Although Rynearson's offense was more effective, outscoring opponents 111 to 82, more than half of the scoring came in a single game, a 63-0 rout of Central Michigan, and the team ended the season with a 3-4 record. After the shortened 3-game 1918 season was coached by Lynn Bell, Rynearson returned to coach the 1919 squad to their first winning season in four years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1915 |title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results 1915-1919 |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] After another winning season in 1920, other coaches assumed the duties for four years, during which the team managed a 9-15-4 record.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1920 |title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results 1920-1924 |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl]
Rynearson's return in 1925 sparked the most successful period in school history. From 1925 through 1930, the team achieved a 40-4-2 record, including perfect seasons in 1925 and 1927. From 1925 through 1927 they outscored opponents 405 points to 31 and registered 19 shutouts. They won the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association Championship in 1925, and won the Michigan Collegiate Conference championships in 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1925 |title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results 1925-1929 |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1930 |title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results 1930-1934 |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] Although less dominant, Rynearson's teams continued to have success throughout the 1930s, never having a losing season until the teams of 1940 and 1941 combined for a 2-10-3 record. The 1943 and 1945 teams (there was no team in 1944) were again successful, combining for a 7-0-1 record. However, following the end of World War II, Rynearson's teams again struggled, and he ended his coaching career on a streak of three losing seasons from 1946 through 1948.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1945 |title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results 1945-1949 |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] His 26 seasons as head coach are double those of the next-longest serving coach, and no Eastern Michigan University football coach has reached even half of Rynearson's win total of 114 games.">[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/coaching_records.php |title=Eastern Michigan Coaching Records |work=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] Over the course of his career, he coached at least one year in every varsity sport at Michigan State Normal, including football, basketball, baseball and track,[tpl]cite news|title=Former Coach at EMU Dies Wed.|newspaper=The Record-Eagle (Traverse City, MI)|date=1967-02-09[/tpl] as well as serving as athletic director from 1948 to 1963.

From Kent State he went to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League as the offensive coordinator in 1983. The Argonauts won the Grey Cup in 1983.

===Mike Stock and Bob LaPointe (1978-1982)===

Both Mike Stock and Bob LaPointe had lengthy coaching careers, but their time at Eastern Michigan University is primarily notable for a school-record 27-game losing streak from 1980 through 1982, including a winless season in 1981. Stock was fired after the team lost the first three games of 1982, including a 49-12 pasting at Louisiana Tech and 35-0 shutout at Miami University, bringing the losing streak to 22 games; the team went on to lose five more consecutive games under interim coach Bob LaPointe before the streak was broken with a 9-7 win over Kent State on November 6, 1982. Under LaPointe, the team received widespread attention for their various attempts to end the streak, which included "bringing a coffin to the locker room before the game...as a reminder to [tpl]'[/tpl]kill the streak[tpl]'[/tpl]",[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GNURAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2e4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7109,3892161&dq=bob-lapointe&hl=en |title=New streak: 26 straight losses |last=Shapiro |first=Michael |accessdate=2011-01-26 |date=1982-10-24 |work=The Spokesman-Review |page=C1[/tpl] and hiring a local hypnotist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/sports/sports-people-power-of-suggestion.html?sec=health&&fta=y |title=SPORTS PEOPLE; Power of Suggestion |date=1982-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-26 |work=The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/625737512.html?dids=625737512:625737512&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+22%2C+1982&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Which+spell+will+Huskies+break%3F&pqatl=google |title=Which spell will Huskies break? |accessdate=2011-01-26 |date=1982-10-22 |work=Chicago Tribune |last=Rollow |first=Cooper |page=D1[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1787339222.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+13%2C+1982&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&desc=Hypnotist+tackles+E.+Mich.'s+losing+streak&pqatl=google |title=Hypnotist tackles E.

And, just as he had at Steel Valley, Batch succeeded with his first opportunity, earning all-conference honors and being named his team's offensive MVP. A broken ankle forced him to sit out all of the next season, but in 1997, the NCAA granted him a rare extra year of playing eligibility in his sixth year of college. He knew it would be his one last chance to impress professional scouts, and he made the most of it, setting the school's season and career records.[/tpl] and Rasnick's recruiting noticeably favored junior-college transfers rather than high school seniors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vandelaysports.com/football/recruit/2004/emu.html |title=2004 MAC Football Recruiting - Eastern Michigan Eagles |work=VanDelaySports.com |accessdate=2011-01-23 |quote=The Eagles have 13 players from the metro-Detroit area, which is much different philosophy than the recruiting efforts of the previous coach Jeff Woodruff, or his predecessor, Rick Rasnick, who preferred JUCOs.[/tpl]
