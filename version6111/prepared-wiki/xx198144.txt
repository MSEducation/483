APHA color, also referred to as the Hazen scale, and more appropriately as the Platinum Cobalt(Pt/Co) scale,http://enterprise.astm.org/SUBSCRIPTION/NewValidateSubscription.cgi?D1209-00-HTML is a color standard named for the American Public Health Association and defined by ASTM D1209. It was originally intended to describe the color of waste water, but its usage has expanded to include other industrial applications. APHA color is a color scale sometimes referred to as a “yellowness index” that is used to assess the quality of liquids that are clear to yellowish in color.
It is similar to the Hazen color test, which it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as. The Hazen color test uses a Pt/Co solution and was developed for water treatment facilities where the Color of water could be used as a measure of concentration of dissolved and particulate material.
