The Charter of the United Nations is the foundational treaty of the international organization called the United Nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/ |title=Introductory Note |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09[/tpl] It was signed at the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center in San Francisco, United States, on 26 June 1945, by 50 of the 51 original member countries. (Poland, the other original member, which was not represented at the conference, signed it two months later.) It entered into force on 24 October 1945, after being ratified by the five permanent members of the Security Council—the Republic of China under Chapter II of the United Nations Charter (and currently by the People's Republic of China), France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (later replaced by the Russian Federation), the United Kingdom, and the United States—and a majority of the other signatories.
As a charter, it is a constituent treaty, and all members are bound by its articles. Furthermore, Article 103 of the Charter states that obligations to the United Nations prevail over all other treaty obligations.http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter16.shtml, Chap 16, Article 103 Most countries in the world have now ratified the Charter.

==Summary==

The Charter consists of a preamble and a series of articles grouped into chapters.
The preamble consists of two principal parts. The first part contains a general call for the maintenance of peace and international security and respect for human rights. The second part of the preamble is a declaration in a contractual style that the governments of the peoples of the United Nations have agreed to the Charter.
The following chapters deal with the enforcement powers of UN bodies:

==Charter Provisions==

===Preamble===

The Preamble to the treaty reads as follows:
 We the peoples of the United Nations determined 
 '''And for these ends 
Have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims 
 Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United Nations.
Although the Preamble is an integral part of the Charter, it does not set out any of the rights or obligations of member states; its purpose is to serve as an interpretative guide for the provisions of the Charter through the highlighting of some of the core motives of the founders of the organisation.Report of the Rapporteur of Commission I/1 UNICO VI, pp 446–7, Doc. 944 I/1/34(1).
