After leaving the government in 1964, Pratt joined Pfizer as controller. In 1969, he became Chairman and President of Pfizer International. In 1971, he was elected president of Pfizer, and in 1972 he succeeded Jack Powers as Chairman and CEO.
During Pratt's two decades at the helm, Pfizer evolved into one of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies in the United States. Pratt expanded research and development facilities worldwide, acquired Howmedica and other medical device companies, and introduced of products like Procardia, Feldene, Diflucan, and Norvasc. Under his leadership, annual revenue increased sevenfold, from $1 billion to nearly $7 billion.http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/edmund_pratt.jsp
Pratt's earlier government service in Washington stood him in good stead as the Company grew and played a greater role in national and international matters. As advisor to United States Trade Representative Bill Brock in the mid-1980s, he played an instrumental role encouraging private sector involvement in trade matters. As chairman of the presidentially appointed Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations, he also broadened the trade agenda to include items of global impact, including the issue of intellectual property as a result of Pfizer's diminishing returns. In his own words "We were beginning to notice that we were losing market share developing countries because our intellectual property rights were not being respected in these countries" Santoro, 1996, p6 A member of the IPC trade delegation in the Punta del Este round of the GATT trade talks in 1986, he pushed hard for the creation of a commercially beneficial system of worldwide IP rights.
Pratt served as chairman of the Business Council of New York State, The Business Round Table, and the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations.  On March 1, 1992 Pratt retired as chairman and continued his involvement with the Company as a director of the board until 1997.
During his tenure as head of Pfizer, Ed Pratt was instrumental in the creation of low-income housing around Pfizer's Brooklyn plant, the donation of a Pfizer building for a public charter school, and the economic development and improvements in neighborhood safety. He also held leadership positions in organizations such as the United Way, the Boys Clubs of America, and the Girl Scouts of the USA. He made significant contributions to Long Island University, in 1998, to fund academic, computer, and library facilities and, in 1999, to Duke University which created the Pratt School of Engineering.
Ed Pratt was also one of the visionary early investors of a little-known company Premier Heart, LLC (http://premierheart.com/webapp/contents/index.php), a pioneer in Applied Systems Engineering and innovator of a ground breaking technology Multifunction Cardiogram (11)(.http://premierheart.com/webapp/contents/tech.php) The technology solves one of medicine's most challenging problems - detecting potentially deadly myocardial ischemia caused by critical blockages due to coronary artery disease. Since Prat's passing, Premier Heart has survived and thrived. It will blossom into a technology leader in the field of Computational Electrophysiology. As a new discipline in modern medicine, computational Electrophysiology will open the path for phenotypical physiological sensing technologies to become the main stream. People around the world will benefit from the technologies generated from this field of discipline!
