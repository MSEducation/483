Trade mission is an international trip by government officials and businesspeople that is organized by agencies of national or provincial governments for purpose of exploring international business opportunities. Business people who attend trade missions are typically introduced both to important business contacts and to well-placed government officials. A trade mission is a way in which countries or organisations can seek out potential buyers and sellers. Trade missions will usually occur after one party has undergone significant market research.

In Canada, trade missions which include both the federal and provincial governments working together (perhaps also with cities and private businesses) are called "Team Canada Missions"
