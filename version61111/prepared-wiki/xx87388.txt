[[Ichneumon (medieval zoology)]]

CATEGORIES: European legendary creatures, Legendary mammals, Fictional mustelids

In medieval literature, the ichneumon or echinemon was the enemy of the dragon. When it sees a dragon, the ichneumon covers itself with mud, and closing its nostrils with its tail, attacks and kills the dragon. The ichneumon was also considered by some to be the enemy of the crocodile and the asp, and attack them in the same way. The name was used for the "pharaoh's rat", mongoose, or Egyptian mongoose, which attacks snakes; it can also mean "otter".

==Etymology==

Ichneumon means "tracker" in Greek.  Cockatrice, a name for another mythical beast, derives from calcatrix, a Latin translation of this.

In 18th-century English poet Christopher Smart's "My Cat Jeoffrey," the speaker praises the cat for, among other things, the cat's power to "kill the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land."
