[[List of wine-producing regions]]

CATEGORIES: Wine regions, Wine-related lists

This list of wine-producing regions catalogues significant growing regions where vineyards are planted. Wine grapes mostly grow between the 30th and the 50th degree of latitude, in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Grapes will sometimes grow beyond this range and minor amounts of wine are made in some very unexpected places.
In 2009, the five largest producers of wine in the world were, in order, Italy, France, Spain, the United States and China (see list of wine-producing countries for a complete rank).
