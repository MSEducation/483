==Signs and symptoms==

Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behavior, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dobie|first=C|title=Diagnosis and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in primary care for school-age children and adolescents|year=2012|page=79|url=http://guidelines.gov/content.aspx?f=rss&id=36812|publisher=Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html |title=Facts About ADHD |publisher=NCBDDD |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=13 November 2012 [/tpl] Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships. The symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.[tpl]cite book|author=Ramsay, J. Russell |title=Cognitive behavioral therapy for adult ADHD|publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |isbn=0-415-95501-7 |page=25[/tpl][tpl]Rp|p.26[/tpl]
To be diagnosed per the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), symptoms must be observed in two different settings for six months or more and to a degree that is greater than other children of the same age.[tpl]cite book|last=Association]|first=[American Psychiatry|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersAmerican Psychiatric Associati.|year=2013|publisher=AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING|location=Arlington|isbn=0890425558|pages=59–65|edition=5th[/tpl]
Based on the presenting symptom ADHD can be divided into three subtypes—predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, or combined if criteria for both types are met.[tpl]Rp|p.4[/tpl]
An individual with inattention may have some or all of the following symptoms:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml |title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) |author=National Institute of Mental Health |authorlink=National Institute of Mental Health |year=2008 |publisher=National Institutes of Health |location=United States [/tpl]
An individual with hyperactivity may have some or all of the following symptoms:
Note: These hyperactivity symptoms tend to go away with age and turn into "inner restlessness" in teens and adults with ADHD.
An individual with impulsivity may have some or all of the following symptoms:
People with ADHD more often have difficulties with social skills, such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with ADHD have attention deficits which cause difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They also may drift off during conversations, and miss social cues.[tpl]cite journal |author=Coleman WL |title=Social competence and friendship formation in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Adolesc Med State Art Rev |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=278–99, x |date=August 2008 |pmid=18822833[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

===Brain structure===

The pathophysiology of ADHD is unclear with there being a number of competing explanations. In children with ADHD there is a general reduction of brain volume, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided prefrontal cortex. The brain pathways connecting the prefrontal cortex and the striatum also appears to be involved. This suggest that inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity may reflect frontal lobe dysfunction, with addition brain regions such as the cerebellum also being implicated.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Krain|first1=Amy |year=2006 |title=Brain development and ADHD |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=433–444 |id= |url=|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.01.005 |pmid=16480802 |last2=Castellanos |first2=AL |last3=Castellanos |first3=FX[/tpl] Other brain systems related to attention have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD.[tpl]cite journal |author=Castellanos FX, Proal E |title=Large-scale brain systems in ADHD: beyond the prefrontal-striatal model |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Neurotransmitters===

Previously it was thought that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology but it appears that the elevated numbers are due to adaptation to exposure to stimulants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fusar-Poli P, Rubia K, Rossi G, Sartori G, Balottin U |title=Striatal dopamine transporter alterations in ADHD: pathophysiology or adaptation to psychostimulants?

===Executive function===

One theory of suggests that the symptoms arise from a difficulty in executive functions.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = TE. | title = ADD/ADHD and Impaired Executive Function in Clinical Practice | journal = Curr Psychiatry Rep | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 407–411 |date=Oct 2008 | doi =  10.1007/s11920-008-0065-7| pmid = 18803914 [/tpl] Executive functions refers to a number of mental processes that are required to regulate, control, and manage daily life tasks. Some of these impairments include: problems with organizational skills, time keeping, excessive procrastination, concentration problems, processing speed, regulating emotions, using working memory and short-term memory problems. People usually have decent long-term memory.

In North America, the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria are often used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-10. With the DSM-IV criteria a diagnosis of ADHD is 3–4 times more likely than with the ICD-10 criteria. It is classified as a psychiatric disorder of the neurodevelopmental disorder type. Additionally it is classified as a disruptive behavior disorder along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.[tpl]Cite book|author=Wiener, Jerry M., Editor |title=Textbook Of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2003|isbn=1-58562-057-2 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIgGKcp0SpkC |accessdate=17 January 2014 [/tpl] A diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorder.

===Diagnostic and Statistical Manual===

As with many other psychiatric disorders, formal diagnosis is made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States these criteria are defined by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Based on the DSM-criteria, there are three sub types of ADHD:
This subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both.[tpl]cite journal |author=Steinau S |title=Diagnostic Criteria in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Changes in DSM 5 |journal=Front Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue= |page=49|year=2013 |pmid=23755024 |pmc=3667245 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00049 |url=[/tpl] To be considered, the symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The signs must be not appropriate for a child of that age[tpl]cite journal |author=Berger I|title=Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: much ado about something|url=http://www.ima.org.il/FilesUpload/IMAJ/0/40/20032.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Isr. Med. Assoc. J.|volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=571–4 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21991721 |doi= [/tpl] and there must be evidence that it is causing social, school or work related problems.
Most children with ADHD have the combined type. Children with the inattention subtype are less likely to act out or have difficulties getting along with other children. They may sit quietly, but without paying attention resulting in the child difficulties being overlooked.[tpl]cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC|year=2000|pages=|isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]

===International Classification of Diseases===

In the tenth edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) the signs of ADHD are given the name "hyperkinetic disorders". When a conduct disorder (as defined by ICD-10)[tpl]cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=World Health Organisation |accessdate=17 January 2014 [/tpl] is present, the condition is referred to as hyperkinetic conduct disorder. Otherwise the disorder is classified as disturbance of activity and attention, other hyperkinetic disorders or hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified.  The latter is sometimes referred to as, hyperkinetic syndrome.

===Adults===

Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. Questioning parents or guardians as to how the person behaved and developed as a child may form part of the assessment; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis. While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children, for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.

===Differential===

Symptoms of ADHD such as low mood and poor self-image, mood swings, and irritability can be confused with dysthymia, cyclothymia or bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder. Some of the symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders, antisocial personality disorder, developmental disabilities or mental retardation or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with some ADHD. These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD. Medical conditions which can cause ADHD type symptoms include: hyperthyroidism, seizure disorder, lead toxicity, hearing deficits, hepatic disease, sleep apnea, drug interactions, and head injury.

==Epidemiology==

ADHD is estimated to affect about 6–7% of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria. When diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria rates in this age group are estimated at 1–2%. Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Polanczyk G, de Lima MS, Horta BL, Biederman J, Rohde LA |title=The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: a systematic review and metaregression analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=942–8 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17541055 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.6.942[/tpl] If the same diagnostic methods are used rates are more or less the same between countries.

Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is. It is believed that changes to the diagnostic criteria in 2013 with the release of the DSM V will increase the percentage of people with ADHD especially among adults.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dalsgaard|first=S|title=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)|journal=European child & adolescent psychiatry|date=February 2013|volume=22 Suppl 1|pages=S43–8|pmid=23202886|doi=10.1007/s00787-012-0360-z[/tpl]

With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis. Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the medicalization of deviant behavior, or in other words, the turning of the previously non medical issue of school performance into a medical one. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder, at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms. Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers around diagnosis and treatment in the much larger number of people with less severe symptoms.
[tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], 8% of all United States Major League Baseball players had been diagnosed with ADHD, making the disorder common among this population. The increase coincided with the League's 2006 ban on stimulants, which has raised concern that some players are mimicking or falsifying the symptoms or history of ADHD to get around the ban on the use of stimulants in sport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2208429/|title=Doping Deficit Disorder.

===Media commentary===

A number of notable individuals have given controversial statements regarding ADHD. Tom Cruise has referred to the medications Ritalin and Adderall as "street drugs".  Ushma S. Neill criticized this view, stating that the doses of stimulants used in the treatment of ADHD do not cause behavioral addiction and that there is some evidence of a reduced risk of later substance addiction in children treated with stimulants.[tpl]cite journal|author=Neill US |title=Tom Cruise is dangerous and irresponsible |journal=J.

==Special populations==

===Adults===

It is estimated that between 2–5% of adults have ADHD. Around half of children with ADHD continue to have ADHD as adults. Of those who continue to have symptoms approximately 25% have the full disorder and 75% partially 'grow out' of it. Most adults remain untreated.[tpl]cite journal |author=Culpepper, L, Mattingly G |title=Challenges in identifying and managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults in the primary care setting: a review of the literature |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages= PCC.10r00951|year=2010 |pmid=21494335 |pmc=3067998 |doi=10.4088/PCC.10r00951pur |url=[/tpl] Many have a disorganized life and use non-prescribed drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism. Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities.

Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax or talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as substance abuse and gambling are common. The DSM-IV criteria have been criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who present differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis.

===Children with high IQ scores===

The diagnosis of ADHD and the significance of its impact on children with a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is controversial. Most studies have found similar impairments regardless of IQ, with higher rates of repeating grades and having social difficulties. Additionally, more than half of people with high IQ and ADHD experience major depressive disorder or oppositional defiant disorder at some point in their lives. Generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder and social phobia are also more common.
