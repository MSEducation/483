David Lloyd Blackwood, CM, O.Ont (born November 7, 1941) is a Canadian artist.
Blackwood is known chiefly for his intaglio prints, often depicting dramatic historical scenes of Newfoundland outport life and industry, such as shipwrecks, seal hunting, iceberg encounters, and resettlement. He considers himself a "visual storyteller," and also produces paintings, drawings and woodcuts.
