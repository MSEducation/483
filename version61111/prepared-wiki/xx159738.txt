The UB40 File is a compilation album of all of UB40's 1980 Graduate recordings.  The album first appeared as a double vinyl LP in 1985 and features all the tracks from Signing Off on Record One, the 3 tracks from the 12" single that accompanied Signing Off on the first side of Record Two with the tracks released as singles that didn't feature on the debut album on side 2.
A CD followed in 1986.  The band's official website lists "The Earth Dies Screaming" and "Dream a Lie" as being the 12" extended versions.
The album is very similar to the 1983 compilation More UB40 Music released in The Netherlands.
