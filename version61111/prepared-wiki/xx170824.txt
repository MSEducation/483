CATEGORIES: Serie D seasons, 2007–08 domestic association football leagues, 2007–08 in Italian football leagues

Serie D, the fifth level of Italian Football, is composed of 162 teams divided into nine divisions of 18 teams each.
The regular Serie D season started September 2, 2007 and continued through to May 4, 2008 with each team playing 34 matches, two matches against every other team in the division. The nine division winners were automatically promoted to Serie C2 for the 2008-09 season, while the two last-placed teams were automatically relegated to Eccellenza.
After the regular season is complete, teams placed 13 through to 16 in each division played a double-leg series (13 vs 16, 14 vs 15) where the winners remained in Serie D the following season and the two losers were also relegated to Eccellenza for a total of 4 relegations in each division, 36 in total for the league.
The nine division winners entered a tournament to determine the over-all Serie D champion and was awarded the Scudetto Dilettanti.
Teams placed second through fifth in each division entered a playoff tournament after the regular season as well. The results of the playoffs provided a list, starting with the winner, by which vacancies could be filled in Serie C2, now called Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, if teams in the professional leagues above Serie D run into financial difficulties or are penalized.

In addition to the nine division winners, the top five teams in the promotional play-offs also won promotion to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to fill vacancies.

===Relegations===

Thirty-six teams were destined to be relegated to Eccellenza for the 2008-09 season.  The two last-placed teams from each of the nine divisions were directly relegated - 18 in total.  Of the 18 teams that lost in the relegation play-offs, nine were eventually selected to remain in Serie D for the 2008-09 season in order to fill the vacancies created when nine extra teams were called up from Serie D to Serie C2, now called Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
The nine vacancies in Serie C2 were created by the bankruptcies and other financial problems of nine teams in total that played in Serie B, C1 & C2 in 2007-08.  As teams moved up to fill the void, nine spaces were left to be filled in Serie C2.  As mentioned, five teams that played in Serie D in 2007-08 received extra promotions, while four teams initially relegated from C2 were called back.
After the 162-team list was set for the 2008-09 season, the league decided to place four of the nine financially troubled teams of the upper leagues in Serie D as well, resulting in a 166-team Serie D league for next season.
