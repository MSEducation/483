Challenging Times is a quiz show for teams representing higher education institutes in Ireland, both those in the Republic of Ireland and those in Northern Ireland.  It was televised by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) from 1991 to 2001, sponsored by The Irish Times, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper.[ref]

The programme used a quizbowl format similar to that of University Challenge in the United Kingdom, which is itself a licensed version of the College Bowl format popular in the United States. Each year, 16 teams qualified for the televised knockout stages, with two teams of three competing in each programme up to the final.
The programme was cancelled after the 2001 series, at a time when RTÉ was in financial difficulties.[tpl]cite news |title=  Independent producers bemoan cutbacks |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/03/24/story46842728.asp |first=Catherine |last=O'Mahony |date=2002-03-24 |work=Sunday Business Post |accessdate=2007-05-31 [/tpl]  
The final of that series was postponed at short notice and an episode of The Simpsons was broadcast instead.[tpl]cite news |title=Final of quiz series replaced by `Simpsons' |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2001/0531/archive.01053100022.html |first=Patsy |last=McGarry |date=2001-05-31 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=2007-05-31 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  
Kevin Myers later complained that RTÉ had given The Irish Times no notice that the series was being discontinued,[tpl]cite news |title=An Irishman's Diary |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2001/0712/archive.01071200101.html |first=Kevin |last=Myers |authorlink=Kevin Myers |date=2001-07-12 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=2007-05-30 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] 
though RTÉ disputed this contention.[tpl]cite news |title='Challenging Times' |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2001/1128/archive.01112800092.html |date=2001-11-28 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=2007-05-30 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
