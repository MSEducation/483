The Oakwood Historic District is an old neighborhood in Raleigh, North Carolina that contains the cityâ€™s largest collection of Victorian architecture and many other early-to-mid twentieth century styles. It is Raleigh's earliest white middle-class suburb, and unlike later suburbs, it developed lot-by-lot over time, instead of by platted sections. Its Victorian-era architectural styles include Second Empire, Queen Anne, and Italianate. Later infill brought the bungalow, the foursquare, Craftsman style, and the Minimal Traditional house to the area.
Oakwood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and is also one of six local historic overlay districts (HOD). Several Oakwood residences are also individually recognized as Local Historic Landmarks.
