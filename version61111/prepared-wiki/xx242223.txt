==Euthanasia==

Dowbiggin has written on the history of the euthanasia movement, including A Merciful End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America (2003) and A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine (2005). He links the rise of euthanasia to an intellectual shift that took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, away from the moral precepts of the Judeo-Christian tradition. One important cause of this shift was Darwinism, which had questioned the right of the "unfit" – such as the mentally handicapped – to live. Along with other intellectual currents such as social progressivism and Unitarianism, this led physicians and people like the founder of the Euthanasia Society of America, Charles Francis Potter, to accept the practice of euthanasia.[tpl]cite web |last = Weikart |first = Richard |year = 2004 |title = Killing Them Kindly: Lessons from the euthanasia movement |url = http://www.csustan.edu/history/faculty/Weikart/killing.htm |publisher=California State University |accessdate = July 23, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Larson | first = Edward | year = 2004 | title = Review: Euthanasia in America: Past, Present, and Future: A Review of a "Merciful End" and "Forced Exit" | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 1245–1262 |publisher=University of Michigan Law School |jstor = 4141944[/tpl]
According to a review of A Concise History of Euthanasia by Sandra Woien in the American Journal of Bioethics, Dowbiggin sees euthanasia and eugenics as the inevitable results of abandoning the moral guidance of religion in medicine. Woien found that the book overemphasised the relationship between eugenics and euthanasia, and muddied "important conceptual and practical distinctions", but allowed that it may be "useful in understanding the historical context of euthanasia."[tpl]cite journal | last = Woien | first = Sandra | year = 2007 | title = Review of Ian Dowbiggin, A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine and Neal Nicol and Harry Wylie, Between the Dying and the Dead: Dr. Jack Kevorkian’s Life and the Battle to Legalize Euthanasia | journal = American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 7  | issue = 11 | pages = 50–52 |url=http://philpapers.org/archive/WOIROI.1.pdf |publisher=Taylor & Francis |accessdate=January 30, 2012[/tpl]
The Canadian Historical Association awarded Dowbiggin the Wallace K. Ferguson Prize for A Merciful End, stating that the book "gives a clear and evenly-balanced study of the history of euthanasia in the United States since the latter part of the nineteenth century", and concluded that it overall is a "masterful explanation of the way in which changing social, economic and disease-related factors have affected public interest in euthanasia."[tpl]cite web |url=http://cha-shc.ca/en/Prizes_24/items/10.html |title=The Wallace K.

Dowbiggin has spoken against euthanasia legislation and said that the Netherlands exists as a "cautionary lesson" for Canada in particular, showing that those places that "take a permissive attitude to assisted suicide keep pushing the boundaries."[tpl]cite web | last = Casey | first = Donna |date=November 2, 2007 | url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/11/02/4625978-sun.html |title=Debating euthanasia | work =CNews |publisher=Sun Media |accessdate= July 23, 2011 [/tpl]

==Sterilization==

Dowbiggin published the book The Sterilization Movement and Global Fertility in the Twentieth Century in 2008. Drawing on scholarly sources, the book is primarily an account of sterilization as used for the purposes of eugenics and population control, examples including the use of sterilization by European fascists and the Indian mass sterilization program carried out during the 1975–1977 Emergency in India, which contributed to the downfall of Indira Gandhi's government.
Ulf Högberg, guest researcher of Public Health and Clinical Medicine at Umeå University, argued in the European Journal of Public Health  that, "The book is most impressive, finely tuning the history between choice and compulsion of sterilization policy; sometimes it has been a fine line in between, sometimes an abyss of abuse of human rights."[tpl]cite journal |author=Ulf Högberg |date=November 11, 2008 |title=Ian Dowbiggin, The sterilization movement and global fertility in the twentieth century |journal=European Journal of Public Health |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=121 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckn112  |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/1/121.full |accessdate=January 26, 2012 [/tpl]
A review in the The New England Journal of Medicine, by Carolyn Westhoff, an official of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, summed up by agreeing with the book's conclusion that "advocacy of sterilization as a solution to population growth leads to serious problems when that agenda overrides individual values and individual autonomy", but differed from it in stating that "Voluntary sterilization, however, deserves its great popularity and will remain valuable as one part of a broader menu of options for family planning."
