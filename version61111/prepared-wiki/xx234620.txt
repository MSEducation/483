==History==

contemode was created in 2003 by Yasutaka Nakata to primarily serve as a label for capsule, an electronic music duo he formed in 1997 with vocalist Toshiko Koshijima. Nakata had a significant amount of involvement with the artists who were signed to or worked in conjunction with his label, and described the music that came from contemode as an "accessory to fashion"; contemode artists' music was often sold in fashion boutiques located in Shibuya. Gradually over contemode's lifespan, less and less artists were signed to the label, until the point where the only remaining active artists were capsule and Nakata himself. Nakata has since moved to Japanese management company ASOBISYSTEM and Warner Music Japan's label unBORDE.
