==History==

Featherstone Lions are the result of a merger between Jubilee Hotel and Traveller's amateur sides in the early 1990s.
Featherstone's first season, 1994-95, was in the CMS Yorkshire league First Division. At the end of the 1995-96 season, they had won promotion to the Yorkshire League Premier Division and finished 2nd in the table.
They were accepted into National Conference League Division 2 for the 1996-97 season. In 1997-98, Featherstone Lions won promotion to NCL Division 1 as champions, won the Yorkshire Cup beating Siddal in a bad tempered final at Thrum Hall and beat Doncaster in the third round of the Challenge Cup before losing to Hull Kingston Rovers.
Featherstone reached the fourth round of the Challenge Cup, in 1998-99, after beating Hemel Stags before playing Super League side Halifax.
In 2000-01, Featherstone reached the National Cup Final before losing to Thatto Heath at Spotland Stadium, Rochdale.
The following year, the Lions narrowly avoided relegation but in 2002-03 were promoted to NCL Premier League. However, they were relegated back to NCL Division 1 in their first season and followed this with another relegation back down to NCL Division 2.
Following this double relegation, Featherstone withdrew from National Conference to rebuild the open age team. In 2006, they joined National League Three which they won a year later under its new name RLC National Division.
