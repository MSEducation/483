Czartak ([tpl]IPA-pl|ˈtʂart̪ak[/tpl]) was a regional literary group in Poland, founded by Emil Zegadłowicz. Its most famous member was Zofia Kossak-Szczucka.
Czartak's program may be described as a mystical naiveté that joined a love of nature with a disgust for modern civilization. Czartak's writers were fascinated by expressionism.
