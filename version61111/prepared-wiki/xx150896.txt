[[United States cities by crime rate (40,000â€“60,000)]]

CATEGORIES: Crime rates in the United States

The following table is based on Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports statistics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010|publisher=FBI|title=Crime in the United States by Metropolitan Statistical Area, 2010 (Table 6)|accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl] 
The population numbers are based on U.S. Census estimates for the year end.  The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter.  This list is based on the reporting agency.  In most cases the city and the reporting agency are identical.  However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu and Las Vegas, the reporting agency as more than one city.
Murder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report.  Consequently some agencies particularly in Illinois do not report all the crimes.  If components are missing the total is adjusted to "0."

==Note about population==

Data is voluntarily submitted by each jurisdiction and some jurisdictions do not appear in the table because they either did not submit data or it did not meet deadlines.
According to the FBI website has this disclaimer on population estimates:

==2012 Calendar Year Ratios of Crime Per 100,000 Population==

==Criticism of ranking crime data==

The FBI web site recommends against using its data for ranking because these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/caution-against-ranking |title=Caution Against Ranking|publisher=FBI|accessdate=August 8, 2012[/tpl] The FBI web site also recommends against using its data to judge how effective law enforcement agencies are, since there are many factors that influence crime rates other than law enforcement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/word.htm|title=A Word About UCR Data|publisher=FBI|accessdate=12 October 2010[/tpl] 
In November 2007, the executive board of the American Society of Criminology (ASC) went further than the FBI itself, and approved a resolution opposing not only the use of the ratings to judge police departments, but also opposing any development of city crime rankings from FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) at all. The resolution opposed these rankings on the grounds that they "fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates" and "divert attention from the individual and community characteristics that elevate crime in all cities", though it did not provide sources or further elaborate on these claims. The resolution states the rankings "represent an irresponsible misuse of the data and do groundless harm to many communities" and "work against a key goal of our society, which is a better understanding of crime-related issues by both scientists and the public".Criminologists Condemn City crime rankings (November 16, 2008).PRNewswire. Retrieved on January 13, 2008. 
The U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a similar statement, which also committed the Conference to working with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice "to educate reporters, elected officials, and citizens on what the (UCR) data means and doesn't mean."
