[[Moment (physics)]]

CATEGORIES: Physical quantities, Length

In physics, moment relates to the perpendicular distance from a point to a line or a surface, and is derived from the mathematical concept of moments.Robertson, D.G.E.; Caldwell, G.E.; Hamill, J.; Kamen, G.; and Whittlesey, S.N. (2004) Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL:Human Kinetics Publ., p. 285. It is frequently used in combination with other physical quantities as in moment of inertia, moment of force, moment of momentum, magnetic moment and so on.
Moment is also used colloquially for different physical quantities that depend upon distance. For example, in engineering and kinesiology the term moment is often used instead of the more complete term moment of force. A moment of force is the product of the distance of a force from an axis times the magnitude of the force, i.e., F Ã— d, where F is the magnitude of the force and d is the moment of the force. See torque for a more complete description of moments of force or couple for the related concept free moment of force also known as a force couple.
