Children of God is the fifth studio album by American post-punk band Swans. It was released in 1987, through record label Caroline.

==Background==

The album marks a change in direction from Swans' early work. More tracks utilize acoustic guitars and more melodic vocals. The lyrics also focus more prominently on religious themes.

==Release history==

Children of God was re-issued along with some songs by World of Skin on CD in 1997 as Children of God/World of Skin. On this re-release, the original album version of "Our Love Lies" was replaced with the version included on the Love Will Tear Us Apart EP. Also, the re-release added "Damn You to Hell" and "I'll Swallow You" (under one title as "I'll Swallow You") from the New Mind single as a bonus.
