The Detroit Area Library Network (DALNET) is a multi-type library consortium located on the campus of Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, USA.  The consortium, incorporated in 1985, is open to academic, public, school and special libraries as well as information organizations located in any of the seven Southeast Michigan, Metropolitan Detroit counties, including Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, St. Clair, Monroe, Livingston, and Washtenaw counties. 
To make a regional information gateway possible, consortium members agree to share in projects that include the "DALNET Information Gateway" of online library systems, resource sharing services and cooperations, and other digital information projects.  The consortium also hosts the healthcalendar.org project, a website calendar listing health-related, group events to citizens in the region.
