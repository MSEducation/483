The State Farm Research and Development Center opened in January 2005 at the University of Illinois’ Research Park. State Farm has been involved in academic programming, student assistance and research at U of I for over 35 years, but this facility allows for a captive audience of college interns working on projects to benefit the company as a whole, while students get to apply what they learn in class to real business problems.State Farm Research Center

==MAGNet==

Students have an opportunity to apply analytical skills to State Farm business issues through MAGNet, short for the Modeling and Analytic Graduate Network. Students in MAGNet are expected to enroll in a new master’s curriculum created via a relationship between State Farm and the U of I’s Statistics Department. MAGNet is similar to a 50% graduate assistantship as students work at the Research & Development Center 20 hours per week during academic semesters and receive a pay rate similar to that of graduate assistants at the university. Students are also offered tuition assistance while working in MAGNet. Those staying on in the summer will work full time and receive higher pay. Interested students apply in the fall of their senior year and begin work the summer before their graduate program begins.http://www.stat.uiuc.edu/MagnetBrief.pdf

==Center for Consumer Feedback==

Another portion of the Research & Development Center is the Center for Consumer Feedback (CCF). This part of the Research & Development Center mostly hires students or community members on a part-time basis and not as part of an internship. The CCF is said to be one of the most state-of-the-art outbound call facilities in the country. The center collects consumer research via phone and online surveys. Hiring processes for the CCF are conducted through Spherion (spherioncareers.com).State Farm Research Center

==Name Change==

In the second half of 2009 the State Farm Research Center officially changed its name to the State Farm Research and Development Center. The addition of "and Development" came about from a natural evolution in the work being done at the research center. When founded in 2005, most interns produced whitepapers based on Internet and other types of research. However, by 2009 research center interns were also frequently involved in developing application prototypes. The focus had shifted from pure research activities to research and development.
