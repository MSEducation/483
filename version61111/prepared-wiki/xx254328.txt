"Since the girls at the telemarketing company I was using then wouldn't say 'Sergeant Pecker,' I told the crowds at the tapings for the next CD that I decided to make it a bit more cryptic and call the next one Hot Dogs & Donuts, figuring if somebody made something sexual of it that it was as much them as it was me. Nancy Sirianni, my production partner & wife, came up with the photo ideas and spelling out the name with hot dogs & donuts. I recorded Hot Dogs & Donuts at The Comedy Palace in Andover, Massachusetts. Ron Sava's club always had the kind of buzz that I could only always count on in a few places. One of the others was Rascals in West Orange, where they taped the "Stump The Joke Man" footage that's on the DVD we included with Snart. I had edited almost the entire Hot Dogs & Donuts CD when I performed at The Comedy Palace again. From listening for hours and hours as I edited, the jokes were even more deeply & perfectly engrained in my little head, so I blasted away at those crowds like never before. The tapes from that weekend pushed the older tapes off the shelf and I started editing again. But that editing was minimal. The finished product is pretty funny and a healthy leap dirtier than the first two CD's. Not by design, it just is."
