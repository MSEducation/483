The Violent Land (Portuguese: Terras do Sem Fim) is a Brazilian Modernist novel written by Jorge Amado in 1943. It describes the development of cacao plantations in the forests of the Bahia state of Brazil. Amado wrote that "No other of my books. . . is as dear to me as The Violent Land", and suggested that the novel belongs to a distinct Brazilian "literature of cacao". By 1965, the book had been adapted as a film, as well as for the stage, television and radio.
