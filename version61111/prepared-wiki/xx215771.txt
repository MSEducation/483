Indigenous people of Sikkim include the  Lepchas and Bhutias  in contrast to the dominant heterogeneous Nepali population of Sikkim.

==History==

The Lepcha is the earliest ethnic group settled Sikkim. The Sikkim was named by Limboo/Subba.The believe they are the autochthones while others considered that they were settled by the thirteenth century, coming from the Assam hills before the arrival of the Tibetan Bhutias.[tpl]cite book|title=Sikkim: Past and Present |first=H.G. |last=Goshi |chapter=Chapter 3: History of Sikkim: A Himalayan Kingdom |page=60 |publisher=Mittal Publications |year=2004 |ISBN=81-7099-932-4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L7gIVNzkN2YC[/tpl] The Bhutia who immigrated to Sikkim claimed descent from a common ancestor, a Khampa prince or chief named Khye-bum-sar, and were divided into fourteen main families.[tpl]cite book|title=Sikkim: Geographical Perspectives |first=Maitreyee |last=Choudhury |publisher=Mittal Publications |year=2006 |pages=25–28 |ISBN=81-8324-158-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W9EwNfXkxZwC[/tpl] Relations between the Lepcha and Tibetan peoples began in the thirteenth century with the signing of a blood brotherhood by the Lepcha Chief Thekong Tek and the Tibetan Prince Khye Bumsa at Kabi Lungchok in north Sikkim. The Bhutias introduced Buddhism to the region.
In 1642, the Bhutia established a monarchy headed by the Chogyal ([tpl]bo|t=ཆོས་རྒྱལ་|w=chos rgyal[/tpl]; divine king), and opened relations with Tibet. By the founding of the Bhutia monarchy, Tibetan sources considered Tibetans (Bhutia), Lepchas, and Limbus to be the "original races of the kingdom."
Around 1819, the Lepchas were still the most numerous population, comprising roughly half of all Sikkimese, followed by Bhutias (30%) and Limbus (20%); sources disagree on whether the Bhutias outnumbered the Limbu or vice-versa, but in any event, the Limbu frequently intermarried with the Lepcha. At this time there was apparently no appreciable Nepali population present.
Throughout the nineteenth century, further groups of Tibetans known as Rui-chhung ("little families") migrated to Sikkim under British rule. 
Between the 1890s and the early 1900s, the large scale immigration of Nepalis began, encouraged by colonial landlords in order to raise rents in otherwise densely forested Sikkim.[tpl]cite book|work=Criminal Justice India Series |title=Sikkim |first1=N.

Discrimination between the heterogeneous Nepalese and other groups became a pressing social issue, however the government of the Chogyal in its later years strove to treat all subjects equally as citizens, and allowed democratic changes to move forward. These democratic and demographic changes culminated in a plebiscite in 1974, resulting in union with India as a State. Since joining India, indigenous groups have expressed anxiety over losing land, resources and power to those they view as non-Sikkimese "far above them in terms of political consciousness, resource position, education and manipulative qualities."[tpl]rp|79[/tpl]

==Indigenous cultures==

The indigenous Sikkimese show wide cultural variation.  
The Lepcha  speak Lepcha and use Lepcha script. Both the Lepcha and Limbu scripts are descended from the Tibetan script.[tpl]cite book|last1=Daniels |first1=Peter T. |first2=William |last2=Bright |title=The World's Writing Systems |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996[/tpl] Traditionally, Lepcha men wear gadas and tie a patang, a kind of weapon, on their waist and don a bamboo cap; women wear distinctive dresses and ornaments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snowlinenews.com/The%20People%20of%20Sikkim-.htm |title=The Ethnic People of Sikkim: Their Lifestyles and Their Cultures |author=Bijaya Bantawa (ed.) |work=Snowline News online |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] Among Lepchas, there is a tradition of nuclear family structure and of monogamous marriage; though divorce is relatively rare, widowed persons customarily remarry.
Traditionally, the Lepcha practice a religion centered around shamans called mun, who officiate ceremonies and festivals, and bóngthíng, who are healers and are often female.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lepcha.info/religion.htm |title=The Lepcha religion |work=Information on Lepcha Language and Culture |author=Heleen Plaisier |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2011-01-17[/tpl] The Lepcha converted to Buddhism in the eighteenth century, though their beliefs are largely syncretic.
Bhutias speak Sikkimese, which is also referred to as Dranjongke, written in the Tibetan script, proper. Men and women wear bakhus, while for women only this is accompanied by a hongu (blouse) around which they tie a woolen cloth around their waist called pangden if they are married.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/tribes/bhutiatribes.html |title=Bhutia Tribes |work=Indian Mirror online |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] On special occasions they wear a scarf called a khada, which has become common feature in the Sikkimese society and culture even among the Nepalese of Sikkim. Historically, the Bhutia practiced polyandry before the nineteenth century; during the nineteenth century, wife-sharing among male siblings was also practiced, however neither tradition survives today.[tpl]rp|30[/tpl] Marriage rituals are traditionally elaborate and festive, officiated by a village chief as opposed to a Buddhist lamas; late marriage and divorce are not uncommon practices among the Bhutia.[tpl]rp|30[/tpl]
Most  Lepcha, and Bhutia today practice local forms of Buddhism, incorporating aspects of Bön religion and animism, in contrast to the Hindu Nepalese majority. Followers of Buddhism in Sikkim are largely either Karmapa or Nyingma, though a small section of Bhutias claim to adhere to Bön in particular. Since the arrival of the Nepalese and Western missionaries, few Lepchas have converted to Christianity.

==Contemporary issues==

Lepchas are suffering from a feeling of inferiority, some denying they are Lepchas, while Nepalis who seek to integrate them label Lepchas as Bhutias.[tpl]Cite book|last=Awasty |first=Indira |title=Between Sikkim and Bhutan - The Lepchas and Bhutias of Pedong |publisher=B.R.
