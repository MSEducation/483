Bacup [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ay|k|ʌ|p[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Miller|1971|p=8[/tpl]. is a town within the Rossendale borough of Lancashire, England. It is located amongst the South Pennines, along Lancashire's eastern boundary with West Yorkshire. The town sits within a rural setting in the Forest of Rossendale, amongst the steep-sided upper-Irwell Valley, through which the River Irwell passes. It is [tpl]convert|3.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] east of Rawtenstall, [tpl]convert|6.4|mi|km|1[/tpl] north of Rochdale, and [tpl]convert|21|mi|km|0[/tpl] east of Preston. At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Bacup—which encompasses the outlying communities of Britannia, Stacksteads, Rockcliffe, Trough Gate and Weir—had a population of 12,763.
Bacup emerged as a settlement following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the Early Middle Ages. For centuries, Bacup was a small and obscure centre of domestic flannel and woollen cloth production, and many of the original weavers' cottages survive today as listed buildings. Following the Industrial Revolution Bacup became a mill town, its landscape dominated by distinctive and large rectangular woollen and cotton mills. Bacup received a charter of incorporation in 1882, giving it municipal borough status and its own elected town government, consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors to oversee local affairs.
In the late 20th century Bacup became part of the borough of Rossendale – at which time the town was suffering from chronic depopulation and urban decay with little in the way of infrastructural change in a century. Nevertheless, Bacup's historic character, culture and festivities have encouraged the town's suburbanisation and redevelopment as a commuter town; English Heritage has proclaimed Bacup as the best preserved cotton town in England, and its town centre is designated as a conservation area for its special architectural qualities.

==History==

The name Bacup is derived from the Old English fūlbæchop. The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names translates this as "muddy valley by a ridge"; the fūl- element, which meant "foul" or "muddy" was used in the earliest known reference to the area, in a charter by Robert de Lacey, around the year 1200, as used in the Middle English spelling fulebachope. The prefix ful- was dropped from the toponym.[tpl]harvnb|Mills|2003|p=28[/tpl]. The -bæchop element is less clear, possibly meaning "ridge valley", or else  "back valley" referring to the locale's position at the back part of the Irwell Valley.[tpl]harvnb|Fenton|2006|p=5[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Cameron|1961|p=182[/tpl].
Bacup and its hinterland has provided archeological evidence of human activity in the area during the Neolithic.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=45228|publisher=pastscape.org.uk|accessdate=27 October 2009|title=Monument No. 45228[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=887154|publisher=pastscape.org.uk|accessdate=27 October 2009|title=Monument No. 887154[/tpl] Anglo-Saxons settled in the Early Middle Ages. It has been claimed that in the 10th century the Anglo-Saxons battled against Gaels and Norsemen at Broadclough, a village to the north of Bacup.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.whitworth.gov.uk/local-info-indiv.php?id=127&name=Town Overview|author=Whitworth Town Council|publisher=whitworth.gov.uk|title=Town Overview|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.rossendale.gov.uk/info/200064/local_history_and_heritage/218/a_brief_history_of_rossendale/2|publisher=rossendale.gov.uk|author=Rossendale Borough Council|title=A Brief History of Rossendale; Bacup|page=2[/tpl] From the medieval period in this area, the River Irwell separated the ancient parishes of Whalley and Rochdale (in the hundreds of Blackburn and Salford respectively). The settlement developed mainly in the Whalley township of Newchurch but extending into Rochdale's Spotland.[tpl]sfn|Farrer and Brownbill|1911|pp=437-441|ps=[/tpl]
The geology and topography of the village lent itself to urbanisation and domestic industries; primitive weavers' cottages, coal pits and stonequarries were propelled by Bacup's natural supply of water power in the Early Modern period. The adoption of the factory system, which developed into the Industrial Revolution, enabled the transformation of Bacup from a small rural village into a mill town, populated by an influx of families attracted by Bacup's cotton mills, civic amenities and regional railway network. Locally sourced coal provided the fuel for industrial scale quarrying, cotton spinning and shoe making operations, stimulating the local economy. Bacup received a charter of incorporation in 1882, giving it honorific borough status and its own elected town government, consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors to oversee local affairs.
Bacup's boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the town developing into a prosperous and thickly populated industrial area by early-20th century. But the Great Depression and the ensuing deindustrialisation of the United Kingdom largely eliminated Bacup's textile processing sector and economic prosperity.
Bacup followed the regional and national trend of deindustrialisation during the early and mid-20th century; a process exacerbated by the closure of Bacup railway station in 1966. Bacup also experienced population decline; from 22,000 at the time of the United Kingdom Census 1911, to 15,000 at the United Kingdom Census 1971. Much of Bacup's infrastructure became derelict owing to urban decay, despite regeneration schemes and government funding. Shops became empty and others appeared tatty or downmarket. The houses along the main roads endured as the original terraces from Bacup's industrial age, but behind these, on the hillsides, are several council estates.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/2009/07/04/Bacup+%28bacup%29/4475414.Joint_fight_to_get_Bacup_back_on_its_feet/|publisher=lancashiretelegraph.co.uk|title=Joint fight to get Bacup back on its feet|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=27 October 2009|first=Ron|last=Freethy|work=Lancashire Telegraph|first=Alex|last=Willmott[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/rossendalefreepress/news/s/507320_bacup_left_to_rot|title=Bacup 'left to rot'|accessdate=11 November 2009|publisher=M.E.N.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the High Middle Ages, Bacup was a chapelry linked with the parishes of Whalley and Rochdale, and divided between the townships of Newchurch and Spotland in the hundred of Blackburn.[tpl]harvnb|Lewis|1848|pp=124–128[/tpl].
Bacup's first local authority was a Local board of health established in 1863;[tpl]citation|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzb.htm |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=20 June 2007|at=Places names – B|archivedate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718144414/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzb.htm[/tpl] Bacup Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the Bacup Urban Sanitary District. The area of the sanitary authority was granted a charter of incorporation in 1882, giving it honorific borough status and its own elected town government, consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors to oversee local affairs.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10062172&c_id=10001043|title=Bacup MB through time. Census tables with data for the Local Government District|accessdate=27 October 2009|publisher=University of Portsmouth|work=A vision of Britain through time|author=Great Britain Historical GIS Project|year=2004[/tpl] The Municipal Borough of Bacup became a local government district of the administrative county of Lancashire under the Local Government Act 1894, meaning it shared power with the strategic Lancashire County Council. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Bacup was abolished, and since 1 April 1974 Bacup has formed an unparished area of Rossendale, a local government district of the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire.
From 1983 until 2010, Bacup was represented in the House of Commons as part of the parliamentary constituency of Rossendale and Darwen, by Janet Anderson, a Labour Party MP.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/1257/rossendale-and-darwen|work=The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk|title=Rossendale and Darwen|accessdate=11 November 2009|date=[/tpl] Bacup had previously formed part of the Rossendale constituency.
