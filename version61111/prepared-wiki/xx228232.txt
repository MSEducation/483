CATEGORIES: 1904 songs

"On The Warpath" is a popular instrumental tune composed by Raymond A. Browne in 1904.Browne, "On The Warpath" (Sheet music). "On The Warpath" was the first American popular music to incorporate a repeating tom-tom effect in the score.Pisani, Imagining Native America in Music, p. 253: "Raymond A. Browne used a repeating tom-tom open-fifth trope for 'On the War-Path: A Wild-West Two-Step' (also 1904). Though the tom-tom effect had occasionally appeared in nineteenth-century balletic danses sauvages, 'On the War-Path' is the first such instance I have found in an American  popular song."
