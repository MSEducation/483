Campeonato Nacional de Fútbol de Puerto Rico is an amateur football league in Puerto Rico. As of 2008 it has been replaced as the highest level football league in the country by the Puerto Rico Soccer League. It was created in 2005 by the Federación Puertorriqueña de Fútbol to unify the domestic football scene (but only managed to get the attention of Liga Mayor teams, whilst most teams chose to stay in La Liga Premier, another amateur league). It does not include the Puerto Rico Islanders, who for historical reasons play in the United Soccer Leagues, the second division in the United States of America and Canada.
