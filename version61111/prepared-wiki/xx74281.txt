==History==

The county was ceded to Sweden by Russia together with Ingria by the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. The county extended to the parishes of Lieksa in North and of Suojärvi in the East. In the South and West, the county was bordered by Viborg and Nyslott County. 
Following the Great Northern War southern and eastern parts were ceded to Russia in 1721, and the territory that remained was reconsitituted into the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott ([tpl]Lang-sv|Kymmenegårds och Nyslotts län[/tpl], [tpl]Lang-fi|Savonlinnan ja Kymenkartanon lääni[/tpl]), with the remainder of the Viborg and Nyslott County. In 1743 following a new conflict part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo. The ceded parts of the County of Viborg and Nyslott and the County of Kexholm were at first part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate, but in 1744 they were reconsitituted with new conquests into the Russian Vyborg Governorate, which also became known as Old Finland. Remainder of the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott was joined with some parts of the County of Nyland and Tavastehus in 1747 into the County of Savolax and Kymmenegård.
After the Russian victory in the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden ceded all its territory in Finland to Russia by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. As part of Russian Empire Finland became to constitute a separate grand duchy. In 1812 Russia made the territories of Vyborg Governorate part of the new Grand Duchy of Finland as Viipuri Province.
