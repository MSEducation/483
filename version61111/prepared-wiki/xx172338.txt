The Brochet MB.80 was a two-seat light aircraft developed in France in the early 1950s. It was a derivative of the Brochet MB.70, using essentially the same airframe as the MB.70, but with a wider fuselage and revised undercarriage. The Service de l'Aviation Légère et Sportive purchased ten examples for distribution to French aeroclubs.
