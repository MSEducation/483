Knockout mice]]]]
Mice are common experimental animals in biology and psychology primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of homology with humans. They are the most commonly used mammalian model organism, more common than rats. The mouse genome has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse genes have human homologs. They can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although animal rights activitsts often object. A knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a gene knockout.
There are other reasons why mice are used in laboratory research. Mice are small, inexpensive, easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short period of time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental. Mice and rats have the same organs in the same places, just of different size.

==Subgenera==

All members of the Mus genus are referred to as mice. However, the term mouse can also be applied to species outside of this genus. Mouse often refers to any small muroid rodent, while rat refers to larger muroid rodents. Therefore these terms are not taxonomically specific. For simplicity, only the rodent subgenera belonging to the Mus genus are listed here.

==As pets==

Many people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females.  However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing.  Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:

==Nutrition==

In nature, mice are largely herbivores, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants.Mouse: Northwestern University Ecodome Information Page However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables. Food intake is approximately [tpl]convert|15|g|abbr=on[/tpl] per [tpl]convert|100|g|abbr=on[/tpl] of body weight per day; water intake is approximately [tpl]convert|15|ml|abbr=on[/tpl] per 100 g of body weight per day.Louisiana Veterinary Medical Association

==As food==

Mice are a staple in the diet of many small carnivores.  Humans have eaten mice since prehistoric times and still eat them as a delicacy throughout eastern Zambia and northern Malawi,[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.bridgewater.edu/~mtembo/mbeba.html | title=Mice as a Delicacy: the Significance of Mice in the Diet of the Tumbuka People of Eastern Zambia | first=Mwizenge S. | last=Tembo | accessdate=2008-08-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080623091951/http://www.bridgewater.edu/~mtembo/mbeba.html  |archivedate = 2008-06-23[/tpl] where they are a seasonal source of protein. Mice are no longer routinely consumed by humans elsewhere.
In various countries mice are used as foodFood - Frozen mice & rats, Canberra Exotic Pets / reptilesinc.com.au, accessed 2009-11-14 for pets such as snakes, lizards, frogs, tarantulas and birds of prey, and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose. Some countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, have banned the practice of feeding live mice, citing ethical concerns regarding both predator and prey.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.animalhospitals-usa.com/reptiles/snake_feeding.html | title=Snake feeding: Rodents, Food infections, Feeding Schedule | accessdate=2009-05-29[/tpl]
Common terms used to refer to different ages/sizes of mice when sold for pet food are "pinkies", "fuzzies", "crawlers", "hoppers", and "adults".[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.southfloridarodents.com/ | title=South Florida's True Rodent Professionals | accessdate=2009-05-29[/tpl] Pinkies are newborn mice that have not yet grown fur; fuzzies have some fur but are not very mobile; hoppers have a full coat of hair and are fully mobile but are smaller than adult mice. Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed. These terms are also used to refer to the various growth stages of rats (see Fancy rat).

==Use for sense of smell==

Israeli scientists have tested mice as a new form of airport security detector. It consists of three concealed cartridges, each containing eight specially trained mice. If they sense traces of explosives or drugs, they will trigger the alarm. According to the New Scientist, the mice work four-hour shifts and are more accurate than using dogs or X-ray machines.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/8300223/Mice-trained-for-airport-security.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mice trained for airport security | date=2011-02-03[/tpl]
