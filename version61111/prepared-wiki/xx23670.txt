==Early life==

Pfeiffer was born in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Richard Pfeiffer, a heating and air-conditioning contractor, and Donna (née Taverna), a housewife.

==Career==

===First television and film appearances===

Pfeiffer's early acting appearances included television roles in Fantasy Island,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/movies/michelle-pfeiffer-sensuous-to-sensible.html?pagewanted=4&src=pm|title=Michelle Pfeiffer, Sensuous to Sensible|date=August 6, 1995|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|first=Tim|last=Egan[/tpl] Delta House and BAD Cats among others. She was one of the several candidates to audition as a replacement for Kate Jackson on the television series Charlie's Angels in 1979, although the part went to Shelley Hack. She had small roles in a few theatrical films, including Falling in Love Again (1980) with Susannah York, The Hollywood Knights (1980) opposite Tony Danza, and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. Pfeiffer later said of her early screen work: "I needed to learn how to act... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and cashing in on my looks." She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap,[tpl]cite journal|work=Weekly review|publisher=Weekly Review Ltd|year=1983|issue=1186|page=96[/tpl] and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bhplayhouse.com/index.php?option=com_hdflvplayer&Itemid=162&title=Michelle-Pfeiffer-on-The-Beverly-Hills-Playhouse-Acting-School&compid=1&id=11&page=1|title=Alumni videos: Beverly Hills Playhouse|work=Beverly Hills Playhouse's Official Site|publisher=Beverly Hills Playhouse|accessdate=July 10, 2011[/tpl] before appearing in three further television movies – Callie and Son (1981) with Lindsay Wagner, The Children Nobody Wanted (1981), and a 1981 TV movie remake of Splendor in the Grass. She then landed her first major film role as Stephanie Zinone in Grease 2 (1982), the sequel to the smash-hit musical Grease (1978). The film was a critical and commercial failure, although Pfeiffer herself received some positive attention, notably from the New York Times, which said "although she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable than anyone else in the cast."[tpl]cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|url= http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9d02efdb143bf932a25755c0a964948260|title=Grease 2 (1982) More Grease|work=New York Times|date=June 11, 1982|accessdate=April 25, 2011[/tpl] Despite escaping the critical mauling, Pfeiffer's agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that "she couldn't get any jobs. Nobody wanted to hire her."[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|first=Douglas|title=Pfeiffer: Beyond the Age of Innocence''|publisher=Warner Futura|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7515-1030-0[/tpl]

===Mainstream attention===

Director Brian De Palma, having seen Grease 2, refused to audition Pfeiffer for Scarface (1983), but relented at the insistence of Martin Bregman, the film's producer. She was cast as cocaine-addicted trophy wife Elvira Hancock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/michelle_pfeiffer_biog/4 |title=Michelle Pfeiffer Biography |publisher=Tiscali UK Limited trading|work=Talk Talk|accessdate=October 23, 2008[/tpl] The film was considered excessively violent by most critics, but became a commercial hit and gained a large cult following in subsequent years.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oek-PyR-70UC&lpg=PA162&dq=scarface%20violent&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=New forms of consumption: consumers, culture, and commodification|first=Mark|last=Gottdiener|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9570-6|date=April 25, 2011, 2000[/tpl] Pfeiffer received positive reviews for her supporting turn; Richard Corliss of Time Magazine wrote, "most of the large cast is fine: Michelle Pfeiffer is better..."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951028-2,00.html |title=Say Good Night to the Bad Guy|work=Time Magazine|first=Richard|last=Corlis|date=December 5, 1983 |accessdate=October 23, 2008[/tpl] while Dominick Dunne, in an article for Vanity Fair titled "Blonde Ambition", wrote, "she is on the verge of stardom.

Following Scarface, she accepted the roles of Isabeau d'Anjou in Richard Donner's fantasy film Ladyhawke (1985) opposite Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick, Diana in John Landis' comedy Into the Night (1985) opposite Jeff Goldblum, Faith Healy in Alan Alda's Sweet Liberty (1986) opposite Michael Caine, and Brenda Landers in a segment of the 1950s sci-fi parody Amazon Women on the Moon (1987), all of which, despite achieving only modest commercial success, helped to establish her as an actress. She finally scored a major box-office hit as Sukie Ridgemont in the 1987 adaptation of John Updike's novel The Witches of Eastwick, alongside Jack Nicholson, Cher and Susan Sarandon. The film grossed $63,766,510 domestically (equivalent to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|63.766510|1987|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars [tpl]inflation-fn|US[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=witchesofeastwick.htm|title=The Witches of Eastwick|work=BoxOfficeMojo|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=April 27, 2011[/tpl]

===Critical acclaim===

Pfeiffer was cast against type, as a murdered gangster's widow, in Jonathan Demme's mafia comedy Married to the Mob (1988), opposite Matthew Modine, Dean Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl. For the role of Angela de Marco, she donned a curly brunette wig and a Brooklyn accent,[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800016613/bio|title=Michelle Pfeiffer biography|work=Yahoo Movies|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=April 27, 2011[/tpl] and received her first Golden Globe Award nomination as Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, beginning a six-year streak of consecutive Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-awards-and-nominations/michelle-pfeiffer/?ipp=15&startingItem=31|title=Michelle Pfeiffer – awards and nominations|work=MSN Movies|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=April 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29761|title=Michelle Pfeiffer|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl] Pfeiffer then appeared as chic restauranteuse Jo Ann Vallenari in Tequila Sunrise (1988) opposite Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell, but experienced creative and personal differences with director Robert Towne, who later described her as the "most difficult" actress he has ever worked with.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pfeiffertheface.com/M_1988_CT.htm |title=Tequila Sunrise: Michelle Pfeiffer |accessdate=October 23, 2008[/tpl]
At Demme's personal recommendation, Pfeiffer joined the cast of Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons (1988) alongside Glenn Close and John Malkovich, playing the virtuous victim of seduction, Madame Marie de Tourvel. Her performance won her widespread acclaim; Hal Hinson of the Washington Post saw Pfeiffer's role as "the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used makes it seem an aspect of her spirituality."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/dangerousliaisonsrhinson_a0a8d4.htm |title='Dangerous Liaisons' |work=The Washington Post  |date= January 13, 1989|accessdate=October 23, 2008[/tpl] She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1989|title=Past winners and nominees – Film nominations 1989|work=BAFTA's Official Site|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=April 28, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110525123102/http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1989 |archivedate=May 25, 2011[/tpl] and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/61st-winners.html|title=61st Academy Awards winners|work=Academy Awards' Official Site|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 28, 2011[/tpl]
Pfeiffer then accepted the role of Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), which co-starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys. She underwent intensive voice training for the role for four months, and performed all of her character's vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/150-greatest-movie-performances-of-all-time-1/146-michelle-pfeiffer-susie-diamond-the-fabulous-baker-boys-1989|title=150 Greatest movie performances of all time|work=TotalFilm.com|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011[/tpl] The film was a modest success, grossing $18,428,904 domestically (equivalent to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|18.428904|1989|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars [tpl]inflation-fn|US[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fabulousbakerboys.htm|title=The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)|work=BoxOfficeMojo|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=April 28, 2011[/tpl] Pfeiffer's portrayal of Susie, however, drew raves from critics.

===International success===

Pfeiffer continued to build on her A-list status in Hollywood, accepting and also turning down many high-profile roles, beginning with the title role in Pretty Woman (1990), which earned Julia Roberts a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/pretty-woman-20th-anniversary-re-release|title=Pretty Woman: 20th anniversary re-release|work=Total Film|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl] She took the part of the Soviet book editor Katya Orlova in the 1990 film adaptation of John le Carré's The Russia House, opposite Sean Connery, a role that required her to adopt a Russian accent.

Pfeiffer earned an Academy Award nomination for Actress in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture Drama for her performance as Lurene Hallett in the nostalgic independent drama Love Field (1992). This film had been temporarily shelved by the financially troubled Orion Pictures. It was finally released in late 1992, in time for Oscar consideration.

Pfeiffer took the role of Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992) opposite Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito. For the role of Catwoman, she trained in martial arts and kickboxing. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised her for giving the "feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit" and called her a "classic dazzler."[tpl]cite web |title=Batman Returns: Review : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/batman-returns-19920619 |work=Rolling Stone |year=1992 |accessdate=October 23, 2008[/tpl] Premiere retrospectively lauded her performance: "Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era, Michelle Pfeiffer's deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise.

On November 7, 2012, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Pfeiffer will star alongside Tim Robbins (also director) and Chloë Grace Moretz in the dark comedy, Man Under.

==Theater==

In 1989, Pfeiffer made her stage debut in the role of Olivia in Twelfth Night, a New York Shakespeare Festival production staged in Central Park. Other film actors appearing in the play included Jeff Goldblum as Malvolio and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Viola.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=secCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=michelle+pfeiffer+Twelfth+Night#v=onepage&q=pink%20and%20white&f=false|title=Some have papp thurst upon them|date=July 24, 1989|work=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media LLC|issn=0028-7369|volume=22|number=29|first=John|last=Simon|accessdate=April 18, 2011[/tpl]  Frank Rich's review in the New York Times was extremely critical of the production, stating "Ms. Pfeiffer offers an object lesson in how gifted stars with young careers can be misused by those more interested in exploiting their celebrity status than in furthering their artistic development." Rich praised Pfeiffer's performance in what was then her most recent film, the screwball comedy Married to the Mob, but stating it was "unfortunate that the actress has been asked to make both her stage and Shakespearean comic debut in a role chained to melancholy and mourning."

==Personal life==

While taking acting classes in Los Angeles, Pfeiffer was taken in by a friendly couple who ran a metaphysics and vegetarian cult. While they helped Pfeiffer to no longer drink, smoke, or do drugs, the couple took control of her entire life. Much of her money went to the group. "I was brainwashed... I gave them an enormous amount of money." Pfeiffer, insecure, felt that she could no longer live without them. At an acting class taught by Milton Katselas in Los Angeles, Pfeiffer met fellow budding actor, Peter Horton. Pfeiffer and Horton began dating. The actor took notice of the young actress' plight, and decided to try to help her. Horton was cast in a film called Split Image. His character in the film is enrolled in Peter Fonda's cult. He is then de-programmed by James Woods. While doing research in San Francisco for the role, Horton took Pfeiffer along to meet real-life cult de-programmers. It was due to this experience that Pfeiffer finally felt strong enough to leave the couple.[tpl]cite news|last=Brown|first=Mick|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/michelle-pfeiffer/biography/85?page=3|title=Michelle Pfeiffer - Biography|work=TalkTalk|publisher=Tiscali UK Limited|date=April 20, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.
After her marriage to Horton, Pfeiffer had a three-year relationship with actor/producer Fisher Stevens.
