In 1975, Prophet founded Church Universal and Triumphant, which became the umbrella organization for the movement, and which she expanded worldwide. Prophet controversially called on her members in the late 1980s to prepare for the possibility of nuclear war at the turn of the decade, encouraging them to construct fallout shelters. In 1996, Prophet handed day-to-day operational control of her organization to a president and board of directors, maintaining her role as spiritual leader until her retirement due to health reasons in 1999.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Prophet appeared on Larry King Live, Donahue and Nightline, among other television programs.DeHaas, Jocelyn H.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Elizabeth Clare Prophet was born Elizabeth Clare Wulf at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey on April 8th, 1939, to Hans and Fridy Wulf. She grew up with her family in Red Bank, New Jersey during the Second World War.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 2[/tpl] Her earliest memories of her childhood she describes as idyllic, however problems arose such as the detention of her father as a suspected German spy in 1942. Upon his release he conveyed the need of her to help others who may also suffer because of their nationality, their race or religion.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 6[/tpl] After seeing the horrors of the Holocaust in media and print, she became convinced of the reality of absolute evil in the world which contributed to her decision to major in political science in her studies.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 7[/tpl]
One of the major difficulties in her early life was her father's addiction to alcohol. He verbally abused her mother and had a violent temper which he directed towards them and the destruction of his beloved fish tanks.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 13[/tpl] After witnessing this for many years Elizabeth became convinced that when the blood alcohol content creates a chemical imbalance in the body possessing demons take over the mind and the emotions.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 14[/tpl] 
In Prophet's early life she periodically blacked out. This happened in the third grade when she was about to say her lines in a Christmas play, and continued after that throughout her life. Her condition was first diagnosed as petit mal epilepsy, know more commonly today as absence seizures. She did not find medication helpful, and discontinued using it.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 16[/tpl] Her mother later confessed that in 1937 she took some pills in an unsuccessful attempt to abort her pregnancy when she was carrying Elizabeth. Prophet thought that her mother was implying that the medication may have contributed to her childhood blackouts. Prophet herself did some research and found out that the use of quinine sulfate could have damaged the developing nervous system and the brain.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 18[/tpl] 
Elizabeth Wulf claimed mystical experiences while growing up. When she was about 4, she claims that she had a vision of herself playing on the sands of the Nile river in Egypt (her mother told her it was a past life).[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 10[/tpl]  As a child, she claimed to feel God's light around her naturally, and to hear a sound in her inner ear like that of an ocean wave or the roar of Niagara Falls.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 19[/tpl] Another experience she had while water-skiing was that of being suspended in a place where other spiritual beings existed who were joyous in the light, radiating love. This motivated her to find out more who these "saints robed in white" (Rev. 7:9-17) were for she had always believed in the "universality of all true religion".[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 22[/tpl] 

===Influences===

Betty Clare grew up in a home that was mainly non-religious except for major holidays. Her father was Lutheran, her mother Catholic. Yet it was her mother's interests in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on Elizabeth.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 9[/tpl]  In Theosophy and the I AM Activity she heard about the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God was our true nature. Prophet stayed with Christian Science until she met Mark Prophet at the age of 22.

===Education===

Elizabeth Clare Wulf spent her junior year studying French in Switzerland in 1956 and a year later graduated from Red Bank Regional High School second in her class. She attended Antioch College in Ohio from September 1957 to March 1959 majoring in political science and economics. She transferred to Boston University in September 1959, from where she graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in political science in August 1961.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chronology[/tpl]

===Career===

In summer of 1958 Prophet took a co-op job as a camp counselor in a French immersion school in Vermont. She was in charge of a number of high school girls between 15 and 16 years old and her role was to discipline them. She described the experience as frustrating and said she ended up praying to God that she never be put in an position of authority over others.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 25[/tpl] 
In fall 1958 she served an internship at the United Nations as secretary for Leo Rosenthal, a UN photographer. Her experience at the UN showed her that many of the ambassadors were not there to solve the world’s problems but rather were engaged in power politics and manipulation of the world’s economies. Leaving after three months made her depressed, with the opinion that to solve the world’s problems people would need to change their concept of themselves and of God. 
After moving to Boston in 1959 she worked as a secretary for the Christian Science church and the Christian Science Monitor. According to Prophet, this is where she learned much about the publishing operations, organization, and administration of a church on a worldwide scale which was to help her later on in running her own church.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 30[/tpl]  
Prophet claimed that she realized that she was intended to be a messenger while meditating with Mark L. Prophet at a public meeting in Boston on April 22nd, 1961. He had come to teach about what he called "the Ascended Masters." She later claimed to have received a vision while meditating with him that her role in life was to pass on a higher teaching to further humanity’s spiritual evolution.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 34[/tpl] She confided to Mark the next day that like him, she was also to be a messenger; he accepted her as a student at his mystical school, The Summit Lighthouse. She said she received another vision in June of that year in the way of a visitation by the Ascended Master El Morya who told her to go to Washington, DC to be trained as messenger. 
After attending her first conference in Washington in July, Mark Prophet returned to Boston in August to help her move to Washington to begin her training under him.[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Montana|isbn=978-1-932890-19-8|pages=Chapter 35[/tpl] They married in 1963, and upon his death on February 26, 1973, Elizabeth Clare Prophet assumed leadership of the organization.[tpl]cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R and Sarah M|title=Sacred Schisms: How Religions Divide|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521881470|page=171[/tpl]
