CATEGORIES: Lactones

trans''-3-Methyl-4-octanolide''', also called trans-β-methyl-γ-octalactone' is a chemical compound of the lactone family with formula [tpl]chem|C|9|H|16|O|2[/tpl].  It exists in two stereoisomers: (3R,4S) and (3S,4R).
The (3S,4R) form is found in whiskey and other alcoholic beverages that have been aged in oak barrels, together with the more important cis isomer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wine-pages.com/guests/tom/taste5.htm | title = Aromas and Flavours | publisher = Wine-Pages.com | accessdate = 2007-12-18[/tpl]Hans-Dieter Belitz, Peter Schieberle, and Werner Grosch (2004) Food Chemistry, page 383.
