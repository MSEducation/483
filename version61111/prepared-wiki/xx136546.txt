Portfolio is the debut album by Grace Jones, released in 1977 by Island Records. It spawned her first big hit, "La Vie en rose".

==Background==

Having enjoyed a successful modelling career in Paris and New York in the early 1970s, Grace Jones released a series of singles throughout 1975-1976. None of them, however, managed to succeed in mainstream charts. Jones secured a record deal with Island Records in 1977 and found wider recognition only with her debut Island LP, Portfolio.
The album was recorded and mixed in Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and released in autumn 1977 as the first of three albums made with the legendary disco record producer Tom Moulton. Side one of the original vinyl album is a continuous disco medley covering three songs from Broadway musicals, "Send in the Clowns" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, "What I Did for Love" from A Chorus Line and "Tomorrow" from Annie. Side two opens with Jones' very personal re-interpretation of Ã‰dith Piaf's "La Vie en rose" and continues with three new recordings, two of which have been co-written by Jones herself. Italian release would omit "Sorry" and "That's the Trouble", adding an extended, over 7-minute long version of "I Need a Man" instead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Grace-Jones-Portfolio/release/1717094 |title=Grace Jones - Portfolio (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |work=www.discogs.com |accessdate=2012-05-24[/tpl] Album's artwork was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist working for Interview, who would later contribute to Jones' two next albums' artworks and with whom the singer would re-team up for the 1986 record Inside Story.
Portfolio reached number 52 on the Black Albums Chart in the U.S., while climbing to number 109 on Billboard's mainstream albums chart. It garnered more attention in Europe, entering top 10 in both Italy in early 1978 and the Netherlands in 1983.

"I Need a Man" was Jones' debut single, originally released in 1975 by a minor French label Orfeus. It failed to make any chart impact until two years later, when it was re-recorded and released under Beam Junction label, becoming a number 1 dance hit in the U.S. and introducing Jones to club audience, primarily gay.
The second single, "Sorry", was released still one year prior the Portfolio album release and earned a very modest success on U.S. singles chart. Its B-side track, "That's the Trouble", also received a separate A-side release. Both songs were Grace Jones' first forays into songwriting.
"La Vie en rose" was released as a single in autumn 1977 and became the biggest hit off Portfolio, having charted in French and Italian top 5. When re-released in 1983, it reached top 5 also in the Netherlands. It brought Jones mainstream club popularity and now remains one of her best known recordings.
"What I Did for Love" became a top 10 dance hit in the USA.
