Goodmayes railway station is a railway station at Goodmayes in the London Borough of Redbridge in east London, opened on 18 February 1901 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on the Main Line from Liverpool Street. The station once had an extensive shunting yard for goods traffic but this fell into disuse during Dr. Beeching's modernisation (known at the time as "axing") of the railway system in 1963, and was eventually dismantled.  The site of the yard stood on the area between the present track and the High Road and has been replaced by a Tesco Extra superstore, other stores and housing. There was also a large yard area between the existing track area and Kinfauns Road. This yard area went as far as Chadwell Heath.
It is planned that Crossrail trains will call here, replacing current services. The station is in Travelcard Zone 4.
