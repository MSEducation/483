Big Audio Dynamite (later known as Big Audio Dynamite II and Big Audio, and often abbreviated BAD) is a British musical group formed in 1984 by the ex-guitarist and singer of the Clash, Mick Jones. The group is noted for its effective mixture of varied musical styles, incorporating elements of punk rock, dance music, hip hop, reggae, and funk. BAD's one constant throughout frequent shifts in membership and musical direction is the vocals provided by Mick Jones. After releasing a number of well-received albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Big Audio Dynamite disbanded in 1997, but embarked on a reunion tour in 2011.

==History==

===T.R.A.C. (1984)===

After being ousted from the Clash in 1983 and following a brief stint with the band General Public, Mick Jones formed a new band called Top Risk Action Company (T.R.A.C.) He recruited bassist Leo "E-Zee Kill" Williams, saxophone player John "Boy" Lennard (from Theatre of Hate), and ex-Clash drummer Nicky "Topper" Headon. Headon was quickly sacked for his heroin addiction and Lennard either left or was fired and the band folded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beatpatrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/big-audio-dynamite-this-is-big-audio-dynamite-1985 |title=Big Audio Dynamite – "This Is Big Audio Dynamite" (1985) |publisher=Beatpatrol.wordpress.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110726105447/http://beatpatrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/big-audio-dynamite-this-is-big-audio-dynamite-1985| archivedate= 26 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Although the band released no material (only demos were recorded which have yet to be officially released), T.R.A.C. can be seen as a forerunner to Big Audio Dynamite in much the same way London SS can be seen as an early incarnation of The Clash.

===Big Audio Dynamite (1984–1990)===

Jones  then formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director Don Letts (maker of The Punk Rock Movie, various Clash music videos, and later The Clash documentary Westway to the World), bassist Leo Williams (from T.R.A.C.), drummer Greg Roberts, and keyboardist Dan Donovan.  In 1985 the group's debut, This Is Big Audio Dynamite, was released.  The album's cover shows the group as a four-piece (minus Donovan); the full group is pictured on the back cover. 
1986's No. 10, Upping St. reunited Jones for one album with former Clash band-mate Joe Strummer, who was a co-producer of the album and co-writer of a number of its songs.  The cover painting, based on a still taken from the Brian de Palma film "Scarface" was painted by Tim Jones. BAD supported U2 on their 1987 world tour, then released 1988's Tighten Up, Vol. '88 and 1989's Megatop Phoenix. Tighten Up, Vol. 88 contained "Just Play Music!", which was the second No. 1 single on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. The band also recorded an unreleased track called "Keep off the Grass" which was a rock-style instrumental of the theme to the classic western film, The Magnificent Seven. A promo video can be seen on YouTube.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srNAFh86YNk |title=Big Audio Dynamite - Keep Off The Grass (rare video) |publisher=YouTube |date=24 December 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl]
In 1990, the original line-up wrote and recorded the song "Free" for the soundtrack to the movie Flashback. This would be the final song written with the original lineup, as the band would dissolve shortly after.  "Bottom Line" from the first LP was remixed and used as the title track for Flashback. However this track was not included on the soundtrack. It can be found on the 12" or by possible download. Later in 1990, Mick Jones debuted Big Audio Dynamite II and release the UK only album Kool-Aid. Dan Donovan remained in BAD II for one song, a re-working of the final BAD track "Free" renamed "Kickin' In".

===Big Audio Dynamite II (1991–1993)===

For 1990's The Globe, only Jones remained from BAD, and the band was now called "Big Audio Dynamite II".  This new line-up featured two guitarists. The Globe featured the band's most commercially successful single, "Rush" which hit No. 1 on both the US modern rock chart and the Australian National Aria Chart. "Innocent Child" and "The Globe" were also released as singles.
BAD supported U2 on their ZooTV tour and released the live EP "On The Road Live '92".

===Big Audio (1994)===

The band later recruited keyboardist Andre Shapps (co-producer of The Globe and Mick Jones's cousin) and Michael "DJ Zonka" Custance as DJ and vocalist. Both appeared on the band's 1994 album Higher Power, which was released under the shortened name "Big Audio".

===Final years and subsequent activities (1995–2010)===

After signing with Gary Kurfirst's Radioactive Records in 1995, the band reverted to the original "Big Audio Dynamite" moniker and released their least successful album to date, F-Punk.
Radioactive Records refused to release the next proposed BAD album, Entering a New Ride.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]  The line-up contained Mc vocals by 
Joe Attard (Punks Jump Up), Ranking Roger (The Beat, General Public) and drummer Bob Wond (Under Two Flags) In 1998, the band launched a new web site, primarily as a means to distribute songs from the Entering a New Ride album.
Since 2005, Jones has been working on a project with Tony James (ex-member of Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik) called Carbon/Silicon.
In early 2007, a BAD II live DVD was released.

===2011 reunion===

In April 2010, Don Letts revealed to Billboard.com that he and Mick Jones broached the idea of a Big Audio Dynamite reunion in 2011. He explained, "I could lie to you and say 'Not in a million years,' but... if Mick wasn't tied up with Gorillaz it might happen this year. (Jones) has looked at me and said, 'Maybe next year,' but who knows. I've got to admit that in the past I'm not a great one for reformations; I always think if you're lucky in life, you get a window of opportunity, use it to the best of your ability and then fuck off and let someone else have their turn. But here I am 25 years down the line considering the thing." Besides a Big Audio Dynamite reunion, Letts said he was also hopeful for more Legacy Editions of the group's albums after finding more unreleased material—including live recordings—in the vaults. "There's definitely more stuff; whether Sony thinks it's worthwhile, that's another matter. But there seems to be a lot of respect for Big Audio Dynamite. Time has shown that a lot of the things we were dabbling in back then have come to manifest themselves today...so hopefully we'll get to do some more."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958688/big-audio-dynamite-reignited |title=Big Audio Dynamite Reignited |publisher=Billboard.com |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl]
