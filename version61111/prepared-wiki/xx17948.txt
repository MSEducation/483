[[Clanging]]

CATEGORIES: Medical signs

In psychology and psychiatry, clanging refers to a mode of speech characterized by association of words based upon sound rather than concepts. For example, this may include compulsive rhyming or alliteration without apparent logical connection between words. This is associated with the irregular thinking apparent in psychotic mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia).Formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: a factor analytic study. Peralta V, Cuesta MJ, de Leon J. Compr Psychiatry. 1992 Mar-Apr;33(2):105-10.
Clanging refers specifically to behavior that is situationally inappropriate. While a poet rhyming is not evidence of mental illness, disorganized speech that impedes the patient's ability to communicate is a disorder in itself, often seen in schizophrenia.Schizophrenia and the structure of language: the linguist's view.
