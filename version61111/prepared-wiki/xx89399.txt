[[Heterobranchia]]

CATEGORIES: Heterobranchia, Gastropods

Heterobranchia, the heterobranchs (meaning "different-gilled snails"), is a taxonomic clade of snails and slugs, which includes marine, aquatic and terrestrial gastropod mollusks.
Heterobranchia is one of the main clades of gastropods. Currently Heterobranchia comprises three informal groups: the Lower Heterobranchia, the Opisthobranchia and the Pulmonata, also known as the lower heterobranchs, the opisthobranchs and the pulmonates.Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

The three subdivisions of this large clade are quite diverse:

==Taxonomy==

===Older taxonomy===

The families currently included in Heterobranchia have historically been placed in many different parts of the taxonomic class of gastropods. Earlier authors (such as J.E. Gray, 1840) considered Heterobranchia to consist of only marine gastropods, and conceptualized it as a borderline category, intermediate between the Opisthobranchia & Pulmonata, and all the other gastropods.[tpl]cite journal | author = Haszprunar G. |title = The Heterobranchia ― a new concept of the phylogeny of the higher Gastropoda|year = 1985| journal = Zeitschrift für zoologische Systematik und Evolutionsforschung|volume = 23| issue = 1 | pages = 15–37[/tpl]  ISSN 0044-3808
The (sometimes recognized) category Heterostropha within the Heterobranchia, which includes such families as Architectonicidae, the sundial or staircase snails, is primarily characterized by a shell which has a heterostrophic protoconch, in other words the apical whorls are coiled in the opposite plane to the adult whorls. The classification of this group was revised by Ponder & Warén in 1988.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ponder, W.

According to the  older taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997) the Heterobranchia were ranked as a superorder.

===2005 taxonomy===

Heterobranchia is currently one of the main clades of gastropods. For a detailed taxonomy, see Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005)#Clade Heterobranchia.

===2010 taxonomy===

Jörger et al. (2010) have redefined major groups within the Heterobranchia: they created the new clades Euopisthobranchia and Panpulmonata.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jörger K.
