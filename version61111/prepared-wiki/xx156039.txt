Wausau was in burlesque dancing beginning in 1928.Answers To Questions, Hammond, Indiana Times, March 7, 1940, Page 14.

The audience applauded enthusiastically.Boston Girds For Strippers, Oakland Tribune, November 25, 1965, Page 40. Wausau appeared in
an Ed E. Daley production, Temptations, presented at the Robbins Playhouse in Syracuse, New York, in June 1929. The blonde entertainer displayed both her singing and dancing talents in the stage comedy.Hinda Wausau Returns as Guest Star of Temple Show, Syracuse Herald, June 10, 1929, Page 10.
She was recruited by Billy Rose for his revue which showcased Eleanor Powell and Hal Le Roy. Premiering in late July 1932, Wausau was described by Rose as the best cooch dancer since Gilda Gray first startled the public.Repertory Company to Be Formed For Winter By Katharine Cornell, Oakland Tribune, July 24, 1932, Page 15 She was on the same bill as the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.

Wausau was managed by her husband, Rube Bernstein, in 1938. Ann Corio had the same manager until she discovered Wausau was getting better breaks and dancing at a competitor club. Corio quickly fired
Bernstein.
