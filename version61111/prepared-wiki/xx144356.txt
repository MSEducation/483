The Manuel L. Quezon University (MLQU) is a private university in Quiapo, Manila, Philippines. It is a member of the Colleges and Universities Sports Association (CUSA) and Universities and Colleges Athletic Association (UCAA). It offers academic programs at the pre-school, elementary, high school, tertiary, and graduate levels. It is named for Philippine president Manuel L. Quezon.

==History==

It was founded in 1947.
On November 1, 1947 eighteen professors from the school where Dr. Monzon served as Dean joined him in an old building at the corner of Mendiola and Legarda Streets to begin training 643 students for the law profession. Thus was born the MLQU School of Law.
The fledging school produced its first batch of graduates the following year and in the Bar Examinations given in that same year, the school registered a passing average of 97.5%. In 1949, it exceeded its first record with a passing average of 100% with three of its graduates making it to the Top Ten.
The law school soon found it necessary to transfer to a new site on R. Hidalgo St. where other academic units were organized beginning with the School of Arts and Sciences followed by the School of Education, Commerce and Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture and Graduate Studies. With the addition of these units, the Law school became the Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution. In 1958, the institution acquired University status.
Subsequently the Schools of Criminology, Architecture and Secretarial Education were separated from the School of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Commerce and Business Administration, respectively. The School of Information Technology is the latest addition to the University community.
The Manuel L. Quezon University has two campuses, namely, the Monzon Hall, located at R. Hidalgo St. and the Arlegui Compound at Arlegui St. where the Basic Education Department is located. Just recently, the Research Center was built adjacent to the Monzon Hall and which was named after Justice Arsenio P. Dizon.
