===Queensbury tube station===

The main focus of Queensbury is the area around the tube station. Queensbury did not exist as an area before the opening of the Stanmore branch as part of the Metropolitan line in 1932 (transferred to the Bakerloo Line in 1939, and then the Jubilee line in 1979. The station opened on 16 December 1934. The name Queensbury was adopted for the tube station to match neighbouring Kingsbury and has no historical basis.Whats in a Name?  Cyril M.

The parade of shops and houses built along with the station form a large crescent with a public green space in the centre.  The area was developed in the 1930s and the architecture reflects this.  Until May 2008 a roundabout in front of the station featured a prominent 1930's style mast bearing the London Underground emblem. The pavements and public space were redeveloped at that time losing some of the 1930s character.
The tube station, and its local surroundings and characters were cited in the song "Queensbury Station" by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band The Magoo Brothers on their album "Beyond Believable", released in 1988. The song was written by Paul Bonin and Melanie Hickford, who both grew up and lived in the area.https://mgonline.gema.de/werke/detail.do?title=QUEENSBURY+STATION&dbkey=540612 GEMA database listing for Queensbury Station song, work no.: 2181020-001
