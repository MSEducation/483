==History==

Denver's first train station was constructed in 1868 to serve the new Denver Pacific Railway, which connected Denver to the main transcontinental line at Cheyenne, Wyoming. By 1875, there were four different railroad stations, making passenger transfers between different railroad lines inconvenient.  To remedy this issue, the Union Pacific Railroad proposed creating one central "Union Station" to combine the various operations. In February 1880, the owners of the four lines (the Union Pacific, the Denver & Rio Grande Western, the Denver, South Park & Pacific, and the Colorado Central) agreed to build a station at 17th and Wynkoop Streets.  Architect A. Taylor of Kansas City was hired to develop the plans, and the station opened in May 1881.Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974; p. 2.
A fire in 1894 destroyed the central portion of the 1881 depot. The Kansas City architectural firm of Van Brunt & Howe was hired to design a larger replacement depot in the Romanesque style. Both the 1881 and 1894 depots included a tall central clock tower with four clock faces.Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974, p. 3.
In 1912, the original Union Depot partnership was dissolved and replaced by the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the then-major operators of the station (the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe, the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific, the Colorado & Southern, the Union Pacific, and the Denver & Rio Grande Westen). The new partnership decided to demolish and rebuild the central portion of the station to handle the increasing passenger traffic. The new central portion, designed by Denver architects Gove & Walsh, was built in the Beaux-Arts style and opened in 1914.Fraser, Clayton, and Jennifer Strand. Railroads in Colorado, 1858–1948. Loveland, Coorado: Fraserdesign, 1997, p. 161.

==Today==

During its heyday, the station was served by 80 daily trains operated by six different railroads; however, most of this was terminated at the time of the formation of Amtrak, which has since operated only one train daily between Chicago and the Bay Area, routed through Denver. Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad's Ski Train was operated until the end of the winter of 2008–2009, at which time the operation was discontinued.  In September 2009 plans were announced to revive the service as a special limited route beginning in December,[tpl]Cite news|title=All Are Aboard Plan to Revive Ski Train|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13362260 | newspaper=Denver Post | first=Jeffrey|last=Leib|date=September 18, 2009[/tpl] but this did not happen due to insurance problems.[tpl]Cite news|title=Problems derail revival of ski train|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_14084331 | newspaper=Denver Post | first=Jeffrey|last=Leib|date=December 29, 2009[/tpl] Current passenger services include:
The station also serves the once a year Cheyenne Frontier Days Train, usually pulled by Union Pacific's steam locomotive 844, the last steam locomotive built for the UP. The train runs between Union Station and Cheyenne, Wyoming for the Frontier Days Rodeo event.

==Redevelopment==

Under a public/private consortium, the station and the surrounding 19.5 acres (79,000 m²) will soon be the hub of Denver's new FasTracks rail network, under the Regional Transportation District's master plan for the station site, officially known as the Denver Union Station. Eight teams of prominent architects, developers and engineers competed in 2002 for the massive contract to redevelop the station into a transit-oriented retail, office and residential complex, with a budget in the range of $900 million.
On July 30, 2010, the US Department of Transportation announced that the station had received a $300 million grant to construct three light-rail tracks and eight heavy-rail tracks for both intercity and commuter rail services, as well as additional storage and servicing capabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=23912|title=Denver receives $300 million from USDOT for Union Station project|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=July 30, 2010|accessdate=July 30, 2010[/tpl]
On February 1, 2011, Amtrak's passenger station and boarding platform was moved to a temporary station at 21st and Wewatta streets, behind Coors Field, in order to allow construction of the commuter rail tracks and platforms.  This temporary relocation is scheduled to last until February 2014, at which time Amtrak's services will move back to the newly constructed passenger area behind Denver Union Station.[tpl]cite news |title=Renovations for New Hub to Close Parts of Union Station|url=http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=177615&catid=339|work=KUSA|location=Denver|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=January 25, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vzKfFMH5|archivedate=January 25, 2011[/tpl]

New light rail station debuts at Union Station in Denver The new location is west of the former light rail stations, and is adjacent to the consolidated main line railroad tracks and near the Denver Millennium Bridge. The westernmost stop of the 16th Street Mall shuttle, also known as the MallRide, was also moved west and is adjacent to the new light rail stop.
The building closed to the public on December 1, 2012 for construction. The majority of the terminal building's upper levels will become The Crawford Hotel, with the Great Hall on the ground level serving as the hotel lobby. The building will also have restaurants and shops on the first floor.http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article74992.html
