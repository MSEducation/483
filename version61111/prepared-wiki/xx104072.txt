Mu Cephei (μ Cep, μ Cephei), also known as Herschel's Garnet Star, is a red supergiant star in the constellation Cepheus. It is one of the largest and most luminous stars known in the Milky Way. It appears garnet red and is given the spectral class of M2 Ia. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

==History==

The deep red color of Mu Cephei was noted by William Herschel, who described it as "a very fine deep garnet colour, such as the periodical star ο Ceti", and it was called Garnet sidus by Giuseppe Piazzi in his catalogue. Later, it is thus commonly known as Herschel's "Garnet Star".  An alternative name, Erakis, used in Antonín Bečvář's star catalogue, is probably due to confusion with Mu Draconis, which was previously called [tpl]transl|ar|al-Rāqis[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ar|arˈraːqis|[/tpl] in Arabic.
In 1848, English astronomer John Russell Hind discovered that it was variable. This variability was quickly confirmed by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. Almost continual records of the star's variability have been maintained since 1881.
