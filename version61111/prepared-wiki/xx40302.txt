CATEGORIES: Airports in Saint Lucia, Vieux Fort, Saint Lucia

Hewanorra International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|UVF|TLPL[/tpl], near Vieux Fort Quarter, Saint Lucia, in the Caribbean, is the larger of the country's two airports the smaller being George F. L. Charles Airport, and is managed by the Saint Lucia Air and Seaports Authority (SLASPA).
The airport is a Fire Category 9 airport that handles 500,000 passengers a year and has the capability to handle the Boeing 747, Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 777 and other similar long range intercontinental aircraft. Aircraft maintenance there is carried out by Caribbean Dispatch Services. George F. L. Charles Airport, formerly known as Vigie Airport, is located in Castries and handles inter-Caribbean scheduled passenger flights which are currently operated with turboprop and prop aircraft from this smaller airfield.

==History==

Hewanorra International Airport was originally named Beane Army Airfield and was used as a military airfield by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force and used in World War II. Beane Field was activated in early 1941 with a mission to defend Saint Lucia against an enemy attack.
The former USAF base was then refurbished and converted into a commercial airport. There is a disused northeast/southwest runway north of the main east-west runway that was part of the military airfield. It is in poor condition, along with a few dispersals.

==Expansion==

As the amount of air traffic handled at Hewanorra International Airport is steadily increasing every year, St.Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority has requested and received a master plan for the redevelopment and redesign of HIA. There has been much controversy surrounding the project as some say, at an estimated cost of US $160 million, it could set back the country's economy. Many have argued and said that expanding the airport will expand the country's economic outlook. the new terminal design includes: construction of a new terminal building, installation of jet bridges, a new modern control tower, increase in aircraft apron parking positions from five to eight in phase 1 of the project and then to twelve in phase 2; development of a Fixed Base Operation (FBO); redevelopment and relocation of a new air cargo facility; and construction of a new car park and road infrastructure network. As the projections indicate, passenger throughput is expected to increase by approx. 750,000 passengers. The new terminal building is proposed to be constructed in stages consistent with passenger growth. The facility will improve the airport's aesthetics by separating cargo from commercial aircraft and will be able to handle large aircraft such as Boeing 747, Airbus A380, Boeing 777 and other similar aircraft. The new design will reduce airport congestion and improve passenger comfort and create a positive passenger experience. Work on the airport will take about two years. Work is set to begin in July 2011.

==Runway and taxiways==

The Airport has a single east-westerly runway, connected by two taxiways at the Mid-Section of the runway, with turning bays at the end to allow Back Tracking. As a result of the earths' tradewinds that blow Northeast across St Lucia, all aircraft usually arrive and depart on runway 10 in an easterly direction. This results in a typical flight path for arriving aircraft along the west coast of St Lucia, while departing flights usually fly along the east coast of the island. On relatively rare but not uncommon occurrences, weather disturbances such as, passing hurricanes or tropical systems, may cause planes to take off or land on runway 28 in a westerly direction.

==Accidents and incidents==

Quebecair flight 714, a Boeing 707 jetliner operating a charter flight from Toronto, caught a wind shear while on approach to Hewanorra international airport on 19 February 1979. The windshear caused the aircraft to halt its descent while already over the threshold. The copilot who was flying at that time retarded the throttles, however at that very moment the aircraft had passed the windshear zone and the nose of the aircraft slammed into the runway and bounced twice, destroying the nose landing gear. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries reported in this incident. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off.
