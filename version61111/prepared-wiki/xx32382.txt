It is the largest city-borough in the US, with a land area of 2,870.3 mi2 (7,434.1 km2) and a total area (including water area) of 4,811.4 mi2 (12,460.8 km2). With a population of 8,881 in 2010, Sitka is the fourth-largest city by population in Alaska. Urban Sitka ([tpl]coord|57|03|5.62|N|135|20|19.11|W|scale:10000[/tpl]), the part that is usually thought of as the "city" of Sitka, is situated on the west side of Baranof Island.
The current name "Sitka" (derived from Sheet’ká, a contraction of the Tlingit Shee At'iká)[ref]
</ref> means "People on the Outside of Baranof Island", whose Tlingit name is ''Sheet’-ká X'áat'l'' (here contracted to ''Shee'').

==History==

Sitka's location was originally settled by the Tlingit people over 10,000 years ago. The Russians settled Old Sitka in 1799 under the name Redoubt Saint Michael ([tpl]lang-ru|форт Архангела Михаила[/tpl], t Fort Arkhangela Mikhaila). The governor of Russian America, Alexandr Baranov, arrived under the auspices of the Russian-American Company, a colonial trading company chartered by Tsar Paul I. In 1802, Tlingit warriors "clad in animal-headed helmets and armour" destroyed the original establishment, killing 24 Russians and 200 Aleuts, enslaving the rest, with only a few managing to escape.Vaillant (2006), p. 169. Baranov was forced to levy 10,000 rubles in ransom for the safe return of the surviving settlers.[tpl]cite book|last=Chevigny|first=Hector|title=Lord of Alaska: Baranov and the Russian adventure|year=1942|publisher=Viking Press|location=Cornell University|page=320|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Lord_of_Alaska.html?id=qPg9AAAAYAAJ[/tpl]
Baranov returned to Sitka in 1804 with 150 Russians and 700 Aleuts with the Russian warship Neva.  The ship bombarded the Tlingit fort but was not able to cause significant damage. The Russians then launched an attack on the fort and were repelled by Tlingit fighters and marksmen. However, the Tlingit gunpowder reserves had been lost before the Russian assault and the Tlingit were forced to leave the fort.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Following their victory at the Battle of Sitka, the Russians established New Archangel as a permanent settlement named after Arkhangelsk, the largest city in the region where Baranov was born. The Tlingit re-established a fort on the Chatham Strait side of Peril Strait to enforce a trade embargo with the Russian establishment. In 1808, with Baranov still governor, Sitka was designated the capital of Russian America.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
The Cathedral of St. Michael was built in Sitka in 1848 and became the seat of the Russian Orthodox Bishop of Kamchatka, the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, and Alaska. The original church burnt to the ground in 1966, but was restored to its original appearance, with the deliberate exception of its clockface, which is black in photographs taken prior to 1966, but white in subsequent photos.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
 "As out of the way as it appears now, the settlement was once known as the "Paris of the Pacific;" for the first half of the nineteenth century, it was the most important port on the West Coast." 
Bishop Innocent lived in Sitka after 1840. He was known for his interest in education, and his house, parts of which served as a schoolhouse, the Russian Bishop's House has since been restored by the National Park Service as part of the Sitka National Historical Park. Swedes, Finns and other Lutherans worked for the Russian-American Company,Sitka Lutheran Church. and the Sitka Lutheran Church, built in 1840, was the first Protestant church on the Pacific Coast. After the transition to American control, following the purchase of Alaska from Russia by the United States in 1867, the influence of other Protestant religions increased, and St. Peter's-By-The-Sea Episcopal Church was consecrated as "The Cathedral of Alaska" in 1900.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Post Russia control===

Sitka was the site of the signing of the Alaska purchase and where the transfer of power took place on October 18, 1867. Russia was going through economic and political turmoil after they lost the Crimean War to Britain, France, and Turkey in 1856 and decided they wanted to sell Alaska before it got taken over by one of their enemies. Although Britain had an interest in purchasing Alaska, Russia decided to offer to sell it to America. Secretary of State William Seward (under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson) had wanted to purchase Alaska for quite some time as he saw it as an integral part of Manifest Destiny and America's reach to the Pacific Ocean.The Alaska Purchase, Library of Congress. http://memory.loc.gov/intldl/mtfhtml/mfak/mfaksale.html  While the agreement to purchase Alaska was made in April 1867, the actual purchase and transfer of power took place on October 18, 1867.  The cost to purchase Alaska was $7.2 million or roughly 2 cents per acre.
On October 18, Alaska celebrates Alaska Day to commemorate the Alaska purchase. The City of Sitka holds an annual Alaska Day Festival. This week long event includes a reenactment ceremony of the signing of the Alaska purchase, as well as interpretive programs at museums and parks, special exhibits, aircraft displays and film showings, receptions, historic sites and buildings tours, food, prose writing contest essays, Native and other dancing, and entertainment and more. The first recorded Alaska Day Festival was held in 1949.Alaska Day Festival, Sitka, Alaska http://www.alaskadayfestival.org./
Alaska's first newspaper following the Alaska purchase, the Sitka Times, was published by Barney O. Ragan on September 19, 1868.  Only four issues were published that year, as Ragan cited a lack of resources available at the time.  The paper resumed publishing the following year as the Alaska Times.  In 1870, it moved to Seattle, where the year following it was renamed the Seattle Times (not to be confused with the modern-day newspaper of the same name).[tpl]cite book|title=Guide to Alaska Newspapers on Microfilm|url=http://www.library.state.ak.us/hist/hist_docs/newspapers/by_place.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 29, 2011|year=1998|publisher=Alaska State Library|location=Juneau|pages=324, 332[/tpl]
Sitka served as the capital of the Alaska Territory until 1906, when the seat of government was relocated north to Juneau.

While gold mining and fish canning paved the way for the town's initial growth, it wasn't until World War II, when the Navy constructed an air base on Japonski Island (bringing 30,000 service personnel to the area), that Sitka finally came into its own.  Today Sitka encompasses portions of Baranof Island and the smaller Japonski Island (across the Sitka Channel from the town), which is connected to Baranof Island by the O'Connell Bridge.  The John O'Connell Bridge was the first cable-stayed bridge built in the Western Hemisphere.  Japonski Island is home to Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport (IATA:SIT, ICAO:PASI), the Sitka branch campus of the University of Alaska Southeast, Mt. Edgecumbe High School — a state-run boarding school for rural Alaskans, Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium's Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital, a U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Sitka, and the port and facilities for the USCGC Maple.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

==Economy==

In 2010, Sitka's two largest employers were the South East Alaska Regional Health Consortium (SEARHC), employing 482 people, and the Sitka School District, employing 250 people. However, there are more people employed in the seafood industry than in any other sector.  An estimated 18% of Sitka's population earns at least a portion of their income from fishing and seafood harvesting and processing.   Many Sitkans hunt and gather subsistence foods such as fish, deer, berries, seaweeds and mushrooms for personal use.[ref]

Sitka's power is generated by dams at Blue Lake and Green Lake, with supplemental power provided by burning diesel when electric demand exceeds hydro capacity. In December 2012 the Blue Lake Expansion project began, which will create 27 percent more electricity for the residents of Sitka.
