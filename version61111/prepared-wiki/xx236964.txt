==Production==

Adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from a nonfiction book "The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million—and Bucked the Medical Establishment—in a Quest to Save His Children" by the Pulitzer Prize journalist Geeta Anand, the film is also an examination of how medical research is conducted and financed.
Filming took place at several spots in and around Portland, Oregon, mostly at the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Nike campus in Beaverton, Oregon.  This was the first time Nike allowed filming on their campus and they donated the location payment to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.[tpl]cite web | url = http://blog.oregonlive.com/ent_impact_tvfilm/print.html?entry=/2010/01/extraordinary_measures_filmed.html| title='Extraordinary Measures,' filmed in Portland and starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford, opens Friday | publisher = Advance Publications| work = The Oregonian | date = January 21, 2010 | accessdate= January 25, 2010[/tpl] During filming, the working title was The Untitled Crowley Project.[tpl]cite web| url = http://blog.oregonlive.com/ent_impact_tvfilm/print.html?entry=/2009/06/on_the_crowley_set_boredom_act.html| title=On the 'Crowley' set: Boredom, action and a bit of politics | publisher =Advance Publications | work = The Oregonian | date = June 2, 2009 | accessdate=January 25, 2010[/tpl]

==Inspiration==

Myozyme, a drug developed for treating Pompe disease, was simultaneously approved for sale by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Henceforth, more than 1000 infants born worldwide every year with Pompe disease will no longer face the prospect of death before reaching their first birthday for lack of a treatment for the condition.
The screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs is based on Geeta Anand's book The Cure (ISBN 9780060734398).[tpl]cite journal|journal=NY Times|title=Desperate Father’s Plea to a Detached Scientist|author=A. O. Scott|date=January 22, 2010|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/movies/22extraordinary.html[/tpl]  Parts of the book first appeared as a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal.
The small start-up company Priozyme was based on Oklahoma City-based Novazyme. The larger company, called Zymagen in the film, was based on Genzyme in Cambridge, MA. Novazyme was developing a protein therapeutic, with several biological patents pending, to treat Pompe Disease, when it was bought by Genzyme. The patent portfolio was cited in the press releases announcing the deal.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Critical response===

The film opened to mixed reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 27% based on reviews from 136 critics, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 10. The site's general consensus is that "Despite a timely topic and a pair of heavyweight leads, Extraordinary Measures never feels like much more than a made-for-TV tearjerker." 
Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 45 based on 33 reviews.
Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote: "Fraser keeps the story anchored in reality. Meredith Droeger does too: as the Crowleys' afflicted daughter, she's a smart little bundle of fighting spirit. So is the movie, which keeps its head while digging into your heart. You have this critic's permission to cry in public."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1955595,00.html | work=Time | first=Richard | last=Corliss | date=February 1, 2010 | title=Extraordinary Measures: Sentiment Makes a Comeback[/tpl] The New York Times[tpl]'[/tpl] A.
