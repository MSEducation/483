[[Same-sex marriage in California]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT rights in California, Same-sex marriage in the United States by state

Same-sex marriages are legal in the U.S. state of California. The state first began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 16, 2008, as the result of the Supreme Court of California ruling in In re Marriage Cases, which found that barring same-sex couples from marriage violated the state's constitution. The issuance of those licenses was halted during the period of November 5, 2008 through June 27, 2013 (though existing same-sex marriages continued to be valid) due to the passage of Proposition 8—a state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Misc/votebymail.htm|title=Election Results - November 4, 2008 - California Secretary of State|accessdate=December 4, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723190051/http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Misc/votebymail.htm |archivedate = July 23, 2008[/tpl] The granting of same-sex marriages recommenced following the United States Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, which restored the effect of a federal district court ruling that overturned Proposition 8 as unconstitutional.
On August 4, 2010, United States District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker declared Proposition 8 a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, a decision upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 7, 2012. The case, known as Perry v. Brown in the Ninth Circuit, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 31, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Supreme Court Asked to Hear Prop. 8 Case|url=http://www.afer.org/blog/u-s-supreme-court-asked-to-hear-prop-8-case/|publisher=American Foundation for Equal Rights|accessdate=July 31, 2012[/tpl] The case was granted review as Hollingsworth v.

Before the passage of Proposition 8, California was only the second U.S. state (after Massachusetts) to allow same-sex marriage. Those marriages granted under the laws of other state governments, foreign and domestic, were legally recognized and retained state-level rights since 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eqca.org/atf/cf/%7B34f258b3-8482-4943-91cb-08c4b0246a88%7D/SB%2054%20FAQ.PDF |title=SB 54 and Same-Sex Couples Who Marry Outside of California |format=PDF |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2009/10/12/daily8.html |title=California to recognize some out-of-state gay marriages |publisher=sacramento.bizjournals.com |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

From February 12 to March 11, 2004, under the direction of Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, officials of the City and County of San Francisco issued marriage licenses to approximately 4,000 same-sex couples. During the month that licenses were issued, couples traveled from all over the United States and from other countries to be married. On August 12, citing the mayor's lack of authority to bypass state law, the Supreme Court of California ruled that the marriages were void."THE BATTLE OVER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: One Year Later", Rona Maresh, San Francisco Chronicle, February 2, 2005 Consolidated lawsuits against the state government in favor of same-sex marriage which followed eventually reached the Supreme Court of California. On May 15, 2008, it overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage with the ruling In re Marriage Cases.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S147999.PDF |format=PDF|title=Text of the decision in In re Marriage Cases |date=May 15, 2008 |publisher=Supreme Court of California accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] The four-to-three decision took effect on June 16, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR31-08.PDF |format=PDF|title=California Supreme Court Denies Rehearing and Stay in Marriage Cases |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2008[/tpl]  Two weeks earlier, the initiative to override this result of the court decision qualified for the November election ballot.

==Legislation==

===AB 607===

From the enactment of legislation in 1971 to replace gendered pronouns with gender-neutral pronouns, until 1977, California Civil Code § 4100 defined marriage as "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary." This definition was uniformly interpreted as including only opposite-sex partners, but, because of worries that the language was unclear, Assembly Bill No. 607, authored by Assemblyman Bruce Nestande, was proposed and later passed to "prohibit persons of the same sex from entering lawful marriage." The act amended the Civil Code to define marriage as "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary." Opponents of the bill included Assemblyman Willie Brown (who authored the repeal of California's sodomy law in 1975) and Senator Milton Marks. The bill passed 23-5 in the state Senate and 68-2 in the Assembly. It was signed on August 17, 1977 by Governor Jerry Brown (who is also poised to sign its repeal via SB 1306).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/3882868/ |title=The Bakersfield Californian › 19 August 1977 › Page 3 |publisher=Newspapers.com |date=1977-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Carla Marinucci |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Brown-s-switch-on-Prop-8-reflects-times-3255275.php |title=Brown's switch on Prop. 8 reflects times |publisher=SFGate |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57684513/ |title=The San Bernardino County Sun › 12 August 1977 › Page 5 |publisher=Newspapers.com |date=1977-08-12 |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl] Since 1994, this language is found in § 300 of the Family Code.

===Proposition 22 (2000)===

In the March 7, 2000 primary election, Proposition 22 was adopted by a vote of 61.4% to 38%, thus adding § 308.5 to the Family Code, largely replicating the 1977 enactment. The one-sentence code section explicitly defined the union of a man and a woman as the only valid or recognizable form of marriage in the State of California. Proposition 22 was authored by State Senator William J. Knight, and the measure was dubbed the "Knight initiative" in an attempt to link it to the failed "Briggs Initiative" (Proposition 6 of 1978) that would have banned gays and lesbians from working as teachers in California's public schools. The California Supreme Court invalidated the results of Proposition 22 in 2008.

===Legislative action on same-sex marriage===

When California State Legislature opened the 2005-2006 session, Assembly member Mark Leno introduced Assembly Bill 19, which proposed legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill gained the support of then-Speaker Fabian Núñez among others.[tpl]cite web | url=http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_19&sess=0506&house=B&author=leno | title=Assembly Bill 19 (2005-2006) Legislative Documents | publisher=Legislative Counsel of California [/tpl] Leno had introduced a similar bill in the prior session, but it died in committee.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_1967&sess=0304&house=B&author=leno |title=Assembly Bill 1967 (2003-2004) Legislative Documents| publisher=Legislative Counsel of California [/tpl] Assembly committees reported out Assembly Bill 19 favorably, but the measure failed on the Assembly floor on June 2, 2005. Later that month, Assembly member Patty Berg amended the text of her fisheries-research measure, Assembly Bill 849, which was already in the Senate, to the text of Leno's failed bill.[tpl]cite web | url=http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_849&sess=0506&house=B&author=berg | title=Assembly Bill 849 (2005-2006) Legislative Documents | publisher=Legislative Counsel of California [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | url=ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/senate-journal/sen-journal-0x-20050628-1709.PDF | format = PDF | title=Committee on Rules: AB 849 Author's Amendments | journal=Senate Daily Journal | volume=2005-06 | page=1714 | date=June 28, 2005[/tpl]
On September 2, 2005, the California Senate approved the bill 21-15 and on September 6, the California State Assembly followed suit with a vote of 41-35, making California's legislature the first in the nation to approve a same-sex marriage bill without court pressure.  The next day, September 7, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger indicated he would veto the bill, citing Proposition 22, which had passed with the approval of a majority of voters five years earlier. Like the statutes amended by AB 849, Prop 22 prohibited the state from recognizing same-sex marriages, but as an initiative statute, it was not affected by AB 849. The legislature avoided physically delivering the bill to the governor for over two weeks, during which time advocacy groups urged Schwarzenegger to change his mind.  Ultimately, the bill was  delivered on September 23 and vetoed on September 29, 2005.[tpl]cite news |last=Buchanan |first=Wyatt |date=September 13, 2005 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/09/13/BAGP6EMO691.DTL |title=Gay rights advocates still trying to change Schwarzenegger's mind |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl] Schwarzenegger stated he believed that same-sex marriage should be settled by the courts or another vote by the people via a statewide initiative or referendum.[tpl]cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-09-07-gay-marriage_x.htm |title=Calif. governor to veto same-sex marriage bill |publisher=USA Today | date=September 7, 2005 | accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/1443/ |title=Statement by Gubernatorial Press Secretary Margita Thompson on AB 849[/tpl] He argued that the legislature's bill simply complicated the issue, as the constitutionality of Proposition 22 had not yet been determined, and its ultimate disposition would render AB 849 either unconstitutional (being in conflict with a valid voter initiative) or redundant (being guaranteed by the California Constitution itself, as construed by the courts).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S147999.PDF |format=PDF|title=Text of decision in In re Marriage Cases, Footnote 17, pg. 29-30 |date=May 15, 2008 |publisher=Supreme Court of California accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl]
Shortly after the newly elected Assembly was sworn in, Leno resubmitted a similar bill on December 4, 2006.AB 43, Bill Documents AB 43 was passed by the legislature in early September 2007, giving the governor until October 14, 2007, to either sign or veto the bill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/09/090707calif.htm |title=Calif.

===Proposition 8 (2008)===

Months before the state supreme court's ruling, groups who opposed same-sex marriage began circulating initiative petitions. One petition, #07-0068 (titled the "California Marriage Protection Act" by its proponents and the "Limit on Marriage" amendment by the California Attorney General on the actual ballot) gathered an estimated 764,063 valid signatures and qualified for the November 4, 2008 ballot as Proposition 8. The measure added § 7.5 to Article I of the California Constitution to replace the newly unenforceable Family Code § 308.5. It superseded the part of the Supreme Court's holding that authorized the granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Twelve other proposed amendments since 2004 had failed to qualify to be on the ballot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/initiatives/activeindex.php?active=I |title=Initiative Measures - Office of the California Attorney General |publisher=ag.ca.gov |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] The ability of the voters to remove a fundamental constitutional right by initiative amendment was challenged.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2008/inmyopinion052108.htm |publisher=Metropolitan News-Enterprise |date=May 21, 2008 |title=In My Opinion: Is The Proposed "Limit On Marriage" Initiative Too Late? |author=Kevin Norte[/tpl] A lawsuit filed on those grounds asking for the removal of Proposition 8 from the ballot was dismissed on July 16, 2008.

On Wednesday, November 5, 2008, three lawsuits were filed, challenging the validity of Proposition 8 on the grounds that revoking the right of same-sex couples to marry was a constitutional "revision" rather than an "amendment", and therefore required the prior approval of two-thirds of each house of the California State Legislature. Plaintiffs in the various suits included same-sex couples who had married or planned to marry, the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the county of Santa Clara.[tpl]cite news|author=Maura Dolan and Tami Abdollah|title=Gay rights backers file 3 lawsuits challenging Prop. 8|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=November 6, 2008|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gaylegal6-2008nov06,0,220763.story|accessdate=November 6, 2008[/tpl]  The California Supreme Court heard several challenges to Proposition 8 and on May 26, 2009, upheld the proposition but did not overturn previous same-sex marriages which occurred following their ruling in June 2008 and before the day following the November 4 election.

===The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act===

On October 12, 2009, following the passage of Proposition 8, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act (SB 54), legislation proposed by State Senator Mark Leno.[tpl]cite web|last=McGuire |first=Bobby |url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&sc=&sc2=news&sc3=&id=97558 |title=Schwarzenegger signs Milk Day, marriage recognition into law |publisher=edgeboston.com |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl]Schwarzenegger signs gay rights bills[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] The bill established that some of the same-sex marriages performed outside the state are also recognized by the state of California as "marriage", depending on the date of the union.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-12/us/california.samesex.marriage_1_same-sex-marriages-unions-or-domestic-partnerships-california-family-council?_s=PM:US|title=California bill to recognize some same-sex marriages|date=October 12, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 17, 2012[/tpl]
After the California Supreme Court challenge following the passage of Proposition 8, the California Supreme Court Justices affirmed that all same-sex marriages performed in California before the passage of Proposition 8 continued to  be valid and recognized as "marriage". The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act also established that a same-sex marriage performed outside the state is recognized as "marriage" if it occurred before Proposition 8 took effect. This category also includes same-sex marriages performed before same-sex marriage became legal in California. SB 54 also mandates the full legal recognition of same-sex marriages lawfully performed outside of California after the passage of Proposition 8, with the sole exception that the relationship cannot be designated with the word "marriage".[tpl]cite web|author=Leno |url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0051-0100/sb_54_bill_20091011_chaptered.html |title=Text of SB 54 |publisher=info.sen.ca.gov |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] The law provides no label to be used in place of "marriage" to describe these relationships; they are not "domestic partnerships". The resumption of same-sex marriage in California on June 28, 2013 effectively supersedes this law with respect to out-of-state same-sex marriages.

===SB 1306===

Introduced by Senator Mark Leno on February 21, 2014, SB 1306 would repeal Sections 300 (AB 607, 1977), 308 (The Marriage Recognition and Family Recognition Act, author by Sen. Leno), 308.5 (Prop 22, California Defense of Marriage Act) of the Family Code, amend Section 300 to be gender neutral among other sections as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://openstates.org/ca/bills/20132014/SB1306/ |title=SB 1306 - California 2013-2014 Regular Session |publisher=Open States |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl]

==Court challenges==

===Trial court decision===

In February 2004, litigants filed five civil lawsuits in San Francisco Superior Court and one case in Los Angeles Superior Court. The parties included individuals and organizations opposed to same-sex marriage who sought to stop San Francisco from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The City and County of San Francisco and numerous individuals sued the state of California seeking to overturn Proposition 22, the existing state law that limited marriage to opposite-sex couples.
Eventually, all six cases were coordinated (In re Marriage Cases) and assigned to San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard Kramer. On March 14, 2005, Judge Kramer ruled that California statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples were unconstitutional.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issue_marriage_ca |title=NCLR: In re Marriage Cases |publisher=nclrights.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] The court held there was no rational connection between forbidding same-sex marriage and any legitimate state interest and the opposite-sex requirements impermissibly discriminated based on gender.

===Appellate court decision===

The state and organizations opposed to same-sex marriage appealed. Division Three of the First District Court of Appeal held extended oral argument on the cases on July 10, 2006, before a three-judge panel. In a 2-to-1 decision, the appellate court overturned the lower court.[ref]
[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/A110449.PDF  |format=PDF |title=First Appellate court decision in In re Marriage Cases |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070104224231/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/A110449.PDF |archivedate = January 4, 2007[/tpl][/ref] Writing for the majority, Presiding Justice William R. McGuiness found: The marriage statutes do not discriminate based on gender; the state’s interests in "preserving the traditional definition of marriage" and "carrying out the expressed wishes of a majority of Californians" were sufficient to preserve the existing law; and challenges from the two groups opposed to same-sex marriage had to be dismissed because they lacked standing in any actual controversy on which the court could rule.
The majority emphasized that it was not the role of the court to determine whether the "traditional definition" of marriage should be maintained. "The time may come when California chooses to expand the definition of marriage to encompass same-sex unions," McGuiness writes. "That change must come from democratic processes, however, not by judicial fiat."
In a sharply worded dissent, Justice J. Anthony Kline (Presiding Justice of Division Two, sitting by designation because two Justices had recused themselves) described the court’s reasoning as "circular." He wrote that the majority’s indifference to the reasons why marriage is a fundamental right unintentionally "diminish the humanity of the lesbians and gay men whose rights are defeated." Both justices in the majority commented at length on Justice Kline’s dissent.

===Supreme Court of California review===

In November 2006, several parties petitioned the Supreme Court of California to review the decision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=447693&doc_no=S147999 |title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information |publisher=appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the Supreme Court to take up the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_849&sess=0506&house=B&author=leno |title=Bill List |publisher=leginfo.ca.gov |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] In December 2006, the Supreme Court voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral argument on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as In re Marriage Cases.
On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court struck down California's existing statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples in a 4-3 ruling.[tpl]cite news|last=Egelko|first=Bob|title=State's top court strikes down marriage ban|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/State-s-top-court-strikes-down-marriage-ban-3213394.php|accessdate=October 30, 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 16, 2008[/tpl] The judicial ruling overturned the one-man, one-woman marriage law which the California Legislature had passed in 1977 and Proposition 22. After the ruling, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a statement repeating his pledge to oppose Proposition 8, the ballot initiative that would override the ruling.
The opinion, written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, cited the Court's 1948 decision in Perez v. Sharp where the state's interracial marriage ban was held unconstitutional.  It found that "equal respect and dignity" of marriage is a "basic civil right" that cannot be withheld from same-sex couples, that sexual orientation is a protected class like race and gender, and that any classification or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the California State Constitution. Associate Justices Joyce L. Kennard, Kathryn Werdegar, and Carlos R. Moreno concurred. It is the first state high court in the country to do so.[tpl]cite news |first=Adam |last=Liptak |title=California Court Affirms Right to Gay Marriage  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-marriage.html?pagewanted=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 16, 2008 [/tpl] The Massachusetts State Supreme Court, by contrast, did not find sexual orientation to be a protected class, and instead voided its gay-marriage ban on rational basis review.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/conlaw/goodridge111803opn.pdf |format=PDF|title=Text of the Massachusetts ruling in Goodridge v.

After the announcement, the Advocates for Faith and Freedom and the Alliance Defense Fund, inter alia, asked for a stay of the ruling. In a one-page order on June 4, 2008, the court denied all petitions for rehearing or to reconsider the May 15 ruling and rejected moves to delay enforcement of the decision until after the November election, when Californians voted on a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. As a result, same-sex marriages took place starting in mid-June. Chief Justice Ronald George and Justices Joyce Kennard, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos Moreno, voted for the resolution, while dissenting or voting to reconsider the judgment, were Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming Chin and Carol Corrigan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-gay-marriagejun05,0,6075700.story|title=Calif. court refuses to stall gay marriage|author=Maura Dolan, Jessica Garrison|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=June 5, 2008|accessdate=May 17, 2012[/tpl] The order stated, "The decision filed on May 15, 2008, will become final on June 16, 2008, at 5 p.m." San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that marriages would be held  "5:01" on June 16.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/us/politics/05stay.html?ref=us |title=Court Won't Delay Same-Sex Marriages | work=The New York Times | first=Jesse | last=McKinley | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-marriage5-2008jun05,0,7825437.story |title=California Supreme Court refuses to delay gay marriage |publisher=LA Times online | first1=Maura | last1=Dolan | first2=Jessica | last2=Garrison | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl] The final stage of the case was the issuance of a writ of mandate by the Superior Court to the Registrar of Vital Statistics on June 19, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/courts/media_center/writ.pdf |format=PDF|title=San Francisco Superior Court Issues Orders to Implement Supreme Court Decision Making State Marriage Law Gender Neutral |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 20, 2008[/tpl]

===Legal challenges to Proposition 8===

On June 20, 2008, gay rights groups filed suit before the California Supreme Court seeking to remove the initiative from the November ballot; their lawsuit was later dismissed on July 16, 2008.[tpl]cite news |title=Bid to ban gay marriage will stay on ballot, California Supreme Court rules|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gaymarriage17-2008jul17,0,672698.story |date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=July 21, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Maura|last=Dolan[/tpl] They argued that the changes would constitute a revision to the California Constitution, which requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature before being placed before voters, rather than a mere amendment, which does not require involvement by the legislature. They further argued that the original petitions, which were circulated before the May 15 court decision, were misleading because the petitions said the initiative would not change the marriage laws and would have no fiscal impact.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/20/BAC211CKE5.DTL&type=politics.htm |publisher= San Francisco Chronicle |date=June 20, 2008 |title=Gay marriage backers want ban issue off ballot | first=Bob | last=Egelko[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/politics/cal/la-me-court21-2008jun21,0,7740249.story |title=Gay rights groups ask California Supreme Court to block initiative banning same-sex marriage |date=June 21, 2008 |accessdate=June 22, 2008 | work=Los Angeles Times |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080626085903/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/politics/cal/la-me-court21-2008jun21,0,7740249.story |archivedate = June 26, 2008[/tpl]
Prior to the election date, backers of the proposition also filed a lawsuit after state Attorney General Jerry Brown changed the title of the Proposition 8 initiative from "Limit on Marriage" to "Eliminates the Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry".Ruling expected today on gay marriage ballot, San Jose Mercury News, August 8, 2008  On August 8, 2008, Superior Court Judge Timothy Frawley ruled that "The attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry", so the new name would appear on the ballots.Judge refuses to order change in Prop. 8 title San Francisco Chronicle, August 9, 2008
On the day of the Strauss v. Horton decision–in which the California State Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8 as a lawful amendment of the state constitution–the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge the validity of Proposition 8 under the U.S. Constitution in a case known as Perry v. Schwarzenegger. Judge Vaughn R. Walker ordered a full trial which began in January 2010.  It addressed questions as wide-ranging as whether being gay diminishes one's contribution to society, affects one's ability to raise children, impairs judgment, or constitutes a mental disorder.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/19/BA7T19AQ10.DTL&tsp=1|title=Judge sets January trial for Prop. 8 lawsuit|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|author=Egelko, Bob|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009[/tpl]  Judge Walker ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, violating both the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution, and on August 12, 2010, had scheduled to deny a motion to stay the ruling throughout the appeals process.

===Further legal challenges to the scope of the injunction barring enforcement of Proposition 8===

Proposition 8 proponents argued that the district court's injunction is applicable only to the two couples who are the plaintiffs in the case or, at most, applies to the two counties whose clerks were named as defendants. California Attorney General Kamala Harris, however, issued an analysis that the district court's injunction applies statewide and binds upon all 58 of California's counties based on the interpretation of California Supreme Court's decision in Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AG-letter-re-Prop.-8.pdf |title=Attorney General Letter re Prop 8 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] stating that county clerks are state officials under supervision of Department of Public Health for the limited purpose of issuing marriage licenses and are thus bound by the injunction. Governor Brown then directed all county clerks to comply with district court ruling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18120 |title=Governor Brown Directs California Department of Public Health to Notify Counties that Same-Sex Marriages Must Commence |publisher=gov.ca.gov |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl]
On July 12, 2013, Proposition 8 proponents petitioned California Supreme Court in case Hollingsworth v. O’Connell (CA S.Ct docket: S211990), invoking court's original jurisdiction under Article VI §10 of the California Constitution, asking the CA Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandate and immediate stay or injunction ordering county clerks to enforce Proposition 8. Arguing that the district court lacks authority to grant relief beyond the named plaintiffs or, even if the district court has such authority, its injunction only binds to two county clerks who are named defendants. They also argue that Article III §3.5 of California Constitution prohibits Administrative officials from declaring a law unconstitutional or unenforceable or refuse to enforce the law unless an appellate court has made such determination. Since US Supreme Court's ruling in Hollingsworth v. Perry held that Proposition 8 proponents lack legal standing to appeal district court's decision, the decision of the Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit was vacated with no legal effect or precedent.
California Supreme Court ordered to parties to brief on the merits and whether the stay should be issued[tpl]cite web|url=http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CA-SCt-order-7-12-13-re-Prop-8-stay-etc.pdf |title=CA-Supreme Court-Order-7-12-13 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] and on July 15, it denied the application for stay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2050721&doc_no=S211990 |title=Court Docket: S211990 |publisher=appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov |accessdate=September 12, 2013[/tpl] On July 19, San Diego County Clerk Ernest J.

===Legality===

City officials in San Francisco claimed that although the 2004 marriages were prohibited by state law, the state law was invalidated by the Equal Protection Clause. The mayor echoed this view, permitting the marriages because he believed the state law was unconstitutional.  However, legislators and groups opposing same-sex marriages quickly reacted, filing a suit and requesting a court order to prevent the city from performing the ceremonies. Additionally, the California state agency that records marriages stated that altered forms, including any marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples, would not be registered. The legal validity of the marriages was tested in the courts, and the marriages were ultimately voided by the state Supreme Court.
Officials in Berkeley and Oakland, in nearby Alameda County, expressed interest in joining San Francisco[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] but were unable to do so because marriage licenses are handled at a county, rather than at a city, level. San Francisco was able to issue its own licenses because San Francisco is both a city and a county.

===Statistics===

Marriage licenses were issued to 4,037 same-sex couples in 2004 before the state Supreme Court issued its stay.[tpl]cite news| last = Murphy| first = Dean E.| title = San Francisco Married 4,037 Same-Sex Pairs From 46 States | newspaper=New York Times| date = March 18, 2004| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/us/san-francisco-married-4037-same-sex-pairs-from-46-states.html | accessdate =February 21, 2012[/tpl] During the same period, the San Francisco City Hall issued 103 opposite-sex marriage licenses.
Of those same-sex marriage licenses issued, 82 couples either decided not to go through with a marriage or failed to register their marriage with the county before the state Supreme Court stay was issued, meaning 3,955 completed same-sex marriages were registered in the county.[tpl]cite news | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Timeline of same-sex marriage in California | date=February 8, 2012 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/02/07/BANB1N4871.DTL | accessdate=February 21, 2012[/tpl]
By reviewing first names of applicants, San Francisco officials estimated that 57 percent of the same-sex married couples were women. Demographic information gleaned from the registered licenses also shows the newlywed same-sex couples were older and better educated than the average American household. More than 74 percent were over age 35, while 69 percent had at least one college degree.
According to figures released March 17, 2004 by San Francisco County Assessor Mabel Teng, although 91.4 percent of the licenses were granted to couples living in California, other couples came from every state in the United States except for Maine, Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming.
Of the other states, the top five states represented included 32 couples each from Washington and Oregon, 24 from Nevada, 20 from New York and 16 from Florida. International same-sex couples, 17 in all, came from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands,  Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom. and Venezuela.
