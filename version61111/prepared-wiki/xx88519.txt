==Early life==

Sienkiewicz was born May 3, 1958, in Blakely, Pennsylvania. When he was five years old, he moved with his family to Hainesville, New Jersey, where he attended elementary and secondary school.Marvel Age No. 53 (July 1985): "The Marvel Age Interview: Bill Sienkiewicz", pp. 20–22
Sienkiewicz began drawing "when he was about four or five", and continued doing and learning about art throughout his childhood. His early comic-book influences include artist Curt Swan Superman comics, and artist Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four.
Sieniewicz attended the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts in Newark, New Jersey.
After art school, he showed a portfolio of his work to DC Comics' art director Vince Colletta, which led to his breaking into the field at age 19.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Shooter, Jim|story= Introduction|title= Moon Knight Special Edition|issue= 1|date= November 1983[/tpl] The artist recalled in 1985, "They didn't have any work for me, but that didn't bother me. I just figured that if comics didn't work out I'd have done advertising or illustration. Vinnie called comics and advertising artist Neal Adams, who put me in touch with Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. Soon after that I was drawing Moon Knight, in The Hulk comics magazine". His art style was heavily influenced by Neal Adams.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=38|title= Bill Sienkiewicz Interview|first= Michael|last= Thomas|date= July 17, 2001|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121012141005/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=38|archivedate= October 12, 2012|deadurl= no|quote= Studying Neal's work, ...

When I finally got started, what got me hired was the fact that I drew like Neal. Neal in fact called up Shooter and said, 'I've got this kid fresh off the street and he draws like me. Is that a problem?'[/tpl]
