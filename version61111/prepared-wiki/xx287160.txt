The dhyāngro is a frame drum played by the jhakri (shamans) of Nepal—especially those of the Magars, the Kirati, and the Tamang—as well as by Tibetan Buddhist musicians.
The dhyāngro may be either single- or double-headed. Double-headed drums are said to have a male side and a female side.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bhola nath Banstola |editor-last=Breeze-Wood |editor-first=Nicholas |year=2008 |title=Jhankri: The Shamans of Nepal |journal=Sacred Hoop Magazine|issue=60 |pages= |publisher= |format=PDF |issn=1364-2219 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |url=http://www.nepalese.it/sites/default/files/BHOLA_0.pdf[/tpl] The drumhead, which is made from animal skin, is struck with a curved beater fashioned from cane.[tpl]cite web |url=http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/Tibet/3980/DrumNepal.html#beater |title=Images from the Beede Gallery: Frame Drum (Dhyāngro), Nepal, Early 20th Century |author= |year=2010 |website=National Music Museum |publisher=University of South Dakota |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] The frame may also be equipped with jingles. Like the na drum of Tibet, but unlike most frame drums, the dhyāngro usually has a handle. The carving in the wooden handle of a dhyāngro may be quite intricate; owing to Buddhist influence, the handles of some drums are fashioned into a kīla.
A jhakri plays the dhyāngro during traditional shamanic ceremonies. The drum is occasionally used in Tibetan Buddhist celebrations, as in an orchestra performing Buddhist music. For example, such a performance greeted the seventh Ling Rinpoche when he visited the Tadika Than Hsiang Farlim and Child Care Centre on Penang Island.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thanhsiang.org/en/content/visit-his-eminence-7th-ling-rinpoche-0 |title=Visit by His Eminence the 7th Ling Rinpoche  |author= |date=31 December 2009 |website=Than Hsiang Temple |publisher= |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
