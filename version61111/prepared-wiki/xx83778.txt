Following tours as an F/A-18 flight instructor and as a catapult officer aboard the [tpl]USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6[/tpl], Oswald resigned from active Navy duty and joined Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a civilian test pilot. As a reservist, Rear Adm. Oswald flew the RF-8 and the A-7 until 1988 when he transferred to the fledgling Naval Reserve space community. His assignments included three command tours, the last of which was at the Navy Space Systems Division in the Pentagon as Director, Naval Space Reserve Program. In 2000 and 2001, he served on active duty as Deputy Commander, Joint Task Force â€“ Computer Network Operations based in the Washington, D.C. He was assigned as the Reserve Deputy to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (OPNAV N6/7) in the Pentagon.

Oswald joined NASA in November 1984 as an aerospace engineer and instructor pilot and was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 1985. His technical assignments within the Astronaut Office have included: flight crew representative to Kennedy Space Center; flight software testing with the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory; crew representative to the Marshall Space Flight Center on solid rocket booster redesign; and spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center during Space Shuttle missions. He was also the Chief of the Operations Development Branch within the Astronaut Office and served as Assistant Director of Engineering at Johnson Space Center.
Oswald has piloted two missions aboard the [tpl]OV|103[/tpl]: STS-42, the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 mission, flown in January 1992, and STS-56, the second Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS-2) mission, flown in April 1993. Oswald commanded STS-67, the second flight of the Astro observatory (Astro II), which flew on the [tpl]OV|105[/tpl] in March, 1995. This mission established a mission duration record for Space Shuttle at 17 days. With the completion of his third space flight, Oswald has logged over 33 days in space.
After STS-67, Oswald was assigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Operations. In this capacity, he was responsible for Space Shuttle, Expendable launch vehicles, and Space Communications for the Agency.
