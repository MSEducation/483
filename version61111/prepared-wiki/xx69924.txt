Swing Time Records was a United States based record label, active in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The label was founded by Jack Lauderdale in 1947 as Down Beat Records and was headquartered in Los Angeles, California. In approximately October, 1949 the name was changed to Swing Beat Records, and shortly, near March 1950, the name was changed again to Swing Time.[tpl]cite book |title= The American Record Label Directory and Dating Guide, 1940-1959|last=Gart|first=Galen|year=1989|publisher=Big Nickel Publications|location=Milford, New Hampshire|isbn=0-936433-11-6|page=215[/tpl]  The company went bankrupt in 1953[tpl]cn|date=April 2013[/tpl], but continued releasing singles as late as February 1954.

==Leasing/Purchasing/Reissuing/Signings==

Lauderdale started his label off by recording the Lucky Thompson Quartet with Dodo Marmarosa in late 1946 (releasing three discs during 1947). Felix Gross & His Sextet were another early signing. (releasing eight discs during 1947 thru 1949). He then leased/reissued the Five Soul Stirrers recordings from Bronze Records (releasing three discs in 1947). Next up was the leasing/reissuing of Lowell Fulson's recordings for Bob Geddins' Big Town/Down Town/Cava-Tone group of labels and the Bob Geddins/Rene LaMarre-partnered Trilon label (a total of 12 discs were released starting in 1947 thru 1949). Jack also got masters of "Jimmy McCracklin & His Blues Blasters" from Trilon. Lauderdale then purchased in 1950 all the master recordings by the Charles Brown-led "Johnny Moore's Three Blazers" from Leon Ren√©'s Exclusive Records plus the masters by Brown's ex-wife, Mabel Scott. Still not done, Jack purchased Al Patrick's defunct Supreme label and reissued recordings by Jimmy Witherspoon with Jay McShann's band featuring Louis Speiginer on guitar, Paula Watson, Percy Mayfield, Floyd Dixon with Eddie Williams' Trio (AKA "The Brown Buddies"), Sister Emily Bram, the "Stars Of Harmony" gospel group, and Maxwell Davis' band with Marshall Royal starting in late 1950 thru 1951. Added to all this activity was the signing of pianist Lloyd Glenn as recording artist/house band leader/session arranger and label A&R man.  Also signed-up were Pete Johnson's band with Big Joe Turner, and the Maxin/Maxim Trio with Ray Charles. Dexter Gordon's quintet with Wardell Gray recorded a session (releasing two discs), and songwriter/bass player Shifty Henry recorded for the Swing Time label (one disc released in 1950). It all wound-down for Lauderdale's enterprise with Play Boy Thomas (two discs released in 1953) and the Hollywood Flames featuring Bobby Byrd (one disc in 1954).

==Numbering system==

The Down Beat/Swing Beat/Swing Time Records numbering system ran from #100 (1947) thru #347 (1954). Lauderdale also started up a subsidiary label in late 1952: Flame Records' numbering system ran from #1001 thru #1009.
