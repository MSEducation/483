The Mummy is a 1999 American adventure and horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v179644|work=Allmovie|title=The Mummy|accessdate=December 8, 2012|author=Deming, Mark|publisher=Rovi Corporation[/tpl] It is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name which starred Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the movie was eventually turned into a blockbuster adventure film.
Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.
The Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; the movie went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, The Mummy Returns, as well as The Mummy: The Animated Series, and the spin-off film The Scorpion King. Seven years later, the third installment, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, opened on August 1, 2008. Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, Revenge of the Mummy, in 2004. Novelizations of the movie and its sequels were written by Max Allan Collins.

==Plot==

In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovered their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch. As Seti's guards arrive, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun killed herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep and his priests stole her corpse and travelled to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, where they began the resurrection ceremony. However, they were intercepted by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul was sent back to the Underworld. Imhotep's priests were mummified alive; Imhotep was sentenced to immortal agony, condemned to suffer the Hom Dai curse, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. He was buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the Medjai; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface.
Over 3000 years later in 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer named Rick O'Connell, currently in prison. Evelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit of the French Foreign Legion found the location years ago. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged.
Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former comrade of Rick. Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Ardeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city. Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a box containing the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot. Before opening the box, Chamberlain reads an engraving saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened. The men ignore the warnings, but Beni refuses to assist them, and flees.
At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. The expeditions flee to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the antagonist promises not to kill Beni in return. Imhotep absorbs the life from the American expedition, returning to full strength. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. After Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again. After discovering the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group. Imhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group anyway. However, Rick discovers an entrance to the sewers and they escape. Terrence sacrifices himself to buy the others time to escape.
Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Evelyn is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests, and she reads from the Book of Amun-Ra. Imhotep becomes mortal, and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death. Rapidly decaying, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge with the same words he carved into his sarcophagus, Death is only the beginning. While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. The heroes escape, although they lose the Book of Amun-Ra in the process.  Rick, Jonathan and Evelyn ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.

==Production==

===Origins===

In 1992, producer James Jacks decided to update the original Mummy film for the 1990s.[tpl]cite news|title=The Mummy That Wasn't|publisher=Cinescape|date=May 3, 1999[/tpl] Universal Studios gave him the go-ahead, but only if he kept the budget around $10 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Hobson|first=Louis B|title=Universal rolls out new, improved Mummy|publisher=Calgary Sun|date=May 1, 1999 [/tpl] The producer remembers that the studio "essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise"; in response, Jacks recruited horror filmmaker/writer Clive Barker on board to direct. Barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.[tpl]cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=Unwrapping The Mummy| publisher=Toronto Sun|date=May 2, 1999 [/tpl] Jacks recalls that Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism", and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie". After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company. Filmmaker George A. Romero was brought in with a vision of a zombie-style horror movie similar to Night of the Living Dead, but this was considered too scary by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture.
Joe Dante was the next choice, increasing the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (co-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, making it to the final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15 million and rejected Dante's version. Soon after, Mick Garris was attached to direct but eventually left the project,[tpl]cite news|last=Chase|first=Donald|title=What Have They Unearthed?|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 3, 1999[/tpl] and Wes Craven was offered the film but turned it down. Then, Stephen Sommers called Jacks in 1997 with his vision of The Mummy "as a kind of Indiana Jones or Jason and the Argonauts with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time". Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale.[tpl]cite news|last=Snead|first=Elizabeth|title=Updating A Well-Preserved Villain|publisher=USA Today|date=May 7, 1999[/tpl] He had wanted to make a Mummy film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment. At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of Babe: Pig in the City, and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.[tpl]cite web|first=Liane|last=Bonin|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84361,00.html|title=That's a Wrap|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1999-05-07|accessdate= 2008-04-01[/tpl] Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15 million to $80 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Argent|first=Daniel|title=Unwrapping The Mummy: An Interview with Stephen Sommers|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|year=1999[/tpl]

===Principal photography===

Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17 weeks. Photography then moved to the Sahara desert outside the small town of Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29, 1998.[tpl]cite web|title=Behind the Scenes|work=The Mummy Official Site|publisher=Universal Studios|year=1999|url=http://www.mummyvideo.com/bhs/| accessdate=2007-05-24 [/tpl] The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions.[tpl]cite news|last=Portman|first=Jamie|title=Mummy Unearths Horror, Humour|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|date=May 5, 1999 [/tpl] To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.
Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, "He Fraser stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated." The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them, a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273360_3,00.html|title=Show Me The Mummy (page 3)|author=Staff|date=1999-05-14|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-04-01[/tpl]
Production Designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the location because, "A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile.[tpl]cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1999/10/the-mummy-1999/|title=Kent Film Office The Mummy Film Focus[/tpl] This set was [tpl]convert|600|ft|m|0[/tpl] in length and featured "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".

===Special effects===

The filmmakers reportedly spent $15 million of the $80 million budget on special effects, provided by Industrial Light & Magic;[tpl]cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=Mummy Unwraps a New Fraser "Cartoon" Character|publisher=Toronto Sun|date=1999-05-09[/tpl] the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies. John Andrew Berton, Jr., Industrial Light & Magic's Visual Effects Supervisor on The Mummy, started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used motion capture in order to achieve "a menacing and very realistic Mummy". Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.[tpl]cite journal|first=Estelle|last=Shay|title=Thoroughly modern Mummy|journal=Cinefex|date=April 1999|issue=77|pages=71–76|quote=On the special effects used in the film, and on the company who made them, Industrial Light & Magic. [/tpl]
To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." Vosloo described the filming as a "whole new thing" for him; "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.

==Soundtrack==

The Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage. The soundtrack was released by Decca Records on May 4, 1999. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219|title=The Mummy (Jerry Goldsmith) Soundtrack Review|work=ScoreReviews.com|accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080215095846/http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219 |archivedate=February 15, 2008[/tpl] Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work.
Overall, Goldsmith's score was well received. Allmusic described it as a "grand, melodramatic score" which delivered the expected highlights.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r414518|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Allmusic: The Mummy (1999 Original Score)|work=Allmusic|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl] Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall.[tpl]cite web|author=Coleman, Christopher|year=2000|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/themummy.htm|title=The Mummy by Jerry Goldsmith|work=TrackSounds.com|accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl] On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mummy.html|title=The Mummy: Editorial Review|work=FilmTracks.com|accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl] and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition. Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as "representative of both Goldsmith's absolute best and his most mediocre. Thankfully ... his favourable work on this release wins out."

===Critical reaction===

The Mummy has received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 55% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087270-mummy/|title=The Mummy|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2007-06-24[/tpl] and a 48 Metascore at Metacritic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-mummy|title=The Mummy: Reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2007-06-24[/tpl] Roger Ebert, a film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing "There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased."[tpl]cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Mummy|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1999-05-07|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990507/REVIEWS/905070303/1023|accessdate=2006-11-29[/tpl] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "B-" grade and said, "The Mummy would like to make you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality."[tpl]cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=The Mummy|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 7, 1999|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64020,00.html|accessdate=2006-12-19[/tpl] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.[tpl]cite news|author=Graham, Bob|title='Mummy' -- It's Alive|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1999-05-07|accessdate=2008-02-03[/tpl]
Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote, "This version of The Mummy has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think Night of the Living Dead stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (The Road to Hamunaptra?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof."[tpl]cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Sarcophagus, Be Gone: Night of the Living Undead|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 7, 1999|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D7103CF934A35756C0A96F958260&scp=3&sq=The+Mummy&st=nyt|accessdate=2006-11-29[/tpl] Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion;[tpl]cite news|author=Savlov, Mark|title=The Mummy|publisher=The Austin Chronicle|date=1999-05-07|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A142860|accessdate=2008-03-12[/tpl] talking about the special effects, the Observer lamented "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy."[tpl]cite news|author=Hinson, Hal|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-05-13/film/mummy-dearest/|title=Mummy dearest|publisher=Dallas Observer|date=1999-05-07|accessdate=2008-03-20[/tpl] Other publications such as Jump Cut felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy; "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the Jump Cut, "is standard-issue I.L.&M.".[tpl]cite journal|first=Ernest|last=Larsen|title=The Mummy: traffic in mummies|journal=Jump Cut|url=http://ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/Mummy.html|date=July 2000| issue=43|pages=12–15, 128 |accessdate=2008-04-09[/tpl] Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred.[tpl]cite web|author=Newman, Kim|date=1999-06-01|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/152|title=Sight and Sound: The Mummy|work=British Film Institute|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl] "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene.
