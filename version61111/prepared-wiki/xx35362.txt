CATEGORIES: Fictional computers, Lists of fictional things, Science fiction themes, Artificial intelligence in fiction, Computing-related lists

Computers have often been used as fictional objects in literature, movies and in other forms of media. Fictional computers tend to be considerably more sophisticated than anything yet devised in the real world.
This is a list of computers that have appeared in notable works of fiction. The work may be about the computer, or the computer may be an important element of the story.  Only static computers are included. Robots and other fictional computers that are described as existing in a mobile or humanlike form are discussed in a separate list of fictional robots and androids.
