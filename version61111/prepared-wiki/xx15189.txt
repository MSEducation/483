[[Eastern Europe]]

CATEGORIES: Eastern Europe, Regions of Europe

Eastern Europe is the eastern part of the European continent. The term has widely disparate and varying geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic readings, which makes it highly context-dependent and even volatile. There are "almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region"."The Balkans", Global Perspectives: A Remote Sensing and World Issues Site. Wheeling Jesuit University/Center for Educational Technologies, 1999-2002. A related United Nations paper adds that "every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct".A Subdivision of Europe into Larger Regions by Cultural Criteria prepared by Peter Jordan, the framework of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (StAGN), Vienna, Austria, 2006
One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural (and econo-cultural) entity: the region lying in Europe with main characteristics consisting in Byzantine, Orthodox, and some Turco-Islamic influences.[tpl]Cite book |last=Ramet |first=Sabrina P. |title=Eastern Europe: politics, culture, and society since 1939 |page=15 |year=1998 |publisher=Indiana University Press |url= http://books.google.com/?id=eWmDAd6vr5sC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=eastern+europe+definition#v=onepage&q=eastern%20europe%20definition&f=false |accessdate=2011-10-05 |isbn=0253212561 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]This definition is fulfilled by Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Another definition was created during the Cold War and used more or less synonymously with the term Eastern Bloc. A similar definition names the formerly communist European states outside the Soviet Union as Eastern Europe. Although some view such definitions as outdated,"The geopolitical conditions (...) are now a thing of the past, and some specialists today think that Eastern Europe has outlived its usefulness as a phrase."[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11016/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Future-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions, Regionalism, Eastern Europe by Steven Cassedy |publisher=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-01-31 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]The Economist: Eastern Europe a bogus term – South Eastern Europe – The Sofia Echo"One very common, but now outdated, definition of Eastern Europe was the Soviet-dominated communist countries of Europe."http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/balkans/BKdef.html"Too much writing on the region has – consciously or unconsciously – clung to an outdated image of 'Eastern Europe', desperately trying to patch together political and social developments from Budapest to Bukhara or Tallinn to Tashkent without acknowledging that this Cold War frame of reference is coming apart at the seams.

==Definitions==

Several definitions of Eastern Europe exist today, but they often lack precision or are extremely general. These definitions vary both across cultures and among experts, even political scientists, recently becoming more and more imprecise.Drake, Miriam A. (2005) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, CRC Press

===Geographical===

The Ural Mountains, Ural River, and the Caucasus Mountains are the geographical land border of the eastern edge of Europe. In the west, however, the cultural and religious boundaries of "Eastern Europe" are subject to considerable overlap and, most importantly, have undergone historical fluctuations, which make a precise definition of the western boundaries of Eastern Europe somewhat difficult.
