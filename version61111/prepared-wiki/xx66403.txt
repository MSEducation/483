==History==

During World War II, the airport in Otopeni was used as an airbase by the German air force. Up to 1965, it was restricted for military use and was one of the major bases of the Romanian Air Force, with a runway of [tpl]convert|1200|m|ft[/tpl]. Băneasa Airport was the only airport that Bucharest used for commercial flights. In 1965, with the growth of air traffic, a new commercial airport was constructed in the settlement of Otopeni, where the military air base used to be. The runway was modernised and extended up to [tpl]convert|3500|m|ft[/tpl], making it one of the longest in Europe at that time.AIHCB 2007 Report at bucharestairports.ro
In August 1969, when President Nixon of the United States visited Romania, a VIP lounge was inaugurated. A new passenger terminal (designed by Cezar Lăzărescu), with a capacity of 1,200,000 passengers per year, was opened on 13 April 1970, for domestic and international flights. The airport slowly became more and more used by airlines, with a growing number of passengers. In 1986, it entered a new phase of development. A second 3500-metre runway was constructed, as well as related taxiways. The airport lighting system was improved and the capacity was increased to 35 airport movements per hour.
In 1992, Otopeni Airport became a regular member of Airports Council International (ACI). In the same year a long-term, multi-stage upgrade plan was devised, anticipating a sharp increase in traffic as traveling restrictions to and from Romania were lifted.
The first stage of the plan (Phase I), taking place between 1994 and 1998, involved the construction a new departures terminal and of a new airside concourse with five jetways and nine gates (referred to as 'the Finger') as well as the extension of airport ramps and of their associated taxiways.[ref]http://www.mt.ro/transparenta/HG_%20finantare_lucrari_dezvoltarea_si_modernizarea_aeroportului_otopeni.htm

The second phase (labeled Phase II/IIe) of the plan led to the construction of a terminal dedicated to domestic flights and of a multi-story car park (2003), the complete overhaul of the control tower (between 2005–2007) as well as the transformation of the old terminal building in a dedicated arrivals hall (in 2000). During the same phase, two high-speed taxiways (Oscar and Victor) were constructed. Phase II was completed in 2007.
The third stage of the plan (Phase III), started in 2009, involves the extension of the airside concourse ('the Finger') with 15 new gates (of which nine jetways), as well as the expansion of Departure Hall (eight new gates) and Arrivals Hall. The airside concourse, designed by Studio Capelli Architettura & Associati, was inaugurated on 29 March 2011."The Bucharest Airport at a10.eu It was followed, in November 2012, by the extension of the Departure Hall.New Departing Hall extension opened [tpl]Ro icon[/tpl]

===Current and future development===

The airport is undertaking Phase III of its development program, a €150 million investment, which consist of the expansion of Departure Hall, Arrivals Hall and the concourse. At the end of this phase, the terminal will have a processing capacity of 4,500 passengers per hour,Bucharest Henri Coandă Airport – Development&Modernization – Phase III and capacity is expected to rise to 6 million passengers annually on domestic and international routes.Extensions to the Coandă Airport [tpl]Ro icon[/tpl]
Beyond Phase III, a new terminal building (Henri Coandă 2), at the eastern end of the current location is envisaged. Henri Coandă 2 will be of a modular design, consisting of four separate buildings, each capable of handling 5 million passengers annually. Each module will be built as traffic demands dictate. Thus, by 2023, Terminal 2 alone should be able to handle the 20 million passengers per year indicated by estimates. The terminal will be directly connected to A3 motorway, to the railway system, and to the Bucharest Metro system as Bucharest Metro Line M6.http://www.mt.ro [tpl]Ro icon[/tpl] The Romanian Ministry of Transportation
