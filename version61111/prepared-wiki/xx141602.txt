==Design==

The Australian one dollar note was designed by Gordon Andrews, the design being accepted in April 1964. The note features Queen Elizabeth II wearing Garter robes on the obverse with the Australian Coat of Arms. This portrait was based on a photo taken by Douglas Glass.http://www.australianbanknotes.net/one_dollar_banknotes/index.htm The reverse of the note features Aboriginal Contemporary Art, created by David Malangi. The artwork depicts the 'mortuary feast' of one of the artist's creation ancestors, Gunmirringu, the great Ancestral Hunter. The Manharrngu people attribute this story as the origin of their mortuary rites.[tpl]cite web|title=No Ordinary Place: The Art of David Malangi|url=http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/malangi/pdf/EduKit.pdf|work=National Gallery of Australia website|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=21 June 2012|location=Canberra|page=6|format=Adobe Acrobat|year=2004[/tpl]
