==The Raikes Mausoleum==

The mausoleum was built in 1818 for Robert Raikes, at the north end of Welton Dale, approximately [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Welton village and Welton House. The building is circular with a shallow domed roof on top of a frieze decorated with triglyphs, and stands on a circular plinth that originally was railed. The inscription: AEDIFICAVIT ROBERTUS RAIKES ARMIGER AD MDCCCXVIII  (translation) Robert Raikes, Esquire, built this. 1818 AD  is above the entrance. Eight doric pilasters divide the exterior into bays, alternate bays are blind, the remainder decorated in relief with sarcophagii. The building is faced in light stone, and may have been modelled on an original Roman building.[ref]Sources:
The land alongside the Mausoleum was consecrated in 1822, for use as 'Welton Dale Burial ground' but was not commonly used.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
In 1960 the vault under the mausoleum was broken into, and disturbed, and a skull stolen, later recovered. After a coroners inquest and police investigation the vault was permanently sealed by the then land owner, Sir Basil Parkes.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
It has been a grade II listed building since 1968.
