[[Tongue-in-cheek]]

CATEGORIES: English idioms, Humour, Satire

Tongue-in-cheek is a figure of speech used to imply that a statement or other production is humorously or otherwise not seriously intended, and it should not be taken at face value. The facial expression typically indicates that one is joking or making a mental effort.[tpl]cite journal |title=A preliminary study of some of the motor phenomena of mental effort |first=E.

By 1842, the phrase had acquired its contemporary meaning, indicating that a statement was not meant to be taken seriously.[tpl]citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I.

==History==

Putting one's tongue into a cheek was formerly used to signify contempt.  For example, in Tobias George Smollett's The Adventures of Roderick Random, which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero is taking a coach to Bath and apprehends a highwayman.  This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random |authorlink=Tobias George Smollett | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780[/tpl][tpl]cquote|He looked back and pronounced with a faultering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.[/tpl]
A similar usage appears in 1828 in The Fair Maid of Perth by  Sir Walter Scott, "The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces like himself."  
The more modern ironic sense appears in the 1842 poem "The Ingoldsby Legends", in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:[tpl]cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org [/tpl]

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth—biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins & Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3[/tpl]
