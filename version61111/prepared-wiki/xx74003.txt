The Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, International  is a fellowship of churches and individuals representing various denominations or organizations (originally from an African-American Baptist background) that accepts the operation of spiritual gifts (the charismata) in the church today, in reaction to the teachings of many Baptist bodies. The polity they operate with is episcopal. It was founded by Bishop Paul S. Morton, Sr. in 1994. He is the current Presiding Bishop. The FGBCF has an Executive Council (which Bishop Paul S. Morton is the Chairman of), a Bishops Council, and several Auxiliary Department Bishops. The FGBCF has an annual Summer Convention that convenes in Atlanta, Georgia every year, much like the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) has its Annual Holy Convocation  in Memphis, Tennessee every year.
