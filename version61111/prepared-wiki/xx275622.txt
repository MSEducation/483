Secrist had two outstanding seasons in minor league baseball. After signing with the Baltimore Orioles, he was undefeated in seven decisions with a 1.96 earned run average for the 1963 Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class A Northern League.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference Drafted from the Orioles by the Cincinnati Reds following that season, Secrist spent five more years in the Reds' farm system. In his last, in 1968, he won 11 games and lost two for the Indianapolis Indians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Following that campaign, he was dealt with catcher Don Pavletich to the White Sox for pitcher Jack Fisher.
