Khuhro ([tpl]lang-ur|کھوڑو[/tpl]) is a Sindhi tribe in Sindh and Balochistan, Pakistan. Khuhros belong to the Abro clan of the Sammas. According to tradition the Khuhro settled in the fertile tract near the Indus River around the modern Larkana District and Khairpur District. As per some saying they belong to the Arab ethic group and are the decedents of Quraish Qabila. They came with Mohammad Bin Qasim and settled in Sindh province of Pakistan, which has the same weather as of their homeland.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The Khuhro tribe is found in ten villages of the Gambat taluka, Khairpur District, where until 2013 they were supporters of the PPP and PML-F political parties. In that year they were expected to change their support to Asad Khuhro, an independent election candidate from their own community who was also their tribal chief and a grandson of a former Pakistani Defence Minister, Muhammad Ayub Khuhro.[tpl]cite news |title=Khuhro likely to give PPP, PML-F tough time on PS-34 |date=1 April 2013 |publisher=One Pakistan |url=http://pakistan.onepakistan.com.pk/news/pakistan/196274-khuhro-likely-to-give-ppp-pml-f-tough-time-on-ps-34.html |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Chief of Khuhro tribe held after bail dismissal |publisher=Dawn |date=24 September 2013 |url=http://dawn.com/news/1045150/chief-of-khuhro-tribe-held-after-bail-dismissal |accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl]
