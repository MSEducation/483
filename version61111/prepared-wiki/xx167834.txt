Stephen Prescott MBE (26 December 1973 – 9 November 2013) was an international rugby league footballer. Prescott was born in St Helens, and started his professional career with his hometown club, who signed him in 1992. He made his debut for St Helens a year later, and soon established himself as the club's first choice fullback. In 1996, Prescott helped Saints win the league championship and Challenge Cup for the first time in two decades. He went on to win a second consecutive Challenge Cup with the club in 1997, but was sold to Hull Sharks at the end of the season.
After spending two years at Hull, Prescott joined Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, but rejoined Hull a year later after being released by Wakefield due to the club's financial difficulties.
Prescott made his senior international debut in 1996, playing both games for England in their European Championship victory. He later changed his international allegiance to Ireland, who he represented at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. He also made one appearance for Lancashire in 2003, but suffered a serious knee injury while playing for the team, which ultimately ended his playing career.
In 2006, Prescott was diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer and was given months to live. He set up the Steve Prescott Foundation in 2007, and went on to organise a series of money-raising initiatives. He raised almost half a million pounds for charity through the foundation, and was awarded an MBE in 2009 for his efforts. After a long battle with the disease, he died in 2013, aged 39.
In October 2013 a small group of people started a campaign to get the highest honor in English Rugby League the Man of Steel Award to be renamed after Steve. On 5th of March 2014 the RFL announced that the Man of Steel award will be renamed after Steve and is now known as the Steve Prescott Man of Steel Award

==Club career==

Although he was initially deemed too small to make the grade by Saints, Prescott secured his future at the club with some impressive performances for the reserve team. He made his debut for the first team in September 1993 against Leigh, and scored his first try later that year against Hull.[tpl]cite web|title=Steve Prescott|url=http://www.saints.org.uk/home/player.php?num=16189|publisher=Saints Heritage Society|accessdate=4 January 2014|first=Dave|last= Dooley|first2=Alex |last2=Service[/tpl] He made 15 appearances and kicked 29 goals during his debut season, playing as a winger, or deputising for Dave Lyon at fullback.[tpl]cite web|last=Hadfield|first=Dave|title=Rugby League: Hughes has early look at Wigan|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-hughes-has-early-look-at-wigan-1469382.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=24 December 1993[/tpl]

He also played for Saints at fullback in the 1996 Challenge Cup Final, scoring two tries in the first seventeen minutes and helping his team to a 40–32 victory against Bradford Bulls. The following season, he was part of the team that won the 1997 Challenge Cup, once again defeating Bradford Bulls in the final. In November 1997, after failing to agree a new contract with Saints, he was signed by newly promoted Hull Sharks, along with Alan Hunte and Simon Booth, for a combined transfer fee of £350,000.

In April 1998, he scored two tries against Sheffield Eagles in his first Super League game for the club, and became the club's regular goal kicker later that year. In the 1999 season, Prescott missed two months of the season through injury due to a dislocated elbow. With Hull struggling near the bottom of the table, and the club being unable to afford his wages, Prescott confirmed he was likely to leave when his contract expired in the winter.[tpl]cite web|last=Hadfield|first=Dave|title=Prescott on salvage mission|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-prescott-on-salvage-mission-1118641.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 February 2014|date=12 September 1999[/tpl] Hull won their final game for the season against Sheffield, with Prescott kicking six goals, and finished in 13th place – one position above bottom club Huddersfield Giants due to a superior goal difference.

==Representative career==

Prescott made his representative debut in November 1994, playing at fullback for Great Britain's under-21 side against Australia, who were touring Great Britain and France.

===Steve Prescott Foundation===

In August 2007, Prescott set up the Steve Prescott Foundation, which aimed to raise funds for two organisations: Christie Hospital, a leading cancer treatment centre in Europe, and Try Assist, the Rugby Football League's benevolent fund. In order to raise funds, Prescott went to organise a number of charity boxing tournaments and rugby league games, with a number of Prescott's former team-mates taking part. He also took part in a series of challenges, including running in the London Marathon and cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats while completing the National Three Peaks Challenge en route.
He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to rugby league and charity.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=59282 |date=31 December 2009 |startpage=21 |supp=yes [/tpl]
