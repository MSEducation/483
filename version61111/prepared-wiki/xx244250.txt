The album features a range of instruments in addition to the traditional hard rock sound - including didgeridoo, djembe, piano, synthesizers, choirs and programming.

==History==

Like A Storm first began touring the US in 2009, when they were invited to join Creed on their nationwide "Full Circle" Reunion tour. The "Full Circle" tour took Like A Storm all over the country, playing arenas and amphitheaters in a wide range of American cities. Overwhelming fan response to the band's live show saw their first album, The End of the Beginning, enter Billboard's New Artist Charts at No. 61 from tour sales alone. The End of the Beginning continues to be available through iTunes. 
The band continued extensive American touring into 2010, in support of their first single "Chemical Infatuation" - sharing stages with artists such as Shinedown, Skillet, Puddle of Mudd and Drowning Pool, as well as playing major festivals including Rock On The Range. "Chemical Infatuation" reached No. 43 in the U.S Active Rock Top 100.
2011 saw Like A Storm complete two tours of the US with Alter Bridge. In between tours, the band entered the studio to record "Like A Storm Unplugged", an unplugged album featuring acoustic and piano driven interpretations of some of their most popular songs. Like A Storm Unplugged, produced and mixed by the Brooks brothers, showcases the Brooks brothers playing a wider range of instruments - including didgeridoo, piano, church organ and djembe. In the words of singer/guitarist Matt Brooks, We all grew up playing any instrument we could get our hands on, and it's awesome to be able to explore these different ideas within the music of Like A Storm. We see it more as re-building the soundscape with different instruments and textures than stripping the songs down. 
Also in 2011, Like A Storm played main stage slots at 3 summer festivals - Boonstock in Gibbons, Alberta, Canada; "Pain in the Grass" for KISW Seattle; and the PDX "RockFest" in Portland. In December 2011, the band was voted Tunelab's "Most Fan Friendly Band." [tpl]cite web|title=Most Fan Friendly Band|url=http://tunelab.com|accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] The Brooks brothers responded by thanking their fans on social networking sites. In January 2012, Like a Storm returned to their native New Zealand for a month long holiday, and recorded the band's first unplugged DVD "Southern Skies" which was released 22 February 2012. In the movie Chris, Kent, and Matt take viewers to some landmark places and tell of stories growing up in Auckland before playing acoustic versions of fan favorites while at those sites. Southern Skies also gives you a sneak peek at two new songs off of the upcoming album as well as Matt's humorous home video documenting the little time they spent in Australia. While in their hometown, Matt and Kent went on to do an interview with New Zealand's largest rock radio station. At the time singer/guitarist/didgeridoo player Chris was ill and could not attend. A filmed version of the interview can also be found on the "Southern Skies" DVD.[tpl]cite web|title=Southern Skies Unplugged in New Zealand|url=http://likeastorm.com|accessdate=23 February 2012[/tpl]

Shortly after their acoustic tour, Like a Storm confirmed that drummer Thomas, would no longer be playing in the band.

==Bio==

Like A Storm began in 2005 when brothers Chris, Kent and Matt Brooks first played together in their native New Zealand. They decided to move to North America to pursue a career in music. According to lead singer Chris, New Zealand is such an amazing place to grow up, so beautiful and isolated. But the first time we jammed together, we had this amazing chemistry, and we knew we had to take our sound to North America. We left our family and friends and set up in Canada. There are so many different experiences from that time, and the songs on the record are about them.http://www.myspace.com/likeastorm The band settled in Vancouver and quickly attracted attention. After their first show, Kai Marcus from Methods of Mayhem and Econoline Crush befriended them and introduced them to producer Mike Plotnikoff. In 2006, Like A Storm began working on the record, and officially began recording with Plotnikoff and producer/composer Igor Khoroshev in 2007 in Los Angeles, California. After sixteen months of writing and recording, The End of the Beginning was complete.
