An evaluation function, also known as a heuristic evaluation function or static evaluation function, is a function used by game-playing programs to estimate the value or goodness of a position in the minimax and related algorithms. The evaluation function is typically designed to prioritize speed over accuracy; the function looks only at the current position and does not explore possible moves (therefore static).

==In chess==

One popular strategy for constructing evaluation functions is as a weighted sum of various factors that are thought to influence the value of a position. For instance, an evaluation function for chess might take the form 
Such as
in which: 

==In Go==

Evaluation functions in Go take into account both territory controlled, influence of stones, number of prisoners and life and death of groups on the board.
