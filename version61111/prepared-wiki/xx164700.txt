V Aquilae (V Aql) is a carbon star in the constellation Aquila. This is a type of star with a spectrum that is dominated by strong absorption lines of the molecules C2 and CN. The enhanced levels of carbon in the atmosphere may have been contributed by recently nucleosynthesized material that has been dredged up to the surface. This is a variable star of type SRb.
