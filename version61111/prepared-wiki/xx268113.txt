==MeltDose速 Technology Platform==

MeltDose速 works by incorporating a drug substance with low water solubility into a "meltable" vehicle.Van Arnum P. Formulation Development Forum: Controlled Agglomeration for Poorly Soluble Drugs.  Pharmaceutical Technology 35(7). It is then sprayed on an inert particulate carrier using fluid bed equipment.
The melt is solidified when deposed on a particle carrier, and thus captures the active drug in a solid dispersion either as a solid solution or in a nano-crystalline state. The particle size is then increased by controlling and optimizing the product temperature and feed rate of the melt.
The granulate can be directly compressed into tablets without additional processing steps besides blending with a lubricant. In addition, the technology allows for customization of the release profile.
Once in tablet form, the dissolution profile and the particle size of drugs manufactured using MeltDose速 technology remain stable allowing for a long shelf-life.
