==Former title==

Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica was a Chinese-language journal entitled  "Shengwu Huaxue Yu Shengwu Wuli Xuebao" (see box below), which began publishing sometime in 1958 or 1959, or August 1961, until December 2003 (depending on the source). Tables of contents were in English. Summaries (abstracts) were in English and Russian, and text of articles in Chinese.  Later issues were promulgated in the  Chinese and English languages. The translated title was "Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics".
The frequency was quarterly from 1959 to 1963, bimonthly from 1964 to 2002, and finally, monthly by 2003. Publication was suspended from 1966 to 1975. It was indexed in Chemical Abstracts Service. It may have published 35 volumes in total, over the years. In 2004 the journal switched to a full English-language journal under its current title.[ref]
