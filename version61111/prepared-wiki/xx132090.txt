Lafayette Towers Apartments West (1321 Orleans Street, Detroit, Michigan) is one of two identical apartment buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe.
The apartment is in the Lafayette Park development, near downtown. Lafayette Towers Apartments were built in 1963 and stand at 22 stories in height. They were built in the international style of architecture, much like the Lafayette Pavilion Apartments, and the other buildings in the development. The main materials are aluminium and glass. 
Along with the other neighboring Mies van der Rohe-designed buildings, these buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
These are two of four towers in the Lafayette Park development. The other two are the Windsor Tower, and the Lafayette Pavilion Apartments.
