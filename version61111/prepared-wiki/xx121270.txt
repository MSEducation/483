CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Apulia

Sannicandro di Bari is a town and comune in the province of Bari, Puglia, Italy.

==Castle==

The main attraction of Sannicandro is the Hohenstaufen-Norman castle, located in the centre of the city. It is composed of two structures one within the other: the first one was built by the Byzantines in 916, with a line of walls in stone with six quadrangular towers. After the Norman conquest of Bari in 1071, the castle was restored; the structure was then turned into a palace in the reign of emperor Frederick II.
