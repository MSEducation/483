CATEGORIES: Bitterns, Ardeidae

Bitterns are a classification of birds in the heron family, Ardeidae, a family of wading birds. Species named bitterns tend to be the shorter-necked, often more secretive members of this family.  They were called hæferblæte in Old English; the word "bittern" came to English from Old French butor, itself from Gallo-Roman butitaurus, a portmanteau of Latin būtiō and taurus.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | editor = Joseph P.
