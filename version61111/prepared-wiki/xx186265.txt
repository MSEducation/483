As a spokesperson and public speaker, Love has been invited to speak at a variety of venues. In March 2013 she spoke to groups of undergrad as well as graduate students in the East Carolina University Department of Sociology. Love lectured about the relevancy of alternative relationships and her position that in many cases, traditional marriage simply does not work. This was Love's third time speaking at the University. Professor of Sociology Dr. David Knox was quoted as saying about Love, "Brandi is an outstanding speaker, organized and engaging. She has spoken for two years to my human sexuality class on swinging/adult lifestyles and holds the room spellbound."[tpl]cite web|last=Staff|title=Brandi Love to Speak at East Carolina University|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Brandi-Love-to-Speak-at-East-Carolina-University-509466.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]
In 2006 in her appearance on The Tyra Banks Show, Love was invited with her husband along with Hugh Hefner (and his three, at the time, girlfriends) to debate the subject of open marriages in a segment titled "Is Monogamy Natural?" The segment also paired them with a monogamous couple. Love and her husband had been in a twelve year open marriage at the time of the show's taping.[tpl]cite web|last=Staff|title=Brandi Love, Hefner Debate Monogamy on "Tyra Banks Show"|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Brandi-Love-Hefner-Debate-Monogamy-on-Tyra-Banks-Show-44554.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]
