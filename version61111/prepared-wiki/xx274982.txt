[tpl]third-party|date=March 2012[/tpl]SeaTwirl is a vertical floating wind turbine that was tested off the west coast of Sweden in 2011. It is also the name of the company that produces the turbine.

==Design==

SeaTwirl has a vertical axis, with blades above water and the generator below. It is one of several designs that can float and therefore be positioned far offshore and take advantage of the stronger winds there.Sarah Laskow, "Hope Floats for a New Generation of Deep-Water Wind Farms", Good Environment, 13 September 2011, retrieved 27 September 2011. The SeaTwirl design uses the seawater itself as a roller bearing and stores energy in a water-filled torus. The company intends to use the design to enable the use of cheaper and heavier materials to lower the cost below conventional turbines, and generate energy even when the wind is not blowing.SeaTwirl, Startups, CleanIndex, retrieved 26 September 2011.Startups och expansionsbolag inom STING-sfären, STING (Stockholm Innovation & Growth AB), 2010, retrieved 27 September 2011 [tpl]sv icon[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
If the design is scaled to 430 m long, the company claims that it could provide 4.5 MW of electricity and store 25 MWh of energy.
