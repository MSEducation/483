===Corruption===

In 2009, ambassador Richard E. Hoagland quoted people sceptical about an anti-corruption campaign in Kazakhstan. He referred to a political analyst who "sees the recent convictions more as a sign of intra-elite warfare than evidence of a concerted anti-corruption effort" and a "civil society activist" who "describes the discredited officials as 'the weak links in the chain' and believes that the 'real sharks' are continuing to operate with impunity."[tpl]cite document| last =Hoagland| first =Richard| authorlink =Richard E. Hoagland| title =Government's anti-corruption campaign — sweeping effort or selective targeting? | work =| publisher =WikiLeaks| date =22 April 2009| url =http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/04/09ASTANA677.html [tpl]cablegate|09ASTANA677[/tpl] | accessdate =1 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vOo8HEny |archivedate=31 December 2010  [/tpl] Hoagland commented, "Corruption is endemic among Kazakhstani officialdom, as it is across the CIS. Blessed with strong tax revenues, government salaries are high in Kazakhstan compared to its neighbors -- for example, Prime Minister Masimov's salary is over $50,000 a year -- but most senior officials live lifestyles that require much higher incomes. In many instances, they receive profits from businesses registered in the names of their spouses or other relatives. In other cases, they're stealing directly from the public trough. The officials taken down by the anti-corruption campaign are thus just a tiny fraction of those with dirt on their hands."

==Koreas==

===Korean reunification===

North Korea was behaving like a "spoiled child", according to Chinese officials, who were prepared to accept Korean reunification under South Korean leadership.
