Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru (Bengalūru, [tpl]IPA-kn|ˈbeŋɡəɭuːɾu||Bengaluru-Kannada-Pronunciation.ogg[/tpl]), is the capital city of the Indian state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration. Bangalore is known as the "Silicon Valley of India" because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.[tpl]cite news|url =http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/06/tech/bangalore-india-internet-access|title =How the 'Silicon Valley of India' is bridging the digital divide |last =Canton|first =Naomi|publisher =CNN |accessdate =6 December 2012|date=6 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/business/worldbusiness/20bangalore.html|title =Is the Next Silicon Valley Taking Root in Bangalore? |last =RAI|first =SARITHA|work =New York Times|accessdate =20 March 2006|date=20 March 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20201666|title =Can the 'American Dream' be reversed in India? |last =Vaidyanathan|first =Rajini |publisher =BBC World News |accessdate =5 November 2012 |date=5 November 2012[/tpl] Located at a height of over [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m|1[/tpl] above sea level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year.[tpl]cite book| last1 = Swaminathan | first1 = Jayashankar M. | title = Indian Economic Superpower: Fiction Or Future? | volume = Volume 2 of World Scientific series on 21st century business, ISSN 1793-5660 | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2009 | isbn = 9789812814661 |page=20[/tpl] The city is amongst the top ten preferred entrepreneurial locations in the world.[tpl]cite news|title=Bangalore among the top 10 preferred entrepreneurial locations|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/emerging-businesses/regional-hubs/south/bangalore-among-the-top-10-preferred-entrepreneurial-locations/articleshow/12630240.cms|work=The Economic Times|date=12 April 2012[/tpl]
A succession of South Indian dynasties, the Western Gangas, the Cholas, and the Hoysalas ruled the present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā — a feudatory ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire — established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore. Following transitory occupation by the Marāthās and Mughals, the city remained under the Mysore Kingdom. It later passed into the hands of Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, and was captured by the British after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore, and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The exiting Kannada name Bengalūru was declared as official name of the city in 2006.
Bangalore is home to many well-recognised educational and research institutions in India, such as Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Management (Bangalore) (IIMB), Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). Numerous public sector heavy industries, technology companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defence organisations, such as Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Infosys, and Wipro are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the second-fastest growing major metropolis in India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/06sld2.htm|work=Rediff News|date=6 February 2008|title=India's 10 fastest growing cities|accessdate=7 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090324171237/http://us.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/06sld2.htm| archivedate= 24 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The city also houses the Kannada film industry.

==Etymology==

The name "Bangalore" represents an anglicised version of the Kannada language name, "Bengaḷūru" ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು [tpl]IPA-kn|ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru||Bengaluru-Kannada-Pronunciation.ogg[/tpl]. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription on a "vīra gallu" ([tpl]lang|kn|ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು[/tpl]) (literally, "hero stone", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in Begur, "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 CE. It states that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru", the "City of Guards" in Halegannada (Old Kannada).[tpl]cite news|first=K|last= Chandramouli |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072500270200.htm |title=The city of boiled beans|newspaper=The Hindu |date= 25 July 2002|accessdate=10 June 2012|location=Chennai, India[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/20/stories/2004082016400300.htm|title=Inscription reveals Bangalore is over 1,000 years old|newspaper= The Hindu|date= 20 August 2004|accessdate=10 June 2012|location=Chennai, India[/tpl]
An apocryphal, though popular, anecdote recounts that the 12th century Hoysala king Veera Ballala II, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru".[tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/Oct302006/index20581420061029.asp|title=Many miles to go from Bangalore to Bengalūru |author=Vijesh Kamath|work=Deccan Herald |date=30 October 2006|accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl] Suryanath Kamath has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name, being derived from benga, the Kannada term for Pterocarpus marsupium (also known as the Indian Kino Tree), a species of dry and moist deciduous trees, that grew abundantly in the region.

==History==

===Early and medieval history===

A recent discovery of Stone Age artifacts during the 2001 census of India at Jalahalli, Sidhapura and Jadigenahalli, all of which are located on Bangalore's outskirts today, suggest probable human settlement around 4,000 BCE.[tpl]cite news | title = Bangalore dates from 4,000 BC | date = 11 October 2001 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-10-11/bangalore/27237242_1_bangalore-mysore-municipal-bodies | work = The Times of India | accessdate = 7 September 2013[/tpl] Around 1,000 BCE (Iron Age), burial grounds were established at Koramangala and Chikkajala on the outskirts of Bangalore. Coins of the Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius found at Yeswanthpur and HAL indicate that Bangalore was involved in trans-oceanic trade with ancient civilisations in 27 BCE.[tpl]cite news | first = T.S. | last = Ranganna | title = Bangalore had human habitation in 4000 B.C. | date = 27 October 2001 | url = http://hindu.com/2001/10/27/stories/0427402p.htm | work = The Hindu | accessdate = 7 September 2013[/tpl]
The region of modern day Bangalore was part of several successive South Indian kingdoms. Between the fourth and the tenth centuries, the Bangalore region was ruled by the Western Ganga Dynasty of Karnataka, the first dynasty to set up effective control over the region.[tpl]harvnb|Srinivas|2004|p=69|Ref=Sri2004[/tpl] According to Edgar Thurston [tpl]cite book|author=Edgar Thurston and K. Rangachari|title=Castes and Tribes of Southern India|year=1909|publisher=Government Press, Madras[/tpl] there were twenty eight kings who ruled Gangavadi from the start of the Christian era till its conquest by the Cholas. These kings belonged to two distinct dynasties: the earlier line of the Solar race which had a succession of seven kings of the Ratti or Reddi tribe, and the later line of the Ganga race. The Western Gangas ruled the region initially as a sovereign power (350 – 550), and later as feudatories of the Chalukyas of Badami, followed by the Rashtrakutas till the tenth century.[tpl]harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=6|Ref=Aditi2008[/tpl] The Begur Nageshwara Temple was commissioned around 860, during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I and extended by his successor Nitimarga II.[tpl]harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=7|Ref=Aditi2008[/tpl]Sarma (1992), p. 78 Around 1004, during the reign of Rajendra Chola I, the Cholas defeated the Western Gangas, and captured Bangalore. During this period, the Bangalore region witnessed the migration of many groups - warriors, administrators, traders, artisans, pastorals, cultivators, and religious personnel from Tamil Nadu and other Kannada speaking regions. The Chokkanathaswamy temple at Domlur, the Aigandapura complex near Hesaraghatta, Mukthi Natheshwara Temple at Binnamangala, Choleshwara Temple at Begur, Someshwara Temple at Madiwala, date from the Chola era.
In 1117, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas in the Battle of Talakad in south Karnataka, and extended its rule over the region. Vishnuvardhana expelled the Cholas from all parts of Mysore state.http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/ By the end of the 13th century, Bangalore became a source of contention between two warring cousins, the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III of Halebidu and Ramanatha, who administered from the Hoysala held territory in Tamil Nadu. Veera Ballala III had appointed a civic head at Hudi (now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits), thus promoting the village to the status of a town. After Veera Ballala III's death in 1343, the next empire to rule the region was the Vijayanagara Empire, which itself saw the rise of four dynasties, the Sangamas (1336 – 1485), the Saluvas (1485 – 1491), the Tuluvas (1491 – 1565), and the Aravidu (1565 – 1646).[tpl]harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=8|Ref=Aditi2008[/tpl] During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, Achyuta Deva Raya of the Tuluva Dynasty raised the Shivasamudra Dam across the Arkavati river at Hesaraghatta, whose reservoir is the present city's supply of regular piped water.[tpl]harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=9|Ref=Aditi2008[/tpl]

===Foundation and early modern history===

Modern Bangalore had its beginning in 1537 by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempé Gowda I, who aligned with the Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja who he defeated and expelled to Kanchi, and who built a mud-brick fort for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules placed by Achuta Deva Raya who feared the potential power of KempeGowda and did not allow for a formidalbe stone fort.  Kempé Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/05/21205005/Bangalore-Bhath--First-city-e.html|title=Bangalore bhath: first city edifices|last1=Misra|first1=Hemant|last2= Jayaraman|first2=Pavitra|newspaper=Mint|date=22 May 2010|accessdate=11 June 2012[/tpl] Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions—each called a "pete" ([tpl]IPA-kn|peːteː[/tpl]). The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempé Gowda I's successor, Kempé Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").[tpl]Cite thesis |chapter= 5: Bangalore: mud fort to sprawling metropolis|title= Bangalore—future trends in public open space usage.

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 in the Battle of Talikota, Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. Kempé Gowda declared independence, then in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command Shāhji Bhōnslé defeated Kempé Gowda III, and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a jagir (feudal estate). In 1687, the Mughal general Kasim Khan, under orders from Aurangzeb, defeated Ekoji I, son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/02/22/stories/2005022201010300.htm|title=The bean city|newspaper=The Hindu |first=S|last= Srinivas|accessdate=2 July 2007|date=22 February 2005|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali, Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hyder Ali is credited with building the Delhi and Mysore gates at the northern and southern ends of the city in 1760.[tpl]harvnb|Pinto|Srivastava|2008|p=6|Ref=TalkoftheTown[/tpl] The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son Tipu Sultan. Hyder and Tipu contributed towards the beautification of the city by building Lal Bagh Botanical Gardens in 1760. Under them, Bangalore developed into a commercial and military centre of strategic importance.
Bangalore fort was captured by the British armies under Lord Cornwallis on 21 March 1791 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War and formed a centre for British resistance against Tipu Sultan.[tpl]cite book |title=The military engineer in India, vol I |last=Sandes |first=Lt Col E.W.C. |year=1933 |publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham |isbn=978-1-84734-071-9|pages=163–165 [/tpl] Following Tipu's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), the British returned administrative control of the Bangalore "pētē" to the Maharaja of Mysore and was incorporated into the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. The old city ("pētē") developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore. The Residency of Mysore State was first established in Mysore City in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in 1804. It was abolished in 1843 only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and to be closed down permanently in 1947, with Indian independence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rajbhavan.kar.nic.in/history/fromresi-rajbhavan.htm|title=Raj Bhavan, Karnataka|work=The Homepage of Raj Bhavan, Government of Karnataka|accessdate=24 August 2012[/tpl] The British found Bangalore to be a pleasant and appropriate place to station their garrison and therefore moved their cantonment to Bangalore from Seringapatam in 1809 near Halsur, about four miles north-east of the City. A town grew up around the cantonment, by absorbing several villages in the area. The new centre had its own municipal and administrative apparatus, though technically it was a British enclave within the territory of the Wodeyar Kings of the Princely State of Mysore.[tpl]harvnb|Srinivas|2004|p=3|Ref=Sri2004[/tpl] Two important developments which contributed to the rapid growth of the city, include the introduction of telegraph connections to all major Indian cities in 1853, and a rail connection to Madras in 1864.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Ghosh | first1 = Jyotirmoy | title = Entrepreneurship in tourism and allied activities: a study of Bangalore city in the post liberalization period | publisher = Pondicherry University | year = 2012 | pages = 86 |url = http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/5261/9/09_chapter%203.pdf[/tpl]

===Later modern and contemporary history===

In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a twin city, with the "pētē", whose residents were predominantly Kannadigas, and the "cantonment" created by the British, whose residents were predominantly Tamils.[tpl]Cite thesis |chapter= 8: Public domain—contested spaces and lack of imageability|title= Bangalore—future trends in public open space usage.

While it remained in the princely territory of Mysore, Cantonment had a large military presence and a cosmopolitan civilian population that came from outside the princely state of Mysore, including Britons, Anglo-Indians, and migrant Tamil labourers and contractors. City, on the other hand, had a largely Kannada-speaking population.[tpl]cite news | title = Cantonment and City | date = 9 August 2013 | publisher = The Hindu | url = http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/art/the-other-bangalore/article4944711.ece | work = Frontline | accessdate = 1 October 2013[/tpl]
Bangalore was hit by a plague epidemic in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help coordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better coordination. Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General of British India.[tpl]cite news | title = 1898 plague revisited | date = 17 November 2012 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-17/bangalore/35171344_1_bangalore-vivek-first-health-officer | work = The Times of India | accessdate = 8 September 2013[/tpl] New extensions in Malleswaram and Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of the pētē.[tpl]cite web | first = Maya | last = Jaypal | title = Malleswaram, Basavanagudi, the new extensions | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/237394/malleswaram-basavanagudi-extensions.html | work = Deccan Herald | accessdate = 8 September 2013[/tpl] In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in Bangalore.[tpl]harvnb|Karnataka State Gazetteer: Bangalore District|p=91|Ref=kar[/tpl] In 1906, Bangalore became one of the first cities in India to have electricity from hydro power, powered by the hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra.[tpl]cite web| last=Srinivasaraju|first=Sugata|title=ElectriCity|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?230851|accessdate=15 November 2011|work=Outlook India|date=10 April 2006[/tpl] The Indian Institute of Science was established in 1909, which subsequently played a major role in developing the city as a science research hub.

Bangalore's reputation as the "Garden City of India" began in 1927 with the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the rule of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.

Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 and 1934 and addressed public meetings here. In 1926, the labour unrest in Binny Mills due to demand by textile workers for payment of bonus resulted in lathi charging and police firing, resulting in the death of four workers, and several injuries.[tpl]harvnb|Nair|2005|p=70|Ref=nair[/tpl] In July 1928, there were notable communal disturbances in Bangalore, when a Ganesh idol was removed from a school compound in the Sultanpet area of Bangalore.[tpl]cite book|title=Dimensions of Socio-Political Change in Mysore, 1918-40|first=Chandrasekhar|last=S.|publisher=APH Publishing|year=1985|isbn=9780836414714|page=135[/tpl] In 1940, the first flight between Bangalore and Bombay took off, which placed the city on India's urban map.[tpl]harvnb|Pinto|Srivastava|2008|p=10|Ref=TalkoftheTown[/tpl]

The Government of Karnataka later constituted the Bangalore Development Authority in 1976 to co-ordinate the activities of these two bodies.[tpl]harvnb|Srinivas|2004|p=4|Ref=Sri2004[/tpl] Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the rest of the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced rapid growth in the decades 1941–51 and 1971–81, which saw the arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. By 1961, Bangalore had become the sixth largest city in India, with a population of 1,207,000. In the decades that followed, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the establishment of private companies such as MICO (Motor Industries Company), which set up its manufacturing plant in the city.
By the 1980s, it was clear that urbanization had spilled over the current boundaries, and in 1986, the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority, was established to co-ordinate the development of the entire region as a single unit.

In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river Kaveri provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta
reservoirs of the Arkavathi river.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bwssb.org/help_faq.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060206121846/http://bwssb.org/help_faq.html|archivedate=6 February 2006|title=Help/FAQ|publisher=Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board |accessdate=2 July 2007[/tpl] Bangalore receives 800 million litres (211 million US gallons) of water a day, more than any other Indian city.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/NM2/Thirsty-Bangalore-invokes-god/Article1-6117.aspx|title=Thirsty Bangalore invokes god|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=9 June 2003|accessdate=11 June 2012[/tpl]
However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during summer- more so in the years of low rainfall.

Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils.
Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large deciduous canopy and minority coconut trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jan/30inter.htm|title=The Rediff interview.

Bangalore's rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature of growth in the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/water/paper/urbanfloods_bangalore/profile.htm | title = Urban Floods: Case Study of Bangalore | accessdate = 14 September 2013 | last = Ramachandra | first = T.
