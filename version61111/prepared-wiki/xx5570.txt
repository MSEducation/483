In statistics, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S test) is a nonparametric test for the equality of continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions that can be used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K–S test), or to compare two samples (two-sample K–S test). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic quantifies a distance between the empirical distribution function of the sample and the cumulative distribution function of the reference distribution, or between the empirical distribution functions of two samples. The null distribution of this statistic is calculated under the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same distribution (in the two-sample case) or that the sample is drawn from the reference distribution (in the one-sample case). In each case, the distributions considered under the null hypothesis are continuous distributions but are otherwise unrestricted.
The two-sample K–S test is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing two samples, as it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples.
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test can be modified to serve as a goodness of fit test. In the special case of testing for normality of the distribution, samples are standardized and compared with a standard normal distribution. This is equivalent to setting the mean and variance of the reference distribution equal to the sample estimates, and it is known that using these to define the specific reference distribution changes the null distribution of the test statistic: see below. Various studies have found that, even in this corrected form, the test is less powerful for testing normality than the Shapiro–Wilk test or Anderson–Darling test.[ref]
</ref> However, other tests have their own disadvantages. For instance the Shapiro-Wilk test is known not to work well with many ties (many identical values).

==Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic==

The empirical distribution function Fn for n iid observations Xi is defined as
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic for a given cumulative distribution function F(x) is
In practice, the statistic requires a relatively large number of data points[tpl]Quantify|date=April 2014[/tpl] to properly reject the null hypothesis.

==Kolmogorov distribution==

The Kolmogorov distribution is the distribution of the random variable
where B(t) is the Brownian bridge. The cumulative distribution function of K is given by[tpl]Cite journal |author=Marsaglia G, Tsang WW, Wang J |year=2003 |title=Evaluating Kolmogorov’s Distribution |journal=Journal of Statistical Software |volume=8 |issue=18 |pages=1–4 |url=http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i18/paper[/tpl]
Both the form of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis were published by Andrey Kolmogorov,[tpl]Cite journal |author=Kolmogorov A |year=1933 |title=Sulla determinazione empirica di una legge di distribuzione |journal=G. Ist. Ital. Attuari |volume=4 |pages=83–91[/tpl] while a table of the distribution was published by Nikolai Vasilyevich Smirnov.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Smirnov N |year=1948 |title=Table for estimating the goodness of fit of empirical distributions |journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics |volume=19 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177730256[/tpl] Recurrence relations for the distribution of the test statistic in finite samples are available.
Under null hypothesis that the sample comes from the hypothesized distribution F(x),
in distribution, where B(t) is the Brownian bridge.
where Kα is found from
The asymptotic power of this test is 1.

===Test with estimated parameters===

If either the form or the parameters of F(x) are determined from the data Xi the critical values determined in this way are invalid. In such cases, Monte Carlo or other methods may be required, but tables have been prepared for some cases. Details for the required modifications to the test statistic and for the critical values for  the normal distribution and the exponential distribution have been published, and later publications also include the Gumbel distribution.[tpl]cite book |title= Empirical Processes with Applications to Statistics |authors= Galen R. Shorack and Jon A. Wellner |year= 1986 |ISBN= 047186725X |publisher= Wiley |page= 239[/tpl] The Lilliefors test represents a special case of this for the normal distribution.
The logarithm transformation may help to overcome cases were the Kolmogorov test data does not seem to fit the assumption that it came from the normal distribution.

==Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test==

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test may also be used to test whether two underlying one-dimensional probability distributions differ. In this case, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic is
Note that the two-sample test checks whether the two data samples come from the same distribution.  This does not specify what that common
distribution is (e.g. normal or not normal). Again, tables of critical values have been published.

==Setting confidence limits for the shape of a distribution function==

While the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is usually used to test whether a given F(x) is the underlying probability distribution of Fn(x), the procedure may be inverted to give confidence limits on F(x) itself. If one chooses a critical value of the test statistic Dα such that P(Dn > Dα) = α, then a band of width ±Dα around Fn(x) will entirely contain F(x) with probability 1 − α.

==The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic in more than one dimension==

A distribution free multivariate Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test has been proposed by Justel, Peña and Zamar (1997).[tpl]cite journal |last=Justel |first=A. |last2=Peña |first2=D. |last3=Zamar |first3=R. |year=1997 |title=A multivariate Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of goodness of fit |journal=Statistics & Probability Letters |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=251–259 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7152(97)00020-5 [/tpl]  The test uses a statistic which is built using Rosenblatt's transformation and an algorithm is developed to compute it in the bivariate case.  An approximate test, that can be easily computed in any dimension, is also presented.
One approach to generalizing the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic to higher dimensions which meets the above concern is to compare the cdfs of the two samples with all possible orderings, and take the largest of the set of resulting K-S statistics.  In d dimensions, there are 2d−1 such orderings.  One such variation is due to Peacock[tpl]cite journal  |author = Peacock J.A. |title = Two-dimensional goodness-of-fit testing in astronomy |journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume = 202 |pages = 615–627  |year = 1983 |bibcode = 1983MNRAS.202..615P [/tpl] and another to Fasano and Franceschini[tpl]cite journal |authors= Fasano, G., Franceschini, A. |year=1987 |title= A multidimensional version of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test |journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |issn=0035-8711 |volume= 225 |pages= 155–170 |bibcode=1987MNRAS.225..155F [/tpl] (see Lopes et al. for a comparison and computational details).[tpl]cite conference |authors= Lopes, R.H.C., Reid, I., Hobson, P.R. |year=2007 |title= The two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test |conference= XI International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research |date= April 23–27, 2007 |location= Amsterdam, the Netherlands |url= http://dspace.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/1166/1/acat2007.pdf [/tpl] Critical values for the test statistic can be obtained by simulations, but depend on the dependence structure in the joint distribution.
