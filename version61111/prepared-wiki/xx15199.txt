All the alkaline earth metals have two electrons in their valence shell, so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron shell is to lose two electrons to form doubly charged positive ions.

====Compounds and reactions====

The alkaline earth metals all react with the halogens to form ionic halides, such as calcium chloride ([tpl]chem|Ca|Cl|2[/tpl]), as well as reacting with oxygen to form oxides such as strontium oxide ([tpl]chem|Sr|O[/tpl]). Calcium, strontium, and barium react with water to produce hydrogen gas and their respective hydroxides, and also undergo transmetalation reactions to exchange ligands.

===Physical and atomic===

The table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the alkaline earth metals.

====Nuclear stability====

All of the alkaline earth metals except magnesium and strontium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope: beryllium-7, beryllium-10, and calcium-41 are trace radioisotopes, calcium-48 and barium-130 have very long half-lives and, thus, occur naturally, and all isotopes of radium are radioactive. Calcium-48 is the lightest nuclide to undergo double beta decay.[tpl]cite journal |author=G. Audi, A. H. Wapstra, C. Thibault, J. Blachot and O. Bersillon |year=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf|journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=729 |issue= |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A[/tpl]
The natural radioisotope of calcium, calcium-48, makes up about 0.1874% of natural calcium,[tpl]cite web |url=http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/Ca_iso.htm |title=Isotopes of Calcium (Z=20) |author=Richard B. Firestone |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=12 June 2012[/tpl] and, thus, natural calcium is weakly radioactive. Barium-130 makes up approximately 0.1062% of natural barium, and, thus, barium is weakly radioactive, as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/Ba_iso.htm |title=Isotopes of Barium (Z=56) |author=Richard B. Firestone |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=12 June 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Etymology===

The alkaline earth metals are named after their oxides, the alkaline earths, whose old-fashioned names were beryllia, magnesia, lime, strontia, and baryta. These oxides are basic (alkaline) when combined with water. "Earth" is an old term applied by early chemists to nonmetallic substances that are insoluble in water and resistant to heating—properties shared by these oxides. The realization that these earths were not elements but compounds is attributed to the chemist Antoine Lavoisier. In his Traité Élémentaire de Chimie (Elements of Chemistry) of 1789 he called them salt-forming earth elements. Later, he suggested that the alkaline earths might be metal oxides, but admitted that this was mere conjecture. In 1808, acting on Lavoisier's idea, Humphry Davy became the first to obtain samples of the metals by electrolysis of their molten earths,[tpl]cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Robert E. Krebs| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| isbn = 0-313-33438-2| pages=65–81[/tpl] thus supporting Lavoisier's hypothesis and causing the group to be named the alkaline earth metals.

===Discovery===

The calcium compounds calcite and lime have been known and used since prehistoric times. The same is true for the beryllium compounds beryl and emerald.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535[/tpl] The other compounds of the alkaline earth metals were discovered starting in the early 15th century. The magnesium compound magnesium sulfate was first discovered in 1618 by a farmer at Epsom in England. Strontium carbonate was discovered in minerals in the Scottish village of Strontian in 1790. The last element is the least abundant: radioactive radium, which was extracted from uraninite in 1898.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed009p1046 | title = The discovery of the elements. X.

All elements except beryllium were isolated by electrolysis of molten compounds. Magnesium, calcium, and strontium were first produced by Humphry Davy in 1808, whereas beryllium was independently isolated by Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy in 1828 by reacting beryllium compounds with potassium. In 1910, radium was isolated as a pure metal by Curie and André-Louis Debierne also by electrolysis.

====Beryllium====

Beryl, a mineral that contains beryllium, has been known since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535[/tpl] Although it was originally thought that beryl was an aluminium silicate,[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=537[/tpl] beryl was later found to contain a then-unknown element when, in 1797, Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin dissolved aluminium hydroxide from beryl in an alkali.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Annales de Chimie|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA155|pages = 155–169| first = Louis-Nicolas|last = Vauquelin|title = De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre| year = 1798| issue = 26[/tpl] In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler[tpl]Cite journal|journal = Annalen der Physik|volume = 89|issue = 8|pages = 577–582|title = Ueber das Beryllium und Yttrium|first = Friedrich|last = Wöhler|authorlink = Friedrich Wöhler|doi = 10.1002/andp.18280890805|year = 1828|bibcode = 1828AnP....89..577W[/tpl] and Antoine Bussy[tpl]cite journal|journal = Journal de Chimie Medicale| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=pwUFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA456|pages=456–457| first = Antoine |last = Bussy| title = D'une travail qu'il a entrepris sur le glucinium| year = 1828| issue = 4[/tpl] independently isolated this new element, beryllium, by the same method, which involved a reaction of beryllium chloride with metallic potassium; this reaction was not able to produce large ingots of beryllium.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539[/tpl] It was not until 1898, when Paul Lebeau performed an electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride, that large pure samples of beryllium were produced.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539[/tpl]

====Magnesium====

Magnesium was first produced by Sir Humphry Davy in England in 1808 using electrolysis of a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide.[tpl]cite journal| last = Davy |first = H. | year= 1808 | title = Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–370|bibcode = 1808RSPT...98..333D | jstor=107302 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy’s first suggestion for a name was magnium, but the name magnesium is now used.

====Calcium====

Lime has been used as a material for building since 7000 to 14,000 BCE,[tpl]cite web |title = Commodity report:Lime |publisher = United States Geological Survey |first = M. Michael | last = Miller | url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lime/390498.pdf |accessdate= 2012-03-06[/tpl] and kilns used for lime have been dated to 2,500 BCE in Khafaja, Mesopotamia.[tpl]cite book | url =http://books.google.com/?id=ryap1yyEGAgC&pg=PA4 | page = 4 |title =Lime Kilns and Lime Burning | isbn =978-0-7478-0596-0 | author1 =Williams | first1 =Richard | year =2004[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books/about/Lime_and_limestone.html?id=vHQsGAKAdYoC| title = Lime and Limestone: Chemistry and Technology, Production and Uses | isbn = 978-3-527-61201-7 | author1 = Oates | first1 = J. A. H | date = 2008-07-01[/tpl] Calcium as a material has been known since at least the first century, as the ancient Romans were known to have used calcium oxide by preparing it from lime. Calcium sulfate has been known to be able to set broken bones since the tenth century. Calcium itself, however, was not isolated until 1808, when Humphry Davy, in England, used electrolysis on a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide,[tpl]cite journal | author = Davy H | year = 1808 | title = Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102#v=onepage&q&f=false |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 333–370|bibcode = 1808RSPT...98..333D | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1808.0023 [/tpl] after hearing that Jöns Jakob Berzelius had prepared a calcium amalgam from the electrolysis of lime in mercury.

====Strontium====

In 1790, physician Adair Crawford, who had been working with barium, realized that Strontian ores showed different properties than other supposed ores of barium.[tpl]cite journal |last=Crawford |first=Adair |year=1790 |title=On the medicinal properties of the muriated barytes |journal=Medical Communications |location=London |volume=2 |pages=301–359[/tpl] Therefore, he concluded that these ores contained new minerals, which were named strontites in 1793 by Thomas Charles Hope, a chemistry professor at the University of Glasgow,[tpl]cite journal |author=Murray, T.|year=1993| title= Elemementary Scots: The Discovery of Strontium |journal = Scottish Medical Journal| volume = 38 |pages = 188–189 |pmid=8146640 |issue=6[/tpl] who confirmed Crawford's discovery. Strontium was eventually isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy by electrolysis of a mixture of strontium chloride and mercuric oxide. The discovery was announced by Davy on 30 June 1808 at a lecture to the Royal Society.[tpl]cite book|last=Davy |first=Humphry |year=1808 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102#v=onepage&q&f=falseElectro-chemical |title=researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia |publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=98|pages=333–370[/tpl]

====Barium====

Barite, a mineral containing barium, was first recognized as containing a new element in 1774 by Carl Scheele, although he was able to isolate only barium oxide. Barium oxide was isolated again two years later by Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Later in the 18th century, William Withering noticed a heavy mineral in the Cumberland lead mines, which are now known to contain barium. Barium itself was finally isolated in 1808 when Sir Humphry Davy used electrolysis with molten salts, and Davy named the element barium, after baryta. Later, Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen isolated pure barium by electrolysis of a mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301|title = Masthead|year = 1855|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = fmi–fmi[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194|title =Notizen|year =1856|last1 =Wagner|first1 =Rud.|last2 =Neubauer|first2 =C.|last3 =Deville|first3 =H.

====Radium====

While studying uraninite, on 21 December 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered that, even after uranium had decayed, the material created was still radioactive. The material behaved somewhat similarly to barium compounds, although some properties, such as the color of the flame test and spectral lines, were much different. They announced the discovery of a new element on 26 December 1898 to the French Academy of Sciences.[tpl]cite journal |year=1898|title=Sur une nouvelle substance fortement radio-active, contenue dans la pechblende (On a new, strongly radioactive substance contained in pitchblende)|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume= 127|pages= 1215–1217|url=http://www.aip.org/history/curie/discover.htm |accessdate=2009-08-01 |author=Curie, Pierre; Curie, Marie and Bémont, Gustave [/tpl] Radium was named in 1899 from the word radius, meaning ray, as radium emitted power in the form of rays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=radium |title=radium |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl]
