==Overview==

There were seventeen housemates competing for the grand prize (making this the first season to have an odd number of original housemates), a decrease over the previous season. The season lasted 78 days, a decrease of one week over the previous season.

===The game===

Big Brother divided the housemates into five cliques of three: Sarados (the Fit), Belos (the Beautiful), Cabeças (the Nerds), Ligados (the Tunned) and Coloridos (the Colorful/Gays). 
The housemates play as individuals except when a housemate from a clique wins Head of Household, then all members of that clique are immune from eviction. This concept was first implemented on the eleventh season of Big Brother (U.S.)
Five past housemates returned to support one of the cliques in the House: Joseane Oliveira of Big Brother 3 supported the Belos, Marcelo Dourado of Big Brother 4 supported the Sarados, Rafael Valente of Big Brother 6 supported the Cabeças, Fani Pacheco of Big Brother 7 supported the Coloridos and Natalia Casassola of Big Brother 8 supported the Ligados. 
Fernanda won the first HoH competition for the "Belos" allowing Joseane to return to the House as a full housemate and the first Head of Household. Joseane also could choose one of the two male ex-housemates (either Dourado or Rafael) to enter as a full Housemate. She chose Dourado.

===Reunion show===

The reunion was hosted by Ana Maria Braga and aired on April 5, 2010 on the morning news and talk show "Mais Você". It was first reunion since Season 5 and all the former housemates attended. Actresses Deborah Secco and Betty Lago, singer Preta Gil, Season 7 winner Diego Gasques and Season 9 runner-up Priscila Pires were special guests.[tpl]cite web|url =http://televisao.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2010/03/31/ana-maria-braga-recebe-os-brothers.jhtm|title =Ana Maria Braga recebe os brothers|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100404080257/http://televisao.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2010/03/31/ana-maria-braga-recebe-os-brothers.jhtm| archivedate= 4 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Anamara===

A request for exemption was made on January 29, 2010 from housemate Anamara Barreira to the State Military Police [tpl]cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml|title =Procuradora entra com pedido de exoneração de Anamara da PM|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100202054821/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml| archivedate= 2 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] was accepted and the decision was published on February 23, 2010 in the Official Gazette of Bahia. 
Anamara should have returned from her vacation earlier this month. Without the exemption, she would be considered a deserter and could be imprisoned for up to two years. The application was lodged by the procurator of Anamara, Amanda Miller. According to Amanda, Anamara left an attorney before entering the house to the application for exemption from the corporation could be done. With the letter of resignation Anamara could not be considered a defector.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml|title =Anamara é exonerada da Polícia Militar|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100202054821/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml| archivedate= 2 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Dourado===

Dourado caused disagreements and controversies by displaying manjis in a tattoo on his left arm, which were taken to be swastikas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://babado.ig.com.br/bbb10/noticias/2010/01/18/bbb10+exibicao+de+simbolo+ligado+a+nazismo+irrita+comunidade+judaica+9355089.html|title=BBB10: Exibição de símbolo ligado a nazismo irrita comunidade judaica|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100330182109/http://babado.ig.com.br/bbb10/noticias/2010/01/18/bbb10+exibicao+de+simbolo+ligado+a+nazismo+irrita+comunidade+judaica+9355089.html| archivedate= 30 March 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He was also accused of homophobic behavior by some LGBT organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/tv/bbb10/noticias/0,,OI4312368-EI14549,00-ABGLT+comunica+Endemol+sobre+caso+de+homofobia+no+BBB.html|title=ABGLT comunica Endemol sobre caso de homofobia no "BBB 10|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-02[/tpl] Dourado's adviser, Aline Antonoff, issued a press release, in which she stated that the tattoo differs from the Nazi swastika, because it is reversed, and has no connection with it, since the symbol belongs to several cultures.

===Elenita===

After recording a post-elimination interview with Elenita for a spin-off show broadcast by cable channel Multishow, Season 7 winner and main host Diego Gasques criticized the former housemate on his Twitter account, commenting that the two had a fight and she was a disgusting and low level woman. Later, he deleted the post, but kept posting sarcastic comments about her.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u696068.shtml|title =Diego Alemão diz que Elenita é nojenta e de quinta categoria|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100223014658/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u696068.shtml| archivedate= 23 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
