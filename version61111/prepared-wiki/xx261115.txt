CATEGORIES: Chess variants

Chess Attack is a chess variant played on a rectangular board of six rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 6) and five columns (called files, denoted with letters a to e) of squares. It can be seen as a chess game exclusively devoted to endplay.

==Setup and rules==

Each player starts with one king, one queen, one rook, one bishop (of alternate colors), one knight and five pawns. Apart from the initial setup, the game follows all conventional chess rules.

==History and use==

The game was invented by the Norwegian game designer Werner Kling in 2008, both as a tool to introduce a simplified chess variant to younger players and for experienced players to hone endgame skills.
