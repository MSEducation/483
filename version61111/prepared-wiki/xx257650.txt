Kvenvær church ([tpl]lang-no|Kvenvær kirke[/tpl]) is a parish church in the municipality of Hitra in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The church is located in the village of Kvenvær on the northwestern coast of the island of Hitra.
The church was consecrated in 1909. The decision to build the church was done by royal decree on 14 March 1908 and the church was built on the Steine farm at Kvenvær village.  The new church replaced the old Kvenvær church on the island of Hakkebuøya west of Kvenvær.  The old church stood there from the mid-1400s until 1934 when it was deconstructed, moved, and rebuilt as Forsnes chapel in Forsnes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkdalsmenighetene.no/Kvenvær/index.htm|title=Kvenvær kirke|language=Norwegian|publisher=Orkdals prosti|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
