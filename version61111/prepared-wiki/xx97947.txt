[[King George Station]]

CATEGORIES: Expo Line (TransLink) stations, Buildings and structures in Surrey, British Columbia

King George Station is located on an elevated portion of the Expo Line, a part of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station itself is in Surrey and is the current eastbound terminus of the Expo Line.

==Location==

King George Station is located in Surrey City Centre at the corner of King George Boulevard and 100th Ave, just north of the western terminus of the Fraser Highway. On the south side of the station there used to be a large 815 space parking lot operated by Impark. The station has also recently spurred a series of nearby mixed-use developments, like the King George Tower. The most recent proposed development to the south of the station has taken half of the park and ride space out of service.

==History==

King George Station was built in 1994 as part of the second extension of the Expo Line into Surrey; the other stations included on this extension were Gateway and Surrey Central. In contrast to Surrey Central, the King George station is less busy.
Since opening in 1994, it has been the eastern terminus of the Expo Line. The tracks actually continue beyond the station for about a block before they terminate, to store extra cars and to allow eastbound trains to switch tracks for their ensuing westbound runs; plans call for the line to eventually be extended deeper into Surrey following the Fraser Highway, however to date no firm timeline for construction has been established, given that other mass-transit construction projects in Greater Vancouver now under way have been given priority.

==Services==

King George Station is a major connection point for the TransLink bus routes in Surrey, Langley, and White Rock.
