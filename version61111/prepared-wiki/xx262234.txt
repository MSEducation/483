==Causes and Beliefs==

Throughout her career as an activist and politician, she was a champion of Christian conservative causes, opposing the department of Child Protective Services (a.k.a Department of children and Families). Which, after 4 years of investigation, on November 16, 2007 she published a report entitled "The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services". After publishing the report, in a press conference she exclaimed that the report caused her to lose her position as a Georgia State Senator. In addition, she stood firmly in her support of the Pro-Life agenda, and also opposed Gay marriage. However, in expressing her Christian beliefs she promoted the display of the Ten Commandments in public places.  She was a senior official in the Baptist church, having served as a First Vice President of the Georgia Baptist Convention.
