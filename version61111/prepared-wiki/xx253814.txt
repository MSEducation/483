[[Amager Vest]]

CATEGORIES: Copenhagen city districts

Amager Vest (West Amager) is one of the ten administrative districts of Copenhagen, Denmark, located on in the north-western part of the island of Amager. It includes areas such as Islands Brygge, Ørestad and Eberts Villaby as well as the extensive meadowland of Kalvebod Fælled. The western part of Amager island is mainly an enlargement from shallow parts of the Øresund sea. The extension of western Amager began around 1930 and was finished around 1955. The main purpose was to give shelter to the southern parts of Copenhagen harbour. The enlargement is filled with rocks, sand from the sea, plaster, waste and today unknown items, making it very expensive to set up buildings there. The exhibition centre Bella Center (which hosted the environment meeting COP15 in December 2009) is one of very few exceptions from this. Even the soil is too bad for agricultural matters. Western Amager is the largest of the ten new official boroughs of Copenhagen, but has at the same time the smallest population. Only the most northern part can be considered as "urban area".
