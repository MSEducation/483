The Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA) is a community-based amateur commercial basketball league in Southern Philippines sanctioned by the country's National Sports Association for basketball, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP).  The league is made up of teams from the Visayas and Mindanao.  Formal operations began on February 25, 2006 with the opening of the ML Kwarta Padala First Conference at the MSU-IIT Gym in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte.  Forward Mark Bonifacio of Montana Pawnshop-Davao made the first basket in league history during the opening game versus PacMan-GenSan.
The league is a brainchild of multi-titled coach and Cebu City Councilor Raul "Yayoy" D. Alcoseba, who wanted to have a Vis-Min league managed by Vis-Min people and based in the area.  With the financial backing of sports patron Michel J. Lhuillier, the dream became a reality in late 2005 as Alcoseba and his staff began the groundwork by talking to potential team owners and sponsors.
Former FIBA referee Jose "Boy" Murillo and PBA legend Wilfredo "Willy" Generalao were named as the MVBA's two co-equal commissioners, with Murillo in charge of the Visayas games and Generalao in Mindanao.  Gov. Oscar S. Moreno, team owner of Misamis Oriental, was unanimously elected as the MVBA's Chairman.
In 2008, it merged with the National Basketball Conference (NBC), and Third Force Inc. (TFI) to form the new Liga Pilipinas.
