Eric M. Genden is an American otolaryngologist with the distinction of being the first surgeon to perform a jaw transplant in the United States.Daily News - "Jaw-Droppin' Op a Success" Retrieved April 30, 2008 It was also the first jaw transplant ever to combine donor jaw with bone marrow from the patient.
Genden graduated Summa Cum Laude from Columbia College, Harvard University School of Public Health and graduated first in his medical school class. Genden's other achievements include the development of an advancement in tracheal transplants that allows patients to communicate and breathe normally."New Tracheotomy Alternative Gives Hope" - Tracheotomy.info retrieved April 30, 2008

==Biography==

Genden is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology Neurosurgery and Immunobiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. He is also the Director of the Head and Neck Cancer Center. His expertise is in thyroid, parathyroid surgery, head and neck cancer surgery, and airway reconstruction. Other titles include Professor (of both Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Immunobiology) and Surgical Director of the Multidisciplinary Program for Head and Neck Cancer. He has been funded by the National Institutes of Health for his research in tracheal and laryngeal transplantation. 
Memberships include the New York Head and Neck Society, American Head and Neck Society, American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and the American Broncho-Esophagological Association. He received his B.A. degree from Columbia University in 1987 and graduated from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1992 where he obtained his MD degree with Distinction in Research, and Harvard University School of Public Health with a degree in Healthcare Management.

===Jaw transplant===

In 2006, Genden performed the first jaw transplant in North America, on a patient who carried the donated jaw in one of the back muscles for eight months. Along with several of his surgical team, Genden developed a technology using the patient's bone marrow and donor bony skeleton to create an immunological chimera. This technique has subsequently been applied to solid organ transplantation and Genden and his basic science team have been recognized by the National Academy of Science for this unique contribution to transplantation biology.

===Tracheal transplant===

In 2003, Genden performed the first reported tracheal transplantation that combined donor trachea cartilage with tissue from his patient. This innovation minimized the potential for rejection and, equally significantly, allowed the patient to communicate normally post-surgery. Genden has subsequently received international recognition for this work and has been nominated for the Marcus Prize in Medicine.
