==Early life==

Spacey was born in South Orange, New Jersey, the son of Kathleen Ann (née Knutson; December 5, 1931 – March 19, 2003), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler (June 4, 1924 – December 24, 1992), a technical writer and data consultant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=Ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|date=|accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Paul|last=Fischer|title=The Alien World Of Kevin Spacey|work=FilmMonthly|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html|date=October 20, 2001|archivedate=January 24, 2007|accessdate=June 2, 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070124110051/http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Who's who in the world, 1991–1992 (Volume 10 of Who's who in the world)|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|year=1990|location=|page=348|month=|url=|isbn=0-8379-1110-9[/tpl] He has two older siblings: a sister, Julie, and a brother, Randy.

==Career==

Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Molière's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.
His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to Spacey.[tpl]cite news|title=In Step With: Kevin Spacey|publisher=Parade Magazine|date=December 5, 2004|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_12-05-2004/in_step_with_0[/tpl] He made his first major television appearance in the second season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of "Uncle Louie" in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.
Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder–starring comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). Spacey earned a fan base following after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of the bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the all-star ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe, after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects, and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards.[tpl]cite news|first=Abraham|last=Levy|work=Austin American-Statesman|title=Texas film critics give 'Suspects' top honors|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD97C511DD8C8F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|date=December 30, 1995|accessdate=December 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|work=Austin Chronicle|title=The Society of Texas Film Critics 1995 Awards|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A530347|date=January 5, 1996[/tpl] He remarked in 2013, "I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch."[tpl]cite journal |author= Nashawaty, Chris |title= Kevin Spacey: Good & Evil |journal= Entertainment Weekly |date= February 8, 2013 |location= New York |publisher= Time Inc. |page= 54[/tpl]
Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also did voice work in Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998) voicing Hopper, the leader of a vicious gang of grasshoppers.
Spacey won universal praise and a Best Actor Oscar for his role as a depressed suburban father who re-evaluates his life in 1999's American Beauty; the same year, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Spacey won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and earned another Tony nomination in 1999 for The Iceman Cometh. In 2001, Spacey co-hosted, with Judi Dench, the Unite for the Future Gala, a UK fundraiser for the British Victims of 9/11 and Médecins Sans Frontières at London's Old Vic Theatre, produced by Harvey Goldsmith and Dominic Madden.
He played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in Pay It Forward (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an alien in K-Pax (2001), and singer Bobby Darin in Beyond the Sea (2004). Beyond The Sea was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career, and relationship with actress Sandra Dee. Facing little interest for backing in the States, Spacey went to the UK and Germany for funding. Almost all of the movie was filmed in Berlin. Spacey provided his own vocals on the Beyond the Sea soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of the film's release. He received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film.
Spacey hosted Saturday Night Live twice: first in 1997 with musical guest Beck and special guests Michael Palin and John Cleese from Monty Python's Flying Circus; and again in May 2006 with musical guest Nelly Furtado.
In 2006, Spacey played Lex Luthor in the Bryan Singer–directed superhero film, Superman Returns. He was to return for its 2009 sequel, but it was recently revealed that there won't be a chronological sequel; it is currently unknown if he has been asked to resume the role in any future films. Spacey also appeared in Edison, co-starring Morgan Freeman and Justin Timberlake; Edison received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006. In 2008, he played an MIT lecturer in the film 21, along with Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne, and Jim Sturgess. The film is based on Ben Mezrich's best seller, Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions, a story of student MIT card-counters who used mathematical probability to aid them in card games such as blackjack. In early 2010, Spacey went to China to star in writer-director Dayyan Eng's black-comedy film, Inseparable, alongside Hong Kong star Daniel Wu. Spacey was the first Hollywood actor to star in a fully Chinese-funded film.
Spacey is well known in Hollywood for his impressions. When he appeared on Inside the Actors Studio he imitated, at host James Lipton's request: James Stewart, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, John Gielgud, Marlon Brando, Christopher Walken, Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon.[tpl]youtube|bKKDKAKNH-k|Impersonations by Kevin Spacey (Full Video)[/tpl]
Capitol/EMI's album Forever Cool (2007) features two duets with Spacey and the voice of the late Dean Martin: "Ain't That a Kick in the Head" and "King of the Road."
He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.http://ssf.uk.com/patrons/kevin-spacey

==The Old Vic==

In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was returning to London to become the artistic director of the Old Vic, one of the city's oldest theatres.[tpl]cite news|title=Spacey 'to run Old Vic'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2723437.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=February 3, 2003|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] Appearing at a press conference with Judi Dench and Elton John, he promised both to appear on stage and to bring in big-name talent.[tpl]cite news|title=Spacey becomes London theatre boss|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2727845.stm|date=February 6, 2003|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] Spacey undertook to remain in the post for a full ten years. The Old Vic Theatre Company, in its current form, stages shows eight months out of the year. Spacey's first season started in September 2004, and opened with the British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos, directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews.[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief History of the Old Vic|publisher=Old Vic Theatre|url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php|year=2008|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the title role of Richard II directed by Trevor Nunn.
In mid-2006, Spacey said that he was having the time of his life working at the Old Vic; at this point in his career, he said, he was "trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside himself".[tpl]cite news|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|title=Beyond a Sea of Criticism, All's Well for Kevin Spacey at Old Vic|work=New York Times|date=May 29, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/theater/29spac.html|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] He performed in productions of National Anthems by Dennis McIntyre, and The Philadelphia Story by Philip Barry in which he played C.K. Dexter Haven, the Cary Grant role in the film version. Critics applauded Spacey for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
In the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a major setback with a production of Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues, directed by Robert Altman.[tpl]cite news|title=Spacey defends Old Vic management|publisher=BBC News|date=April 13, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4905638.stm|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] Despite an all-star cast (including Neve Campbell and Matthew Modine) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed after only a few weeks. Later in the year, Spacey starred in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten, along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. For the spring part of the 2007–08 season, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly joined Spacey as the three characters in David Mamet's 1988 play Speed-the-Plow.[tpl]cite web|first=Alistair|last=Page|title=Goldblum to join Spacey in the Old Vic's Speed-the-Plow|work=The Stage|date=December 10, 2007|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/19128/goldblum-to-join-spacey-in-the-old-vics|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl]

==Personal life==

A 1999 Sunday Times article stated that Spacey's "love affair with acting, and the absence of a visible partner in the life of an attractive 40-year-old, has resulted in misunderstanding and Esquire magazine's bet-hedging assertion two years ago that he must be gay."[tpl]cite news|first=Lesley|last=White|title=Spacey's Odyssey|url=http://www.drivingmrspacey.com/TheSundayTimesMagazine.htm|work=The Sunday Times Magazine |date=December 19, 1999[/tpl] He responded to such rumours by telling Playboy and other interviewers that he was not gay,[tpl]cite news|date=October 1999|url=//web.archive.org/web/20100805050550/http://www.kevinspacey.de/Presse/Playboy_englisch/playboy_englisch.html|title=Playboy interview[/tpl] and telling Lesley White of the Sunday Times, "I chose for a long time not to answer these questions because of the manner in which they were asked, and because I was never talking to someone I trusted, so why should I? Recently I chose to participate because it's a little hard on the people I love," Spacey said to Gotham Magazine. "I’ve just never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity. I’m not interested in doing it. Never will do it. They can gossip all they want; they can speculate all they want." He added, "I just happen to believe that there’s a public life and there’s a private life. Everybody has a right to a private life no matter what their profession is."[tpl]cite news|first=Sara|last=Bliss|title=The Drama King|url=http://kspacey.egloos.com/257064|work=Gotham Magazine|date=May 2007[/tpl]
