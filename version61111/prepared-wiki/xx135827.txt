[[Chaos theory in organizational development]]

CATEGORIES: Business theory, Chaos theory, Organizational theory

In organizational development, chaos theory is a subset of more general chaos theory that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics and presents them in a complex systems environment. To the observer the systems seem to be in chaos. Organizational Development of a business system is the management of that apparent chaos. The term “Managing Organized Chaos” is used in the book by the same name Managing Organized Chaos – Business Planning 1.0, to describe the daily management of an entity (business) engaged in continual activity.
