</ref> [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], an astronomer at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], used the plates from Arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the SMC. In 1908, the results of her study were published, which showed that a type of [[variable star]] called a "cluster variable", later called a [[Cepheid variable]] after the prototype star [[Delta Cephei]], showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star's luminosity.<ref>
