...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records. It was their first album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, following the death of Cliff Burton in 1986. ...And Justice for All is musically progressive, featuring long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It was noted for its dry, sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the album's mixing process. The songs' dark lyrics have themes of political and legal injustice, as seen through the prism of war, censored speech, and nuclear brinkmanship.
The front cover depicts a statue of Lady Justice cracked, blindfolded, and bound by ropes with her breasts exposed and both of her scales filled with dollars. The words "…And Justice for All" are written in graffiti-like lettering to the right. The cover art was created by Stephen Gorman, based on a concept developed by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. The album was initially released on one vinyl disc, but soon after re-released (without additional tracks) as a double-album.
...And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics. It was included in The Village Voice[tpl]'[/tpl]s annual Pazz & Jop critics poll of the year's best albums, while the single "One" earned Metallica their first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. It was also their best-selling album at that point and became the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the United States. The album was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 9, 2003, having shipped eight million copies in the US.

==Background==

...And Justice for All was Metallica's first studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, following the death of Cliff Burton in 1986. However, Newsted had previously appeared on Metallica's The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, an extended play released in 1987.[tpl]cite web|author=J. Bennett|title=Metallica "… And Justice for All"|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/metallica/|work=Decibel|publisher=Red Flag Media Inc.|accessdate=June 9, 2013[/tpl] The band intended to record the album earlier, but the process was interrupted with a substantial number of festival dates scheduled for the summer of 1987. Another reason that prevented them from entering the studio was frontman James Hetfield's arm injury that occurred in a skateboarding accident.
The band's previous studio album Master of Puppets marked the end of the licensing deal the group had with record label Music for Nations. Metallica's manager Peter Mensch wanted the band to sign with the British record distributor Phonogram Records, and Phonogram's chairman Martin Hooker was keen to renew the band's contract. To persuade the group to choose his label over Q Prime, who were also interested in making an agreement with the band, Hooker offered them a bigger deal, saying "worth well over £1 million, which at that time was the biggest deal we'd ever offered anyone." Hooker explained his decision by saying that "the final figure for combined British and European sales of all three Metallica albums on MFN was then in excess of 1.5 million, or about 500,000 each".

==Production and recording==

...And Justice for All was recorded from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen. Rasmussen was initially unavailable for Metallica's planned start date at January 1, 1988, and so the band brought in Mike Clink, who had caught their attention as the producer of Guns N' Roses' album Appetite for Destruction (1987). But things did not work out as planned, and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after drummer Lars Ulrich gave him a call. Rasmussen heard Clink's demos for the album on his flight to Los Angeles on February 14, and upon his arrival Clink was fired. James Hetfield explained that the recording process with Mike Clink "didn't work out so well, so we got Flemming to come over and save our asses". However, Clink is credited with engineering the drums on two of the album's tracks – "The Shortest Straw" and "Harvester of Sorrow". While waiting for him to arrive, the band recorded two cover tunes – "Breadfan" and "The Prince" – to "fine‑tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe".[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may11/articles/classic-tracks-0511.htm|title=Metallica 'One': Classic Tracks|journal=Sound on Sound|publisher=SOS Publications Group|date=May 2011|last=Buskin|first=Richard |accessdate=January 18, 2013|oclc=61313197[/tpl] Both tunes were later released as B-sides of the "Harvester of Sorrow" CD single, with them also separately being B-sides for "Eye of the Beholder" and "One" respectively, as well as included on the compilation album Garage Inc. in 1998.
Rasmussen's first providence was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound, which the band had not been satisfied with. Both a guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's drumming were employed. The band would perform in a live room, with the instruments being recorded separately. Each song used three reels, one for drums, one for the bass and guitars, and one for anything else. Hetfield wrote the lyrics during the recording session, at times not having them finished as the song started recording, which Rasmussen attributed to Hetfield "wasn't really interested in singing" in lieu of "wanting that hard vibe". The recording routine was strange to newcomer Jason Newsted, who complained about not having bigger impact to the overall sound, nor having any discussion between him and the rest of the working team. He had a different experience during his tenure in his previous band Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style of playing as "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". On ...And Justice for All, Newsted said that he recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with just the assistant engineer present. He also noted that his bass parts ended up at the same frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, creating a "battle for the same frequency".[tpl]cite journal|date=May 1, 2013|author=Merlin|title=Jason Newsted Says He's Over Metallica Screwing With His Bass Parts On '…And Justice For All'|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/jason-newsted-says-hes-over-metallica-screwing-with-his-bass-parts-on-and-justice-for-all/|journal=Metal Hammer|publisher=TeamRock|accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl]

==Music==

 
  "We took the Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets concept as far as we could take it. There was no place else to go with the progressive, nutty, sideways side of Metallica, and I'm so proud of the fact that, in some way, that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the '80s."  —Lars Ulrich, on the band's direction for the album 

 "This is completely sublimated rock, on a quest for a purity of form, light years beyond raunch or blues rock. Metallica turn heavy metal's melodrama into algebra. This isn't thrash, but thresh: mechanized mayhem. There's no blur, no mess, not even at peak velocity, but a rigorous grid of incisions and contusions."  —Simon Reynolds, on the album's music 

...And Justice for All is a musically progressive album that features long and complex songs,[tpl]cite book|last=Edmondson|first=Jacqueline|year=2013|title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=TQPXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA708#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-31-339348-8|page=708[/tpl] with very fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. The band decided to broaden their sonic range, writing compositions that had multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and odd time signatures.[tpl]cite book|last=Gulla|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Gulla|title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC&pg=PA104&dq=...and+justice+for+all+bob+gulla&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WyHkUuyKD-qvyAPXkoCYBg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=...and%20justice%20for%20all%20bob%20gulla&f=false|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35806-7|page=104[/tpl] Hetfield later explained that, "songwriting-wise, album was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'"[tpl]cite news|year=2008|title=Metallica Look Back At ... And Justice For All|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1592409/metallica-look-back-at-justice-all-metal-file.jhtml|accessdate=June 9, 2013[/tpl] Music critic Simon Reynolds said that there are various riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts".
BBC Music's Eamonn Stack felt that ...And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher singing by Hetfield.[tpl]cite web|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|date=April 18, 2007|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5f54|title=BBC Review|publisher=BBC Music|accessdate=June 9, 2013[/tpl] Journalist Martin Popoff opined that the album did not have as much melody as its predecessors, because of the frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures, and layered guitars. He argued that rather than thrash, the album is more of a progressive metal record characterized by intricately performed music and a bleak sound.[tpl]cite book|last=Popoff|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Popoff|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3SUQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT83|title=Metallica: The Complete Illustrated History|page=81|year=2013|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=0760344825|accessdate=January 4, 2014[/tpl] Joel McIver viewed the music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain place among the bands "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" on the album.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TMHr1g7T8gQC&pg=PT163|accessdate=June 12, 2013|title=The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll|last=Knowles|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Knowles (comics)|year=2010|page=163|quote=Having taken the thrash concept to its logical conclusion with 1988's ...And Justice for All, Metallica...|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=1-57344-564-9[/tpl]
The album was noted for its dry, sterile production. Rasmussen said it was not his intention, as he attempted to get a sound filled with ambience like in the previous two albums, and he was not present for the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix and none of the room microphones, thus causing the "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that due to the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded "strangled mechanistic". He saw the "synthetic" percussion as another reason for the compressed, "difficult cyborgian" sound of the album.[tpl]cite book|last=Popoff|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Popoff|title=The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time|year=2002|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-530-3|page=183[/tpl]
The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that "Jason Newsted, engineer Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". In their defence, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines to the point of being indiscernible from each other.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/metallica-talkin-thrash?page=0,6|title=Metallica: Talkin' Thrash|author=Bienstock, Richard|journal=Guitar World|publisher=NewBay Media|date=December 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl] A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do.[tpl]cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton |year=2009 |publisher=Jawbone Press |isbn=978-1-906002-24-4[/tpl] Newsted was quoted as saying "The Justice album wasn't something that really felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass".Classic Albums: Metallica – Metallica.

==Lyrics==

...And Justice for All has a dark lyrical material which features a conceptual uniformity around notions of political and legal injustice, as seen through the prism of war, censored speech, and nuclear brinkmanship. The majority of the songs raise issues that differ from the violent retaliation of their previous releases. Editor Tom King wrote that "the lyrics, for the first time dealt with political and environmental issues". He named fellow contemporaries Nuclear Assault as the only other band who "applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs" rather than singing about Satan and Egyptian plagues.[tpl]cite book|last=King|first=Tom|title=Metallica – Uncensored On the Record|year=2011|publisher=Coda Books LTD|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-1-908538-55-0|page=|pages=Section 25|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=h_2oRFsFnnUC&pg=PT110&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Music biographer Joel McIver noted that the band's main lyricist, James Hetfield, wrote about topics that he has not addressed before, like his revolt towards The Establishment.
Lars Ulrich described the songwriting process as "our CNN years", with him and James Hetfield watching the channel in search for song subjects – "I'd read about the blacklisting thing, we'd get a title, 'The Shortest Straw,' and a song would come out of that."[tpl]cite journal|first=David|last=Fricke|title=Metallica: Rolling Stone|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090321081614/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21395583/metallica/6 |journal=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] Concerns about the environmental plight of the planet ("Blackened"), corruption ("...And Justice for All"), and blacklisting and discrimination ("The Shortest Straw") are emphasized with traditional existential themes.[tpl]cite book|last=Irwin|first=William|title=Metallica and Philosophy: A Crash Course in Brain Surgery|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Pennsylvania|isbn=978-1-4051-6348-4|page=63|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=aAwd261m7a0C&pg=PA50&dq=Metallica+and+Philosophy:+A+Crash+Course+in+Brain+Surgery+and+justice+for+all&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VCe6Udofo4vgBN34gZAK&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Metallica%20and%20Philosophy%3A%20A%20Crash%20Course%20in%20Brain%20Surgery%20and%20justice%20for%20all&f=false[/tpl] Issues such as freedom of speech and civil liberties are presented from a grim and pessimistic point of view.[tpl]cite book|editor1-first=Paul|editor1-last=Brannigan|editor2-first=Ian|editor2-last=Winwood|title=Birth School Metallica Death|year=2013|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-57129-416-9|pages=Section 8|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=CX9KAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT7&dq=Birth+School+Metallica+Death&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oR3kUoODDYzAygOu4YCQDg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Birth%20School%20Metallica%20Death&f=false[/tpl] Due to its theme which depicts the suffering of a wounded soldier, "One" was unofficially entitled as "antiwar anthem".[tpl]cite book|last=Ray|first=Michael|title=Disco, Punk, New Wave, Heavy Metal, and More: Music in the 1970s and 1980s|year=2013|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|location=New York|page=53|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=3q4rIHXyOGUC&pg=PA40&dq=Disco,+Punk,+New+Wave,+Heavy+Metal,+and+More:+Music+in+the+1970s+and+1980s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hm3MUvvUO-O7yAPClICwDw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA[/tpl] The album's closing track, "Dyers Eve", is a lyrical rant from James Hetfield to his parents.[tpl]cite book|last=McIver|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel McIver|title=Justice For All – The Truth About Metallica|year=2004|publisher=Music Sales Group|isbn=0-85712-009-3|pages=Section 16|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=SvW-uN-qEbIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mciver+metallica&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bcjKUuL2K-HnywPG-IHAAg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mciver%20metallica&f=false[/tpl]
Cliff Burton receives co-writers credit on "To Live Is to Die" as the bass line was a medley of unused bass recordings Burton had performed prior to his death. While the original recordings are not used on the track, the compositions are credited as written by Burton and are played by Metallica's bassist at the time, Jason Newsted. The spoken word at the end of the song ("when a man lies, he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives...") was written by German poet Paul Gerhardt, but is erroneously attributed to Burton in the liner notes. Still, the second half of the speech ("All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?") was written by Burton.[tpl]cite book|last=McIver|first=Joel|title=To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton|year=2009|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-24-4|page=227|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=F9uBIwlYSokC&pg=PA230&dq=and+justice+for+all+metallica&hl=en&sa=X&ei=a6W8UY32LaeG4ASliIHQBA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=and%20justice%20for%20all%20metallica&f=false[/tpl]

Spin magazine's Sharon Liveten called it a "gem of a double record" and found the music both edgy and technically proficient.[tpl]cite journal|last=Liveten|first=Sharon |page=97|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ffg2qNLJucC&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Spins|journal=Spin|location=New York|volume=4|issue=8|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=November 1988[/tpl] Simon Reynolds, writing in Melody Maker, said that "other bands would give their eye teeth for" the songs' riffs and found the album's densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music: "Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse. It's probably the most incisive music I've ever heard, in the literal sense of the word."[tpl]cite journal|title=...And Justice for All|journal=Melody Maker|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Reynolds|page=36|volume=64|issue=37|date=September 10, 1988[/tpl] Borivoj Krgin of Metal Forces said that it is the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than on Master of Puppets. In a less enthusiastic review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau felt that the band's compositions lack song form and that the album "goes on longer" than Master of Puppets. In 1988, ...And Justice for All was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but with much controversy, it lost to Jethro Tull's Crest of a Knave. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly, named the win one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history.[tpl]cite journal| year=2007|title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets|journal=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html|accessdate=February 13, 2007[/tpl]
In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that ...And Justice for All was both the band's "most ambitious" and ultimately "flattest-sounding" album. AllMusic's Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of their previous two albums, with more sophisticated songs and "apocalyptic" lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the progressive elements on the album and felt that, apart from "One" and "Dyers Eve", most of the album sounded clumsy.[tpl]cite book|last=Wall|first=Mick|authorlink=Mick Wall|title=Enter Night: A Biography of Metallica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8fm8mN58lQC&pg=PA296|pages=10, 296|year=2010|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-1-40911-2969|accessdate=January 10, 2014[/tpl] Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), wrote that, apart from the praiseworthy "One", the album diminished the band's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Lars Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and that it is well-revered among a lot of their colleagues.

==Live performances==

Hammett noted the length of the songs being problematic for fans and the band. "Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long," he said. "One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again.'"[tpl]cite web|title=The Black Album James, Kirk, Lars |publisher=metallicaworld.co.uk|url=http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/Interviews/black_album_1991.htm|accessdate=February 23, 2008[/tpl]
In spite of this, "One" quickly gained a permanent fixture in the band's live setlist since the release of the album.[tpl]cite web|title= Metlists, Inc. – One|publisher=metlists.com|url=http://metlists.com/songs/one.htm|accessdate=January 31, 2008[/tpl] When the song is played live, the war sound heard at the beginning of the song is often lengthened to approximately two minutes instead of the original seventeen seconds. When the war sound has reached a conclusion, after having a pitch-black stage, fire erupts from various points of the stage.
