In November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.  According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."[tpl]cite web |last=Larson|first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet|url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet|date=5 November 2011 |publisher=White House |accessdate=2011-11-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says|url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/|date=5 November 2011 |publisher=UniverseToday |accessdate=2011-11-06 [/tpl] Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye." The response further noted that efforts, like SETI, the Kepler space telescope and the NASA Mars rover, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved."

==Possible basis==

Several hypotheses have been proposed about the possible basis of alien life from a biochemical, evolutionary or morphological viewpoint.

===Biochemistry===

All life on Earth is based upon 26 chemical elements. However, about 95% of this life is built upon only six of these elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur, abbreviated CHNOPS. These six elements form the basic building blocks of virtually all life on Earth, while most of the remaining elements are found in only trace amounts.[tpl]cite book | first1=Lucas John | last1=Mix | year=2009 | title=Life in space: astrobiology for everyone | page=76 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=0-674-03321-3 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A60E-v4Sr-gC&pg=PA76 | accessdate=2011-08-08 [/tpl]
Life on Earth requires water as the solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and the other elements along with water, may enable the formation of living organisms on other planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.[tpl]cite journal | first=Norman R. | last=Pace | date=January 20, 2001 | title=The universal nature of biochemistry | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=98 | issue=3 | pages=805–808 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | pmid=11158550 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P | pmc=33372[/tpl] Terrestrial planets such as Earth are formed in a process that allows for the possibility of having compositions similar to Earth's.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=Jade C. | last2=O'Brien | first2=David P. | last3=Lauretta | first3=Dante S. | title=The Compositional Diversity of Extrasolar Terrestrial Planets. I. In Situ Simulations | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=715 | issue=2 | pages=1050–1070 |date=June 2010 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/715/2/1050 | bibcode=2010ApJ...715.1050B |arxiv = 1004.0971 [/tpl] The combination of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in the chemical form of carbohydrates (e.g. sugar) can be a source of chemical energy on which life depends, and can provide structural elements for life (such as ribose, in the molecules DNA and RNA, and cellulose in plants). Plants derive energy through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Life, as currently recognized, requires carbon in both reduced (methane derivatives) and partially oxidized (carbon oxides) states. Nitrogen is needed as a reduced ammonia derivative in all proteins, sulfur as a derivative of hydrogen sulfide in some necessary proteins, and phosphorus oxidized to phosphates in genetic material and in energy transfer.
Pure water is useful because it has a neutral pH due to its continued dissociation between hydroxide and hydronium ions. As a result, it can dissolve both positive metallic ions and negative non-metallic ions with equal ability. Furthermore, the fact that organic molecules can be either hydrophobic (repelled by water) or hydrophilic (soluble in water) creates the ability of organic compounds to orient themselves to form water-enclosing membranes. Additionally, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules give it an ability to store energy with evaporation, which upon condensation is released. This helps to moderate the climate, cooling the tropics and warming the poles, helping to maintain the thermodynamic stability needed for life.
Carbon is fundamental to terrestrial life for its immense flexibility in creating covalent chemical bonds with a variety of non-metallic elements, principally nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide and water together enable the storage of solar energy in sugars and starches, such as glucose. The oxidation of glucose releases biochemical energy needed to fuel all other biochemical reactions.
The ability to form organic acids (–COOH) and amine bases (–NH2) gives rise to the possibility of neutralization dehydrating reactions to build long polymer peptides and catalytic proteins from monomer amino acids. When combined with phosphates, these acids can build the information-storing molecule of inheritance, DNA, and the principal energy transfer molecule of cellular life, ATP.
Due to their relative abundance and usefulness in sustaining life, many have hypothesized that life forms elsewhere in the universe would utilize these basic materials. However, other elements and solvents could provide a basis for life.
Life forms based in ammonia (rather than water) have been suggested, though this solution appears less optimal than water.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html| publisher=daviddarling.info| title=Ammonia-based life[/tpl]
From a chemical perspective, life is fundamentally a self-replicating reaction, but one which could arise under a great many conditions and with various possible ingredients, though carbon-oxygen within the liquid temperature range of water seems most conducive. Suggestions have even been made that self-replicating reactions of some sort could occur within the plasma of a star, though it would be highly unconventional.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/etlifevar.html| publisher=daviddarling.info| title=extraterrestrial life, variety of[/tpl] Life on the surface of a neutron star, based on nuclear reactions, has also been suggested. However, communicating with such creatures would be difficult because the time scales involved are much faster.
Several pre-conceived ideas about the characteristics of life outside Earth have been questioned. For example, a NASA scientist suggested that the color of photosynthesizing pigments of hypothetical life on extrasolar planets might not be green.[tpl]cite news | first = Rob Gutro | title = NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets | date = 4 November 2007 | publisher = NASA | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html | work = Goddard Space Flight Center | accessdate = 2011-02-18[/tpl]

===Evolution and morphology===

In addition to the biochemical basis of extraterrestrial life, many have considered evolution and morphology. Science fiction has often depicted extraterrestrial life with humanoid or reptilian forms. Aliens have often been depicted as having light green or grey skin, with a large head, as well as four limbs—i.e. fundamentally humanoid. Other subjects, such as felines, insects, blobs, etc., have occurred in fictional representations of aliens.
A division has been suggested between universal and parochial (narrowly restricted) characteristics. Universals are features which are thought to have evolved independently more than once on Earth (and thus, presumably, are not too difficult to develop) and are so intrinsically useful that species will inevitably tend towards them. The most fundamental of these is probably bilateral symmetry, but more complex (though still basic) characteristics include flight, sight, photosynthesis and limbs, all of which are thought to have evolved several times here on Earth. There is a huge variety of eyes, for example, and many of these have radically different working schematics and different visual foci: the visual spectrum, infrared, polarity and echolocation. Parochials, however, are essentially arbitrary evolutionary forms. These often have little inherent utility (or at least have a function which can be equally served by dissimilar morphology) and probably will not be replicated. Intelligent aliens could communicate through gestures, as deaf humans do, by sounds created from structures unrelated to breathing, which happens on Earth when, for instance, cicadas vibrate their wings or crickets stridulate their wings, or visually through bioluminescence or chromatophore-like structures.
Attempting to define parochial features challenges many taken-for-granted notions about morphological necessity. Skeletons, which are essential to large terrestrial organisms according to the experts of the field of gravitational biology, are almost assured to be replicated elsewhere in one form or another. The assumption of radical diversity amongst putative extraterrestrials is by no means settled. While many exobiologists do stress that the enormously heterogeneous nature of life on Earth foreshadows an even greater variety in outer space, others point out that convergent evolution may dictate substantial similarities between Earth and extraterrestrial life. These two schools of thought are called "divergionism" and "convergionism" respectively.

==Planetary habitability in the Solar System==

Some bodies in the Solar System have been suggested as having the potential for an environment that could host extraterrestrial life, particularly those with possible subsurface oceans. Though due to the lack of habitable environments beyond Earth, should life be discovered elsewhere in the Solar System, astrobiologists suggest that it will more likely be in the form of extremophile microorganisms.
The planets Venus and Mars, along with several natural satellites orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, and even comets, are suspected to possess niche environments in which life might exist. A subsurface marine environment on Jupiter's moon Europa might be the most suitable habitat in the Solar System, outside Earth, for multicellular organisms.
Panspermia suggests that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the Solar System, it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth may have been seeded from elsewhere (exogenesis). The Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, developed by the Planetary Society launched in 2011 was designed to test some aspect of these hypotheses, but it was destroyed along with the carrier Fobos-Grunt mission.Universe Today, "Russian Space Program Prepares for Phobos-Grunt Re-Entry", David Warmflash, 13 December 2011
The first known mention of the term Panspermia was in the writings of the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras.Margaret O'Leary (2008) Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory, iUniverse publishing Group, # ISBN 978-0-595-49596-2 In the nineteenth century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834),[tpl]Cite journal| last =  Berzelius (1799-1848) | first =  J.

New York, Harper & Row, 1908.
Sir Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) and Chandra Wickramasinghe (born 1939) were important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that lifeforms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution.Fred Hoyle, Chandra Wickramasinghe and John Watson, Viruses from Space and Related Matters, University College Cardiff Press, 1986.
Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.

In a virtual presentation on Tuesday, April 7, 2009, Stephen Hawking discussed the possibility of building a human base on another planet and gave reasons why alien life might not be contacting the human race, during his conclusion of the Origins Symposium at Arizona State University. Hawking also talked about what humans may find when venturing into space, such as the possibility of alien life through the theory of panspermia.[tpl]cite web|last=Weaver|first=Rheyanne|title=Ruminations on other worlds|url=http://www.statepress.com/archive/node/5745|work=State Press|accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]

===Jupiter===

Carl Sagan and others in the 1960s and 1970s computed conditions for hypothetical amino acid-based macroscopic life in the atmosphere of Jupiter, based on observed conditions of this atmosphere. However, the conditions do not appear to permit the type of encapsulation thought necessary for molecular biochemistry, so life is thought to be unlikely.[ref]
</ref>
However, some of Jupiter's moons may have habitats capable of sustaining life. Scientists have suggested that heated subsurface oceans of water may exist deep under the crusts of the three outer Galilean moons—Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The EJSM/Laplace mission is planned to determine the habitability of these environments. However, Europa is seen as the main target for the discovery of life.

====Europa====

Jupiter's moon Europa has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of liquid water beneath an ice layer. Hydrothermal vents on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular microorganisms.[ref]

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.Phil Plait, "Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice", "Bad Astronomy Blog""SCIENTISTS FIND EVIDENCE FOR "GREAT LAKE" ON EUROPA AND POTENTIAL NEW HABITAT FOR LIFE"

An alternate explanation for the hypothetical existence of microbial life on Titan has already been formally proposed[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |publisher=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-10 | first=Paul | last=Rincon[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Gladman, Brett; Dones, Luke; Levinson, Harold F.; Burns, Joseph A. | title = Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System | year = 2005 | journal = Astrobiology | volume = 5 | pages = 483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483 | pmid = 16078867 | issue = 4 | bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G[/tpl]—hypothesizing that microorganisms could have left Earth when it suffered a massive asteroid or comet impact (such as the impact that created Chicxulub crater only 66 mya), and survived a journey through space to land on Titan.

====Enceladus====

Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has some of the conditions for life including geothermal activity and water vapor as well as possible under-ice oceans heated by tidal effects. The Cassini probe detected carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen—all key elements for supporting living organisms—during a fly-by through one of Enceladus's geysers spewing ice and gas in 2005. The temperature and density of the plumes indicate a warmer, watery source beneath the surface. However, no life has been detected.

===Small Solar System bodies===

Small Solar System bodies have also been suggested as habitats for extremophiles.  Fred Hoyle has proposed that microbial life might exist on comets.Hoyle, Fred, Evolution from Space, Omni Lecture, Royal Institution, London, 12 January 1982; Evolution from Space (1982) pp. 27–28 ISBN 0-89490-083-8; Evolution from Space: A Theory of Cosmic Creationism (1984) ISBN 0-671-49263-2 Live bacteria were found on the camera of the Surveyor 3 probe that had stayed on the surface of the Moon for two and a half years.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] This finding was later considered doubtful as sterile procedures may not have been fully followed.

==Scientific search==

The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly.

===Direct search===

Scientists are directly searching for biosignatures within the Solar System, carrying out studies on the surface of Mars and examining meteors which have fallen to Earth. At the moment, no concrete plan exists for exploration of Europa for life.  In 2008, a joint mission by NASA and the European Space Agency was announced that would have included studies of Europa."Outer Planet Flagship Mission" , "Jet Propulsion Laboratory"  However, in 2011 NASA was forced to deprioritize the mission due to a lack of funding, and it is possible that the ESA will take on the mission by itself."New approach for L-class mission candidates", "ESA"
There is some limited evidence that microbial life might possibly exist (or have existed) on Mars.Spherix Mars Research (archived page) An experiment on the Viking Mars lander reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil that some argue are consistent with the presence of microbes. However, the lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the Viking lander indicates that a non-biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis. Independently, in 1996, structures resembling nanobacteria were reportedly discovered in a meteorite, ALH84001, thought to be formed of rock ejected from Mars. This report is controversial.
In February 2005, NASA scientists reported that they may have found some evidence of present life on Mars.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_life_050216.html| title= Exclusive: NASA Researchers Claim Evidence of Present Life on Mars| last= Berger| first= Brian| year=2005[/tpl] The two scientists, Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA's Ames Research Center, based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars' atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth, as well as on their own study of primitive life near the Rio Tinto river in Spain. NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists' claims, and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.spacetoday.net/Summary/2804| title= NASA denies Mars life reports| publisher=spacetoday.net| year=2005[/tpl]
Though such methane findings are still very much in debate, support among some scientists for the existence of life on Mars seems to be growing: an informal survey conducted at the conference at which the European Space Agency presented its findings on methane in Mars' atmosphere, indicated that 75% of the people present agreed that bacteria once lived on Mars. Roughly 25% agreed that bacteria inhabit the planet today.[tpl]cite news| last = Spotts|first = Peter N.| title = Sea boosts hope of finding signs of life on Mars| publisher = The Christian Science Monitor| date = 2005-02-28| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0228/p02s02-usgn.html| accessdate = 2006-12-18 [/tpl]

The Gaia hypothesis stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by spectroscopy. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets.

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system.

In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics - "a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively".[tpl]cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins |url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=September 22, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=756 |number=1 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G [/tpl] Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks."

On February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.[tpl]cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

===Indirect search===

If there is an advanced extraterrestrial society, there is no guarantee that they are transmitting information in the direction of Earth or that this information could be interpreted as such by humans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]  The length of time required for a signal to travel across the vastness of space means that any signal detected, or not detected, would come from the distant past.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search for radio activity which would confirm the presence of intelligent life. A related suggestion is that aliens might broadcast pulsed and continuous laser signals in the optical, as well as infrared, spectrum;[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.coseti.org/| publisher=The Columbus Optical SETI Observatory| title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the Optical Spectrum[/tpl] laser signals have the advantage of not "smearing" in the interstellar medium, and may prove more conducive to communication between the stars. While other communication techniques, including laser transmission and interstellar spaceflight, have been discussed seriously and may well be feasible, the measure of effectiveness is the amount of information communicated per unit cost. This results in radio transmission as the method of choice.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Some have hypothesized that very advanced civilizations may create artificial black holes as an energy source or method of waste disposal.  Thus, they suggest that the observation of a black hole with a mass of less than 3.5 solar masses, the theoretical lower mass limit for a naturally occurring black hole, would be evidence of an alien civilization.Ray Villard, "Super-Civilizations Might Live Off Black Holes", "Discovery News"

===Extrasolar planets===

Astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life, narrowing the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://planet.iap.fr/OB05390.news.html |date=25 January 2006 |title=Discovery of OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, the first cool rocky/icy exoplanet |work=IAP.fr |postscript= [/tpl]SPACE.com – Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life Current radiodetection methods have been inadequate for such a search, since the resolution afforded by recent technology is inadequate for a detailed study of extrasolar planetary objects. Future telescopes should be able to image planets around nearby stars, which may reveal the presence of life – either directly or through spectrography – and would reveal key information, such as the presence of free oxygen in a planet's atmosphere:
It has been argued that Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to Earth, may contain planets which could be capable of sustaining life.1997AJ 113.1445W Page 1445
On April 24, 2007, scientists at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile said they had found the first Earth-like planet. The planet, known as Gliese 581 c, orbits within the habitable zone of its star Gliese 581, a red dwarf star which is 20.5 light years (194 trillion km) from the Earth. It was initially thought that this planet could contain liquid water, but recent computer simulations of the climate on Gliese 581 c by Werner von Bloh and his team at Germany's Institute for Climate Impact Research suggest that carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere would create a runaway greenhouse effect. This would warm the planet well above the boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius/212 degrees Fahrenheit), thus dimming the hopes of finding life. As a result of greenhouse models, scientists are now turning their attention to Gliese 581 d, which lies just outside the star's traditional habitable zone.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-06-18-earthlike-planet-questioned_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Hopes dim for life on distant planet | date=2007-06-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Ker | last=Than[/tpl]

In May 2011, researchers predicted that Gliese 581 d, not only exists in the "Goldilocks zone" where water can be present in liquid form, but is big enough to have a stable carbon dioxide atmosphere and "warm enough to have oceans, clouds, and rainfall," according to France's National Centre for Scientific Research.[tpl]cite web|author=View all 26 comments Leave a comment |url=http://www.newser.com/story/118825/gliese-581d-identified-as-habitable-exoplanet.html |title=Scientists ID 'Habitable' Exoplanet — New model suggests Gliese 581D a likely candidate for life |publisher=Newser.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl]

Since 1992, hundreds of planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or "exoplanets") in the Milky Way Galaxy have been discovered. As of [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|asof|mdy[/tpl], the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia identified [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count[/tpl] extrasolar planets (in [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|system_count[/tpl] planetary systems and [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|multiplanetsystem_count[/tpl] multiple planetary systems); the extrasolar planets range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter.[tpl]cite web|title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=10 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-30 [/tpl]  The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years.  Because the Kepler spacecraft must view three stellar transits by exoplanets before it identifies them as candidate planets, it has so far only been able to identify planets that orbit their star at a relatively quick rate.  The mission is expected to continue until at least 2016, in which time many more exoplanet candidates are expected to be found.Mike Wall, "NASA's Kepler Observatory to continue hunt for strange new worlds", "The Christian Science Monitor"
Despite these successes, the transit method employed by the Kepler spacecraft requires that planetary orbits be at a small inclination to the line of sight of the observer. Due to this constraint, the probability of detecting a planet of Earth's size and orbital radius around a distant star is just 0.47%. Thus, the number of planets we are currently able to detect is only a small fraction of the total number of planets present within the galaxy."Kepler: A Search for Habitable Planets", "NASA Ames Research Center"

==The Drake equation==

In 1961, University of California, Santa Cruz, astronomer and astrophysicist Dr. Frank Drake devised the Drake equation. This controversial equation multiplied estimates of the following terms together:
Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that the terms in the equation are entirely based on conjecture. Thus the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind.[tpl]cite book |author= Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart |title=Evolving the Alien |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ |year=2002[/tpl] Chapter 6, What does a Martian look like? Although the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was not meant to be science, but intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html|first=Amir|last=Alexander|title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History — Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation[/tpl]
Drake used the equation to estimate that there are approximately 10,000 planets in the Milky Way galaxy containing intelligent life with the possible capability of communicating with Earth.[tpl]cite web|url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970924.html|title= The Drake Equation|accessdate= 2008-02-05|last= Boyd|first= Padi|work= Imagine the Universe|publisher= NASA|quote= Frank Drake's own current estimate puts the number of communicating civilizations in the galaxy at 10,000[/tpl]
