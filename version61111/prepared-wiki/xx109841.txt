The Heat Is On is a BBC talent show that was a regular fixture on the Saturday night schedule between 1990 and 1994. The show was originally hosted by comedian/impressionist Bobby Davro, with his catchphrase of "They're in heat, so vote with your feet!" sweeping the nation. Davro left the show in 1993 after a Sunday tabloid published an expose on his cocaine-fuelled prostitute orgies.[tpl]Fact|date=May 2007[/tpl] Despite this setback though the programme continued to be a ratings winner and the show was nominated in six categories at the Baftas ceremony later that year.
After continuing with a succession of guest presenters (including Jill Dando, Lenny Henry and a then 12 year-old Jamie Oliver) the show was eventually cancelled in late 1994, after an unfortunate incident during filming for that year's Christmas special.[tpl]Fact|date=May 2007[/tpl]
Producers of the show have included former presenter Chris Kelly.
Notably, a six year old Dylan Mills (aka Dizzee Rascal) appeared as a performer on the show. His five minute act included an array of circus skills.
