Enbise Sar Midir is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. This woreda is named in part after the historic district of Enbise, which was first mentioned in the 16th century.C.F.

Part of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Enbise Sar Midir is bordered on the south by Enarj Enawga, on the west by Goncha Siso Enese, and on the north and east by Abay River which separates it from the Debub Gondar Zone and Debub Wollo Zone.

The highest point in this woreda is Mount Amonewas, with an elevation of 3664 meters; other high points include Mount Yekandach. Other notable landmarks include the monastery at Mertule Mariam. The Abay is crossable at Daga ford, which connects this woreda with Sayint woreda in Debub Wollo.
In 2002, Enbise Sar Midir was judged to be one of four chronically food insecure woredas in this part of the Amhara Region, due to much of their farmland being "extremely depleted, deforested and eroded".Hugo RÃ¤mi, "Fewer surpluses in Gojam and Awi and Severe shortages in lowland areas of Abaye River Gorg ", UN-OCHA Assessment Mission, October 2002 (accessed 23 April 2009)
This woreda was selected as one of the three areas for Agri-Service Ethiopia to implement an Integrated Food Security Program. This Program operates in 10 of the woreda's kebeles, with the goal of improving agricultural practices, developing new rural water sources, conserving use of local natural resources, training community health workers and building new schools.Operational Areas (Agri-Service Ethiopia)
