FreshXpress was a discount supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. It was originally formed in 2007, from the rump of the defunct Kwik Save chain, by Irish retail entrepreneur Brendan Murtagh. It existed in its original form between July 2007 and March 2008, culminating in it going into administration, and was then resurrected in a smaller form, however during 2009 the resurrected company also went into administration, and has since ceased to exist.

==History==

===From the remains of Kwik Save===

In February 2007 Brendan Murtagh, a major shareholder in Cavan-based Kingspan building materials group backed 70% of a £50 million rescue plan for Kwik Save, with the Kwik Save managing director, Paul Niklas covering the remaining 30%. Murtagh's son Alan had already been a director of the business before he got involved.

===A new beginning===

FreshXpress Retail Limited first had 56 stores,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kwiksave.co.uk/docs/KPMG%20Press%20Release%20.pdf KPMG |title=Press release |publisher=Kwik Save |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071006021032/http://www.kwiksave.co.uk/docs/KPMG |archivedate=2007-10-06[/tpl] all of which were formerly Kwik Save stores before the chain went bankrupt. On 6 July 2007, 56 stores stayed open, forming FreshXpress in an £18m deal, saving around 600 jobs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/07/07/600-kwik-jobs-safe-89520-19420191/ |title=600 Kwik Jobs Safe |publisher=The Mirror |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2008-07-08[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6279474.stm |title=Kwik Save shops sold in £18m deal |accessdate=2007-07-06 |date=2007-07-06 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The FreshXpress stores officially opened on 21 July 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tankftp.trafika.co.uk/FreshXpress/docs/freshXpress%20launches.pdf |title=A fresh face on your doorstep |publisher=FreshXpress |accessdate= 2008-03-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928200952/http://tankftp.trafika.co.uk/FreshXpress/docs/freshXpress%20launches.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28[/tpl] Prodo and The Think Tank assisted with the creation of the new brand.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prodo.com/case-studies/freshxpress.php |title=FreshXpress Case Study |publisher=Prodo.com |accessdate= 2008-03-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070918142320/http://www.prodo.com/case-studies/freshxpress.php |archivedate=2007-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thinktank.org.uk/casestudies/freshxpress_supermarkets.htm |title=FreshXpress Case Study |publisher=The Think Tank |accessdate=2008-07-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616141844/http%3A//www.thinktank.org.uk/casestudies/freshxpress_supermarkets.htm |archivedate = June 16, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In the middle of September 2007, due to poor trading results this portfolio of stores was reduced from 56 to just 23 better performing stores,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tankftp.trafika.co.uk/FreshXpress/store_list.htm |title=Store list |publisher=FreshXpress |accessdate= 2008-03-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080328112541/http://tankftp.trafika.co.uk/FreshXpress/store_list.htm |archivedate=2008-03-28[/tpl] the closed stores were sold in chunks to Tesco, Sainsbury's, and The Co-op.
Many of the stores were leased from the Somerfield group and are now being leased to other retailers

===Into administration===

Between September 2007 and March 2008 more under performing FreshXpress stores were closed down, leaving just nine stores, and Mr Niklas cut his ties with the company. In March 2008 FreshXpress went into administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usdaw.org.uk/foodretail/news/1206633719_11013.html|title=FreshXpress soon goes stale|publisher=The official website of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/2008/04/01/jobs-to-go-at-teesside-store-84229-20701814/ |title=Jobs to go at Teesside store |publisher=Evening Gazette |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl] On 21 March David Whitehouse of Menzies Corporate Restructuring was appointed joint administrator.
