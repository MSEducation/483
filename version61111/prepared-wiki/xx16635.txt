==Physical description==

It is [tpl]convert|430|km[/tpl] long and drains about [tpl]convert|28,090|km2[/tpl]; at their confluence the Vltava actually has more water than the Elbe and is even much longer, but joins the Elbe at a right angle to its flow so that it appears a mere tributary. The river is crossed by 18 bridges (including the famous Charles Bridge, shown below) as it runs through Prague. It covers [tpl]convert|31|km[/tpl] within the city.Source : Avantgarde Prague  The water from the river was used for drinking. For instance, until 1912 the Vinohrady Water Tower pumped the water directly from the river.Water Tower of Vinohrady, stovezata.praha.eu, retrieved 14 November 2013
Several dams were built on it in the 1950s, the biggest being Lipno Dam in Šumava. In August 2002 a flood of the Vltava killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length.

Latin aqua). In Annales Fuldenses (872 AD) it is called Fuldaha; from 1113 AD it is attested as Wultha. In Chronica Boemorum (1125 AD) it is attested for the first time in its bohemised form as Wlitaua.

The best-known of the classical Czech composer Bedřich Smetana's set of six symphonic poems Má vlast ("My Motherland") is called Vltava (or The Moldau), and is a musical depiction of the river's course through Bohemia.
A minor planet 2123 Vltava discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the river.[tpl]cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | page = 172 | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = http://books.google.com/books?q=2123+Vltava+1973 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | accessdate = 2009-10-09[/tpl]
Smetana's symphonic poem also inspired a song of the same name by Bertolt Brecht.  An English version of it, by John Willett, features the lyrics Deep down in the Moldau the pebbles are shifting/ In Prague three dead emperors moulder away.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?lang=en&id=5159#agg117930 |title=The song of the Moldau  |author= |date=21 August 2012 |website=Anti War Songs |accessdate=25 September 2013[/tpl]
