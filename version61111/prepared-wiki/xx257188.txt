Kessler joined the Harvard Crimson in the autumn of 2006 and appeared in 12 games with 11 starts. As a rookie, she logged eight wins, while earning shutouts against the Princeton Tigers (on Nov. 25 and Jan. 5), and against nationally ranked Minnesota Duluth (Dec. 2). The shutouts that she registered on November 25 and December 2 came in her second and third collegiate games of her career. This was part of a period in which she went 150 minutes without allowing a goal. She would only give up one goal during her first three NCAA contests. On December 8, she made a then career high 33 saves in a tie against nationally ranked New Hampshire. 
During the 2007-08 campaign, Kessler set the NCAA single-season record with 12 shutouts. In addition, she led all NCAA goaltenders with a .952 save percentage (679 of 713) and winning percentage (30-2-0, .938). With Kessler in net, the Crimson set the all-time record for fewest goals allowed in a season. In a January 27, 2008 win versus Dartmouth (a 4-0 shutout), she surpassed Ali Boe for the Crimson single-season shutout record by notching her eighth. Boe set the previous mark with seven shutouts in 2003-04. In the 2008 women’s Beanpot, Kessler blocked 41 of 43 shots during the tournament to win the Joe Bertagna Award. On February 1, Kessler earned her first NCAA assist. In a match against Brown, Kessler assisted on a goal logged by Kathryn Farni. A February 23 victory over Cornell (by a 4-2 tally) gave Kessler her 25th victory of the season. 
Her junior season (2008–09) resulted in her being named to the ECAC Hockey preseason all-league team. Statistically, she ranked first in the ECAC with a 1.55 goals-against average in conference play. In the Beanpot semifinal (from February 3, 2009), she stopped 17 shots against Boston University as the Crimson prevailed. A February 20 win over the St. Lawrence Skating Saints resulted in Kessler’s fourth shutout of the season. During the ECAC Quarterfinals (on February 27 and 28), Kessler logged back-to-back shutouts against Cornell (by tallies of 3-0, 4-0), respectively.
As a senior (2009–10), Kessler was fifth in the NCAA with a .944 save percentage. She would also rank fifth with a 1.39 goals-against average. In the Crimson’s season opening match versus Colgate (contested on October 30, 2009), Kessler registered 29 saves. On November 14, she would set a career high by blocking 37 shots versus Princeton.  
On December 4 and 5, 2010, Kessler had one of the best performances of her NCAA career. She recorded 24 saves against Minnesota on Dec. 4, as the Crimson prevailed by a 1-0 mark. She followed up her performance with 29 saves to guide Harvard to a 0-0 tie the following day. Entering the weekend, Minnesota had not been shut out since the 2006-07 season.Harvard
A December 8 victory versus the Connecticut Huskies (in which the Crimson earned a 2-1 win) resulted in Kessler tying Ali Boe for the Harvard career win record of 63. Win number 64 came on January 16, 2010 in a 21 save effort that resulted in a 5-1 victory over the Colgate Raiders. Her career save percentage of .9414 (1,863 of 1,979 shots) is the all-time best in NCAA history.http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/wice/2009-10/bios/kessler_christina
