Kaji received a measure of international celebrity with his 1999 partly autobiographical mock documentary Ekiben. The Variety review of the film called it: "Consistently inventive, sometimes very funny and finally rather touching"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117915611?refcatid=31|title=Box lunch| publisher=Variety|accessdate=2011-09-24|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=April 16, 2000[/tpl] while AllRovi commented that it was a "funny and oddly poignant film."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/ekiben-v198472?r=allmovie|title=Ekiben|publisher=AllRovi|accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] He was also the executive producer for the Hot Entertainment March 2000 production of screenwriter Toshiyuki Morioka's debut as a director, [tpl]nihongo|Requiem of Darkness|クラヤミノレクイエム|Kurayami no rekuiemu[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://movie.walkerplus.com/mv31613/| title=ＲＥＱＵＩＥＭ　ｏｆ　ＤＡＲＫＮＥＳＳ　クラヤミノレクイエム|publisher=Movie Walker| accessdate=2011-09-24|language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239541/|title=Requiem of Darkness|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/253898/Kurayami-no-Requiem/overview|title=Kurayami no Requiem |publisher=New York Times| accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
In 2008, Kaji made news by being arrested by Tokyo police and charged with indecent exposure in a public place for filming an adult video in public on July 20, 2007. Actress Asahi Miura and five other staff members from Hot Entertainment were also arrested. The filming was being done in the back of a dump truck and police said that although the truck was partially covered, it could be seen into from surrounding buildings in Tokyo's Shibuya district.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/porn-actress-producers-arrested-for-filming-in-rear-of-dump-truck|title=Porn actress, producers arrested for filming in rear of dump truck|publisher=Japan Today| accessdate=2011-09-24|date=June 21, 2008[/tpl]
