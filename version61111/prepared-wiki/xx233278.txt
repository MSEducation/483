The 2008–09 Israel State Cup ([tpl]lang-he|גביע המדינה[/tpl], Gvia HaMedina) was the seventy-sixth season of Israel's nationwide football cup competition and the fifty-fifth after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. It started on September 5, 2008 while the final was held at Ramat Gan Stadium on May 26, 2009. The defending champions and this year's winners, Beitar Jerusalem, should have qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League, but due to licensing difficulties will not participate in any European competition, as explained here. Since cup runners-up Maccabi Haifa already qualified for second qualifying round of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, all three Europa League spots will be awarded to highest placed teams in the league other than Maccabi Haifa and Beitar.
