For TV programs with fantasy, horror, mystery, paranormal, supernatural and other related themes, please see the respective genres and listings.
Science fiction films, one-time presentations, original net animation (ONA), original video animation (OVA), short films (aka shorts), serial films (aka serials) and specials must have been created specifically for or broadcast first ("first showing") on television to qualify for the purpose of this list.
Films that premiered ("first presentation") on the "big screen" (theatrical release) or have been distributed direct-to-video (tape/VHS, laser disc, DVD/HD-DVD/Blu-ray, etc.) or on the internet do not belong here, even if they aired ("second presentation", rerun) at some point on a TV channel.
