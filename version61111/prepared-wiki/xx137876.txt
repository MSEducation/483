South East Essex (in its first incarnation formally the South Eastern division of Essex) was a parliamentary constituency in  Essex in the East of England.  It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The constituency was created for the 1885 general election, and abolished for the 1950 general election.
The constituency was re-established for the 1955 general election, and abolished again for the 1983 general election.

==Boundaries==

South East Essex originally comprised a large area including modern day Thurrock district, Castle Point district, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and the Winstree hundred. However, as the population of the area grew, so did its parliamentary representation.
In 1918, a reformed constituency lost the Winstree hundred and Southend-on-Sea (except Shoeburyness), and gained Billericay.
In 1945, Shoeburyness was handed over to Southend East while Thurrock gained its own representation.
