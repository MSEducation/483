Many condiments are available packaged in single-serving sachets (packets), like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals. Condiments are usually applied by the diner. Condiments are sometimes added prior to serving, for example a sandwich made with ketchup or mustard. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, marmite are examples.
The term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning "spice, seasoning, sauce" and from the Latin condere, meaning "preserve, pickle, season".[tpl]cite web | url=http://hilobrow.com/2010/09/07/de-condimentis-1/ | title=De Condimentis | publisher=HiLobrow | date=7 September 2010 | accessdate=10 February 2014 | author=Nealon, Tom[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/condiment | title=Definition of Condiment | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

==History==

In Ancient Rome, the Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by crushing and fermenting in salt with the meat of various fish, leading to a flourishing condiment industry. Apicius, a cookbook based on 4th and 5th century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.
