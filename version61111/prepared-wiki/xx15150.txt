==History==

===Etymology===

Accounts differ about the origin of the name. One account credits Capt. B.L.E. Bonneville of the U.S. Army as its source. After trekking for weeks through dry and rough terrain, his exploration party reached an overlook with a view of the Boise River Valley. The place where they stood is called Bonneville Point, located on the Oregon Trail east of the city. According to the story, a French-speaking guide, overwhelmed by the sight of the verdant river, yelled "[tpl]lang|fr|Les bois! Les bois![/tpl]" ("The wood! The wood!")—and the name stuck.
The name may instead derive from earlier mountain men, who named the river that flows through it. In the 1820s, French Canadian fur trappers set trap lines in the vicinity. Set in a high-desert area, the tree-lined valley of the Boise River became a distinct landmark. They called this "La rivière boisée", which means "the wooded river."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/reference%20series/0032.pdf|title=IdahoHistory.net|publisher=IdahoHistory.net|date=2010-07-07|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Natives, and those who have lived in the area for a long time, use the pronunciation [tpl]IPA|/ˈbɔɪsiː/[/tpl] (BOY-see). This is the pronunciation given on the city's website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofboise.org/CityGovernment/AboutBoise/|title=About Boise|publisher=Cityofboise.org|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] The pronunciation is sometimes used as a shibboleth by native Boiseans and other longtime residents, as outsiders tend to pronounce the city's name as [tpl]IPA|/ˈbɔɪziː/[/tpl] (BOY-zee).[tpl]cite web|last=O'Mara|first=Maggie|url=http://www.ktvb.com/community/blogs/maggie-omara/65582257.html|title=BLOG: Boise or Boize?

The area was called Boise long before the establishment of Fort Boise. The original Fort Boise was [tpl]convert|40|mi|0[/tpl] west, near Parma, down the Boise River near its confluence with the Snake River at the Oregon border. This defense was erected by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1830s. It was abandoned in the 1850s, but massacres along the Oregon Trail prompted the U.S. Army to re-establish a fort in the area in 1863 during the U.S. Civil War. The new location was selected because it was near the intersection of the Oregon Trail with a major road connecting the Boise Basin (Idaho City) and the Owyhee (Silver City) mining areas, both of which were booming. During the mid-1860s, Idaho City was the largest city in the Northwest, and as a staging area, Fort Boise grew rapidly; Boise was incorporated as a city in 1863. The first capital of the Idaho Territory was Lewiston in northern Idaho, which in 1863 was the largest community, exceeding the populations of Olympia and Seattle, Washington Territory and Portland, Oregon combined. The original territory was larger than Texas. But following the creation of Montana Territory, Boise was made the territorial capital of a much reduced Idaho in a controversial decision which overturned a district court ruling by a one-vote majority in the territorial supreme court along geographic lines in 1866.
Designed by Alfred B. Mullett, the U.S. Assay Office at 210 Main Street was built in 1871 and today is a National Historic Landmark.

==Geography==

Boise is located in southwestern Idaho, about [tpl]convert|41|mi[/tpl] east of the Oregon border, and [tpl]convert|110|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of the Nevada border. The downtown sits at [tpl]convert|2704|ft[/tpl] above sea level.
Most of the metropolitan area lies on a broad, flat plain, descending to the west. Mountains rise to the northeast, stretching from the far southeastern tip of the Boise city limits to nearby Eagle. These mountains are known to locals as the Boise foothills and are sometimes described as the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. About [tpl]convert|34|mi[/tpl] southwest of Boise, and about [tpl]convert|26|mi[/tpl] southwest of Nampa, the Owyhee Mountains lie entirely in neighboring Owyhee County.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|80.05|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|79.36|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.69|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-18[/tpl] The city is drained by the Boise River. The City of Boise is considered part of the Treasure Valley.

===Parts of the city===

Boise occupies a large area — [tpl]convert|64|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] according to the United States Census Bureau. Like all major cities, it is composed of several neighborhoods. These include the Bench, the North End, West Boise and Downtown, among others. In January 2014 the Boise Police Department partnered with the folksonomic neighborhood blogging site Nextdoor, the first city in the Northwest and the 137th city in the U.S. to do so.http://police.cityofboise.org/home/news-releases/2014/01/boise-police-join-nextdoorcom/ Boise Police Department joins Nextdoor]  Since the app, which enables the city's police, fire, and parks departments to post to self-selected, highly localized areas, first became available in October 2011,http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/10/21/2826016/nextdoor-neighbors-app-propels.htm 101 neighborhoods and sections of neighborhoods have joined.http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/01/16/2975542/city-of-boise-gets-neighborly.html

====Downtown Boise====

Downtown Boise is Boise's cultural center and home to many small businesses and a few mid-rises. While downtown Boise lacks a major retail shopping/dining experience like Seattle, Portland, and Spokane the area has a small variety of shops and growing option for dining choices. Centrally, 8th Street contains a pedestrian zone with sidewalk cafes and restaurants. The neighborhood is home to many local restaurants, bars and boutiques and supports a vibrant nightlife. The area contains the Basque Block, which gives visitors a chance to learn and enjoy Boise's Basque heritage. Downtown Boise's main attractions include the Idaho State Capitol, the classic Egyptian Theatre on the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Main Street, the Boise Art Museum[tpl]cite web|url=http://boiseartmuseum.org/|title=Welcome to BAM|publisher=Boiseartmuseum.org|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] on Capitol in front of Julia Davis Park, and Zoo Boise located on the grounds of Julia Davis Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zooboise.org/|title=Home|publisher=Zooboise.org|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]
Boise's economy was threatened in the late 1990s by commercial development at locations away from the downtown center, such as Boise Towne Square Mall and at shopping centers located near new housing developments.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Cultural events in Downtown Boise include Alive after Five,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.downtownboise.org/m_events/dba_alive_after_5.cfm/|title=Downtown Boise Association|publisher=Downtownboise.org|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] First Thursday,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.downtownboise.org/m_events/dba_first_thursday.cfm/|title=Downtown Boise Association|publisher=Downtownboise.org|date=2012-11-01|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] and the Idaho Potato Drop.

====Boise State University====

To the south of downtown Boise is Boise State University and its surrounding environs. The area is dominated by residential neighborhoods and businesses catering to the student population. The unique blue playing field at the 37,000-seat Bronco Stadium on the BSU campus, home to the Boise State Broncos football team, is a major city landmark. Other cultural and sports centers in the area include the Velma V. Morrison Center for the Performing Arts and Taco Bell Arena. Broadway Avenue to the east and south of the BSU campus features many college-themed bars and restaurants.

====The North End====

The North End, generally defined as the part of Boise north of State Street, contains many of the city's older homes. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] It is known for its tree-lined drives such as Harrison Boulevard, and for its quiet neighborhoods near the downtown area. Downtown Boise is visible from Camel's Back Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://parks.cityofboise.org/|title=Boise Parks & Recreation — City of Boise|publisher=Parks.cityofboise.org|date=2012-11-21|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] On 13th Street, Hyde Park[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northend.org/hydepark.htm|title=Northend.org|publisher=Northend.org|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] is home to restaurants and other businesses. The North End also hosts events such as the annual Hyde Park Street Fair. In 2008, the American Planning Association (APA) designated Boise's North End one of 10 Great Neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/|title=Great Places in America|publisher=Planning.org|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]

====Southwest Boise====

Southwest Boise contains sparsely populated neighborhoods built from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Many include acre-sized plots and the occasional farmhouse and pasture. In the 1980s, growth in the area was stunted to prevent urban sprawl. Since this has been lifted, there has been widespread growth of new homes and neighborhoods. The area lies near Interstate 84, theaters, shopping, the airport, golf and the Boise Bench area.

====Northwest Boise====

Northwest Boise lies against the Boise Foothills to the north, State Street to the south, the city of Eagle to the west, and downtown Boise to the east. It contains a mix of old and new neighborhoods, including Lakeharbor, which features the private Silver Lake, a reclaimed quarry. Northwest Boise has some pockets of older homes with a similar aesthetic to the North End. Downtown is minutes away, as is Veteran's Memorial Park[tpl]cite web|url=http://parks.cityofboise.org/|title=Boise Parks & Recreation — City of Boise|publisher=Parks.cityofboise.org|date=2012-11-21|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] and easy access to the Boise Greenbelt. Across the river sits the Boise Bench and to the west are the bedroom communities of Eagle, Star, and Middleton.

====Warm Springs and East End====

Warm Springs is centered on the tree-lined Warm Springs Avenue and contains some of Boise's largest and most expensive homes (many of which were erected by wealthy miners and businessmen around the turn of the 20th century; Victorian styles feature prominently). The area gets its name from the natural hot springs that flow from Boise's fault line and warm many of the homes in the area. The Natotorium public swim center is located here.

====East Boise and Harris Ranch====

The far-east end of Warm Springs was once known as Barber Town, featuring a hotel with hot springs nestled into the foothills. It now has some new residential developments, with easy access to Highway 21, which leads to the south-central Idaho mountains, the Boise River, the Boise Foothills, and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival.

====Southeast Boise====

Southeast Boise spans from Boise State University to Micron Technology – all areas between Federal Way and the Boise River. The older area just south of the University can be described as a cross between the North End and the Boise bench. The rest of Southeast Boise was developed in the last thirty years with suburban-style homes.
Columbia Village subdivision and the older Oregon Trail Heights were the first major planned communities in Southeast Boise with an elementary and middle school all within walking distance from all homes. The subdivision is located at the intersections of Interstate 84, Idaho 21, and Federal Way (former U.S. Highway), which are all major arteries to get anywhere in Boise. The subdivision, a baseball complex, and swimming pools were developed around the Simplot Sports complex. The fields are built over an old landfill and dump, and the fields and gravel parking lot allow radon gases to escape through the ground.
On August 25, 2008 at about 7:00 pm, a fire started near Amity and Holcomb during a major windstorm. It destroyed 10 houses and damaged 9. Boise State University linguistics professor Mary Ellen Ryder lost her life in the fire.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nwcn.com/archive/61465767.html|title=Loose electrical connection blamed for Boise fire|last=Bilbao|first=Ysabel|date=August 15, 2009|work=Northwest Cable News|accessdate=July 18, 2011[/tpl]

====Boise Bench====

The Bench, generally bounded by Federal Way to the east, Cole Road to the west and Garden City to the north, sits on an elevation approximately [tpl]convert|60|ft|m[/tpl] higher than downtown Boise to its northeast. Orchard Street is a major north-south thoroughfare in the neighborhood. The Bench is so named because this sudden rise, giving the appearance of a step, or bench. The Bench (or Benches, there are three actual benches in the Boise Valley) was created as an ancient shoreline to the old river channel. The Bench is home to the Boise Union Pacific Depot and older residential neighborhoods similar to those in the North End. Due south of the Bench is the Boise Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iflyboise.com/|title=Boise Airport|publisher=iFlyBoise|date=|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]

====West Boise====

West Boise is home to Boise Towne Square Mall, the largest in the state, as well as numerous restaurants, strip malls, and residential developments ranging from new subdivisions to apartment complexes. The Ada County jail and Hewlett Packard's printing division are also located here. It is relatively the flattest section of Boise, with sweeping views of the Boise Front. West Boise also borders the city of Meridian, Idaho.
