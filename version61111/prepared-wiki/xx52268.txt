==Plot==

Outside Los Angeles, a semi-truck loaded with electronics is approached by three heavily modified Honda Civics. The occupants of the Civics immobilize the truck driver, hijack the truck and escape.
The next day, undercover L.A.P.D. officer, Brian O'Conner, (Paul Walker) is assigned to find the gang responsible for those crimes. Brian uses his cover job at an aftermarket parts shop to infiltrate the local street racing scene. While visiting a tobacco shop, he flirts with the shop's patron, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), the sister of a street racer, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Dominic's team consists of Jesse (Chad Lindberg), Leon (Johnny Strong), Vincent (Matt Schulze), and his girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). Vince gets in a fight with Brian over Mia, but Dominic breaks it up.
Brian enters a race with his Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX against Dominic with his Mazda RX-7 and wagers pink slips for his car. During the race, Brian gains an advantage while using nitrous, but loses when Dominic uses nitrous, too, and totals his Eclipse's engine. Afterwards, Dominic mocks Brian.
The L.A.P.D. arrives, forcing everyone to flee. Dominic is spotted by the police, but Brian saves him from being arrested, gaining his respect. They venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, Johnny Tran (Rick Yune) and his cousin, Lance Nguyen, who later detonate Brian's car. Afterwards, Dominic informs Brian that he owes him a "ten second car".
Brian brings a totaled Toyota Supra to Dominic's safehouse, where he offers his skills as a driver and a mechanic. As the crew settles to repair the car, Brian starts dating Mia. Brian investigates Hector and Tran, convinced that Tran is responsible for the truck hijackings. After investigating a suspicious purchase from Hector at the parts shop, Brian discovers electronics, similar to the ones stolen, at Tran's property. Brian informs his handlers, and the F.B.I. organizes a raid on Tran. However, the electronics on Tran's property were legally bought; it now seems that Dominic and his friends are the true culprit.
Dominic invites Brian to a street racing event, Race Wars and says that they'll talk once Brian has proven his worth there. At the race, Jesse loses his father's Volkswagen Jetta to Tran, fleeing after the loss. Tran confronts Dominic, demanding that he must retrieve the car for him. It is then revealed that Dominic and his friends are responsible behind the truck hijackings. To absolve Jesse's debt, Dominic and his friends decided to commit another hijacking the next day.
When Mia divulges the crew's plan to Brian, they rush over to stop them as Brian is aware that the trucks will be heavily defended. Vince is injured by the truck driver's shotgun, but the team retrieves him. Brian blows his cover when he telephones for an ambulance as a police officer. The revelation enrages Dominic, but he contains himself and flees with the rest of the crew as the medivac arrives.
Brian heads over to Dominic's house to arrest him, but Jesse arrives and pleads for Dominic's help to protect him from Tran. Moments later, Jesse is killed in a drive-by shooting by Lance and Tran, prompting Dominic and Brian to pursue them, which results in Dominic injuring Lance and Brian fatally killing Tran. Brian and Dominic then engage in an impromptu street race, narrowly avoiding a train. Dominic is then injured after his car clips a truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian gives him the keys to his own car, making good on his earlier wager to deliver a "ten second car" and Dominic is able to escape the police.
In the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through Baja, Mexico.

==Production==

===Development and filming===

Director Rob Cohen was inspired to make this film after reading a Vibe magazine article about street racing in New York City and watching an actual illegal street race at night in Los Angeles.Interview found on the original DVD release The plot is essentially the same as that of the 1991 film Point Break, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. The film title rights (but not the story rights) of the 1955 film The Fast and the Furious were purchased so that the title could be used on this project, another film about racing.
The film was shot in various locations within Los Angeles and parts of southern California. Key locations included Dodger Stadium (on the opening scene where Brian tests his Eclipse on the parking lot), Angelino Heights, Silver Lake and Echo Park (the neighborhoods around Toretto's home), as well as Little Saigon (where Tran destroys the Eclipse) and the San Bernardino International Airport (the venue for Race Wars, which attracted over 1,500 import car owners and enthusiasts).Cinema.com - The Fast and the Furious Production Notes The entire last rig heist scene was filmed along Domenigoni Parkway on the southern side of San Jacinto/Hemet in the San Jacinto Valley near Diamond Valley Lake.
Prior to filming, both Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez did not have driver's licenses, so they took driving lessons during production. For the climactic race scene between Brian and Toretto, separate shots of both cars crossing the railroad and the train crossing the street were filmed, then composited together to give the illusion of the train narrowly missing the cars. A long steel rod was used as a ramp for Toretto's car to crash through the semi-truck and fly in mid-air.

===Music===

The film's score was composed by music producer BT, mixing electronica with hip-hop and industrial influences. Two soundtracks were released for the film. The first one features mostly hip-hop and rap music. The second one, titled More Fast and Furious: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture The Fast and the Furious, features alternative metal, post-grunge and nu metal songs, as well as select tracks from BT's score.
