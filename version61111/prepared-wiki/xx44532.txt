[[Fortnight]]

CATEGORIES: Units of time

A fortnight is a unit of time equal to 14 days (2 weeks).  The word derives from the [tpl]lang-ang|fēowertyne niht[/tpl], meaning "[tpl]transl|ang|fourteen nights[/tpl]".The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 5th Edition, 1964, p. 480Senight, sennight or se'night (seven-night), an old word for the week, was still in use in the early 19th century, to judge from Jane Austen's letters. Fortnight and fortnightly are commonly used words in the English-speaking world, where many wages and salaries and most social security benefits are paid on a fortnightly basis,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_dsp.htm |title=Australian Government - How much Disability Support Pension do I get? |accessdate=2008-05-22 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080416024130/http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/pay_how_dsp.htm  |archivedate = 2008-04-16[/tpl] except North America, where it is rare outside of some Canadian regions and insular traditional communities (e.g. Amish) in the United States. American and Canadian payroll systems may use the term biweekly in reference to pay periods every two weeks. Neither term should be confused with semimonthly (in one year there are 26 fortnightly or biweekly versus 24 semimonthly pay periods).

==In other languages==

In many languages, there is no single word for a two-week period and the equivalents of "two weeks", "14 days" or (counting inclusively) "15 days" have to be used. Among the romance languages, there are the terms quincena (or quince días) in Spanish and Galician, quinzena (Portuguese and Catalan),  quindicina (Italian),and quinzaine (French), all meaning "15 days"; Italian also has the word "bisettimanale", literally meaning biweekly. Similarly, in Greek, the term δεκαπενθήμερο (dekapenthímero), meaning "15 days", is also used. In Hebrew, the single-word (shvu′ayim) שבועיים means exactly "two weeks". In Arabic, a similar single-word is used (osbu′ayn) أسبوعين, also meaning "two weeks". ( The Hindu calendar uses the Sanskrit word "paksha" to mean one half of a lunar month, which is between 14 and 15 solar days. In Welsh, the term pythefnos, meaning "15 nights", is used instead. This is in keeping with the Welsh term for a week, which is wythnos ("eight nights"). In Irish, the term coicís and in Czech the terms čtrnáctidenní and dvoutýdenní have the same meaning as fortnight.
