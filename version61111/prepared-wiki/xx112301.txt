==Production==

The film is an unofficial follow up to Storm Boy with the same writer and star, also adapted from a Colin Thiele novel. The South Australian Film Corporation (SAFC) did not want to use Henri Safran as director, though, so employed another director from the ABC, Carl Schultz.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p271-272
The film was shot near Streaky Bay in mid 1978. It was a difficult production and editor Rod Adamson claimed the film would not cut together. Five weeks after filming had completed, Schultz had to leave the film to take up a directing job at the ABC. Accordingly, Matt Carroll of the SAFC called in Bruce Beresford, who was under contract to them, to re-shoot some sequences. Some of these had to be done using a body double for Hardy Kruger since he had returned to Europe. Schultz was supportive of Beresford stepping in but was unhappy with the fact he supervised the final re-cut.Peter Beilby & Rod Bishop, "Carl Schultz", Cinema Papers, Jan-Feb 1979 p242
