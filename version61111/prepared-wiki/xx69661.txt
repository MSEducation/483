The Korean people are an ethnic group originating in the Korean peninsula and Manchuria.http://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&pg=PA6&dq=korean+origin+manchuria&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yuZdUan1PMLE4APmkoDQDw&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=korean%20origin%20manchuria&f=false

==Etymology==

South Koreans call themselves Hanguk-in (Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|한국인[/tpl]; Hanja: [tpl]lang|ko|韓國人[/tpl]), or simply Han-in (Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|한인[/tpl]; Hanja: [tpl]lang|ko|韓人[/tpl]; literally "great people"), or they refer themselves as Hanguk-saram (Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|한국 사람[/tpl]).
North Koreans call themselves Chosŏn-in (Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|조선인[/tpl]) or Chosŏn-saram (Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|조선 사람[/tpl]).
Ethnic Koreans living in Central Asia refer to themselves Koryo-saram (Korean: 고려 사람; Cyrillic: Корё сарам).

==Origins==

===Linguistic and archaeological studies===

Koreans are the descendants of the peoples of Korean Peninsula, often said to be Altaic-[ref]
</ref><ref>
[/ref] or proto-Altaic-speaking tribes. Archaeological evidence suggests proto-Koreans were migrants from south-central SiberiaThe Rise of Civilization in East Asia: the Archaeology of China, Korea and Japan, pp. 165 who populated ancient Korea in successive waves from the Neolithic age to the Bronze Age.?? ?? ???, ?? ?? ???: ???, ??, pp. 44–45 The same tomb style is an indication telling who lived there. The largest concentration of dolmen in the world is found on the Korean peninsula. In fact, with an estimated 35,000 dolmen Korea counts for nearly 70% of the world's total. Similar dolmens can be found outside of Korea, in Manchuria, Shandong Peninsula, and Kyushu, yet it is unclear why this culture only flourished so extensively on the Korean peninsula compared to the area of Northeastern Asia.
Although Koreans are claimed to have come directly from the Central Asia area of Lake Baikal and straight to Manchuria without any movement into the heart of present-day China. However, in regards to language, although the origins of the Korean people may lie in the present day Mongolia many millennia ago, the Korean language is widely believed to be a language isolate, having formed its own distinct means of communication as a result of established presence in the region and cultivation of expression through living as a settled civilization unlike the neighboring nomadic tribes in northern Manchuria. http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1943.html

===Genetic studies===

Studies of polymorphisms in the human Y-chromosome have so far produced evidence to suggest that the Korean people have a long history as a distinct, mostly endogamous ethnic group, with successive waves of people moving to the peninsula and three major Y-chromosome haplogroups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p604310l152202g4/ |title=International Journal of Legal Medicine, Volume 124, Number 6 |publisher=SpringerLink |accessdate=4 May 2012[/tpl]

====Y-DNA haplogroups====

Korean males display a high frequency of Haplogroup O2b* (P49), a subclade of possibly Manchurian origin,  and O3 (M122), a common Y-DNA haplogroup among East Asians in general.Hong Shi, Yong-li Dong, Bo Wen et al., "Y-Chromosome Evidence of Southern Origin of the East Asian–Specific Haplogroup O3-M122," Am.

====mtDNA haplogroups====

Studies of Korean mtDNA lineages have shown that there is a high frequency of Haplogroup D4, ranging from approximately 23% (11/48) among ethnic Koreans in Arun Banner, Inner MongoliaQing-Peng Kong, Yong-Gang Yao, Mu Liu et al., "Mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphisms of five ethnic populations from northern China," Hum Genet (2003) 113 : 391–405. [tpl]doi|10.1007/s00439-003-1004-7[/tpl] to approximately 32% (33/103) among Koreans from South Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004210 |title=Han-Jun Jin, Chris Tyler-Smith and Wook Kim, "The Peopling of Korea Revealed by Analyses of Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosomal Markers," PLoS ONE (2009) |publisher=Plosone.org |accessdate=4 May 2012[/tpl]Miroslava Derenko, Boris Malyarchuk, Tomasz Grzybowski et al., "Phylogeographic Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA in Northern Asian Populations," Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007;81:1025–1041. DOI: 10.1086/522933 Haplogroup D4 is the modal mtDNA haplogroup among Koreans and among Northeast Asians in general. Haplogroup B, which occurs very frequently in many populations of Southeast Asia, Polynesia, and the Americas, is found in approximately 10% (5/48 ethnic Koreans from Arun Banner, Inner Mongolia) to 20% (21/103 Koreans from South Korea) of Koreans. Haplogroup A has been detected in approximately 7% (7/103 Koreans from South Korea) to 15% (7/48 ethnic Koreans from Arun Banner, Inner Mongolia) of Koreans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004210 |title=Han-Jun Jin, Chris Tyler-Smith and Wook Kim, "The Peopling of Korea Revealed by Analyses of Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosomal Markers" PLoS ONE (2009) |publisher=Plosone.org |accessdate=4 May 2012[/tpl] Haplogroup A is the most common mtDNA haplogroup among the Chukchi, Eskimo, Na-Dene, and many Amerind ethnic groups of North and Central America.
The other half of the Korean mtDNA pool consists of an assortment of various haplogroups, each found with relatively low frequency, such as G, N9, F, D5, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, R11, C, and Z.

====Autosomal studies====

A 2011 SNP consortium study done by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Max Planck Society consisting of 1719 dna samples determined that South Koreans and Japanese clustered together but only showed slight overlap with the Chinese, confirming the findings of an earlier study that Japanese and Koreans are closely related.http://www.plosone.org/article/authors/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029502

==Culture==

North Korea and South Korea share a common heritage, but the political division since 1945 has resulted in some divergence of modern culture.

==Language==

The language of the Korean people is the Korean language, which uses Hangul as its main writing system. There are more than 78 million speakers of the Korean language worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kor |title= Korean |work=ethnologue |accessdate=2013-01-01[/tpl]

==North Korean data==

Estimating the size, growth rate, sex ratio, and age structure of North Korea's population has been extremely difficult. Until release of official data in 1989, the 1963 edition of the North Korea Central Yearbook was the last official publication to disclose population figures. After 1963 demographers used varying methods to estimate the population. They either totaled the number of delegates elected to the Supreme People's Assembly (each delegate representing 50,000 people before 1962 and 30,000 people afterward) or relied on official statements that a certain number of persons, or percentage of the population, was engaged in a particular activity. Thus, on the basis of remarks made by President Kim Il Sung in 1977 concerning school attendance, the population that year was calculated at 17.2 million persons. During the 1980s, health statistics, including life expectancy and causes of mortality, were gradually made available to the outside world.
In 1989 the Central Statistics Bureau released demographic data to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) in order to secure the UNFPA's assistance in holding North Korea's first nationwide census since the establishment of the state in 1948. Although the figures given to the United Nations might have been distorted, it appears that in line with other attempts to open itself to the outside world, the North Korean regime has also opened somewhat in the demographic realm. Although the country lacks trained demographers, accurate data on household registration, migration, and births and deaths are available to North Korean authorities. According to the United States scholar Nicholas Eberstadt and demographer Brian Ko, vital statistics and personal information on residents are kept by agencies on the ri ("village", the local administrative unit) level in rural areas and the dong ("district" or "block") level in urban areas.

==Korean diaspora==

Large-scale emigration from Korea began as early as the mid-1860s, mainly into the Russian Far East and Northeast China or what was historically known as Manchuria; these populations would later grow to nearly three million Koreans in China and several hundred thousand Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans in Central Asia).[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Overseas Koreans|author=Lee Kwang-kyu|publisher=Jimoondang|location=Seoul|year=2000|isbn=89-88095-18-9[/tpl]

The Los Angeles and New York City metropolitan areas in the United States contain the largest populations of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea or China. Significant Korean populations are present in China, Japan, and Canada as well.  There are also Korean communities in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. During the 1990s and 2000s, the number of Koreans in the Philippines and Koreans in Vietnam have also grown significantly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2006/0918/028.html|title=Ho Chi Minh Money Trail|last=Kelly|first=Tim|date=18 September 2006|accessdate=27 March 2007|work=Forbes[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200512/kt2005121517211054280.htm|publisher=The Korea Times|date=15 December 2005|accessdate=16 February 2007|title="Korean Wave" in Philippines|last=Meinardus|first=Ronaldo[/tpl] Koreans in the United Kingdom now form Western Europe's largest Korean community, albeit still relatively small; Koreans in Germany used to outnumber those in the UK until the late 1990s. In Australia the Korean Australian community comprise a modest minority. Koreans have migrated significantly since the 1960s. Now they form an integral part in society especially in Business, Education and Cultural areas.
The Korean population in the United States is a small share of the US economy, but it has a disproportionately favorable impact. Korean Americans have a savings rate double that of the average American and also graduate from college at a rate double that of the average American, providing a highly skilled and educated addition to the U.S. workforce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2000 data, mean household earnings for Koreans in the U.S. were $59,981, approximately 5.1% higher than the U.S. average of $56,604.[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF4_U_QTP33&-reg=DEC_2000_SF4_U_QTP33:001%7C023&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF4_U&-_lang=en&-format=&-CONTEXT=qt |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=4 May 2012[/tpl]
