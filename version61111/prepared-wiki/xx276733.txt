Young Street Bridge is a bridge in North Aberdeen, Washington. The bridge covers a brief span along the Wishkah River and carries a north or south bound thoroughfare connecting the City of Aberdeen with the North Aberdeen neighborhood and other outlying communities.
Most notably, the bridge has been the subject of numerous accounts regarding the bridge as a once temporary home for Kurt Cobain. The location is also hinted toward in the lyrics of the song "Something In The Way".
In April 2011, the City of Aberdeen commissioned a 13Â ft tall electric guitar statue near the Young Street Bridge in honor of the musician's career.
