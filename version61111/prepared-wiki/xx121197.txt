==Main sights==

The main attraction of Bitetto is the Cathedral, one of the main examples of Apulian Romanesque architecture, built in 1335. It has a sober fa√ßade divided by false columns with a big rose window. Of the three portals, the central one has a rich series of sculptures: two stone lions supporting columns with carved capitals showing vegetable motifs; these in turn support is a lunette with basreliefs of Christ and the twelve apostles. The frame has instead scenes from the New Testament. The interior was plastered in the 18th century, but was restored to the original Romanesque style in 1959. It has a nave and two aisles; the transept has three apses.
