The term "Hyatt 10" refers to a group of seven secretaries of the Cabinet and three heads of government agencies in the Philippines who resigned their posts on July 8, 2005 as a result of the Hello Garci scandal, which allegedly implicated then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in rigging the 2004 general election in her favor.[tpl]cite news | title=How 'Hyatt 10' was formed | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090709-214576/How-Hyatt-10-was-formed | work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=July 9, 2009 | accessdate=September 24, 2011 [/tpl]
The name "Hyatt 10" was coined because the press conference where the concerned officials announced their resignation was held at the then-Hyatt Regency Hotel (now Midas Hotel) in Pasay City.  The group continues to be influential in Philippine politics, with several members having joined the government of President Benigno Aquino III, Arroyo's successor.

There were originally ten members of the Hyatt 10:
It is believed however that there are more than ten members in the Hyatt 10: Soliman once claimed in 2006 that not only was the Hyatt 10 "intact", but that the group included "more than 200 other persons who had filed or signed impeachment complaints against Ms. Arroyo".[tpl]cite news | title=Palace: Hyatt 10 still 10?; Dinky: More than 10 | author=Cabacungan Jr., Gil C. | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20060709-8816/Palace%3A_Hyatt_10_still_10%3F_Dinky%3A_More_than_10 | work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=July 9, 2006 | accessdate=September 24, 2011 [/tpl]
Several members of the Hyatt 10 have since returned to government service under the administration of President Benigno Aquino III, appointed because he believed it would be "liberating" for them to do what they wanted to do in their respective offices, which he claimed they could not do under the previous administration.[tpl]cite news | title=Aquino names Cabinet: Old, new faces in official family | author=Cabacungan Jr., Gil C. | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100630-278319/Aquino-names-Cabinet | work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=June 30, 2010 | accessdate=September 24, 2011 [/tpl]  Corazon Soliman, Cesar Purisima and Teresita Deles have since been reappointed to the posts they occupied before resigning in 2005.
