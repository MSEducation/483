===Skiing===

Sankt Anton is part of the Arlberg area of ski resorts — a region that includes 94 cable cars and ski lifts, [tpl]convert|340|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of groomed pistes and [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of deep-snow runs, all of which are covered under one liftpass.
On the western edge of village is the "Galzigbahn" which has been replaced by a Funitel gondola. The new gondola includes a first-ever "Ferris wheel": enabling passengers to board the gondolas on ground level, then rotating the gondolas up to the main high-speed cables. The Funitel accesses the Galzig slopes and connects to Schindler and Valluga peaks. On the eastern edge of town, the Nassereinbahn rises to the Nasserein area with connections to the Kapall peak. The Kapall, Valluga, and Schindler peaks provide skiers with close to 1,500 vertical metres skiing ([tpl]convert|1500|m|ft|-1|disp=out[/tpl]). Slope-side après-ski bars can be found on the Steissbachtal trail just above Sankt Anton.
The groomed runs in the region cater to all levels; 43% are for beginners (blue), 41% for intermediate skiers (red) and 16% are for the more advanced (black). There are also [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of deep snow runs in the area.
Expert terrain includes less-frequently groomed ski routes such as Schindlerkar and Mattun, and the backside of Valluga ([tpl]convert|2,811|m|ft|0|disp=or[/tpl]) down to Zürs, which is for experts only if accompanied by a guide. There are also a large number of off-piste routes in the area that experts can explore with the help of a guide.
Other ski areas are St. Christoph, a hamlet where in the 14th century the shepherd Heinrich Findelkind built a hospice as a shelter for travellers crossing the Arlberg pass to the Vorarlberg province, Stuben, Lech, Zürs, Warth-Schröcken and Klösterle/Sonnenkopf.

==In popular culture==

The resort was featured extensively in the 2011 film Chalet Girl, a romantic comedy starring Felicity Jones, Ed Westwick and Bill Nighy. The resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany was also used for some interior shots.
Sankt Anton was shown in the 1969 film Downhill Racer, starring Robert Redford and Gene Hackman.
Sankt Anton was also the setting for the film "[tpl]lang|de|Der Weisse Rausch|nocat=true[/tpl]", starring Leni Riefenstahl and local ski instructor Hannes Schneider. Made in 1931, the comedy film was a fictional account of the skiing exploits of a young village girl, played by Riefenstahl, and her attempts to master the sport of skiing and ski-jumping aided by the local ski expert Hannes Schneider. The film was one of the first to use and develop outdoor film-making techniques and featured several innovative action-skiing scenes. Riefenstahl went on to make nazi propaganda films and, post-war, subsequently lived in Africa where she continued film-making, but now of life in the African bush. She survived two fatal crashes, a helicopter and a road accident, in the process. Hannes Schneider, post-war, became the world-famous ski instructor of the downhill skiing method known as the "Arlberg technique".
