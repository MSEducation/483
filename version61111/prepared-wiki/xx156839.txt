The Journal for Healthcare Quality is a bimonthly peer-reviewed healthcare journal published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the National Association for Healthcare Quality.

==History==

The journal was preceded by View and Review, which was renamed in 1979 to Journal of Quality Assurance, the official journal for the National Association of Quality Assurance Professionals, whose executive director, David Stumph, was the editor-in-chief. While a few articles appeared in this journal, most of the content consisted of organizational news stories, making it more of a news magazine than an academic journal. In 1991, the journal obtained its current title, when the association changed its name to National Association for Healthcare Quality.
By 1993, the journal began offering opportunities for members to seek out additional certification in healthcare quality by offering continuing education credits. By reading articles in the journal and completing a quiz, members earn credits to earn their CPHQ degree. In 2001, the journal was awarded the ASAE Gold Circle Certificate of Achievement for a peer-reviewed journal.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The following year, it received an APEX Award of Excellence.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
