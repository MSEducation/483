Henry H. Crocker (January 20, 1839 – January 1, 1913) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War. He received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Battle of Cedar Creek fought near Middletown, Virginia on October 19, 1864. The battle was the decisive engagement of Major General Philip Sheridan’s Valley Campaigns of 1864 and was the largest battle fought in the Shenandoah Valley.
When the war broke out Crocker was living in San Francisco, California. He joined one hundred other pro-Union California men who returned east to fight. The so-called “California Hundred” were organized as a cavalry troop and sent via ship to Camp Meigs in Massachusetts. There they were designated Company A and joined by seven cavalry companies from Massachusetts to form the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. Crocker eventually became captain of Company F, and mustered out in July 1865. NJ Medal of Honor recipients
