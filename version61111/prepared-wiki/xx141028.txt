[[Sergem]]

CATEGORIES: Dairy products, Tibetan cuisine

Sergem is a Tibetan food made from milk once the butter from the milk is extracted. It is then put in a vessel and heated and when it is about to boil, sour liquid call "chakeu" is add and this leads to the separation of sergem from that milk. One can also prepare a soup out of sergem, add sergem to an achaar, or eat it with momo.
