==="Par condicio"===

Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called  'Par Condicio' , Latin for 'equal treatment' or 'Fairness Doctrine')—which has been since often disproved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/02/15/le-trappole-della-par-condicio.html|title=Le trappole della par condicio|publisher=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=2006-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/05/09/il-bavaglio-del-polo-alla-rai.html|title=Il Bavaglio Del Polo Alla Rai|publisher=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=2002-05-09[/tpl]
On June 24, 2009, during the Confindustria young members congress in Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, Silvio Berlusconi invited advertisers to interrupt or boycott advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, in particular the newspaper la Repubblica and the news-magazine L'espresso, calling the publishing group "shameless"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSLO59656320090624|title=L'Espresso calls in lawyers on Berlusconi remarks|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2009-06-25[/tpl] for fueling the economic crisis by bringing attention to it. He also accused them of making a "subversive attack" against him. The publishing group announced possible legal proceedings against Berlusconi to protect the image and the interests of the group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-06-24_124359124.html|title=Espresso group to sue Berlusconi|publisher=ANSA|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2009-06-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In October 2009, Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Jean-François Julliard declared that Berlusconi "is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom", which would be a first for a European leader. In the event, Berlusconi was not declared a Predator of Press Freedom, but RWB continued to warn of "the continuing concentration of media ownership, displays of contempt and impatience on the part of government officials towards journalists and their work" in Italy."Press Freedom Index 2010", Reporters Without Borders, 2010 Julliard added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB press freedom index.[tpl]cite web | title=Reporters Without Borders in Rome as Berlusconi gets closer to being declared a "Predator" | url=http://en.rsf.org/italy-reporters-without-borders-in-rome-02-10-2009,34640.html | work= | publisher=Reporters Without Borders | date= | accessdate=2009-10-03[/tpl] Italy was in fact ranked last in the EU in RWB's "Press Freedom Index 2010".

Italy is listed as engaged in selective Internet filtering in the social area and no evidence of filtering was found in the political, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative in December 2010."ONI Country Profile: Italy", OpenNet Initiative, 15 December 2010

===Censorship of Wikipedia===

On October 4, 2011, following a decision adopted by the community, the contents of the Italian version of Wikipedia were hidden and the website was blocked by its administrators, as a protest against paragraph 29 of the "DDL intercettazioni" (Wiretapping Bill).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stampati/pdf/16PDL0038530.pdf |title=Camera dei Deputati: disegno di legge N. 1415-B |language=Italian |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |publisher=Camera dei Deputati[/tpl] (English translation) The proposed bill would empower anyone who believes themselves to have been offended by the content of a web site to enforce publication of a reply, uneditable and uncommented, on the same web site, within 48 hours and without any prior evaluation of the claim by a judge or to face a €12,000 fine. Some see it as an attempt by government to censor bloggers."Wikipedia Shuts Down Italian Site In Response To Berlusconi's New Wiretap Act", Adam Taylor, Business Insider, October 4, 2011
On October 4, 5, and 6, all pages on the Italian version of Wikipedia redirected to a statement opposing the proposed legislation. The statement is available in a number of languages, wiki-linked above [tpl]'[/tpl]Cara lettrice, caro lettore[tpl]'[/tpl]. On October 7, the Italian Wikipedia pages were again available, but a notice about the proposed legislation was still displayed at the top of pages.
