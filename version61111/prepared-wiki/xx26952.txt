Hasely Joachim Crawford  TC (born August 16, 1950) is a former athlete from Trinidad and Tobago. In 1976, he became his country's first Olympic champion and the first Olympic 100 m champion from a Caribbean country. A stadium was renamed in his honour in 2001.

==Early years==

Crawford was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, one of the eleven children of Lionel and Phyllis Crawford, and began pursuing athletics at the age of 17. He is a six-time Trinidad and Tobago 100 metres champion, and won the 200 metre title in 1976. He debuted internationally in 1970, winning a bronze medal in the 100 metres at the Commonwealth Games. Only two years later, he surprisingly qualified for the 100 metres final of the Olympics in Munich, but pulled his hamstring after 20 metres and failed to finish.

==Athletic career==

Crawford ran for Eastern Michigan University under coach Bob Parks during his college years.
After finishing as the runner up at the 1975 Pan American Games in the 100 metres, Crawford was added to the team of American coach Bob Parks. His new coach prepared him for the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the 1976 Summer Olympics with a strategy of only allowing him to run in a few races during the season. This tactic paid off, as Crawford, in the outside lane 1, narrowly won the 100 metres final in a time of 10.06 seconds, just 0.02 seconds in front of Don Quarrie of Jamaica, winning Trinidad and Tobago's first Olympic gold medal.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlMUOVsrko8 Youtube Video 1976 Olympic 100m He had also qualified for the 200 metres final, but was forced to pull out mid-race after injuring his groin.

This award was changed to the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Crawford went on to compete in a total of four Olympic Games as he also represented T&T at both the Moscow and Los Angeles editions in 1980 and 1984, but was unable to qualify for another final. Crawford's last international medals were a bronze and a silver which he won at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in the 100 metres and the 4x100 metres relay respectively.http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cg.htm In 2000, he was named the Trinidad & Tobago Athlete of the Millennium.
