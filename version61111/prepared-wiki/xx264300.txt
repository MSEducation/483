==State representative==

From 1988-1992, during the administration of Governor Buddy Roemer, Volentine served a single term in the state House of Representatives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/members/h1812-2012.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives|publisher=legis.state.la.us|accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] Volentine was unseated in the general election held on November 16, 1991, by his fellow Democrat Pinkie C. Wilkerson, an African American attorney from Grambling in Lincoln Parish. Volentine's defeat occurred after redistricting and in the same election in which Edwin Washington Edwards returned to the Louisiana governorship for his fourth term in a ringing defeat of the Republican State Representative David Duke. Volentine had led Wilkerson in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in October 1991. He received 6,150 votes (46.9 percent) to Wilkerson’s 4,358 ballots (33.2 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 20 percent of the vote.[tpl]cite web|url= http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/|title=Election  returns, October 19, 1991|publisher=electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=September 27, 2009[/tpl] In the general election, Wilkerson unseated Volentine, 8,590 (51.8 percent) to 7,992 (48.2 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/|title=Election returns, November 16, 1991|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=September 27, 2009[/tpl]

==Sheriff Volentine==

In 1995, as Wilkerson won easy reelection to the legislature, Volentine secured the first of his two terms as Claiborne Parish sheriff. The office is based in the parish seat of Homer. Incumbent James R. "Snap" Oakes (1929-2014) retired, and in a two-candidate race Volentine defeated fellow Democrat Donald Ray "Chic" Ceccarelli (born 1965) of Homer, 3,760 (61.5 percent) to 2,350 votes (38.5 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/|title=1995 Louisiana primary election returns|publisher=electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl] In 1999, Ceccarelli ran again, this time as a "No Party" candidate. Volentine prevailed, 3,619 (69 percent) to 1,487 (28.4 percent). Another 141 ballots went a second "No Party" candidate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/|title=1999 Louisiana primary election returns|publisher=electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl]
In July 2003, the Baton Rouge firm Utopia Entertainment, Inc., sued Claiborne Parish, through Sheriff Volentine, and LaSalle Management Company, under contract to manage the men's division of the parish jail. The company claimed copyright-infringement because inmates and visitors to the Claiborne Parish Detention Center for a $3 fee could purchase pirated copies of recordings by such performers as Eminem, John Tesh, and George Strait. An inmate named Bo Fain was specifically cited for having made the recordings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qnluc0_lja0J:www.privateci.org/louisiana.htm+state+Rep.+Kenneth+Volentine+of+LA&cd=9&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=Claiborne Parish Detention Center: Homer, Louisiana|publisher=private.ci.org|accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl]
In July 2003, Volentine joined another former state representative from the area, Virgil Orr of Ruston, in supporting the unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial contender Randy Ewing of Jackson Parish, a former member of the Louisiana State Senate. The position ultimately went to another Democrat, Kathleen Blanco of Lafayette.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcwd.com/gj/2003/briefs-2003-07-03.html|title=Hundreds Attend Ewing Fundraiser|publisher=kcwd.com, July 3, 2003|accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl]
In 2003, Volentine did not seek a third term as sheriff and was succeeded by Kenneth R. Bailey of Homer (born 1958), runaway victor in the nonpartisan blanket primary held that fall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcwd.com/gj/2003/briefs-2003-10-09.html|title=Susan T.
