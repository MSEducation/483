The ranges vary from low hills to high ridges with many cliffs. The vegetation found in the area is mostly spinifex and mulga with creeklines being surrounded by eucalypts. Mulga scrub and mulla mulla are found in dense scrubland in the northeastern plains with spinifex and sand dunes being found in the western end.[tpl]cite AHD|10830|Cape Range Area|date=2010|accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl]
The park is the home of the rare Pilbara Pebble-Mound Mouse Pseudomys chapmani which is also found in the Millstream-Chichester National Park and the Karlamilyi National Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/action/rodents/rodap5.html|title=Department of Environment - Action Plan for Australian Rodents|year=1995|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl]
The mulgara habitat is a refuge for the critical weight range mammals such as Macrotis lagotis, Dasycercus crassicaudata and Dasyurids.
The standard of management in the park is poor and is only visited occasionally by Department of Environment and Conservation staff from Karratha. The park is baited for wild dogs but suffers damage from feral donkeys and wandering cattle. No fire management is in practice and weed problems are unknown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/science/bio_audit/gascoyne03_p240-251.pdf|title=Gascoyne Subregion Biodiversity values|year=2001|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl]
