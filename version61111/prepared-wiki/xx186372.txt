==History==

Oakleigh was initially part of the Oakleigh Road District in January 1857, which became the Shire of Oakleigh in December 1871. Parts of the Central and South Ridings were severed to create the Oakleigh Borough on 13 March 1891. The remainder was renamed the Shire of Mulgrave in 1897 and went on to become the City of Waverley.
On 16 April 1913, Oakleigh annexed part of the City of Caulfield, and went on to be declared a town on 19 February 1924 and a city on 2 August 1927. It annexed part of the Shire of Mulgrave on 15 December 1949, which became the East Ward, and on 1 October 1959, Oakleigh incorporated small areas of land from all surrounding areas.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=446–447, 521–522[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
On 15 December 1994, the City of Oakleigh was abolished, and, along with the City of Waverley, was merged into the newly created City of Monash. The suburb of Clayton South was transferred to the City of Kingston, to join parts of the former City of Moorabbin.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=9|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl]

===Council chambers===

When the rebuilt Oakleigh Mechanics' Institute was opened in July 1906, the council chambers were relocated there. This building, now known as Oakleigh Hall, is located in Drummond Street. In 1921, the chambers were relocated to a purpose-built facility in Atherton Road, which currently houses the Monash Seminar & Training Centre.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/news/media2006/media55-06.htm|title=Centenary of Oakleigh Mechanics' Institute |accessdate=2008-01-04 |date=2006-09-23 |work= News & Events |publisher=Monash City Council |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112231832/http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/news/media2006/media55-06.htm  |archivedate = 2007-11-12[/tpl]
