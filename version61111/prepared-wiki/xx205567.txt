[[Canada–Netherlands relations]]

CATEGORIES: Bilateral relations of Canada, Bilateral relations of the Netherlands, Canada–Netherlands relations

Canada and the Netherlands have a special relationship resulting from actions during World War II when Canadian forces led the liberation of the Netherlands and hosted the Dutch Royal Family in exile.

==History==

===World War II to present===

Following German Occupation of the Netherlands, the Dutch royal family took refuge in Canada.  Princess Margriet was born in exile while her family lived in Ottawa. The maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital in which Princess Margriet was born was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government, thereby allowing her citizenship to be solely influenced by her mother's Dutch citizenship. To commemorate the birth, the Canadian Parliament flew the Dutch flag over Peace Tower. This is the only time a foreign flag has flown over the Canadian Parliament Building.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/procedure-book-livre/document.aspx?language=e&mode=1&sbdid=1b08a55c-743c-47db-92e0-898d41340504&sbpid=&sbpidx=3 |title=The Parliament Buildings and Grounds |year=2009 |work=House of Commons Procedure and Practice |publisher=Parliament of Canada |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]
During 1945, the First Canadian Army was responsible for liberating the Netherlands, which they did through battles such as the Battle of the Scheldt and the Liberation of Arnhem. The liberation of the Randstad, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, is especially notable because the civilian population there was still suffering from the horrific effects of the Hongerwinter ('Hungerwinter'). It was cut off from food that was available in the rest of the Netherlands. German forces in the Netherlands would finally surrender in Wageningen, on 5 May 1945, but not before some 18,000 Dutch civilians died as a result of starvation and malnutrition (desperate coordinated air drops of food had already been staged by the Royal Canadian Air Force over German-occupied Dutch territory in Operation Manna. Civilians wrote "Thank You Canadians!" on their rooftops in response). Immediately following the surrender, Canadian units were able to move into the Randstad and rapidly distribute desperately needed food supplies, causing many to see the Canadians not only as liberators but as saviours.
In appreciation, the Dutch people sent tens of thousands of tulips (the Dutch national flower) to Ottawa. In the following year, the royal family contributed thousands as well, and a further ten thousand yearly since. The donations became an annual tradition, culminating in the Canadian Tulip Festival.

==State visits==

In May 1967, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands visited Canada.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vWlkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vnwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2881,4686019&dq=canada+netherlands+visit+-germany+-britain&hl=en

==International Cooperation==

Canada and the Netherlands have worked very closely together on many foreign issues. They are both members of the United Nations (and its Specialized Agencies) the World Trade Organization, Interpol, they are both founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. Canada and the Netherlands also work together on such issues as the prohibition and elimination of anti-personnel mines, the control of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, eradicating the worst forms of child labour, the provision of rapid reaction peacekeeping forces to the United Nations (SHIRBRIG) and regional security issues such as Bosnia (SFOR) and Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).

==Recent Military Cooperation==

Both armies were fighting the War in Afghanistan; many times together, in joint operations in the South of the country, although this has not occurred after 2010, when the Netherlands withdrew. Canada began withdrawing its troops in July 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Canada-ends-combat-mission-in-Afghanistan-1456030.php|title=Canada ends combat mission in Afghanistan|last=Reichmann|first=Deb|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer[/tpl] Canada withdrew its combat forces by the end of 2011 and currently maintains a small force dedicated to training the Afghan police and military.

===Afghanistan===

Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan was to help train Afghan National Army and police, facilitate reconstruction, and provide security, but in 2006, with the situation in Kandahar Province turned increasingly violent, and the Canadian Forces have participated in several operations and battles. The Royal Canadian Air Force have a major presence in Afghanistan, including three CC-130 Hercules cargo planes, two CP-140 surveillance planes,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/14w-14e/nr-sp/index-eng.asp?id=8742 |title=405 Sqn Deploys to South West Asia ... | Articles | News & Events – News Room | 14 Wing Greenwood | Air Force | DND/CF |publisher=Airforce.forces.gc.ca |date=5 June 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl] six CH-147 Chinook transport helicopters, six Mil Mi-8 leased for one year from Skylink Aviation, eight CH-146 Griffon utility helicopters and three CU-170 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Netherlands also deployed aircraft as part of the European Participating Air Force (EPAF) in support of ground operations in Afghanistan as well as Dutch naval frigates to police the waters of the Middle East/Indian Ocean. The Netherlands deployed further troops and helicopters to Afghanistan in 2006 as part of a new ISAF security operation in the south of the country.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan BBC Friday, 3 February 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl] Dutch ground and air forces totalled almost 2,000 personnel during 2006, taking part in combat operations alongside British and Canadian forces as part of NATO's ISAF force in the south. The Netherlands announced in December 2007 that it will begin withdrawing its Dutch Armed Forces troops from Afghanistan, mainly in the province of Uruzgan, in July 2010. "I do not have assurances that other countries will be ready to replace Netherlands troops, but I am certain that Dutch troops will leave in 2010", Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said. "I indicated that in writing ... to the NATO secretary general, who has confirmed it."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/19/2122622.htm |title=Netherlands confirms 2010 Afghanistan pullout |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] Last minute negotiations in February 2010 after a further NATO request did not change this stance, and there was a handover of command to the United States and Australia on 1 August 2010, formally ending the Dutch military mission, though a redeployment task force would remain for the rest of the year to complete the return of vehicles and other equipment to the Netherlands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10829837|title=Dutch troops end Afghanistan deployment|publisher=BBC|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=1 August 2010[/tpl]

Over 400,000 people of Dutch origin are permanent residents of Canada and in 1996 (the last census figures available) 124,545 residents of Canada were listed as being born in the Netherlands: 0.4 percent of the Canadian population. The Dutch Language is the 7th most spoken language in Canada.Census Canada 1995 report It is also the third most spoken language in Prince Edward Island[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/map-languages-canada/ |title=See the PEI section |publisher=CBC |location=Canada  |accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl]
Of all immigrant groups in Canada, those who are Dutch-speaking have shown a preference for farming that exceeds all other major groups. The capital and expertise they bring have made a substantial contribution to agriculture in Canada. Most Dutch immigrants settle in Ontario. Ontario has the lion's share of all Dutch immigrant farmers in Canada, with 58%. Alberta and British Columbia have similar proportions: 18% and 14% respectively. The Dutch represent a significant proportion of immigrants in the Atlantic provinces.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
The Dutch are world leaders in greenhouse technologies and many have brought their expertise to Canada. Thirty percent of all immigrant-run green-house operations have Dutch immigrants at the helm in Canada. Just under one-quarter of all immigrant nursery operators are Dutch.
