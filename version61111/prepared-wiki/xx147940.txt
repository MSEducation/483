Lambeth was a parliamentary constituency centred on the Lambeth district now part of south London.  It returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the bloc vote system.

==History==

The constituency was created under the Great Reform Act for the 1832 general election, and abolished by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election.
It was divided into eight single member constituencies of Camberwell North, Camberwell Peckham, Lambeth Brixton, Lambeth Kennington, Lambeth North, Lambeth Norwood, Newington Walworth and Newington West.

==Boundaries==

Under the original proposals for the constituency it would have consisted of a large area of south east London comprising the parishes of Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Newington, Lambeth and Camberwell. The commissioners appointed to fix parliamentary boundaries attempted to equalise each of the new "metropolitan" constituencies of London in terms of the number of voters and of population. For this reason Bermondsey and Rotherhithe were assigned to the neighbouring constituency of Southwark. It was also decided not to include the entirety of the parishes of Camberwell and Lambeth: both were very large parishes running five or six miles south from the Thames. The portions closest to the river were heavily built up, but the southern sections were still rural. Peckham and part of Brixton were therefore excluded from the constituency, instead forming part of the Eastern Division of the parliamentary county of Surrey.[tpl]cite book|title=Parliamentary representation: further return to an address to His Majesty, dated 12 December, 1831; for copies of instructions given by the Secretary of State for the Home department with reference to Parliamentary representation; likewise copies of letters of reports received by the Secretary of state for the Home department in answer to such instructions.|year=1832|location=London|pages=125â€“126|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=RcIRAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA125&ots=C1m05MOxiE&dq=lambeth%20parliamentary%20boundaries&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=lambeth%20parliamentary%20boundaries&f=false|author=Commissioners on Proposed Division of Counties and Boundaries of Boroughs[/tpl]
