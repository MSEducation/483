In [[Orientale Province|Eastern Congo, the prevalence and intensity of rape and other sexual violence is described as the worst in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090801194.html |title=Prevalence of Rape in E.Congo Described as Worst in World |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] A 2010 study found that 22% of men and 30% of women in Eastern Congo reported conflict-related sexual violence.
Since fighting broke out in 1998 tens of thousands of people have been raped in the Democratic Republic of Congo.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/africa_tales_of_rape_in_dr_congo/html/1.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Africa Tales of Rape in  DR Congo |accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl]  It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 surviving rape victims living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today.[tpl]cite web|author=Kira Cochrane |url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/09/women.congo |title=Kira Cochrane talks to filmmaker Lisa F Jackson on her documentary about rape in the Congo |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/lumo/special_ensler.php |title=A Conversation with Eve Ensler: Femicide in the Congo |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] War rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo has frequently been described as a "weapon of war" by commentators. Louise Nzigire, a local social worker, states that "this violence was designed to exterminate the population." Nzigire observes that rape has been a "cheap, simple weapon for all parties in the war, more easily obtainable than bullets or bombs."[tpl]cite web|last=Nolen |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp |title="Not Women Anymore": The Congo's rape survivors face pain, shame and AIDS |publisher=Ms. Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] The rape of men is also common. Men who admit they were raped risk ostracism by their community, and criminal prosecution, because they may be seen as homosexual, which is a crime in 38 African countries.
Despite the peace process launched in 2003, sexual assault by soldiers from armed groups and the national army continues in the eastern provinces of the country. Evidence of war rape emerged when United Nations troops move into areas previously ravaged by war after the peace process started. Gang rape and rape with objects has been reported. The victims of war rape may suffer from incontinence and vaginal fistula as a result of particularly violent rape.Martens, Jackie (24 January 2004). "Congo rape victims seek solace". BBC News. Witness accounts include an instance of a woman who had the barrel of a gun inserted into her vagina, after which the soldier opened fire. Incontinence and vaginal fistula leads to the isolation of war rape victims from her community and access to reconstructive surgery is limited in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
More than 500 rapes were reported in Eastern Congo in August 2010, leading to an apology from Atul Khare that the UN peacekeepers had failed to protect the population from brutalisation.UN has failed Congo mass rape victims, says investigator, The Guardian, 8 September 2010

===Darfur region in Sudan===

An 19 October 2004 UN News Centre article"UNICEF adviser says rape in Darfur, Sudan continues with impunity". 19 October 2004. UN News Centre. titled "UNICEF adviser says rape in Darfur, Sudan continues with impunity" reported:
 
 Armed militias in Sudan’s strife-torn Darfur region are continuing to rape women and girls with impunity, an expert from the United Nations children’s agency said today on her return from a mission to the region. Pamela Shifman, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) adviser on violence and sexual exploitation, said she heard dozens of harrowing accounts of sexual assaults – including numerous reports of gang-rapes – when she visited internally displaced persons (IDPs) at one camp and another settlement in North Darfur last week. "Rape is used as a weapon to terrorize individual women and girls, and also to terrorize their families and to terrorize entire communities," she said in an interview with the UN News Service. "No woman or girl is safe."

In the same article Pamela Shifman was reported to have said that:
 
 every woman or girl she spoke to had either endured sexual assault herself, or knew of someone who had been attacked, particularly when they left the relative safety of their IDP camp or settlement to find firewood.

===Iraq war===

Male prisoners of war may be subject to rape and sexual violence. Sexual violence against male prisoners of war gained wide publicity after graphic photos documented such abuses on male Iraqi prisoners by US guards at Abu Ghraib prison, Iraq.[tpl]cite news|title=1,800 new pictures add to US disgust: Stills shown of women forced to bare breasts|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/13/iraq.usa|author=Glaister, Dan, Julian Borger|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2004|accessdate=13 July 2011|location=London[/tpl] Prisoners were forced to humiliate themselves.

===2011 Libyan civil war===

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, claimed that there is evidence that Gaddafi's troops used rape as a weapon during the Libyan civil war. He also said, "Apparently, he Gaddafi decided to punish, using rape," while witnesses confirmed that the Libyan government also purchased a large number of Viagra-like drugs. The Libyan government, on the other hand, does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13705854 |title=Libya: Gaddafi investigated over use of rape as weapon |publisher=BBC |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

===Rape in contemporary peace operations by UN peacekeepers===

In contemporary conflict zones, international organizations, particularly the United Nations peacekeepers, have been involved in maintaining peace and stability in the area as well as distribute humanitarian aid to the local population. At present there are 16 Peace Operations directed by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The peacekeepers are mainly composed of military personnel (but to a less number also the police) sent by governments of various member-states.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/current.shtml |title=Current peacekeeping operations. United Nations Peacekeeping |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] However, over the course of their involvement in the field, peacekeepers have also been accused and at times found guilty of committing rape and other forms of sexual violence to the local population, in particular to women and children. Among all international staff in the conflict zone, United Nations peacekeepers (handled by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) have been most frequently identified as the perpetrators of rape.Defeis, Elizabeth. “U.N. Peacekeepers and Sexual Abuse and Exploitation: An End to Impunity” 7, no. 2 (2008): 185–212.

====Motivations for rape and sexual abuse by peacekeepers====

Like traditional military ventures, peacekeepers are deployed in highly unstable areas similar to war zones, where there is absence of the rule of law, disintegration of society and great psychological and economic hardships.Anna Shotton, A Strategy to Address Sexual Exploitation by U.N. Peacekeeping Personnel, 39 CORNELL L. REV. 97, 103 (2006). Having an image of wealth and authority, peacekeepers can easily exercise power over the local population, which is often abused.Defeis, 2008, p.191.
Moreover, as members of their respective country’s militaries, peacekeepers also carry with them in the peace operations the “hyper-masculine culture” that encourages sexual exploitation and abuse.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] This claim is supported by the fact that most of the peacekeepers are male. As of November 2003, while there are 81,181 male peacekeeping soldiers, there are only 2,322 female peacekeeping troops; on the other hand, while there are 11,644 male police, only female police are only 1, 273.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/gender.shtml |title=Gender statistics. United Nations Peacekeeping |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] The motivations for rape differ from the traditional perpetrators (government and rebel forces) in that rape is not part of a war strategy that contributes to fulfilling the organization’s mission, but rather more as means to relieve the perpetrators’ sexual urges most often related to the military culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/bosnia-and-herzegovina/un-peacekeepers-and-cultures-violenc |title=UN Peacekeepers and Cultures of Violence |publisher=Cultural Survival |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] Apart from putting the victim under the threat of physical violence, perpetrators induce sexual acts from the victim through payment, and granting or denying humanitarian aid.Novick, Natalie. “When Those Meant to Keep the Peace Commit Sexualized Violence | Women Under Siege Project.” Accessed December 18, 2013

====Cases of rape and sexual abuse in peace operations====

UN peacekeepers’ involvement in rape was found as early as in 1993 during the Bosnian genocide, where peacekeepers were found to regularly visit a Serb-run brothel in Sarajevo that housed Bosniak and Croat women who were forced to become prostitutes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bosniagenocide.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/un-peacekeepers-took-part-in-rapes-during-bosnian-genocide/ |title=UN peacekeepers took part in rapes during Bosnian Genocide | We Remember the Bosnian Genocide, 1992-95.

====Punitive measures====

The most common challenge in reprimanding perpetrators is the significant underreporting of the issue mainly due to three reasons. First, the victims do not report or file complaints due to fears of revenge from the offender(s), denial of aid and the social stigma against rape victims in the victims’ own community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/7420798.stm |title=Special Reports | Peacekeepers 'abusing children' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] Second, UN higher officials previously dismissed such allegations as “boys will be boys”.Profile: Bureaucrat at Large in the Balkans; Yasushi Akashi, Almost Painfully Diplomatic U.N. Envoy, The Independent, April 30, 1994. Third, fellow peacekeepers are accustomed to the “wall of silence” in the spirit of brotherhood characteristic of military culture but also to protect the reputation of their sending government.http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:DS8SVzkECNAJ:english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fat_code%3D382507+OhMyNews+UN+peacekeeping+2006&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us As a consequence, whistleblowers are often stigmatised.[tpl]cite web|author=Please enter your username |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/bosnia-sex-trade-shames-un-1-1381668 |title=Bosnia sex trade shames UN |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2003-02-09 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
However, if there would indeed be reports, the UN instituted the Conduct and Discipline Teams (CDTs) to conduct an investigation referring the allegations for serious offense to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).Secretary-General, Comprehensive Report Prepared Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 59/296 on Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, Including Policy Development, Implementation and Full Justification of Proposed Capacity on Personnel Conduct Issues, 14,delivered to the General Assembly, U.N. Doc. A/60/862 (May 24, 2006) When found guilty, the course of the specific disciplinary action is dependent on the employee status of the offender. UN civilian staff and personnel have functional immunity that can only be waived by the UN Secretary-General. In the case of military personnel, they are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective sending governments.Defeis, 2008, p.192. The usual practice for offending soldiers has been to repatriate the personnel and prosecute her / him in his/her home country. In several cases, punitive measures are imposed such as demotion or dishonorable dismissal. However, very few among guilty personnel have faced criminal charges in their home countries after repatriation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/blog/entry/Survival-sex-how-NGOs-and-peacekeepers-exploit-women-in-war |title=‘Survival sex’: How NGOs and peacekeepers exploit women in war |publisher=Women Under Siege Project |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

==Rape camp==

Rape camp is a descriptive term for a detention facility that is designed for[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] or turns into a place where authorities regularly rape the detainees.

===Notable examples===

==Forced Prostitution and Sexual Slavery in War==

Forced prostitution and sexual slavery are distinct as forms of war rape, as they entail more than the opportunistic rape by soldiers of women captives. Instead, women and girls are forced into sexual slavery, in some cases for prolonged periods. This is defined by the UN as “the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including sexual access through rape or other forms of sexual violence”.http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0811fcbd0b9f6bd58025667300306dea/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument#Ipurp War time forced prostitution takes several forms ranging from individual trafficking by armed forces to the institutionalization of the act of rape by military or civil authorities. The term ‘forced prostitution’ is often used in the press to refer to men and women displaced by war who are forced to engage in prostitution to survive.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=The Independent|last=Hassan |first=Nihal| location=London |year=2007 |title=50,000 Iraqi Refugees forced into prostitution |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/50000-iraqi-refugees-forced-into-prostitution-454424.html [/tpl] However, this is not the sense in which it is in this article.

Furthermore, a brothel system was established in German concentration camps, both for the use of camp personnel, and to reward good behaviour on the part of other inmates. Women were shipped from the Ravensbrück concentration camp to others to serve as prostitutes, with the exception of Auschwitz, which operated an internal brothel.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=Der Speigen| title=Nazi Sex Slaves: New Exhibition Documents Forced Prostitution in Concentration Camps| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/nazi-sex-slaves-new-exhibition-documents-forced-prostitution-in-concentration-camps-a-459704.html [/tpl]

===Japan===

An estimated 200,000 women and girls, mostly Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese and Filipino, were forced to work as prostitutes in Japanese military brothels, known euphemistically as 'comfort stations' during World War II. Some were forcibly abducted from their homes by Japanese troops, whilst other responded to false adverts for work in factories or as nurses, and were then coerced by military authorities work as sexual slaves for Japanese occupying troops.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=The American Historical Review: 102 (2)| last=Mitchell |first=Richard H.| title=The Comfort Women: Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War| page=503[/tpl] Such comfort stations existed in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, then Malaya, Thailand, Burma, New Guinea, Hong Kong, Macau, and French Indochina.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=Reuters| title=FACTBOX-Disputes over Japan's wartime "comfort women" continue| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKSP21646220070305| date=March 5, 2007| accessdate=1 December 2013 [/tpl]

===Bosnia-Herzegovina===

Sexual slavery a prominent form of war rape during the wars in the former Yugoslavia, in the early 1990s. It is estimated that approximately 20,000 Bosnian girls and women suffered rape in 1992 in Bosnia-Herzegovina alone, many of them while held by Serb forces in detention facilities of various types. Some of these facilities were established for the explicit purpose of rape and sexual assault, both to provide sex for Serb soldiers, and for the purposes 'ethnic cleansing' through forced impregnation.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=Politics and Society: 34 (3)| last=Wood |first=Elisabeth Jean| title=Variation in Sexual Violence during War| pages=311–312[/tpl]

===Sierra Leone===

The Sierra Leonean civil war, which lasted from 1991 to 2002, saw many cases of brutal war rape including forced prostitution and sexual slavery. Women and girls were detained for extended periods of time, and were forced to provide sexual services to a particular rebel camp or to an individual rebel.[ref]
