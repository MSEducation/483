==Escape Dutroux==

In April 1998 Marc Dutroux escaped from his guards while being transferred to court without handcuffs by overpowering one of his guards and taking his pistol, but was captured later in Herbeumont by a ranger in the nearby woods. This resulted in the resign of minister of interior Johan Vande Lanotte, minister of justice Stefaan De Clerck and the former police chief.
