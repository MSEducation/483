Louis Trauth Dairy was founded in 1920 by the senior Louis Trauth. It is based in Newport, Kentucky, USA. It began from a [tpl]convert|600|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] plant and competed with 54 other dairies in the Greater Cincinnati area. Today, it has a modern facility covering five city blocks. There have been three multi-million-dollar expansions since 1985 to provide more efficient production and distribution of dairy products. Trauth Dairy was the first dairy in the area to vacuum pasteurize milk, and the first in Cincinnati to introduce tamper-evident packaging for sour cream, cottage cheese and dips. Trauth Dairy is the exclusive manufacturer of Fat Free plus a/B milk.
