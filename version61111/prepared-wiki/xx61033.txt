A pennyweight (abbreviated dwt) is a unit of mass that is equal to 24 grains, [tpl]frac|20[/tpl] of a troy ounce, [tpl]frac|240[/tpl] of a troy pound, approximately 0.054857 avoirdupois ounce [ref]Calculated using the relationships:

In the Middle Ages, a British penny's weight was literally, as well as monetarily, [tpl]frac|20[/tpl] of an ounce and [tpl]frac|240[/tpl] of a pound of sterling silver. At that time, the pound in use was the Tower pound. The medieval English pennyweight was thus equal to 32 Tower grains (also known as wheat grains). When Troy weights replaced Tower weights in 1527, the Troy weights were defined in such a way that the old Tower pound came out to exactly 5400 Troy grains (also known as barleycorns), the Tower pennyweight 22[tpl]frac|2[/tpl] Troy grains (and thus approximately 1.46 grams). After 1527, the English pennyweight was the Troy pennyweight.[tpl]cite book| last = Zupko| first = Ronald Edward| authorlink = Ronald Edward Zupko| title = A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles| publisher = American Philosophical Society| year = 1985| pages = 280â€“84| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0l_k-XMIiQIC&pg=PA283&dq=pennyweight&hl=en&ei=en_ATrmDKNDciQLr7dHAAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pennyweight&f=false| isbn = 978-0-87169-168-2[/tpl]
The Troy pound and the pennyweight lost their official status in the United Kingdom in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878; only the Troy ounce and its decimal subdivisions remained official. The Troy ounce enjoys a specific legal exemption from metrication in the UK.
The pennyweight is the common weight used in the valuation and measurement of precious metals. Jewelers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of precious metals used in fabricating or casting jewellery. Similarly, dentists and dental labs still use the pennyweight as the measure of precious metals in dental crowns and inlays.
The most common abbreviation for pennyweight is dwt; d, for the Roman denarius, was the abbreviation for penny before decimalization of the British monetary system. Alternate abbreviations are pwt and PW.
Although the abbreviations are the same, the pennyweight bears no relation to the actual weight of the penny nail, but to the price for a hundred nails in 15th century England: the larger the nail, the higher the cost per hundred.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | title = Penny | url = http://ed2.oed.com/cgi/display_main/00174661#00174661-mB.V.10 | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | edition = 2nd |format= subscription required | quote = Applied to nails, such adjectives denote the original price (in 15th c.) per hundred; as fivepenny nail, a nail which cost 5d. a hundred, tenpenny nail, a nail costing 10d. a hundred. (These names persisted after the prices fell, as they began to do in some places before 1500, and they were eventually used to designate sizes of nails.)[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=H.

The pennyweight also bears no relation to the weight of current penny coins.  The weight of a US penny (colloquialism for cent) minted after 1982, for example, is 2.5g.
