==Story==

The story begins when a comet crashes to the Earth, raining down a strange green dust in its wake. The space dust is harmless to humans and goes unnoticed, but they failed to notice that flora, fauna and fungi including mushrooms, cacti, and kudzu gained sentience. Also, this strange green dust mutated some of the animals too (such as rabbits, moles, spiders and opossums).  In order to survive, the newly conscious mushroom people soon formed into tribes, and war inevitably followed. The story of The Spore Wars on Wii also chronicles the life of the main character Pax, a lone bolete mushroom who is trying to find his place in mushroom society. As Pax progresses he discovers a lepiota called Pester that plans to take over the world. Pax follows him to a trailer park where Pax battles him and causes him to fall to the floor below them, leaving Pester to be killed by a mutated fungi dog that devours him. Pax returns to the village and says good bye to the mushroom villagers, saying he'll go where ever the wind takes him.

==Tribes==

In the August 2007 issue of Gamepro magazine, four different tribes of mushrooms were revealed. The names and characteristics of all the tribes correspond to the species of real-world mushrooms for which they are named. The tribes are the Bolete, Morel, Amanita, Lepiota, and Shiitake. A short description of each tribe is below.

==Weapons==

The game features weapon construction, as the player finds everyday items that can be converted into weaponry. For example, an axe can be made of a corncob holder attached to a popsicle stick or even a Nintendo DS stylus. These weapons fall into four categories: slashing, bashing, thrusting, and radical. Each weapon category has its strengths in combat; for example, a slashing weapon is excellent when being swarmed by a group of enemies, while the thrusting weapons are useful for eliminating hard-to-reach flying enemies.

==Music==

The theme song for the games and several original tracks were composed and performed by Les Claypool of Primus fame.Les Claypool - News He contributed original tracks to the game's soundtrack, which is a groundbreaking metronome-based system developed by Gl33k, a music and sound design group located in Austin, TX. The songs include "Eye of the Mushroom," "Sidescroll my Heart," and "Opposoumly Dangerous."[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]  Some of these are featured on Claypool's 2009 solo album, Of Fungi and Foe.

==Reception==

Reception to The Spore Wars was fair; it was derided by 1UP and Game Informer, and given a 2 out of 5 on X-Play, but it received praise from Nintendo Power and Official Nintendo Magazine.
Common points of praise have been its graphics, sound and presentation, while its gameplay has been considered too formulaic.
Nintendo Power gave Spore Wars on the Wii an 8/10. Rise of the Fungi on the DS received a 5/10.
N-Europe also gave Spore Wars 8/10, noting its Tim Burton-esque nature and praising the game's atmospheric soundtrack, while commenting the game was however rather short.http://www.n-europe.com/review.php?rid=448
