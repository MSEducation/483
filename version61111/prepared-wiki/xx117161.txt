The Politics of Ecstasy is the second full length album by heavy metal band Nevermore. It was released in 1996. The album is named after Timothy Leary's book of the same name. The first chapter of that book is entitled "The Seven Tongues of God", which is the title of the first song on the album. This album is considered to be Nevermore's most progressive album, while still containing elements that define their sound. There is a spoken word sample from the track "Next in Line" from the Adrian Lyne movie, Jacob's Ladder.
