==Background==

Grande has referred to "Right There" as "sort of a sequel" to her first hit single "The Way" due to the songs' similarities in melody and composition.[tpl]cite web|last=Grande|first=Ariana|title=Grande Tweets about Right There|url=https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/334544570312429569|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl] The singer spoke of the mutual interest she and rapper Big Sean felt in wanting to collaborate but mentioned that it took some time for them to find the right song. She said, "We were talking about a few other songs together but it just never worked out and it never was the right moment and then finally 'Right There' came along. And we were like 'Oh this is it'."[tpl]cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Ariana Grande Taps 'Good Dude' Big Sean For 'The Way' Sequel|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1711378/ariana-grande-big-sean-the-way-sequel.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl]
While the song was originally released as a promotional track available for immediate download with pre-orders of Yours Truly on iTunes, Grande stated in an interview that it evolved into a single on its own: "'Right There' is kind of about to be the next single. I think we're going to do a video for it soon. It's just because of what's naturally happened with 'Right There'. Radio's just sort of started picking it up and fans seem to really be responding to that one."[tpl]cite web|last=Lansky|first=Sam|title=Ariana Grande Explains 5 Things To Know About Her New Album ‘Yours Truly’: Watch|url=http://www.idolator.com/7483385/ariana-grande-explains-5-things-to-know-about-her-new-album-yours-truly-watch|publisher=Idolator|accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl] The song samples "Crush on You" by Lil' Kim.
