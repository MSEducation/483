==Origin==

The strategy and phrase "embrace and extend" were first described outside Microsoft in a 1996 New York Times article entitled "Tomorrow, the World Wide Web! Microsoft, the PC King, Wants to Reign Over the Internet",[tpl]cite news|date=July 16, 1996|author=John Markoff|publisher=New York Times|title=Tomorrow, the World Wide Web!

The phrase "embrace and extend" also appears in a facetious motivational song by Microsoft employee Dean Ballard,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/29/b34841.htm|title=Inside Microsoft (Part 1)|first=Kathy|last=Rebello|date=1996-07-15|accessdate=2006-03-31|publisher=Business Week[/tpl] and in an interview of Steve Ballmer by the New York Times.Steve Lohr, "Preaching from the Ballmer Pulpit". New York Times, Sunday, January 28, 2007. pp. 3-1, 3-8, 3-9.
The variation, "embrace, extend and extinguish", was first introduced in the United States v. Microsoft antitrust trial when the vice president of Intel, Steven McGeady, testified[tpl]cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/msdoj/transcripts/1110a.doc|title=Steven McGeady court testimony|accessdate=2006-03-31[/tpl] (DOC format) that Microsoft vice president Paul Maritz used the phrase in a 1995 meeting with Intel to describe Microsoft's strategy toward Netscape, Java, and the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/msdoj/transcript/summaries2.html|title=United States v.

==The strategy==

The strategy's three phases are:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hr.com/servlets/sfs?&t=/Default/gateway&i=1116423256281&b=1116423256281&application=story&active=no&ParentID=1119278102301&StoryID=1119649742078|title=Embrace, Extend, Extinguish (IT Vendor Strategies)|accessdate=2007-10-14[/tpl]
The U.S. Department of Justice, Microsoft critics, and computer-industry journalists[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Microsoft+messaging+tactics+recall+browser+wars/2009-1023_3-267971.html|title=Microsoft messaging tactics recall browser wars|accessdate=2006-03-31|archiveurl=http://archive.is/GvMd|archivedate=2012-05-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=882/ddj0008q/|title=Embrace, Extend, Extinguish: Three Strikes And You're Out|accessdate=2006-03-31[/tpl] claim that the goal of the strategy is to monopolize a product category. Such a strategy differs from J. Allard's originally proposed strategy of embrace, extend then innovate both in content and phases. Microsoft claims that the original strategy is not anti-competitive, but rather an exercise of its discretion to implement features it believes customers want.[tpl]cite web|url=http://openacademy.mindef.gov.sg/openacademy/Learning%20Resources/Microsoft/words/words_4.htm|title=U.S. v.
