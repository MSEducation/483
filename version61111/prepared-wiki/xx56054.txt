[[In-joke]]

CATEGORIES: In-jokes, Humor research

An in-joke, also known as an inside joke or a private joke, is a joke whose humour is understandable only to members of an ingroup, that is, people who are in a particular social group, occupation, or other community of shared interest. It is an esoteric joke that is humorous only to those who are aware of the circumstances behind it.
In-jokes may exist within a small social clique, such as a group of friends, or extend to an entire profession such as the film or professional wrestling industries, or a particular sporting field or team.  Ethnic or religious groups usually have their own in-jokes.Wales Online: "Are the Welsh Really Funny?", 14 October 2006.  Retrieved 6 September 2012.

==Philosophy==

In-jokes are cryptic allusions to shared common ground that act as triggers; only those who have shared the common ground provide an appropriate response.[tpl]cite book|title=Communication and Group Decision Making|author=Randy Y.

An in-joke works to build community, sometimes at the expense of outsiders. Part of the power of an in-joke is that its audience knows that there are those who do not understand the joke.[tpl]cite book|title=Who Rides the Beast?: Prophetic Rivalry and the Rhetoric of Crisis in the Churches of the Apocalypse|author=Paul Brooks Duff|pages=81|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019513835X[/tpl]
An in-joke can also be used as a subtext, where people in the know may find humour with something not explicitly spoken. They may even apologise for doing so to outsiders, directly or indirectly stating that what they were laughing at was an in-joke.[tpl]cite book|title=Acting Your Dreams: Use Acting Techniques to Interpret Your Dreams|author=Ben Tousey|pages=118â€“119|year=2003|publisher=Ben Tousey|isbn=1-4140-0542-3[/tpl]
