[[Winkler (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Winkler is a small lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located about one crater diameter to the south-southeast of Dun√©r. This feature forms a circular, cup-shaped depression in the surface. A small, relatively fresh crater lies across the eastern rim.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Winkler.
