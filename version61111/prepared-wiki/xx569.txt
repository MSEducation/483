The Cayman Islands are a British dependency and island country. It is a three-island archipelago in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman. Georgetown, the capital of the Cayman Islands is [tpl]convert|438|km|mi|0|lk=in|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Havana, Cuba,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Havana_CU_and_George_Town_CJ.html|title=coordinates and total distance|work=web page |publisher=webcrow |accessdate=23 October 2011 [/tpl] and [tpl]convert|504|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of Kingston, Jamaica,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Kingston_JM_and_George_Town_CJ.html |title=coordinates and total distance|work=web page |publisher=webcrow |accessdate=23 October 2011 [/tpl] and are between Cuba and Central America. Georgetown’s geographic coordinates are 19.300° north, 81.383° west.
The Cayman Islands have a land area of [tpl]convert|264 |km²|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] approximately 1.5 times the size of Washington, D.C. and just [tpl]convert|3|km²|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] larger than Saint Kitts and Nevis.

==Geology==

The islands are located on the Cayman Rise which forms the northern margin of the Cayman Trough. The trough is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern Cuba along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward Costa Rica and resulted from Paleocene to Eocene island arc formation with associated volcanism along an extinct subduction zone.H. Sigurdsson, et al., History of circum-Caribbean explosive volcanism: 40Ar/39Ar dating of tephra layers, Ch. 20 in Volume 165, Proceedings of the Oceanic Drilling Program, 26 May 2000, ISSN 1096-7451  [tpl]doi|10.2973/odp.proc.sr.165.2000[/tpl] The islands are formed of marine limestone and dolostone that was uplifted during the late Miocene epoch.J.E. Davies and M.A. Brunt (1994), "Scientific Studies in the Cayman Islands", in: The Cayman Islands: Natural History and Biogeography, Volume 71, edited by M. A. Brunt. Springer. p. 1. ISBN 9780792324621.

==Climate==

The Cayman Islands have a tropical marine climate, with a wet season of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a dry season during the winter (November to April). Terrain is mostly a low-lying limestone base surrounded by coral reefs.
A major natural hazard is the tropical cyclones that form during the Atlantic hurricane season from July to November.

==Environmental issues==

An important environmental issue is the lack of fresh water resources. Drinking water supplies must be met by rainwater catchment and desalination. Destruction of natural resources by the tourism industry and construction of new homes for investors is becoming a great concern to local citizens.

==Natural resources==

Natural resources include fish and a climate and beaches that foster tourism, which is the islands' major industry. A 2005 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 3.85 percent arable land and no permanent crops.

==Districts==

The territory is subdivided into sixth districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island, Grand Cayman. The sixth, Sister Islands, comprises the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.
The population is concentrated in the three (south-)western districts George Town (capital), West Bay, and Bodden Town. Those have a population density many times higher than all remaining districts.
