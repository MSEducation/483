Iron Savior is a German power metal band that formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/iron-savior-p302825/biography |title=Iron Savior |author=Alex Henderson |work=Allmusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=6 February 2011[/tpl] The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://site.iron-savior.com/band/story/ |title=The whole Iron Savior story |work=Iron Savior |accessdate=25 Juny 2012[/tpl]
Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensrÿche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/biography.php?band_id=226&bandname=Iron+Savior |title=Iron Savior – Biography |work=Metal Storm |accessdate=6 February 2011[/tpl]
Since its inception, Iron Savior has released eight studio albums, two EPs, and two singles. When asked about releasing a live album or a DVD in the future, Piet Sielck responded by showing a disinterest in a live album but shows an interest in a DVD if a good opportunity pops up; ''"it's not like we're so keen about it but never say never." 
Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member.
On February 28, 2014, the band released their newest album titled Rise of the Hero via AFM Records.
