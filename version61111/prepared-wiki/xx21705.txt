A psychic ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|k|ɪ|k[/tpl]; from Ancient Greek ψυχικός psykhikos, "of the mind, mental") is a person who claims to have an ability to perceive information hidden from the normal senses through extrasensory perception (ESP), or who is said by others to have such abilities. The word "psychic" is also used to describe theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use techniques such as prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading to produce the appearance of such abilities. It can also denote an ability of the mind to influence the world physically using psychokinetic powers such as those formerly claimed by Uri Geller.
Psychics appear regularly in fantasy fiction, such as in the novel The Dead Zone by Stephen King. A large industry and network exists whereby psychics provide advice and counsel to clients.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Matthew Nisbet|date=May–June 1998|title=Psychic telephone networks profit on yearning, gullibility|magazine=Skeptical Inquirer|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_/ai_20615402[/tpl] Some famous contemporary psychics include Miss Cleo,[tpl]Cite web|title=FTC Charges "Miss Cleo" with Deceptive Advertising, Billing and Collection Practices|publisher=FTC|date=February 14, 2002|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/02/accessresource.htm[/tpl] John Edward, and Sylvia Browne.

==History==

===Etymology===

The word psychic is derived from the Greek word psychikos ("of the mind" or "mental") and refers in part to the human mind or psyche (ex. "psychic turmoil"). The Greek word also means "soul". In Greek mythology, the maiden Psyche was the deification of the human soul. The word derivation of the Latin psȳchē is from the Greek psȳchḗ, literally, breath, derivative of psȳ́chein, to breathe, blow, hence, live.Henry George Liddell; Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, entry for psyche
French astronomer and spiritualist Camille Flammarion is credited as having first used the word psychic, while it was later introduced to the English language by Edward William Cox in the 1870s.[tpl]Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology|chapter=Psychics|last=Melton|first=J.G.|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8103-9487-2[/tpl]

===Early seers and prophets===

Elaborate systems of divination and fortune-telling date back to ancient times. Perhaps the most widely known system of early civilization fortune-telling was astrology, where practitioners believed the relative positions of celestial bodies could lend insight into people's lives and even predict their future circumstances. Some fortune-tellers were said to be able to make predictions without the use of these elaborate systems (or in conjunction with them), through some sort of direct apprehension or vision of the future. These people were known as seers or prophets, and in later times as clairvoyants (French word meaning "clear sight" or "clear seeing") and psychics.
Seers formed a functionary role in early civilization, often serving as advisors, priests, and judges. A number of examples are included in biblical accounts. The book of 1 Samuel (Chapter 9) illustrates one such functionary task when Samuel is asked to find the donkeys of the future king Saul.1 Samuel Ch. 9 The role of prophet appeared perennially in ancient cultures. In Egypt, the priests of Ra at Memphis acted as  seers. In ancient Assyria seers were referred to as nabu, meaning "to call" or "announce".
The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC.Morgan 1990, p. 148. It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice.[ref]
One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503 – 1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies,[tpl]Cite book|title=Présages de Nostradamus|last=Chevignard|first=Bernard|year=1999[/tpl] as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.
Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Unknown Nostradamus|last=Lemesurier|first=Peter|year=2003[/tpl]
In addition to the belief that some historical figures were endowed with a predisposition to psychic experiences, some psychic abilities were thought to be available to everyone on occasion. For example, the belief in prophetic dreams was common and persistent in many ancient cultures.[tpl]Cite book|last=Melton |first=J. G. |authorlink= |title=Dreams.

===Nineteenth century progression===

In the mid-nineteenth century, Modern Spiritualism became prominent in the United States and the United Kingdom. The movement's distinguishing feature was the belief that the spirits of the dead could be contacted by mediums to lend insight to the living.[tpl]Cite book|last=Carroll |first=Bret E. |authorlink= |title=Spiritualism in Antebellum America |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-253-33315-6[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The movement was fueled in part by anecdotes of psychic powers. One such person believed to have extraordinary abilities was Daniel Dunglas Home, who gained fame during the Victorian period for his reported ability to levitate to various heights and speak to the dead.[tpl]Cite book|last=Podmore |first=Frank |authorlink= |title=Mediums of the Nineteenth Century |publisher=University Books |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-253-33315-6[/tpl]
As the Spiritualist movement grew other comparable groups arose, including the Theosophical Society, which was co-founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky (1831–1891). Theosophy coupled spiritualist elements with Eastern mysticism and was influential in the early 20th century, later influencing the New Age movement during the 1970s. Blavatsky herself claimed numerous psychic powers.Melton. Chapter "Theosophical Society"

===Late twentieth century===

By the late twentieth century psychics were commonly associated with New Age culture.Diane Daniel What's in the cards Just how well do the seers see? The Boston Globe (Calendar cover story cache 1999) Psychic readings and advertising for psychics was very common in the 1990s and readings were offered for a fee and given in settings such as over the phones, in a home, or at psychic fairs.Wendy Haskett Psychic Fairs Aim for Aura of Fun in Mind Reading LATimes.com, August 15, 1987

==Popular culture==

===Belief in psychic abilities===

In a survey, reported in 1990, of members of the National Academy of Sciences, only 2% of respondents thought that extrasensory perception had been scientifically demonstrated, with another 2% thinking that the phenomena happened sometimes. Asked about research in the field, 22% thought that it should be discouraged, 63% that it should be allowed but not encouraged, and 10% that it should be encouraged; neuroscientists were the most hostile to parapsychology of all the specialties.McConnell, R.A., and Clark, T.K. (1991). "National Academy of Sciences' Opinion on Parapsychology" Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 85, 333-365.Douglas M.

A poll of 439 college students conducted in 2006 by researchers Bryan Farha of Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward of University of Central Oklahoma, suggested that college seniors and graduate students were more likely to believe in psychic phenomena than college freshmen.[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_1_30/ai_n26718251 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] 23 percent of college freshmen expressed a belief in paranormal ideas.

The poll showed lower belief in psychic phenomena among science students than social science and education students.
Some people also believe that anyone can have psychic abilities which can be activated or enhanced through the study and practice of various disciplines and techniques such as meditation and divination, with a number of books and websites being dedicated to instruction in these methods.[tpl]cite book |last=Chauran|first=Alexandra |title=So You Want To Be a Psychic Intuitive''|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2012|isbn =0738730653 [/tpl] Another popular belief is that psychic ability is hereditary, with a psychic parent passing their abilities on to their children.[tpl]Cite web|title=Psychics – myths & misconceptions|url=http://www.hark.net.au/articles/psychics_info.htm|accessdate=April 25, 2007[/tpl]

===Science fiction===

Psychic abilities are common in science fiction, often under the term "psionic". They may be depicted as innate and heritable, as in Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man, A. E. van Vogt's Slan, Anne McCaffrey's Talents universe series or setting, and the television series Babylon 5. Another recurring trope is the conveyance of psychic power through psychoactive drugs, as in the Dune novels and indirectly in the Scanners films, as well as the ghosts in the Starcraft franchise. Somewhat differently, in Madeleine L'Engle's A Wind in the Door and Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, psychic abilities may be achieved by any human who learns the proper mental discipline, known as kything in the former work. Popular movies include The initiation of Sarah. Psychic characters are also common in superhero comic books, for instance Jean Grey,  Professor X and Emma Frost as well as many others from the Marvel comics X-Men.

==Criticism and research==

thumb|right|180px|Participant of a Ganzfeld Experiment whose results have been criticized as being misinterpreted as evidence for telepathy. Parapsychological research has attempted to use random number generators to test for psychokinesis, mild sensory deprivation in the Ganzfeld experiment to test for extrasensory perception, and research trials conducted under contract by the U.S. government to investigate remote viewing. Critics such as  Ed J. Gracely say that this evidence is not sufficient for acceptance, partly  because the intrinsic probability of psychic phenomena is very small.
Critics such as Ray Hyman and the National Science Foundation suggest that parapsychology has methodological flaws that can explain the experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience. This has largely been due to lack of replication of results by independent experimenters.[tpl]Cite journal|format=|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2006|publisher=National Science Board|year=2006|url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3|postscript=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] See also Note 29: 29 Those 10 items were extrasensory perception (ESP), that houses can be haunted, ghosts / that spirits of dead people can come back in certain places/situations, telepathy / communication between minds without using traditional senses, clairvoyance / the power of the mind to know the past and predict the future, astrology / that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives, that people can communicate mentally with someone who has died, witches, reincarnation / the rebirth of the soul in a new body after death, and channeling / allowing a "spirit-being" to temporarily assume control of a body.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Hyman |first=Ray |title=Evaluation of the program on anomalous mental phenomena |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |volume=59 |issue=1 |year=1995 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n4_v59/ai_18445600 |accessdate=2007-07-30[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Wiseman |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors=Smith, Matthew, et al. |title=Exploring possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld experiments - Psychophysical Research Laboratories |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |year=1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |accessdate=2007-07-30[/tpl]
The evidence presented for psychic phenomena is not sufficiently verified for scientific acceptance, and there exist many non-paranormal alternative explanations for claimed instances of psychic events. Parapsychologists, who generally believe that there is some evidence for psychic ability, disagree with critics who believe that no psychic ability exists and that many of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena such as mediumism, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading, hot reading, or even self-delusion.EBauer, berhard (1984) "Criticism and Controversy in Parapsychology - An Overview", Department of Psychology, University of Freiburg, European Journal of Parapsychology, 5, 141-166 (2007-02-09)O',Keeffe, Ciarán and Wiseman Richard (2005) "Testing alleged mediumship: Methods and results", British Journal of Psychology, 96, 165–17 Magicians such as James Randi, Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, but they present physical and psychological explanations as opposed to paranormal ones.Rowland, Ian (2002) "The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading", Self-Published, ASIN B000NDYWDA
In January 2008 the results of a study using neuroimaging were published. To provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions, the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had participants who are biologically or emotionally related, such as twins. The experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition occurred, but despite this no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic stimuli and non-psychic stimuli, while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on patterns of brain activation. The researchers concluded that "These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena."[tpl]Cite journal|author=Moulton ST, Kosslyn SM |title=Using neuroimaging to resolve the psi debate |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=182–92 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18095790 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20.1.182 |url= [/tpl] James Alcock had cautioned the researchers against the wording of said statement.Science contradicts Psi, Skeptical Inquirer, July/August 2008

The editor controls everything; they can make a psychic look superior or ridiculous depending on direction from the producer.  In an Independent Investigation Group IIG expose of John Edward and James Van Praagh they discovered that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were "substantially different in the accuracy. They're getting rid of the wrong guesses... Once you pull back the curtain and see how it's done, it's not impressive at all."[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-09-21/news/0709210538_1_psychics-james-van-praagh-reality-tv |title=Putting Psychics to the Test|publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2011-09-12[/tpl]
