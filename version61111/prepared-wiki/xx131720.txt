1920 saw Jewell score another two hundreds, and enjoy his most successful summer behind the stumps with 21 victims, 13 of them caught and eight stumped.
The Worcestershire side that year was captained by Arthur's brother Maurice. That season Arthur was also chosen for a Gentlemen v Players game at The Oval, in which he opened the batting for the Gentlemen as well as keeping wicket; he made 3 and 0 and held a single catch (to dismiss Patsy Hendren) in an innings defeat.[ref]

For Worcestershire he played on until the end of the season, his final appearance coming in late August against Lancashire and his last dismissal, in that match, being that of Lancashire captain and former England Test player Jack Sharp.[ref]
