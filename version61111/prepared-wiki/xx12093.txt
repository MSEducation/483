==Life==

William of Ockham joined the Franciscan order at an early age. It is believed that he studied theology at the University of Oxford from 1309 to 1321, but while he completed all the requirements for a master's degree in theology (the 14th century equivalent of a doctorate) he was never made regent master.[tpl]cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/| title=William of Ockham| publisher=Stanford University |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Spade, Paul Vincent | accessdate=2006-10-22[/tpl] Because of this, he acquired the honorific title Venerabilis Inceptor, or "Venerable Beginner" (an inceptor was a student formally admitted to the ranks of teachers by the university authorities[ref]
</ref>).  He was also known as the ''Doctor Invincibilis'' or "Unconquerable Teacher."
His work in this period became the subject of controversy, and Ockham was summoned before the Papal court of Avignon in 1324 under charges of heresy.
During the Middle Ages, theologian Peter Lombard's Sentences (1150) had become a standard work of theology, and many ambitious theological scholars wrote commentaries on it.Roger Olson. The Story of Christian Theology, p. 350. ISBN 0-8308-1505-8  William of Ockham was among these scholarly commentators. However, Ockham's commentary was not well received by his colleagues,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] or by the Church authorities.  In 1324, his commentary was condemned as unorthodox by a synod of bishops[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl], and he was ordered to Avignon, France, to defend himself before a papal court. For two years, he was confined to a Franciscan house,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] until he was condemned as a heretic in 1326.
An alternative understanding, recently proposed by George Knysh, suggests that he was initially appointed in Avignon as a professor of philosophy in the Franciscan school, and that his disciplinary difficulties did not begin until 1327.Knysh, George, Biographical rectifications concerning Ockham's Avignon period. Franciscan Studies 46, pp.61–91.  It is generally believed that these charges were levied by Oxford chancellor John Lutterell.[ref]
