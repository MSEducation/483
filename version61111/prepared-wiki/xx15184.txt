The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media corporation headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the largest media conglomerate in the world in terms of revenue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/09/news/companies/disney_dreamworks.fortune/?postversion=2009020914|title=Why Disney wants DreamWorks|publisher=CNN/Money|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009| first=Richard| last=Siklos[/tpl] Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. In addition, Disney has created new corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands.
The company is best known for the products of its film studio, the Walt Disney Studios, which is today one of the largest and best-known studios in Hollywood. Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, A+E Networks, and ABC Family; publishing, merchandising, and theatre divisions; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world. It also has a successful music division. The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since May 6, 1991. An early and well-known cartoon creation of the company, Mickey Mouse, is a primary symbol of The Walt Disney Company.

==Corporate history==

===1923–1928: The silent era===

In early 1923, Kansas City, Missouri animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled Alice's Wonderland, which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. After the bankruptcy in 1923 of his previous firm, Laugh-O-Gram Films,[tpl]cite web|title= 1919-1924 |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/ |accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]  Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother Roy O. Disney.  Film distributor Margaret J. Winkler of M.J. Winkler Productions contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of Alice Comedies purchased for $1,500 per reel with Disney as a production partner.  Walt and his brother Roy Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio that same year. More animated films followed after Alice.[tpl]cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-walt-disney-company-history/|work=Company Profiles|publisher=fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl]
In January 1926 with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street, the Disney Brothers Studio's name was changed to the Walt Disney Studio.[tpl]cite web|title=1926|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1926.htm|accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]
After the demise of the Alice comedies, Disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through Universal Pictures. The distributor owned Oswald, so Disney only made a few hundred dollars. Disney only completed 26 Oswald shorts before losing the contract in February 1928, when Winkler's husband Charles Mintz took over their distribution company. After failing to take over the Disney Studio, Mintz hired away four of Disney's primary animators (the exception being Ub Iwerks) to start his own animation studio, Snappy Comedies.[tpl]cite web|title=1928|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1928.htm|accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]

===1928–1934: Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies===

In 1928, to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named Mortimer while on a train headed to California drawing up a few simple drawings.  The mouse was later renamed Mickey Mouse and starred in several Disney produced films.  Ub Iwerks refined Disney's initial design of Mickey Mouse.  Disney's first sound film Steamboat Willie, a cartoon starring Mickey, was released on November 18, 1928 through Pat Powers' distribution company. It was the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon released, but the third to be created, behind Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho. Steamboat Willie was an immediate smash hit, and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey's appeal as a character but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound.  Disney used Pat Powers' Cinephone system, created by Powers using Lee De Forest's Phonofilm system. Steamboat Willie premiered at B. S. Moss's Colony Theater in New York City, now The Broadway Theatre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shubertorganization.com/theatres/broadway.asp |title=Broadway Theater Broadway |publisher=The Shubert Organization |date=1942-07-04 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl] Plane Crazy and The Galloping Gaucho were then retrofitted with synchronized sound tracks and re-released successfully in 1929.
Disney continued to produce cartoons with Mickey Mouse and other characters, and began the Silly Symphonies series with Columbia Pictures signing on as Symphonies distributor in August 1929. In September 1929, theater manager Harry Woodin requested permission to start a Mickey Mouse Club which Walt approved.  In November, test comics strips were sent to King Features, who requested additional samples to show to the publisher, William Randolph Hearst.  On December 16, the Walt Disney Studios partnership was reorganized as a corporation with the name of Walt Disney Productions, Limited with a merchandising division, Walt Disney Enterprises, and two subsidiaries, Disney Film Recording Company, Limited and Liled Realty and Investment Company for real estate holdings.  Walt and his wife held 60% (6,000 shares) and Roy owned 40% of WD Productions. On December 30, King Features signed its first newspaper, New York Mirror, to publish the Mickey Mouse comic strip with Walt' permission.[tpl]cite web|title=1929|url= http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1929.htm|accessdate= 2013-12-15 [/tpl]
In 1932, Disney signed an exclusive contract with Technicolor (through the end of 1935) to produce cartoons in color, beginning with Flowers and Trees (1932). Disney released cartoons through Powers' Celebrity Pictures (1928–1930), Columbia Pictures (1930–1932), and United Artists (1932–1937).[tpl]cite book |last=Balio |first=Tino |title=United Artists, Volume 1, 1919–1950: The Company Built by the Stars |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QljKdIYzncoC&lpg=PA116&ots=q41Pr2zfKx&dq=disney%20united%20artists&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q=disney%20united%20artists&f=false |accessdate=2013-08-13 |year=2009 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |pages=113–116[/tpl] The popularity of the Mickey Mouse series allowed Disney to plan for his first feature-length animation.

===1934–1945: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and World War II===

Deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further, Disney began production of his first feature-length animated film in 1934. Taking three years to complete, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, premiered in December 1937 and became highest-grossing film of that time by 1939.[tpl]cite book|last= Gabler|first= Neal|year= 2007|title= Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|location= New York |publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-679-75747-3|pages= 276–277[/tpl] Snow White was released through RKO Radio Pictures, which had assumed distribution of Disney's product in July 1937,[tpl]cite web |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1937.htm |title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company |accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl] after United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts.[tpl]cite news|title=Cinema: Man & Mouse| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758747-5,00.html|work=TIME |accessdate=May 17, 2010|date=December 27, 1937[/tpl]
Using the profits from Snow White, Disney financed the construction of a new [tpl]convert|51|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] studio complex in Burbank, California. The new Walt Disney Studios, in which the company is headquartered to this day, was completed and open for business by the end of 1939.[tpl]cite web|title=1939|url= http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1939.htm|accessdate= 2013-12-15 [/tpl] The following year on April 2, Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering.[tpl]cite web|title=1939|url= http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1940.htm|accessdate= 2013-12-15 [/tpl]
The studio continued releasing animated shorts and features, such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942). After World War II began, box-office profits declined. When the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many of Disney's animators were drafted into the armed forces. The U.S. and Canadian governments commissioned the studio to produce training and propaganda films. By 1942 90% of its 550 employees were working on war-related films.[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iU4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA2&pg=PA61#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Walt Disney Goes to War | work=Life | date=August 31, 1942 | accessdate=November 20, 2011 | page=61[/tpl] Films such as the feature Victory Through Air Power and the short Education for Death (both 1943) were meant to increase public support for the war effort. Even the studio's characters joined the effort, as Donald Duck appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts, including the Academy Award-winning Der Fuehrer's Face (1943).

===1946–1954: Post-war and television===

With limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war, Disney's feature films during much of the 1940s were "package films," or collections of shorts, such as The Three Caballeros (1944) and Melody Time (1948), which performed poorly at the box-office. At the same time, the studio began producing live-action films and documentaries. Song of the South (1946) and So Dear to My Heart (1948) featured animated segments, while the True-Life Adventures series, which included such films as Seal Island (1948) and The Vanishing Prairie (1954), were also popular and won numerous awards.
The release of Cinderella in 1950 proved that feature-length animation could still succeed in the marketplace. Other releases of the period included Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953), both in production before the war began, and Disney's first all-live action feature, Treasure Island (1950). Other early all-live-action Disney films included The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952), The Sword and the Rose (1953), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954). Disney ended its distribution contract with RKO in 1953, forming its own distribution arm, Buena Vista Distribution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1937.htm |title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company | publisher=islandnet.com | accessdate=2013-12-15 [/tpl]
In December 1950, Walt Disney Productions and The Coca-Cola Company teamed up for Disney's first venture into television, the NBC television network special An Hour in Wonderland. In October 1954, the ABC network launched Disney's first regular television series, Disneyland, which would go on to become one of the longest-running primetime series of all time. Disneyland allowed Disney a platform to introduce new projects and broadcast older ones, and ABC became Disney's partner in the financing and development of Disney's next venture, located in the middle of an orange grove near Anaheim, California. It was the first phase of a long corporate relationship which, although no one could have anticipated it at the time, would culminate four decades later in the Disney company's acquisition of the ABC network, its owned and operated stations, and its numerous cable and publishing ventures.

===1955–1965: Disneyland===

In 1954, Walt Disney used his Disneyland series to unveil what would become Disneyland, an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by Art Linkletter and Ronald Reagan. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first monorail system.
For the 1964 New York World's Fair, Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1965, "Disney World" was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of Orlando, Florida.
Disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s. Its weekday afternoon children's television program The Mickey Mouse Club, featuring its roster of young "Mouseketeers", premiered in 1955 to great success, as did the Davy Crockett miniseries, starring Fess Parker and broadcast on the Disneyland anthology show. Two years later, the Zorro series would prove just as popular, running for two seasons on ABC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.billcotter.com/zorro/history-of-series.htm |title=Zorro - A history of the series |last=Cotter |first=Bill |year=2009 |website=Walt Disney's Zorro |accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] Despite such success, Walt Disney Productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] with the exception of the long-running anthology series, later known as The Wonderful World of Disney.
Disney's film studios stayed busy as well, averaging five or six releases per year during this period. While the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s, the studio released a number of popular animated features, like Lady and the Tramp (1955), Sleeping Beauty (1959) and One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), which introduced a new xerography process to transfer the drawings to animation cels.[tpl]cite web|last=Montgomery|first=Tim|title=Production Facts|url=http://animationarchive.net/Feature%20Films/101%20Dalmatians/Production%20Facts/|work=The Unofficial Disney Animation Archive|accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] Disney's live-action releases were spread across a number of genres, including historical fiction (Johnny Tremain, 1957), adaptations of children's books (Pollyanna, 1960) and modern-day comedies (The Shaggy Dog, 1959). Disney's most successful film of the 1960s was a live action/animated musical adaptation of Mary Poppins, which was one of the all time highest grossing movies and received five Academy Awards, including Best Actress Julie Andrews.[tpl]cite web|title=Results Page - Academy Awards Database|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&displayType=3&BSFilmID=36664|work=Academy Awards Databse|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2 October 2013[/tpl]
The theme park design and architectural group became so integral to the Disney studio's operations that the studio bought it on February 5, 1965, along with the WED Enterprises name.[tpl]cite book|last=Broggie|first=Michael|title=Walt Disney's Railroad Story|year=1997|publisher=Pentrex|isbn=1563420090|page=174[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Dave|title=Disney A to Z - The Updated Official Encyclopedia|year=1998|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=0786863919|pages=467, 601[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Disney War|year=2005|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=41[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2006|publisher=Knopf|page=629[/tpl]

===1966–1971: The deaths of Walt and Roy Disney and the opening of Walt Disney World===

On December 15, 1966, Walt Disney died of complications relating to lung cancer, and Roy Disney took over as chairman, CEO, and president of the company. One of his first acts was to rename Disney World as "Walt Disney World" in honor of his brother and his vision.[tpl]cite web|title='The Grand Opening of Walt Disney World' TV Special by Bill Griffiths|url=http://www.startedbyamouse.com/archives/GrandOpeningWDW01.shtml|work=StartedByAMouse.com|publisher=StartedByAMouse.com|accessdate=15 October 2013[/tpl]
In 1967, the last two films Walt actively supervised were released, the animated feature The Jungle Book and the musical The Happiest Millionaire.[tpl]cite book|last=Griffin|first=Sean|title=Tinker Belles and evil queens : the Walt Disney Company from the inside out|year=2000|publisher=New York Univ.

The 1970s opened with the release of Disney's first "post-Walt" animated feature, The Aristocats, followed by a return to fantasy musicals in 1971's Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Blackbeard's Ghost was another successful film during this period.
On October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World opened to the public, with Roy Disney dedicating the facility in person later that month. On December 20, 1971, Roy Disney died of a stroke, leaving the company under control of Donn Tatum, Card Walker, and Walt's son-in-law Ron Miller, each trained by Walt and Roy.

===1972–1984: Theatrical malaise and new leadership===

While Walt Disney Productions continued releasing family-friendly films throughout the 1970s, such as Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) and Freaky Friday (1976), the films did not fare as well at the box office as earlier material. However, the animation studio saw success with Robin Hood (1973), The Rescuers (1977), and The Fox and the Hound (1981).
As head of the studio, Miller attempted to make films to drive the profitable teenage market who generally passed on seeing Disney movies.Harmetz, Aljean (April 10, 1980). "Disney working to expand market." Wilmington Morning Star. Retrieved November 7, 2012. Inspired by the popularity of Star Wars, the Disney studio produced the science-fiction adventure The Black Hole in 1979 that cost $20 million to make, but was lost in Star Wars' wake. The Black Hole was the first Disney production to carry a PG rating in the United States.[tpl]#tag:ref|Although Disney released a PG-rated film, Take Down, prior to the release of The Black Hole, they did not make the film; it was a pickup from independent producers.|group=N[/tpl] Disney dabbled in the horror genre with The Watcher in the Woods, and financed the boldly innovative Tron; both films were released to minimal success.
Disney also hired outside producers for film projects, which had never been done before in the studio's history. In 1979, Disney entered a joint venture with Paramount Pictures on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of Popeye and Dragonslayer (1981); the first time Disney collaborated with another studio. Paramount distributed Disney films in Canada at the time, and it was hoped that Disney's marketing prestige would help sell the two films.
Finally, in 1982, the Disney family sold the naming rights and rail-based attractions to the Disney film studio for 818,461 shares of Disney stock then worth $42.6 million none of which went to Retlaw.  Also, Roy E. Disney objected to the overvalued purchase price of the naming right and voted against the purchase as a Disney board director.[tpl]cite news|last=Peltz|first=James F.|title=The Wonderful World of Disney's Other Firm : Entertainment: Walt Disney created a separate company for his family.

The 1983 release of Mickey's Christmas Carol began a string of successful movies, starting with Never Cry Wolf and the Ray Bradbury adaptation Something Wicked This Way Comes. In 1984, Disney CEO Ron Miller created Touchstone Pictures as a brand for Disney to release more major release motion pictures. Touchstone's first release was the comedy Splash (1984), which was a box office success.[tpl]cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|title=Splash (1984)|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/46141/Splash/overview|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]
With The Wonderful World of Disney remaining a prime-time staple, Disney returned to television in the 1970s with syndicated programing such as the anthology series The Mouse Factory and a brief revival of the Mickey Mouse Club. In 1980, Disney launched Walt Disney Home Video to take advantage of the newly emerging videocassette market. On April 18, 1983, The Disney Channel debuted as a subscription-level channel on cable systems nationwide, featuring its large library of classic films and TV series, along with original programming and family-friendly third-party offerings.
Walt Disney World received much of the company's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In 1978, Disney executives announced plans for the second Walt Disney World theme park, EPCOT Center, which would open in October 1982. Inspired by Walt Disney's dream of a futuristic model city, EPCOT Center was built as a "permanent World's Fair", complete with exhibits sponsored by major American corporations, as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations. In Japan, the Oriental Land Company partnered with Walt Disney Productions to build the first Disney theme park outside of the United States, Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in April 1983.
Despite the success of the Disney Channel and its new theme park creations, Walt Disney Productions was financially vulnerable. Its film library was valuable, but offered few current successes, and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios, particularly the works of Don Bluth, who defected from Disney in 1979.
By the early 1980s, the parks were generating 70% of Disney's income.
In 1984, financier Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings launched a hostile takeover bid for Walt Disney Productions, with the intent of selling off some of its operations.[tpl]cite news|title=HIGHLIGHTS OF STRUGGLE FOR DISNEY|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/business/highlights-of-struggle-for-disney.html|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 June 1984[/tpl] Disney bought out Reliance's 11.1% stake in the company.  However, another shareholder filed suit claiming the deal devaluated Disney's stock and for Disney management to retain their positions. The shareholder lawsuit was settled in 1989 for a total of $45 million from Disney and Reliance.

===1984–2003: The Eisner era===

With the Sid Bass family purchase of 18.7 percent of Disney, Bass and the board brought in Michael Eisner as CEO from Paramount Pictures and Frank Wells from Warner Bros. as president.  Eisner emphasized Touchstone Films with Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1985) to start leading to increased output with Ruthless People (1986), Outrageous Fortune (1987), Pretty Woman (1990) and additional hits. Eisner used expanding cable and home video markets to sign deals using Disney shows and films with a long-term deal with Showtime Networks for Disney/Touchstone releases through 1996 and entering television with syndication and distribution for TV series as The Golden Girls and Home Improvement.  Disney began limited releases of its previous films on video tapes in the late 1980s. Eisner's Disney purchased KHJ, an independent Los Angeles TV station.
Organized in 1985, Silver Screen Partners II, LP financed films for Disney with $193 million. In January 1987, Silver Screen III began financing movies for Disney with $300 million raised, the largest amount raised for a film financing limited partnership by E.F.

Beginning with Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, Disney's flagship animation studio enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes with such films as The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and The Lion King (1994). In addition, the company successfully entered the field of television animation with a number of lavishly budgeted and acclaimed series such as Adventures of the Gummi Bears, Duck Tales and Gargoyles.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]  Disney moved to first place in box office receipts by 1988 and had increased revenues by 20% every year.
In 1989, Disney signed an agreement-in-principle to acquire The Jim Henson Company (then known as Henson Associates) from its founder, Muppet creator Jim Henson. The deal included Henson's programming library and Muppet characters (excluding the Muppets created for Sesame Street), as well as Jim Henson's personal creative services. However, in May 1990, before the deal was completed, Jim Henson passed away, and the two companies broke off merger negotiations the following December.
Named the "Disney Decade" by the company, the executive talent attempted to move the company to new heights in the 1990s with huge changes and accomplishments.  In September 1990, The Disney Company arranged for financing up to $200 million by a unit of Nomura Securities for Interscope films made for Disney.  On October 23, Disney formed Touchwood Pacific Partners I which would supplant the Silver Screen Partnership series as their movie studios' primary source of funding.
In 1991, hotels, home video distribution, and Disney merchandising became 28 percent of total company revenues with international revenues contributed 22 percent of revenues.  The company committed its studios in the first quarter of 1991 to produce 25 films in 1992.  However, 1991 saw net income drop by 23% and had no growth for the year, but saw the release of Beauty and the Beast, winner of 2 Academy Awards and top grossing film in the genre.  Disney next moved into publishing with Hyperion Press and adult music with Hollywood Records while Disney Imagineering was laying off 400 employees.
Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then Disney Studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg acquired Miramax Films in 1993. That same year Disney created the NHL team the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, named after the 1992 hit film of the same name. Disney purchased a minority stake in the Anaheim Angels baseball team around the same time.
Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994. Shortly thereafter, Katzenberg resigned and formed DreamWorks SKG because Eisner would not appoint Katzenberg to Wells' now-available post plus Katzenberg sued over the terms of his contract. Instead, Eisner recruited his friend Michael Ovitz, one of the founders of the Creative Artists Agency, to be President, with minimal involvement from Disney's board of directors (which at the time included Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier, the CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation Stephen Bollenbach, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, Yale dean Robert A. M. Stern, and Eisner's predecessors Raymond Watson and Card Walker). Ovitz lasted only 14 months and left Disney in December 1996 via a "no fault termination" with a severance package of $38 million in cash and 3 million stock options worth roughly $100 million at the time of Ovitz's departure. The Ovitz episode engendered a long running derivative suit, which finally concluded in June 2006, almost 10 years later. Chancellor William B. Chandler, III of the Delaware Court of Chancery, despite describing Eisner's behavior as falling "far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position..." found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they hadn't violated the letter of the law (namely, the duty of care owed by a corporation's officers and board to its shareholders).[tpl]cite court|litigants=In re The Walt Disney Company Derivative Litigation|vol=907|reporter=A.2d|opinion=693|court=Delaware Court of Chancery|date=August 9, 2005[/tpl]
Eisner attempted in 1994 to purchase NBC from GE, but the deal failed due to GE wanting to keep 51% ownership of the network. Disney acquired many other media sources during the decade, including a merger with Capital Cities/ABC in 1995 which brought broadcast network ABC and its assets, including the A&E Television Networks and ESPN networks, into the Disney fold. Eisner felt that the purchase of ABC was an important investment to keep Disney surviving and allowing it to compete with international multimedia conglomerates.Interview with Michael Eisner.

Disney lost a $10.4 million lawsuit in September 1997 to Marsu B.V. over Disney's failure to produce as contracted 13 half-hour Marsupilami cartoon shows. Instead Disney felt other internal "hot properties" deserved the company's attention.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Ann W.|title=The Court Files:  Mickey's Masters Killed Fellow Cartoon Critter, Judge Rules|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/28/local/me-37167|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 28, 1997[/tpl]
Disney took control of the Anaheim Angels in 1996, and purchased a majority stake in the team in 1998. That same year, Disney began a move into the internet field with the purchase of Starwave and 43 percent of Infoseek. In 1999, Disney purchased the remaining shares of Infoseek and launch the Go Network portal in January.  Disney also launched its cruise line with the christening of Disney Magic and a sister ship, Disney Wonder.
As the Katzenberg case dragged on as his contract included a portion of the film revenue from ancillary markets forever.  Katzenberg had offered $100 to settle the case but Eisner felt the original claim amount of about half a billion too much, but then the ancillary market clause was found.   Disney lawyers tried to indicate a decline situation which reveal the some of the problems in the company.  ABC had declining rating and increasing costs while the film segment had two film failures.  While neither party revealed the settlement amount, it is estimated at $200 million.
Eisner's controlling style inhibited efficiency and progress according to some critics, while other industry experts indicated that "age compression" theory led to a decline in the company's target market due to youth copying teenage behavior earlier.
2000 brought an increase in revenue of 9% and net income of 39% with ABC and ESPN leading the way and Parks and Resorts marking its sixth consecutive year of growth.  However  the September 11 attacks led to a complete halt of vacation travel and led to a recession.  The recession led to a decrease in ABC revenue. Plus, Eisner had the company make an expensive purchase of Fox Family Worldwide.  2001 was a year of cost cutting laying off 4,000 employees, Disney parks operations decreased, slashing annual live-action film investment, and minimizing Internet operations.  While 2002 revenue had a small decrease from 2001 with the cost cutting, net income rose to $1.2 billion with two creative film releases.  In 2003, the Studio became the first studio to record over $3 billion in worldwide box office receipts.

===2003–2005: "Save Disney" campaign and Eisner's ouster===

Eisner did not want the board to renominate Roy E. Disney, the son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney, as a board director citing his age of 72 as a required retirement age. Stanley Gold responded by resigning from the board and requesting the other board members oust Eisner.  In 2003, Disney resigned from his positions as the company's vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation,[tpl]cite web|last=Polsson|first=Ken|title=2003|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn2003.htm|work=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=KPolsson.com|accessdate=7 November 2012|accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]  accusing Eisner of micromanagement, flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the theme park business, turning the Walt Disney Company into a "rapacious, soul-less" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000.
On May 15, 2003, Disney sold their stake in the Anaheim Angels baseball team to Arte Moreno. Disney purchased the rights to The Muppets and the Bear in the Big Blue House franchises from The Jim Henson Company on February 17, 2004.[tpl]cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Fuzzy Renaissance|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/movies/21barn.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 September 2008[/tpl] The two brands were placed under control of the Muppets Holding Company, LLC, a division of Disney Consumer Products.
In 2004, Pixar Animation Studios began looking for another distributor after its 12-year contract with Disney ended, due to its strained relationship over issues of control and money with Eisner.  Also that year, Comcast Corporation made an unsolicited $54 billion bid to acquire Disney.  A couple of high budget movies flopped at the box office.  With these difficulties and with some board directors dissatisfied, Eisner ceded the board chairmanship.
On March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising and unprecedented 45% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, withheld their proxies to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.[tpl]cite web|title=2004|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn2004.htm|accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]
In 2005, Disney sold the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team to Henry and Susan Samueli.

Some of Disney's animated family films have drawn fire for being accused of having sexual references hidden in them, among them The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). Instances of sexual material hidden in some versions of The Rescuers (1977) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) resulted in recalls and modifications of the films to remove such content.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp |title=Disney (Disney Films) |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009[/tpl]
Some religious welfare groups, such as the Catholic League, have opposed films including Priest (1994) and Dogma (1999).
