Melissa Janis Lefton (born August 13, 1975 in Chicago, Illinois) is a singer, songwriter, and self-styled comedian.
Her debut major label album, with her punk rock band "Product," was slated to be released in 1999 but was shelved two weeks beforehand. Her second album, Melicious, for Jive Records, was slated for release on August 21, 2001 but was also never released. Melicious took on topics like pollution, date-rape, occultism and murder, with tongue in cheek. Stylus Magazine gave Melicious a positive review and referred to her as the "queen of shelved teenpop". Allmusic also spoke highly of the album, saying it "matches the pop sassiness of the Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/melissa-lefton-mn0000870386 |title=Melissa Lefton |author= |date= |work=Allmusic |publisher= |accessdate=August 12, 2012[/tpl] Lefton was also once referred to as the "anti-Britney."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/pop_playground/sugar-shock-006-screwed-the-lost-world-of-shelved-teenpop.htm |title=Sugar Shock #006: Screwed: The Lost World of Shelved Teenpop |author=Moore, David |date=November 8, 2006 |work=Stylus Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=August 12, 2012[/tpl] Seattle Weekly called her "cute, perky and evil incarnate."[tpl]cite news |title=Two Ears and a Tale: Melissa Lefton |author=Reighley, Kurt B. |newspaper=Seattle Weekly |page=47 |date=July 5, 2001[/tpl]
Three of Lefton's songs from 2001 were commercially released. "I Love Life" appeared on the soundtrack to The Princess Diaries. "My Hit Song" appeared on the soundtrack to On the Line and also appeared on the compilation album Cool Traxx! 3. Her cover of "He Blinded Me With Science" appeared on the soundtrack to Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. Her track "Radio Rainbow" appears in the film Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge.
In an attempt to salvage her career, the label set her up with a manager who sent her to Los Angeles to become an actress. Discouraged with the roles she was offered she returned to New York City. She spent several years working professionally as a commercial jingle writer; Lefton's vocals can be heard in the famous commercial for Pepsi by Britney Spears as well as ads for T.J. Maxx and Chevrolet.
In 2006 Lefton released an album with her band Hello on the record label Frisbie.
