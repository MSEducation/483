[[Medicago]]

CATEGORIES: Medicago, Model organisms

Medicago is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as medick or burclover, and is in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Steele KP, Ickert-Bond SM, Zarre S, Wojciechowski MF. | title = Phylogeny and character evolution in Medicago (Leguminosae): Evidence from analyses of plastid trnK/matK and nuclear GA3ox1 sequences | journal = Am J Bot | volume = 97 | issue = 7 | pages = 1142–1155 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/97/7/1142.abstract | pmid = 21616866 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.1000009 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Gholami A, De Geyter N, Pollier J, Goormachtig S, Goossens A. | title = Natural product biosynthesis in Medicago species | journal = Natural Product Reports | year = 2014 | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 356–380 | pmid = 24481477 | doi = 10.1039/C3NP70104B [/tpl] The best known member of the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important crop,Alfalfa Crop Germplasm Committee Report, 2000 and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from [tpl]lang-el|μηδική (πόα)[/tpl] 'median (grass).'New Oxford American Dictionary (2nd ed., 2005), p. 1054, s.v. medick. Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rosato M, Galián JA, Rosselló JA. | title = Amplification, contraction and genomic spread of a satellite DNA family (E180) in Medicago (Fabaceae) and allied genera | journal = Ann Bot | volume = 109 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–82 | year = 2012 | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/109/4/773.abstract | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcr309 | pmid = 22186276 | pmc = 3286279 [/tpl]
The species Medicago truncatula is a model legume[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.medicago.org/ | accessdate = 21 November 2008 | title = Medicago truncatula [/tpl] due to its relatively small stature, small genome (450–500 Mb), short generation time (~3 months), and ability to reproduce both by outcrossing and selfing.

==Evolution==

It is estimated that Medicago diverged from Glycine (soybean) 53–55 million years ago (in the early Eocene),[tpl]cite book | author = Cannon S. | editor = Stacey G | title = Genetics and Genomics of Soybean | url = http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/plant+sciences/book/978-0-387-72298-6 | series = Plant Genetics and Genomics: Crops and Models | volume = II | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-387-72298-6 | page = 38 | chapter = 3.

==Ecological Interactions with Other Organisms==

===Symbiosis With Nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia===

Béna et al. (2005) constructed a molecular phylogeny of 23 Sinorhizobium strains and tested the symbiotic ability of 6 strains with 35 Medicago species.[tpl]cite journal | author = Béna G, Lyet A, Huguet T, Olivier I. | title = Medicago–Sinorhizobium symbiotic specificity evolution and the geographic expansion of Medicago | journal = J. Evol. Biol. | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1547–58 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16313467 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00952.x [/tpl] Comparison of these phylogenies indicates many transitions in the compatibility of the association over evolutionary time. Furthermore, they propose that the geographical distribution of strains limits the distribution of particular Medicago species.

===Agricultural Uses===

Other than alfalfa, several of the creeping members of the family (such as Medicago lupulina and Medicago truncatula) have been used as forage crops.

===Insect Herbivores===

Medicago species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Common Swift, Flame, Latticed Heath, Lime-speck Pug, Nutmeg, Setaceous Hebrew Character, Turnip Moth and case-bearers of the genus Coleophora including C. frischella (recorded on M. sativa) and C. fuscociliella (feeds exclusively on Medicago spp.).[tpl]Citation needed | date = September 2007 [/tpl]

===Species names with uncertain taxonomic status===

The status of the following species is unresolved:
Recent molecular phylogenic analyses of Medicago indicate that the sections and subsections defined by Small & Jomphe, as outlined above, are generally polyphyletic.[tpl]cite journal | author = Béna G, Lejeune B, Prosperi JM, Olivieri I. | title = Molecular phylogenetic approach for studying life-history evolution: the ambiguous example of the genus Medicago L. | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 265 | issue = 1401 | pages = 1141–1151 | year = 1998 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1401/1141.abstract | pmid = 9684377 | pmc = 1689169 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0410 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Downie SR, Katz-Downie DS, Rogers EJ, Zujewski HL, Small E. | title = Multiple independent losses of the plastid rpoC1 intron in Medicago (Fabaceae) as inferred from phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer sequences | journal = Can J Bot | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 791–803 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b98-047#.U1iq7VeegXI | doi = 10.1139/b98-047 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Béna G, Prosperi JM, Lejeune B, Olivieri I. | title = Evolution of annual species of the genus Medicago: a molecular phylogenetic approach | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 552–559 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790398904936 | doi = 10.1006/mpev.1998.0493 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Béna G. | title = Molecular phylogeny supports the morphologically based taxonomic transfer of the "medicagoid" Trigonella species to the genus Medicago L. | journal = Plant Syst Evol | volume = 229 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 217–236 | year = 2001 | url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s006060170012 | doi = 10.1007/s006060170012 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Yoder JB, Briskine R, Mudge J, Farmer A, Paape T, Steele K, Weiblen GD, Bharti AK, Zhou P, May GD, Young ND, Tiffin P. | title = Phylogenetic signal variation in the genomes of Medicago (Fabaceae) | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 424–38 | year = 2013 | url = http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/3/424.abstract | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt009 [/tpl] However, with minor revisions sections and subsections could be rendered monophyletic.
