 Further, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] — the ability to change shape to focus from far to near — a detriment due probably to [[protein]] crosslinking caused by UV exposure.
Recent research by J.D. Simon et al.[tpl]cite journal |author=Liu Y, Hong L, Kempf VR, Wakamatsu K, Ito S, Simon JD |title=Ion-exchange and adsorption of Fe(III) by Sepia melanin |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=262–9 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15140071 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.2004.00140.x |url=[/tpl] suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively ligate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.

Evidence exists in support of a highly cross-linked heteropolymer bound covalently to matrix scaffolding melanoproteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Donatien PD, Orlow SJ |title=Interaction of melanosomal proteins with melanin |journal=European journal of biochemistry / FEBS |volume=232 |issue=1 |pages=159–64 |date=August 1995 |pmid=7556145 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20794.x |url=[/tpl] It has been proposed that the ability of melanin to act as an antioxidant is directly proportional to its degree of polymerization or molecular weight.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sarangarajan R, Apte SP |title=Melanin aggregation and polymerization: possible implications in age-related macular degeneration |journal=Ophthalmic research |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=136–41 |year=2005 |pmid=15867475 |doi=10.1159/000085533 |url=[/tpl] Suboptimal conditions for the effective polymerization of melanin monomers may lead to formation of lower-molecular-weight, pro-oxidant melanin that has been implicated in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meyskens FL, Farmer PJ, Anton-Culver H |title=Etiologic pathogenesis of melanoma: a unifying hypothesis for the missing attributable risk |journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=2581–3 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15102657 |doi= 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-03-0638|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15102657[/tpl] Signaling pathways that upregulate melanization in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also may be implicated in the downregulation of rod outer segment phagocytosis by the RPE. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to foveal sparing in macular degeneration.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sarangarajan R, Apte SP |title=Melanization and phagocytosis: implications for age related macular degeneration |journal=Molecular vision |volume=11 |issue= |pages=482–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16030499 |doi= |url=http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v11/a56/[/tpl]
