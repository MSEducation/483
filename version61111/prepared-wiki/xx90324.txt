At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, Great Britain, an official football tournament between national representative selections was contested for the first time: football at the two previous games had been played between club teams. Eight teams entered (including two from France), although Hungary and Bohemia withdrew before the start. Denmark's Sophus "Kr√∏lben" Nielsen set a record by scoring 10 goals in a 17-1 win against France. Great Britain won the gold. Also representing the Danish team was the famous mathematician Harald Bohr.
