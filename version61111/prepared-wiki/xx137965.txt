==Incidents==

In late February 2013, the arena's ice system malfunctioned, causing all of the arena's ice to melt. As a result, following the playing of the remaining 2012-13 regular season games at the RiverHawks practice facility, the Augusta RiverHawks suspended operations for the 2013-14 season.
