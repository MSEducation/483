</ref> Every ''h''<sub>1</sub>-sorted and ''h''<sub>2</sub>-sorted array is also (''a''<sub>1</sub>''h''<sub>1</sub>+''a''<sub>2</sub>''h''<sub>2</sub>)-sorted, for any nonnegative integers ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>. The worst-case complexity of Shellsort is therefore connected with the [[coin problem|Frobenius problem]]: for given integers ''h''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''h''<sub>''n''</sub> with gcd = 1, the Frobenius number ''g''(''h''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''h''<sub>''n''</sub>) is the greatest integer that cannot be represented as ''a''<sub>1</sub>''h''<sub>1</sub>+ ... +''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''h''<sub>''n''</sub> with nonnegative integer ''a''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>. Using known formulae for Frobenius numbers, we can determine the worst-case complexity of Shellsort for several classes of gap sequences.<ref>
