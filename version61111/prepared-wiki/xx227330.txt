The Lake Erie Crushers are a professional baseball team based in Avon, Ohio. It is a member of the independent Frontier League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball.

==History==

Avon Professional Baseball unveiled the name and logo on Thursday, December 4, 2008, of the Frontier League team that will begin play in Avon. The name was chosen from entries submitted in a "Name the Team" contest sponsored by The Morning Journal. The owner of the team, Steven Edelson, said more than 800 team name ideas were submitted.
After years of talk, Frontier League officials decided to put a team in Lorain County. After initially hinting it would be in Lorain, they decided to go with Avon because, rumor was they were not happy with the stadium Lorain was offering them, which is now known as The Pipe Yard.
The "Name the Team" contest was launched in October, and the hundreds of entries were whittled down. Fans then voted on finalist selections, choosing from Ohio, Lorain County, Avon, Cleveland or Lake Erie for the team location name and the Groove, Ironmen, Red Tails, Artichokes, Crushers, Walleyes, and Woollies for the team name.
Edelson said any of the runner-up names could have been selected, but the team wanted a name that represented the area. The name recognized the vineyards in Lorain County and crushing grapes to make wine. Edelson said that the Crushers name also alluded to the industrial nature of the area. The mayor of Avon, Jim Smith, said the name is perfect because grapes and wine are an important part of this area's history. Several wineries remain active in the area, he added.
"Lake Erie Crushers is just about as good a name as you can possibly get", the mayor said.http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2008/12/05/news/mj316341.txt
