Peltier's supporters have given two different rationales for overturning the conviction. One argument asserts that Peltier did not commit the murders, and that he either had no knowledge of the murders (as he told CNN in 1999), or that he has knowledge implicating others which he will never reveal, or (as told in Peter Matthiessen's In the Spirit of Crazy Horse (book), 1983) that he approached and searched the agents but did not execute them. The other rationale[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl][tpl]who|date=February 2014[/tpl] holds that the murders (no matter who committed them) occurred during a war-like atmosphere on the reservation in which FBI agents were terrorizing residents in the wake of the Wounded Knee Incident in 1973.
The film Incident at Oglala (1992) included the AIM activist Robert Robideau saying the FBI agents had been shot by a 'Mr X'.  When Peltier was interviewed about 'Mr X', he said he knew who the man was. In 1995 Dino Butler, in an interview with E.K. Caldwell of News From Indian Country, said that 'Mr X' had been invented as the murderer in an attempt to achieve Peltier's release.http://www.dickshovel.com/dino.html In a 2001 interview with News From Indian Country, Bernie Lafferty said that she had witnessed Peltier's referring to his murder of one of the agents.

==21st-century developments==

Near the end of the Clinton administration in 2000, rumors began circulating that Bill Clinton was considering granting Peltier clemency. Opponents campaigned against that, culminating in a protest outside the White House by about 500 FBI agents and families, and a letter opposing clemency from FBI director Louis Freeh. Clinton did not grant or deny Peltier clemency. In January 2009, President George W. Bush denied Peltier's clemency petition before leaving office.Clinton refuses to pardon Leonard Peltier"Bush denies bevy of pardons, commutations". UPI.com, 2009-01-27. Accessed 2009-07-28.
In 2002, Peltier filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FBI, Louis Freeh, and FBI agents who had participated in the campaign against his clemency petition, alleging that they "engaged in a systematic and officially sanctioned campaign of misinformation and disinformation." On March 22, 2004, the suit was dismissed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.noparolepeltier.com/Order-3-22-04.pdf |format=PDF |title=US District Court, Peltier v.

===Editorial about deaths of agents and Aquash===

In January 2002 in the News from Indian Country, the publisher Paul DeMain wrote an editorial that an "unnamed delegation" told him, "Peltier was responsible for the close range execution of the FBI agents. ..." DeMain described the delegation as "grandfathers and grandmothers, AIM activists, Pipe carriers and others who have carried a heavy unhealthy burden within them that has taken its toll."Paul DeMain, "Leonard Peltier. Now what do we do?", News From Indian Country, 2002. DeMain said he was told the motive for the execution-style murder of the AIM activist Anna Mae Aquash in December 1975 "allegedly was her knowledge that Leonard Peltier had shot the two agents, as he was convicted." DeMain did not accuse Peltier of participation in the Aquash murder. In 2003 two Native American men were indicted and later convicted for the murder.
On May 1, 2003, Peltier sued DeMain for libel for similar statements about the case published on March 10, 2003, in News from Indian Country. On May 25, 2004, Peltier withdrew the suit after he and DeMain settled the case. DeMain issued the following statement: "I do not believe that Leonard Peltier received a fair trial in connection with the murders of which he was convicted. Certainly he is entitled to one. Nor do I believe, according to the evidence and testimony I now have, that Mr. Peltier had any involvement in the death of Anna Mae Aquash.""News From Indian County Allows Peltier to Withdraw Lawsuit"."Peltier Accepts Settlement Over Aquash Murder", Indian Country  DeMain did not retract his allegations that Peltier was guilty of the murders of the FBI agents and that the motive for Aquash's murder was the fear that she might inform on the activist."Press Release May 28, 2004", Justice for Anna Mae and Ray].

===Indictments and trials for the murder of Aquash===

Bruce Ellison, Leonard Peltier's lawyer since the 1970s, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to testify at the 2003 federal grand jury hearings on charges against Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham for the murder of Aquash. Ellison also refused to testify at Looking Cloud's trial in 2004. During the trial, the federal prosecutor named Ellison as a co-conspirator in the Aquash case.Paul DeMain, "Aquash Murder Case Timeline", News from Indian Country, published on Justice for Anna Mae and Ray Website Witnesses said that Ellison participated in interrogating Aquash about being an informant on December 11, 1975, shortly before her murder.
In February 2004, Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, an Oglala Sioux, was tried and convicted for the murder of Aquash. In Looking Cloud's trial, the federal prosecution argued that AIM's suspicion of Aquash stemmed from her having heard Peltier admit to the murders. Darlene "Kamook" Nichols, former wife of the AIM leader Dennis Banks, was a witness for the prosecution. She testified that in late 1975, Peltier told her and a small group of AIM fugitive activists about shooting the FBI agents. At the time all were fleeing law enforcement after the Pine Ridge shootout. The other fugitives included her sister Bernie Nichols, her husband Dennis Banks, and Anna Mae Aquash, among several others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jfamr.org/doc/kmtest1.html|title=Ka-Mook Testifies|publisher=Justice for Anna Mae and Ray[/tpl] Bernie Nichols-Lafferty testified with a similar account of Peltier's statement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jfamr.org/didit.html|title=Bernie Lafferty Speaks Regarding Leonard Peltier|publisher=Justice for Anna Mae and Ray[/tpl]
Earlier in 1975, the AIM member Douglass Durham had been revealed to be an FBI agent and dismissed from the organization. AIM leaders were fearful of infiltration. Other witnesses have testified that, once Aquash was suspected of being an informant, Peltier interrogated her while holding a gun to her head.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jfamr.org/doc/troytest.html|title=Troy Lynn Yellow Wood Testifies|publisher=Jfamr.org|date=February 2004|accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/annatp4.html|title=News from Indian Country Taped Interviews|publisher=Dickshovel.com|accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coloradoaim.org/history/1994RobideauslettertoPaulDemain.htm|title=Open Letter to Paul DeMain|publisher=Coloradoaim.org|date=1994-04-08|accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl]Steve Hendricks, The Unquiet Grave: The FBI and the Struggle for the Soul of Indian Country, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006, p. 202[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/time.html|title=Aquash Time Line|publisher=Dickshovel.com|accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl]http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal_rspns.pdf Peltier and David Hill were said to have Aquash participate in bomb-making so that her fingerprints would be on the bombs. Prosecutors alleged in court documents that the trio planted these bombs at two power plants on the Pine Ridge reservation on Columbus Day 1975.
During the trial, Nichols acknowledged receiving $42,000 from the FBI in connection with her cooperation on the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/rad-green/2005-January/017015.html|title=R-G LPDC Alerts: Begin the New year with Leonard Peltier in mind and action[/tpl] She said it was compensation for travel expenses to collect evidence and moving expenses to be farther from her ex-husband Dennis Banks, whom she feared because she had implicated him as a witness. Peltier has claimed that Kamook Nichols committed perjury with her testimony."I can't believe the $43,000 the FBI gave her was a determining factor for her to perjure herself on the witness stand. There must have been some extreme threat the FBI or their cronies put upon her." http://www.aimovement.org/peltier/index.html
On June 26, 2007, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ordered the extradition of John Graham to the United States to stand trial for his alleged role in the murder of Aquash."Former FBI agent says: Anna Mae Awaits Justice", News From Indian Country He was eventually tried by the state of South Dakota in 2010. During his trial, Darlene "Kamook" Ecoffey said Peltier told both her and Aquash that he had killed the FBI agents in 1975. Ecoffey testified under oath, "He (Peltier) held his hand like this," she said, pointing her index finger like a gun, "and he said 'that (expletive) was begging for his life but I shot him anyway.'""Marshall takes witness stand in Graham murder trial", Rapid City Journal Graham was convicted of murder as the gunman who shot Aquash and sentenced to life imprisonment.

===Presidential candidate===

Peltier was the candidate for the Peace and Freedom Party in the 2004 Presidential race. While numerous states have laws that prohibit prison inmates convicted of felonies from voting (Maine and Vermont are exceptions),Maine Today: Inmates in Maine, Vermont are allowed to vote. the United States Constitution has no prohibition against felons being elected to Federal offices, including President. The Peace and Freedom Party secured ballot status for Peltier only in California, where his presidential candidacy received 27,607 votes,Results, by district, of Presidential vote in California, 2004. approximately 0.2% of the vote in that state.

===Ruling on FBI documents===

In a February 27, 2006, decision, U.S. District Judge William Skretny ruled that the FBI did not have to release five of 812 documents relating to Peltier and held at their Buffalo field office. He ruled that the particular documents were exempted on the grounds of "national security and FBI agent/informant protection." In his opinion Judge Skretny wrote, "Plaintiff has not established the existence of bad faith or provided any evidence contradicting (the FBI's) claim that the release of these documents would endanger national security or would impair this country's relationship with a foreign government." In response, Michael Kuzma, a member of Peltier's defense team, said, "We're appealing. It's incredible that it took him 254 days to render a decision." Kuzma further said, "The pages we were most intrigued about revolved around a teletype from Buffalo ... a three-page document that seems to indicate that a confidential source was being advised by the FBI not to engage in conduct that would compromise attorney-client privilege." Peltier's supporters have tried to obtain more than 100,000 pages of documents from FBI field offices, claiming that the files should have been turned over at the time of his trial or following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed soon after."LDPC email", Prison Activist.orgCarolyn Thompson, "Judge Allows FBI to Withhold Some Peltier Documents", AP, LPDC Texas Blog
On July 20, 2012, a federal judge refused a request by Kuzma to review more than 900 pages of FBI documents related to Frank Blackhorse, who was among the approximately 24 AIM members or supporters the FBI identified as having participated in the fatal shootout on June 26, 1975. Blackhorse was arrested with Peltier but faced no extradition effort.Tim Phillips, "Judge Denies Freedom of Information Act Request by Attorney with Leonard Peltier's Defense Team", Activist Defense, July 25, 2012.

===2007 political controversy===

In 2007, billionaire David Geffen, a Peltier supporter, shifted his financial support from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to that of Barack Obama. Geffen said he switched his support because he was disillusioned by Bill Clinton's refusal to pardon Peltier, although he had pardoned Marc Rich.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003548043 |title=Maureen Dowd Column Incites Hillary-Obama War of Words |publisher= Editor & Publisher |date= 2007-02-21[/tpl]
