Royal Air Force station Langham or simply RAF Langham is a former Royal Air Force station, located [tpl]Convert|15|mi[/tpl] North-West of Norwich, Norfolk, England, from 1940 to 1961.

==History==

The airfield was originally equipped with three grass runways.  Originally opened as a satellite station for RAF Bircham Newton, the station became independent in 1942, when it was upgraded with concrete runways, perimeter track and hardstandings, and there is evidence to suggest that it was equipped with the FIDO fog dispersal system.FIDO pipes at Langham 
In 1947 the station was placed into care and maintenance, but it was reactivated during the Korean War.  It was later used as an emergency landing strip for RAF Sculthorpe, before final closure in 1961.

The station was purchased by Bernard Matthews, who constructed turkey sheds on the runways.  The turkey farm is now operated by another farmer, but the construction of the sheds has preserved large sections of the runways.Turkey sheds on runway at Langham
