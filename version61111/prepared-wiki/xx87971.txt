The station was the terminus for suburban services on the Whittlesea line, with the line duplicated in December 1910, and in July 1921 it became the terminus for electric trains. In 1924 a 8 metre long turntable was provided at the station for the operation of an AEC railmotor between Reservoir and Whittlesea station, running two trips a day. Electric trains were extended to Thomastown in December 1929, and the turntable was abolished in 1940.
Boom barriers replaced hand gates at High Street level crossing in 1963.
