Earl of Meath is a title in the Peerage of Ireland created in 1627 and held by the head of the Brabazon family. This family descends from Sir Edward Brabazon, who represented County Wicklow in the Irish House of Commons and served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1606. In 1616 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Ardee. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. In 1627 he was created Earl of Meath in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his younger brother the Hon. Sir Anthony Brabazon. Lord Meath was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. His grandson, the fourth Earl, served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin and of Kildare. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was also Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin. Lord Meath married the Hon. Juliana, daughter of Patrick Chaworth, 3rd and last Viscount Chaworth (see the Viscount Chaworth).
On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin and County Kildare. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. His grandson, the ninth Earl, was killed in a duel in 1797. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin from 1831 to 1851. In 1831 the Chaworth title held by his ancestors was revived when he was created Baron Chaworth, of Eaton Hall in the County of Hereford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His son, the eleventh Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Dublin and was also Lord-Lieutenant of County Wicklow. He was succeeded by his son, the twelfth Earl. He was a politician and philanthropist. His son, the thirteenth Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Grenadier Guards and the Irish Guards.
