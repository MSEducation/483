Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.
With the exception of humans, which inhabit every continent,Humans inhabit every continent if one includes the scientific and meteorological stations in Antarctica. most primates live in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. They range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs only [tpl]convert|30|g|oz|0|abbr=on[/tpl], to the eastern lowland gorilla, weighing over [tpl]convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].

The order Primates has traditionally been divided into two main groupings: prosimians and anthropoids (simians). Prosimians have characteristics more like those of the earliest primates, and include the lemurs of Madagascar, lorisoids, and tarsiers. Simians include monkeys, apes and hominins. More recently, taxonomists have preferred to split primates into the suborder Strepsirrhini, or wet-nosed primates, consisting of non-tarsier prosimians, and the suborder Haplorhini, or dry-nosed primates, consisting of tarsiers and the simians. Simians are divided into two groups: catarrhine (narrow-nosed) monkeys and apes of Africa and southeastern Asia and platyrrhine ("flat-nosed") or New World monkeys of South and Central America. Catarrhines consist of Old World monkeys (such as baboons and macaques), gibbons and great apes; New World monkeys include the capuchin, howler and squirrel monkeys. Humans are the only extant catarrhines to have spread successfully outside of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia, although fossil evidence shows many other species were formerly present in Europe. New primate species are still being discovered. More than 25 species were taxonomically described in the decade of the 2000s and eleven have been described since 2010.
Considered generalist mammals, primates exhibit a wide range of characteristics. Some primates (including some great apes and baboons) are primarily terrestrial rather than arboreal, but all species possess adaptations for climbing trees. Locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree, walking on two or four limbs, knuckle-walking, and swinging between branches of trees (brachiation). Primates are characterized by large brains relative to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on stereoscopic vision at the expense of smell, the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Three-color vision has developed in some primates. Most also have opposable thumbs and some have prehensile tails. Many species are sexually dimorphic; differences include body mass, canine tooth size, and coloration. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals and reach maturity later, but have longer lifespans. Depending on the species, adults may live in solitude, in mated pairs, or in groups of up to hundreds of members.

==Historical and modern terminology==

The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused. For example, "ape" has been used either as an alternative for "monkey" or for any tailless, relatively humanlike primate.[tpl]Citation |last=Anon. |year=1911 |contribution=Ape |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publication-place=New York |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri02chisrich#page/160/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-10 |edition=11th |volume=XIX [/tpl]
Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of the primatologists who developed the idea of trends in primate evolution, and that the living members of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading to humans.[tpl]Citation |last=Dixson |first=A.F. |year=1981 |title=The Natural History of the Gorilla |publication-place=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicholson |isbn=978-0-297-77895-0 [/tpl] Commonly used names for groups of primates, for example "prosimians", "monkeys", "lesser apes" and "great apes", reflect this arrangement. According to our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the primates, several of these groups are paraphyletic, meaning that although all the species in the group descend from a common ancestor, the group does not include all the descendants of that ancestor.Definitions of paraphyly vary; for the one used here see e.g. [tpl]Citation |last=Stace |first=Clive A. |year=2010 |title=Classification by molecules: What's in it for field botanists? |journal=Watsonia |volume=28 |pages=103–122 |url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/Wats28p103.pdf |accessdate=2010-02-07 [/tpl], p. 106
By contrast with approaches such as those of Le Gros Clark, modern classifications typically use groups that are monophyletic, since they include all the descendants of a common ancestor.Definitions of monophyly vary; for the one used here see e.g. [tpl]Citation |last=Mishler |first=Brent D |year=2009 |editor-last=Ayala |editor-first=F.J. |editor2-last=Arp |editor2-first=R. |contribution=Species are not Uniquely Real Biological Entities |title=Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Biology |pages=110–122 |isbn=978-1-4443-1492-2 |doi=10.1002/9781444314922.ch6 |lastauthoramp=yes [/tpl], p. 114 The diagram below shows one possible classification of the living primates,[tpl]cite book | last1 = Cartmill | first1 = M. | last2 = Smith | first2 = F. H. | title = The Human Lineage | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-118-21145-8 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=X058kYnhxC0C&pg=PA90[/tpl] with groups with commonly used names shown on the right.

All the groups that have scientific names are monophyletic (i.e. they are clades), so the scientific classification reflects evolutionary history. Some of the traditional groups shown on the right, which form an "ascending series", are paraphyletic:
Thus, the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea. In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans, and there is no single common name for all the members of the group. One possibility is to create a new common name, in this case "hominoids". Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional terms. For example, in a 2005 book, the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote, "The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans",[tpl]Citation |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate palaeontology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SyJO3vpCk8AC |accessdate=2011-07-10 [/tpl], p. 371 thereby using "apes" to mean "hominoids". The group traditionally called "apes" must then be called the "non-human apes".
[tpl]As of|2011|July[/tpl], there is no consensus as to which approach to follow, whether to accept traditional paraphyletic common names or whether to use monophyletic names, either new ones or adaptations of old ones. Both approaches will be found in biological sources, often in the same work. Thus, although Benton defines "apes" to include humans, he also repeatedly uses "ape-like" to mean "like an ape rather than a human", and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil writes of "claims that Orrorin ... was an ape rather than a human".[tpl]Citation |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate palaeontology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SyJO3vpCk8AC |accessdate=2011-07-10 [/tpl]; e.g. p. 378, p. 379, p. 380

Anthropoidea contained all of the simians.

==Evolutionary history==

Order Primates is part of the clade Euarchontoglires, which is nested within the clade Eutheria of Class Mammalia. Recent molecular genetic research on primates, colugos, and treeshrews has shown the two species of colugos are more closely related to primates than treeshrews,[tpl]cite journal|title=Molecular and Genomic Data Identify the Closest Living Relative of Primates|journal=Science|year=2007|last1=Janečka |first1=J.

The combination of this clade with the clade Glires (composed of Rodentia and Lagomorpha) forms the clade Euarchontoglires. Variously, both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders. Some scientists consider Dermoptera a suborder of Primates and call the "true" primates the suborder Euprimates.[tpl]cite book | author = McKenna, M. C. and Bell, S.

Until recently, the aye-aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini. Theories had been proposed that its family, Daubentoniidae, was either a lemuriform primate (meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises split) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines. In 2008, the aye-aye family was confirmed to be most closely related to the other Malagasy lemurs, likely having descended from the same ancestral population that colonized the island.
Suborder Haplorhini, the simple-nosed or "dry-nosed" primates, is composed of two sister clades. Prosimian tarsiers in the family Tarsiidae (monotypic in its own infraorder Tarsiiformes), represent the most basal division, originating about 58 mya.[tpl]cite conference|title=Evolutionary Biology of Tarsiers|author=Shekelle, M.|year=2005|url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/bejc/|accessdate=2008-08-22[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Rapid electrostatic evolution at the binding site for cytochrome c on cytochrome c oxidase in anthropoid primates|author=Schmidt, T. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=102|issue=18|pages=6379–6384|doi=10.1073/pnas.0409714102|year=2005|pmid=15851671|pmc=1088365|display-authors=1|last2=Wildman|first2=DE|last3=Uddin|first3=M|last4=Opazo|first4=JC|last5=Goodman|first5=M|last6=Grossman|first6=LI|bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6379S [/tpl] The earliest known haplorhine skeleton, that of 55 MA old tarsier-like Archicebus, was found in central China,[tpl]cite web |last=Wade |first=Lizzie |title=Early Primate Weighed Less Than an Ounce|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/crucial-link-in-primate-evolutio.html |publisher=ScienceNow |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=June 7, 2013 [/tpl] supporting an already suspected Asian origin for the group.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Kay|first1=R.

Alternatively, a single rafting event may explain this transoceanic colonization. Due to continental drift, the Atlantic Ocean was not nearly as wide at the time as it is today. Research suggests that a small [tpl]convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] primate could have survived 13 days on a raft of vegetation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Houle, A. | title = The origin of platyrrhines: An evaluation of the Antarctic scenario and the floating island model | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 109 | issue = 4 | year = 1999 | pages = 541–559 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199908)109:43.0.CO;2-N | pmid = 10423268[/tpl] Given estimated current and wind speeds, this would have provided enough time to make the voyage between the continents.

Although primates are well studied in comparison to other animal groups, several new species have been discovered recently, and genetic tests have revealed previously unrecognised species in known populations. Primate Taxonomy listed about 350 species of primates in 2001;[tpl]cite book |title=Primate Taxonomy |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |year=2001 |author=Groves, C. P. |isbn=1-56098-872-X[/tpl] the author, Colin Groves, increased that number to 376 for his contribution to the third edition of Mammal Species of the World (MSW3). However, publications since the taxonomy in MSW3 was compiled in 2003 have pushed the number to 424 species, or 658 including subspecies.

===Hybrids===

Primate hybrids usually arise in captivity,[tpl]cite journal |title=Songs of hybrid gibbons (Hylobates lar × H. muelleri) |author=Tenaza, R. |year=1984 |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=249–253 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350080307[/tpl] but there have also been examples in the wild.[tpl]cite journal |year=1966 |title=Naturally occurring primate hybrid |author=Bernsteil, I.

Intergeneric hybridizations, hybrids of different genera, have also been found in the wild. Although they belong to genera that have been distinct for several million years, interbreeding still occurs between the gelada and the Hamadryas baboon.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jolly |title=Intergeneric Hybrid Baboons |journal=International Journal of Primatology |year=1997 |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1023/A:1026367307470 |pages=597–627 |author-separator=, |author2=C.

==Anatomy, physiology, and morphology==

Primates have forward-facing eyes on the front of the skull; binocular vision allows accurate distance perception, useful for the brachiating ancestors of all great apes. A bony ridge above the eye sockets reinforces weaker bones in the face which are put under strain during chewing. Strepsirrhines have a postorbital bar, a bone around the eye socket, to protect their eyes; in contrast, the higher primates, haplorhines, have evolved fully enclosed sockets.[tpl]cite book | author = Campbell, B.

The primate skull has a large, domed cranium, which is particularly prominent in anthropoids. The cranium protects the large brain, a distinguishing characteristic of this group. The endocranial volume (the volume within the skull) is three times greater in humans than in the greatest nonhuman primate, reflecting a larger brain size. The mean endocranial volume is 1,201 cubic centimeters in humans, 469 cm3 in gorillas, 400 cm3 in chimpanzees and 397 cm3 in orangutans.[tpl]cite book | author= Aiello, L. & Dean, C. | year=1990 | title=An Introduction to Human Evolutionary Anatomy | publisher=Academic Press | pages=193 | isbn=0-12-045590-0[/tpl] The primary evolutionary trend of primates has been the elaboration of the brain, in particular the neocortex (a part of the cerebral cortex), which is involved with sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and, in humans, language. While other mammals rely heavily on their sense of smell, the arboreal life of primates has led to a tactile, visually dominant sensory system, a reduction in the olfactory region of the brain and increasingly complex social behavior.[tpl]cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Primates.html | title="Primates" (On-line) |publisher=Animal Diversity Web | author=Myers, P. | year=1999 | accessdate=2008-06-03[/tpl]
Primates generally have five digits on each limb (pentadactyly), with keratin nails on the end of each finger and toe. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads on the fingertips. Most have opposable thumbs, a characteristic primate feature, though not limited to this order, (opossums, for example, also have them). Thumbs allow some species to use tools. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop brachiation (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike nails on the second toe of each foot, called toilet-claws, which they use for grooming.[tpl]cite book |author=Pough, F. W., Janis, C. M. & Heiser, J.

The primate collar bone is retained as prominent element of the pectoral girdle; this allows the shoulder joint broad mobility. Apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula, broad ribcages that are flatter front-to-back, and a shorter, less mobile spine compared to Old World monkeys (with lower vertebrae greatly reduced, resulting in tail loss in some species). Old World monkeys are unlike apes in that most have tails. New World atelids, including the howler, spider, woolly spider and woolly monkeys, and New World capuchins have prehensile tails.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10516564 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21953012 Male primates typically have a a pendulous penis and scrotal testes.[tpl]cite book|author=Friderun Ankel-Simons|title=Primate Anatomy: An Introduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mwl3M6c5KzoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=penis&f=false|date=27 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-046911-9[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Macdonald | first = David | authorlink = David W.

Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced snout.[tpl]cite web |author=White, T. & Kazlev, A. |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/480Archonta/480.400.html#Primates | title=Archonta: Primates |publisher=Palaeos| accessdate=2008-06-03 | date=2006-01-08 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512022901/http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/480Archonta/480.400.html  |archivedate=2008-05-12[/tpl] Technically, Old World monkeys are distinguished from New World monkeys by the structure of the nose, and from apes by the arrangement of their teeth. In New World monkeys, the nostrils face sideways; in Old World monkeys, they face downwards. Dental pattern in primates vary considerably; although some have lost most of their incisors, all retain at least one lower incisor. In most strepsirrhines, the lower incisors and canines form a toothcomb, which is used in grooming and sometimes foraging, and the first lower premolar is shaped like a canine. Old World monkeys have eight premolars, compared with 12 in New World monkeys. The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending on the number of cusps on their molars; apes have five, Old World monkeys have four, although humans may have four or five.[tpl]cite book|title=Wheeler's Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion |author=Ash, M. M., Nelson, S. J. & Wheeler, R. C. |publisher=W.B. Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8 |pages=12[/tpl] The main hominid molar cusp (hypocone) evolved in early primate history, while the cusp of the corresponding primitive lower molar (paraconid) was lost. Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips, the moist tip of their noses and forward-facing lower front teeth.
The evolution of color vision in primates is unique among most eutherian mammals. While the remote vertebrate ancestors of the primates possessed three color vision (trichromaticism), the nocturnal, warm-blooded, mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the retina during the Mesozoic era. Fish, reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic or tetrachromatic, while all mammals, with the exception of some primates and marsupials,[tpl]cite journal | author=Arrese | year=2005 | title=Cone topography and spectral sensitivity in two potentially trichromatic marsupials, the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) and quenda (Isoodon obesulus) | journal=Proceedings of Biological Science | volume=272 | issue=1565 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3009 | pages=791–796 | pmid=15888411 | pmc=1599861 | author-separator=, | author2=C.

D[/tpl] are dichromats or monochromats (totally color blind). Nocturnal primates, such as the night monkeys and bush babies, are often monochromatic. Catarrhines are routinely trichromatic due to a gene duplication of the red-green opsin gene at the base of their lineage, 30 to 40 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bowmaker, J. K. & Astell, S. | year = 1991 | title = Photosensitive and photostable pigments in the retinae of Old World monkeys | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 156 | pages = 1–19 |issn=0022-0949 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/156/1/1.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-06-16 | pmid = 2051127 | issue=1[/tpl] Platyrrhines, on the other hand, are trichromatic in a few cases only.[tpl]cite journal | author = Surridge, A.

Males, therefore, can only be dichromatic, while females can be either dichromatic or trichromatic. Color vision in strepsirrhines is not as well understood; however, research indicates a range of color vision similar to that found in platyrrhines.
Like catarrhines, howler monkeys (a family of platyrrhines) show routine trichromatism that has been traced to an evolutionarily recent gene duplication.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lucas, P.

===Sexual dimorphism===

Sexual dimorphism is often exhibited in simians, though to a greater degree in Old World species (apes and some monkeys) than New World species. Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism. Primates usually have dimorphism in body mass[tpl]cite journal |author=Ralls, K. |year=1976 |title=Mammals in Which Females are Larger Than Males |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=51 |issue=2 |doi=10.1086/409310 | pages=245–76 |pmid=785524[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Lindstedtand & Boyce | year=1985 | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=125 |pages=873 |doi = 10.1086/284385 |title = Seasonality, Fasting Endurance, and Body Size in Mammals | last2=Boyce | first2=Mark S. | issue=6[/tpl] and canine tooth size[tpl]cite journal |author=Frisch, J.

Comparative analyses have generated a more complete understanding of the relationship between sexual selection, natural selection, and mating systems in primates. Studies have shown that dimorphism is the product of changes in both male and female traits.[tpl]cite journal |author=Plavcan, J. M. |year=2001 |title=Sexual dimorphism in primate evolution |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=33 |pages=25–53 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.10011 |pmid=11786990[/tpl] Ontogenetic scaling, where relative extension of a common growth trajectory occurs, may give some insight into the relationship between sexual dimorphism and growth patterns.[tpl]cite journal |author=O'Higgins, P. & Collard, M. |year=2002 |title=Sexual dimorphism and facial growth in papionine monkeys |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=255–272 |doi=10.1017/S0952836902000857[/tpl] Some evidence from the fossil record suggests that there was convergent evolution of dimorphism, and some extinct hominids probably had greater dimorphism than any living primate.

===Locomotion===

Primate species move by brachiation, bipedalism, leaping, arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism, climbing, knuckle-walking or by a combination of these methods. Several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers and leapers. These include many bushbabies, all indriids (i.e., sifakas, avahis and indris), sportive lemurs, and all tarsiers.[tpl]cite book|title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 1: Lorises, Lemurs and Tarsiers|author=Sussman, R. W.|year=1999|isbn=0-536-02256-9|location=Needham Heights, MA|publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing & Prentice Hall|pages=78, 89–90, 108, 121–123, 233[/tpl] Other prosimians are arboreal quadrupeds and climbers. Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds, while some are leapers. Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers. Gibbons, muriquis and spider monkeys all brachiate extensively, with gibbons sometimes doing so in remarkably acrobatic fashion. Woolly monkeys also brachiate at times. Orangutans use a similar form of locomotion called quadramanous climbing, in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through the trees. Chimpanzees and gorillas knuckle walk, and can move bipedally for short distances. Although numerous species, such as australopithecines and early hominids, have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion, humans are the only extant species with this trait.[tpl]Cite book | first1 = S.

==Behavior==

===Social systems===

Primates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Kappeler|first1=Peter|first2=C. |last2=van Schaik |title=Primate social systems|year=2003[/tpl] Richard Wrangham stated that social systems of non-human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.[tpl]cite book |author=Wrangham, R. W. |authorlink=Richard Wrangham |chapter=Mutualism, kinship and social evolution |year=1982 |title=Current Problems in Sociobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=269–289 |isbn=0-521-24203-7[/tpl] He proposed four categories:
Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with howler monkeys both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related. Some prosimians, colobine monkeys and callitrichid monkeys use this system.
Primatologist Jane Goodall, who studied in the Gombe Stream National Park, noted fission-fusion societies in chimpanzees.[tpl]cite journal | title=Noninvasive paternity assignment in Gombe chimpanzees | author=Constable | journal=Molecular Ecology | year=2001 | volume=10 | issue=5 | pages=1279–1300 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2001.01262.x | pmid=11380884 | author-separator=, | author2=J. L. | display-authors=2 | last3=Goodall | first3=Jane | last4=Pusey | first4=Anne E.[/tpl] There is fission where the main group splits up to forage during the day, then fusion when the group returns at night to sleep as a group. This social structure can also be observed in the Hamadryas baboon,[tpl]cite book|title=The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates|author=Rowe, N.|year=1996|publisher=Pogonias Press|isbn=0-9648825-0-7|pages=4, 139, 143, 154, 185, 223[/tpl] spider monkeys and the bonobo. The gelada has a similar social structure in which many smaller groups come together to form temporary herds of up to 600 monkeys.
These social systems are affected by three main ecological factors: distribution of resources, group size, and predation.[tpl]cite book |author=Pough, F. W., Janis, C. M. & Heiser, J. B. |title=Vertebrate Life |chapter=Primate Societies |year=2005 |origyear=1979 |edition=7th |publisher= Pearson |pages=621–623 |isbn=0-13-127836-3[/tpl] Within a social group there is a balance between cooperation and competition. Cooperative behaviors include social grooming (removing skin parasites and cleaning wounds), food sharing, and collective defense against predators or of a territory. Aggressive behaviors often signal competition for food, sleeping sites or mates. Aggression is also used in establishing dominance hierarchies.Smuts, B.B., Cheney, D.L.

===Interspecific associations===

Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild. Some of these associations have been extensively studied. In the Tai Forest of Africa several species coordinate anti-predator behavior. These include the Diana monkey, Campbell's mona monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, western red colobus, king colobus and sooty mangabey, which coordinate anti-predator alarm calls.[tpl]cite book|title=Monkeys of Tai Forest, An African Primate Community|chapter=Interactions between African Crowned Eagles and Their Prey Community|author=Shultz, S. & Thomsett, S.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=181[/tpl] Among the predators of these monkeys is the common chimpanzee.[tpl]cite book|title=Monkeys of Tai Forest, An African Primate Community|chapter=Interactions between Red Colobus Monkeys and Chimpanzees|author=Bshary, R.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=155–170[/tpl]
The red-tailed monkey associates with several species, including the Western red colobus, blue monkey, Wolf's mona monkey, mantled guereza, black crested mangabey and Allen's swamp monkey. Several of these species are preyed upon by the common chimpanzee.[tpl]cite book|title=Chimpanzee and Red Colobus : the ecology of predator and prey|author=Stanford, C.|year=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00722-0|pages=130–138, 233[/tpl]
In South America, squirrel monkeys associate with capuchin monkeys.[tpl]cite book|title=On the Move : how and why animals travel in groups|chapter=Social Manipulation Within and Between Troops Mediates Primate Group Movement|author=Boinski, S.|editor=Boinski, S. and Garber, P.|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-06340-2|pages=447–448[/tpl] This may have more to do with foraging benefits to the squirrel monkeys than anti-predation benefits.

===Cognition and communication===
