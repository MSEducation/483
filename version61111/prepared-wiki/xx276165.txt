Coso County was a failed attempt in California to create a county from the territory of Tulare County and parts of Mono County east of the Sierra Nevada in 1864. It was the predecessor of Inyo County, which was successfully organized in 1866.Willie Arthur Chalfant, The story of Inyo, The Author, 1922, pp.174-176
The county seat of Coso County was to be Bend City.California Historical Landmark No. 209: SITE OF BEND CITY - Bend City, a population center in the middle 1860s, was designated as the seat of Coso County, but the county was never formed. It was here that the first county bridge across Owens River was constructed. The 1872 earthquake changed the course of Owens River, so the site of Bend City was near an empty ravine instead of on a river bank. Location: On Mazourka Canyon Rd, 4.6 mi W of Independence.
