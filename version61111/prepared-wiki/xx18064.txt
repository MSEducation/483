CATEGORIES: 3D graphics software, CAD file formats

The 3D ACIS Modeler (ACIS) is a Geometric modeling kernel developed by Spatial Corporation (formerly Spatial Technology), part of Dassault Systemes. ACIS is used by many software developers in industries such as computer-aided design (CAD), Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), Computer-aided engineering (CAE), Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), Coordinate-measuring machine (CMM), 3D animation, and shipbuilding. ACIS provides software developers and manufacturers the underlying 3D modeling functionality.
ACIS features an open,[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] object-oriented C++ architecture that enables robust, 3D modelling capabilities. ACIS is used to construct applications with hybrid modeling features, since it integrates wireframe model, surface, and solid modeling functionality with both manifold and non-manifold topology, and a rich set of geometric operations.

==History==

As a geometric kernel, ACIS is a second generation system, coming after the first generation Romulus[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cadazz.com/| title=CAD software history CAD CAM computer aided design 1980 to 1985 | accessdate=2007-03-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070203084236/http://www.cadazz.com/| archivedate= 3 February 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
There are several versions about what the word ACIS actually stands for, or whether it is an acronym at all. The most popular version is that ACIS stands for Alan, Charles, Ian's System (Alan Grayer, Charles Lang and Ian Braid as part of Three-Space Ltd.), or Alan, Charles, Ian and Spatial (as the system was later on sold to Spatial Technology, now Spatial Corp). However, when asked,[tpl]by whom|date=March 2012[/tpl] the creators of ACIS would simply suggest that its name was derived from Greek mythology (See also Acis).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
In 1985 Charles Lang and Ian Braid (creators of Romulus and Romulus-D) formed Three-Space Ltd. (Cambridge, England) which had been retained by Dick Sowar's Spatial Technology (which had been founded by Sowar in 1986) to develop the ACIS solid modeling kernel for Spatial Technology's Strata CAM software. The first version of ACIS was released in 1989 and was quickly licensed by HP for integration into its ME CAD software.
In late 2000, around the time when Spatial was acquired by Dassault Systemes, the ACIS file format changed slightly and was no longer openly published.

==Architecture==

A  software component is a functionally specialized unit of softwareâ€”a collection of software items (functions, classes, etc.) grouped together to serve some distinct purpose. It serves as a constituent part of a whole software system or product. A  product is one or more software components that are assembled together and sold as a package. Components can be arranged in different combinations to form different products.
The ACIS product line is designed using software component technology, which allows an application to use only the components it requires. In some cases, more than one component is available (either from Spatial or third party vendors) for a given purpose, so application developers can use the component that best meets their needs. For example, several rendering components are available from Spatial, and developers use the one that works best for their platform or application.

===ACIS Modeler Extensions===

==File format==

ACIS saves modeling information to external files which have an open format allowing external applications, even those not based on ACIS, access to the ACIS geometric model.  The basic information needed to understand the ACIS file format (focusing on the reading, or restore, operation), includes the structure of the save file format, how data is encapsulated, the types of data written, and subtypes and references.

===Save File Types===

ACIS supports two kinds of save files, Standard ACIS Text (SAT), and Standard ACIS Binary (SAB). The two formats store identical information, so the term SAT file is generally used to refer to either (when no distinction is needed). SAT files are ASCII text files that may be viewed with a simple text editor. A SAT file contains carriage returns, white space and other formatting that makes it readable to the human eye. A SAT file has a .sat file extension. SAB files cannot be viewed with a simple text editor and are meant for compactness and not for human readability. A SAB file has a .sab file extension. A SAB file uses delimiters between elements and binary tags, without additional formatting.

===Structure of the Save File===

A save file contains:
Beginning with ACIS Release 6.3, it is required that the product ID and units be populated for the file header before you can save a SAT file.

==Version Numbers and ACIS Releases==

ACIS is currently being developed by Spatial.  They maintain the concept of a current version (release) number in ACIS, as well as a save version number. The save version allows one to create a SAT save file that can be read by a previous version of ACIS.
Beginning with ACIS Release 4.0, the SAT save file format does not change with minor releases, only with major releases. This allows applications that are based upon the same major version of ACIS to exchange data without being concerned about the save version. To provide this interoperability in a simple implementation, ACIS save files have contained a symbol that accurately identified the major version number, but not the minor version. This meant that applications created using the same major version of ACIS would produce compatible save files, regardless of their minor versions. This was accomplished by simply not incrementing the internal minor version number between major versions.
Beginning with Release 7.0, ACIS started again providing accurate major, minor, and point version numbers.
To summarize how release numbers and SAT changes are related:
