Saint Eunan's College ([tpl]lang-ga|Coláiste Adhamhnáin[/tpl]) is an all-male voluntary secondary school in County Donegal, Ireland. Located in the Glencar area of Letterkenny, it is an imposing three-storey structure resembling a castle, and is known as "the castle on the hill".[tpl]cite news|first=Alan|last=Foley|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/forward-thinking-mcfadden-1-4247035|title=Forward thinking McFadden|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012|quote=As a student, McFadden used to gaze at the framed team photographs dotting the interior walls of St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. It's where he teaches now. Although perhaps traditionally more a soccer school with All-Irelands continually coming through the towering gates of the school known as ‘the castle on the hill’, MacLarnon Cup winning teams are also immortalised in dusting print.[/tpl] It was designed by renowned Irish architect Thomas Francis McNamara. Noted also for the peculiar nature of its architecture, with four turreted round towers and flying buttresses modelled on the nearby Cathedral, it is divided by a capacious central courtyard, adjoined to an immense stone chapel and home to some unusual flora, fauna and fungi, completed by the conspicuous presence of a large monkey puzzle tree on its front lawn. Named after the Abbot of Iona Saint Eunan, a native of Donegal and patron saint of the Diocese of Raphoe, it celebrated its centenary in 2006.Information and References, Saint Eunan's College website. Retrieved 6 July 2008. Saint Eunan's College is a prolific sporting institution, having produced numerous footballers who have gone on to play for the Donegal senior football team at the highest level of the game.

Among the current staff are All-Ireland winning Gaelic football All Star Colm McFadden, football manager Gary McDaid (currently of Glenswilly), football manager and former Donegal selector Mickey Houston and Ollie Horgan, who has managed Finn Harps and the Republic of Ireland schoolboys.

==History==

Saint Eunan's College was founded as a boarding school in 1906 by the then Bishop of Raphoe, Patrick O' Donnell. Originally intended as a minor seminary, it was designed to prepare students for the Roman Catholic priesthood. Diocesan colleges became an increasingly popular feature at the time and were designed to give the best possible Catholic education to boys of every class.
The student population expanded in the 1920s and it was necessary to build a new extension to the College in the early 1930s. The current recreation hall was built in 1958 and the science block in 1968. The College Chapel was designed by J.J. Robinson, the architect of Galway Cathedral. It was completed in 1961 at a cost of £42,000.Did You Know, Published in the 1995 edition of the Letterkenny and District Christmas Annual
The 'new building' was opened in 1979 to cater for the 500 students enrolled at the time. Due to the growth of other second level schools in the area the number of boarders dropped extensively and in 1992, the boarding wing was finally shut down. Saint Eunan's College continues to this day as a Catholic School under the trusteeship of the Bishop of Raphoe.
The school currently serves approximately 900 students from Letterkenny and its surrounding area, and is one of the few remaining all-male schools in the north-western part of Ireland. The president, since 2009, is Christopher Darby and the vice principal, since 2010, is Mary Cunningham.
In 2007, the school came to the attention of the national media. Retailers were urged not to sell eggs and flour to students following a spate of attacks on passing cars.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/garda-crackdown-on-bad-eggs-in-rural-town-61690.html|title=Garda crackdown on 'bad eggs' in rural town|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012|quote=...Also this week, the principals of Letterkenny's two largest secondary schools joined forces in a letter to parents appealing for their assistance in encouraging their children to behave well. Father Michael Carney, principal of St Eunan's College, and Noel O'Fearraigh, principal of the Loreto Convent, said they were responding to complaints received from gardai and retailers in the town.[/tpl]
In 2009, Christopher Darby became the first lay person to become president of the college, taking over from Father Michael Carney.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalnews/New-president-for-St-Eunan39s.5423522.jp|title=New president for St Eunan's College|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=2 July 2009[/tpl]
