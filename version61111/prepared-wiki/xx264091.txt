Perfect Chemistry received mixed to generally positive reviews. RT Book Reviews gave it 4 stars stating,
Kirkus reviews says of Perfect Chemistry,
              [tpl]quote|"Elkeles pens plenty of tasteful, hot scenes—including one where Brittany loses her virginity to Alex—that keep the pages turning. The other elements come together as well, though they seem forced. Alex and his friends are not fully fleshed out, and their voices and dialogue definitely don't capture their characters or their experiences. Brittany's issues and dramas with her mother and her entourage come off like a groan-inducing after-school special. Still, as the title implies, the author definitely knows how to write romance, and that should help readers overlook some of the cheesier bits."<ref>[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/childrens-books/simone-elkeles/perfect-chemistry/ |title=Kirkus review |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Kirkus Book Reviews |accessdate=January 5, 2011[/tpl]</ref>[/tpl]
