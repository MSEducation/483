The Mudaito Dynasty (Modayt√≥ Dynasty) was the ruling family of the Aussa Sultanate.

==History==

The Aussa Sultanate (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne.Abir, p. 23 n.1. The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by Kadhafo around the year 1734, and was thereafter ruled by his Mudaito Dynasty.Abir, pp. 23-26. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.Trimingham, p. 262.
