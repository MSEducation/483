The 2008 FA Community Shield was a football match played on 10 August 2008 between 2007–08 Premier League champions Manchester United and 2007–08 FA Cup winners Portsmouth as the "curtain-raiser" to the 2008–09 English football season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACommunityShield/ |title=The FA Community Shield sponsored by McDonald's |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=27 February 2009 |work=TheFA.com |publisher=The Football Association | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090221060004/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACommunityShield/| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The match marked the 100th year since the first Charity Shield, also won by Manchester United after a replay in August 1908.
Manchester United won the game 3–1 on penalties, after the match finished 0–0 after 90 minutes; the Community Shield no longer plays extra time if the teams are level at the end of normal time.
The match was the second meeting between the two teams in the space of two weeks, after they had played each other in a friendly in Nigeria on 27 July 2008. It was also the first Community Shield since 1996 to feature a team from outside the big four of Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. With this Community Shield title, United extended their record number of wins in the competition to 13 (17 including shared titles).
