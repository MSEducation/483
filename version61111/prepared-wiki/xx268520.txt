==History==

The Makers of Memories Foundation was established in 2007 by marketing and media entrepreneur Brian F. Martin.  Martin was raised in a family with chronic, serious abuse and created the Foundation to help families and children overcome the trauma of domestic violence they experienced and to pursue more positive possibilities in their lives.  In 2007 and 2008 the Foundation hosted journeys for families which combined a restorative experience along with educational and therapeutic services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parents-digital.com/parents/200910?pg=21#pg21 |title=Parents - October 2009 |publisher=Parents-digital.com |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=by Elisa :: Tue Sep 22, 2009 at 05:00:03 AM PST |url=http://www.mothertalkers.com/story/2009/9/22/6240/-Tuesday-Morning-Open-Thread |title=Tuesday Morning Open Thread |publisher=Mother Talkers |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl]  Financial author David Bachhttp://www.uic.edu/orgs/apac/downloads/newsletter/APACNewsletterApr10.pdf and the Central Park jogger, Trisha Mieli, participated in the intervention programs.

The Makers of Memories Foundation began production on a documentary film, 43 Million Secrets in April 2011.  The film profiles a family that has been devastated by domestic violence and includes interviews with experts in the field of domestic violence, law enforcement officials and adults and children who have experienced violence in their homes.  The Foundation plans to use the film as an educational tool to inform the public about the effects of domestic violence on children, adults and society.  Release of the film is scheduled for Spring 2012.
The Foundation convened a summit of scholars and interventionists in April 2010 in New York to identify the most promising existing intervention programs to help children impacted by domestic violence and to develop a new intervention program model focused on prevention.  That research led to a partnership will partner with MINCAVA, of the University of Minnesota School of Social Work to launch a pilot program in 2012 that uses informal family protective networks to provide assistance and support to children who have experienced domestic violence and are at risk.
Congressman John Conyers, as the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, works with Makers of Memories and recently called for an oversight hearing to assess where the government is in their work on the impact of domestic violence on children, and what more can and should be done.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/191773-preventing-domestic-violence-must-begin-with-the-children |title=Preventing domestic violence must begin with the children |publisher=TheHill.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
