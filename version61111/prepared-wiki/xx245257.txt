[[Burmese general election, 1960]]

Burma held its third general election on 6 February 1960 to decide which faction of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) should take over from General Ne Win's interim administration, established in October 1958. The military-led administration was credited for bringing stability and improving infrastructure in the country, though it suppressed some civil liberties.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bigelow|first=Lee S|year=1960|journal=Far Eastern Survey|publisher=Institute of Pacific Relations|volume=29|issue=5|pages=70–74|title=The 1960 Elections in Burma|jstor=3024046[/tpl]
The election was seen as not so much a contest between former Premier U Nu and associates against former colleagues U Kyaw Nyein and U Ba Swe, but a referendum on the policies of the interim military government between 1958 and 1960.[tpl]cite book|last=Rotberg|first=Robert I|title=Burma: prospects for a democratic future|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=1998|page=43|isbn=978-0-8157-7581-2[/tpl] The "Clean AFPFL" faction led by former Premier U Nu won the election with a majority of seats. The communist-orientated National United Front (NUF) won no seats, compared to the 1956 election.
The election set a precedent to other Middle Eastern and South Asian leaders, where the military voluntary handed over to a civilian government and held free elections.[tpl]cite journal|last=Butwell|first=Richard|coauthors=von der Mehden, Fred|year=1960|title=The 1960 Election in Burma|journal=Pacific Affairs|publisher=Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia|volume=33|issue=2|pages=144–157|jstor=2752941[/tpl] However, two years after his election victory, Nu was overthrown by a coup d'état led by General Ne Win on 2 March 1962.

==Political parties==

The "Clean AFPFL", led by U Nu, and "Stable AFPFL", led by U Kyaw Nyein and U Ba Swe, formed after a split in the main AFPFL party in April 1958.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=iX41AAAAIBAJ&sjid=GKwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6787,1182226&dq=|title=All Asia is watching Burma's democratic election|last=Grant|first=Bruce|date=8 February 1960|publisher=The Age[/tpl] Until the military took over in October 1958, U Nu relied on the communists to retain a majority in parliament.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=6BE1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=uaULAAAAIBAJ&pg=3065,4937337&dq=|title=General Ne Win bows out|date=10 February 1960|publisher=The Glasgow Herald[/tpl]
Despite the formation of the two parties, there were no major ideological differences between them and their policies were similar, especially with regards to non-alignment, although the "Stable" faction favoured industrialisation and the "Clean" faction spoke more of agricultural development. The "Stable" faction had given the impression it was favoured by the army, but, after realising the army was not as favoured as first thought, distanced itself. It had also argued it represented stability.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=TnEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z8sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7417,959165&dq=|title='Foes' of corruption win easily in Burma election|last=Associated Press|date=9 February 1960|publisher=Herald-Journal[/tpl] Meanwhile, the "Clean" faction warned against the "dangers of fascist dictatorship",[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Ia8RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oecDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5615,3543389&dq=|title=U Nu victory changes trend|last=Associated Press|date=10 February 1960|publisher=The Spokesman-Review[/tpl] and criticised the current leaders for their "drinking and womanising".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=in41AAAAIBAJ&sjid=GKwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5048,1313037&dq=|title=Burma states her policy|last=Grant|first=Bruce|date=9 February 1960|publisher=The Age[/tpl] The communist NUF was severely repressed by the caretaker military government and was therefore outside the two main parties.[tpl]cite journal|last=Butwell|first=Richard|year=1960|title=The new political outlook in Burma|journal=Far Eastern Survey|publisher=Institute of Pacific Relations|volume=29|issue=2|pages=21–27|jstor=3024460[/tpl]
The Clean AFPFL chose yellow to campaign, as it was the colour worn by monks, while the Stable AFPFL chose red and the National Union Front chose blue.

==Polling day==

An estimated 10,000,000 Burmese were eligible to vote.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=UPQNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FHcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4413,2570642&dq=|title=Burma voters cast ballots for deputies|last=United Press International|date=7 February 1960|publisher=St. Petersburg Times[/tpl] The military largely stayed away on voting day, although it was present at some ballot boxes. Boxes for the "Clean" faction featured pictures of U Nu which the "Stable" faction and other smaller parties alleged confused the voter into thinking they were voting for Nu personally. Polls closed at 6pm and a crowd estimated at 20,000 gathered at the Sule Pagoda in the capital Rangoon to hear results as they were posted. The "Clean" faction took all 9 seats in the capital including one they were prepared to concede, while the "Stable" faction had some strength in the countryside.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=iW4pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lswEAAAAIBAJ&pg=664,1403668&dq=|title=U Nu 'cleans' bidding for sweep in voting|last=Associated Press|date=9 February 1960|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal[/tpl]
Media coverage of the event was restricted to print media only and vigorously covered, but was largely ignored by the state-run Burma Broadcasting Service which had not aired opposition coverage since before the AFPFL split.
