The term 'peplomer' is typically used to refer to a grouping of heterologous proteins on the virus surface that function together.
The tail fibers of some bacteriophages, especially the T4-like phages, are modified peplomers.
Influenza virus has 2 kinds of peplomers 1 triangular spike shaped 2 "haemagglutinin" and mushroom shaped "neuraminidase"
