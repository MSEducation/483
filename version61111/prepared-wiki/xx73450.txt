A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich with toasted bread. It is often cut into quarters and held together by hors d'Å“uvre sticks. It frequently has two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.
The classic ingredients for a club sandwich are turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/classic-club-sandwich-recipe/index.html |title=Classic Club Sandwich Recipe : Food Network Kitchens : Recipes |publisher=Food Network |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] Other common club sandwiches generally vary the bottom layer, for example a "chicken club" or a "roast beef club" or a "breakfast club". Variations might include ham (instead of, or in addition to bacon)  and/or additional cheese slices.  As with a BLT, the club sandwich is usually served on toasted bread. Mayonnaise and mustard and sometimes honey mustard are common condiments. The sandwich is commonly served with a side portion of either coleslaw, or potato salad, and often accompanied by a pickle. The coleslaw or potato salad is often reduced to a "garnish" portion, when the primary side item is an order of French fries or potato chips.
One popular theory is that the club sandwich was invented in an exclusive Saratoga Springs, New York, gambling club in the late 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/ClubSandwich.htm |title=History of the club sandwich |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]
The sandwich is known to have appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as far back as 1899.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&strucID=271825&imageID=467985&total=2&num=0&word=steamer%20rhode%20island%201899&s=1&notword=&d=&c=&f=&k=0&lWord=268324&lField=10&sScope=Source&sLevel=1&sLabel=The%2520Buttolph%2520collection%2520of%2520menus&imgs=20&pos=2&e=w |title="Steamer Rhode Island" dining room, menu dated October 17, 1899: "Cold Dishes ...
