==Statistics and additional information==

This 4,672 foot wooden roller coaster uses the Lake Compounce's natural mountainous terrain, complete with trees and boulders within close proximity of the track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/yellowpages/coasters/boulder_lakecompounce.shtml|title=Boulder Dash|publisher=Compounce Lake.com|accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] The lift climbs the mountainside and then disappears from view. When it reappears, it has completed its first drop of 115 feet and is traveling sixty miles per hour as it crosses over itself and flies over the station. Much of the first half of the ride is hidden as the train climbs and drops along the mountainside.  On the last drop, on-ride photos are taken and can be viewed and bought at the photo booth at the end of the exit line. Most of the ride was retracked during the 2007 off season and during the 2008 off season the remainder was retracked.
Lake Compounce bought PTC trains from Hersheyparks Wildcat and is expected to run them on the Boulder Dash for the 2008 season.
Its layout was inspired by the Rollo Coaster, a small wooden coaster at Idlewild Park (both parks are owned by the same company, Parques Reunidos).

==Awards and rankings==

Boulder Dash was voted the world's number one wooden roller coaster in 2001 and 2004 by the National Amusement Park Historical Association, and it took the top spot in Amusement Today's 2004 and 2013 Golden Ticket Awards for Best Wood Coaster. It is the fastest, and longest wooden coaster on the East Coast.
