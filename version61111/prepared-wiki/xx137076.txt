==Background & shooting==

The African-American population in the Northeast corner of Teaneck grew substantially in the 1960s, accompanied by white flight triggered by the blockbusting efforts of local real estate agencies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  As this de facto racial segregation increased, so did tensions between residents of the Northeast and the predominately white Teaneck Police Department.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  
On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a group of teenagers, one of whom was reported to have a gun. After an initial confrontation near the Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Pannell was shot and killed by Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Many witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and had been shot in the back. A fully loaded .22 caliber pistol was recovered from the jacket pocket of suspect Pannell.  The weapon had once been a starter's pistol that had been modified into a fully operable gun.

Protest marches, some violent, ensued, with most African Americans believing that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, and White residents insisting that Spath had been justified in his actions. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement.
