The largest is William T. Young Library, a federal depository, hosting subjects related to social sciences, humanities and life sciences collections.  In recent years, the university has focused expenditures increasingly on research, following a compact formed by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1997. The directive mandated that the university become a Top 20 public research institution, in terms of an overall ranking to be determined by the university itself, by the year 2020.

==History==

===University origins===

College in the early commonwealth of Kentucky was limited to a number of children from prominent families, disciplined apprentices, and those young men seeking entry into clerical, legal, and medical professions.  As the first university in the territory that would become Kentucky, Transylvania University was the primary center for education, and became the mother of what would become the University of Kentucky.
John Bryan Bowman founded the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky (A&M), a publicly chartered department of Kentucky University, after receiving federal support through the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act in 1865.[tpl]cite web | title=A Brief History of the University of Kentucky | publisher=University of Kentucky | url=http://www.uky.edu/CampusGuide/uk-history.html  | accessdate=January 6, 2012[/tpl] Courses were offered at Ashland, The Henry Clay Estate. Three years later, James Kennedy Patterson became the first president of the land-grant university and the first degree was awarded. In 1876, the university began to offer Master's degree programs. Two years later, A&M separated from Kentucky University, which is now Transylvania University.[tpl]cite web | title=A Chronology of UK | publisher=University of Kentucky Special Collections & Digital Programs Division | date=January 2, 2008 | accessdate=January 2, 2008 | url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/libpage.php?lweb_id=311&llib_id=13 [/tpl] For the new school, Lexington donated a 52 acre (210,000 m²) park and fair ground, which became the core of UK's present campus. A&M was initially a male-only institution, but began to admit women in 1880.
In 1882, the official colors of the university, royal blue and white, were adopted. An earlier color set, blue and light yellow, was adopted earlier at a Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1891.[tpl]cite web | title=University of Kentucky Traditions and songs | accessdate=July 24, 2012 | publisher=University of Kentucky | url=http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/subpages/traditions.html [/tpl] The particular hue of blue was determined from a necktie, which was used to demonstrate the color of royal blue.
On February 15, 1882, Administration Building was the first building of three completed on the present campus. Three years later, the college formed the Agricultural Experiment Station, which research issues relating to agribusiness, food processing, nutrition, water and soil resources and the environment.[tpl]cite web | title=agResearch | publisher=University of Kentucky College of Agriculture | year=2007 | accessdate=January 7, 2007 | url=http://www.ca.uky.edu/research/ [/tpl] This was followed up by the creation of the university's Agricultural Extension service in 1910, which was one of the first in the United States.[tpl]cite web | title=History Briefs | publisher=University of Kentucky | date=May 23, 2007 | url=http://www.uky.edu/Home/AboutUK/history2.html [/tpl] The extension service became a model of the federally mandated programs that were required beginning in 1914.

===Coeducational school: Modern period===

Patterson Hall, the school's first women's dormitory, was constructed in 1904. Residents had to cross a swampy depression, where )))Indeed iop uiopat the University led to the creation of the College of Home Economics in 1916, and Mary E. Sweeney was promoted from chair of the Department of Home Economics to Dean of the College. (Later renamed the College of Human Environmental Sciences, this educational unit was folded into the College of Agriculture in 2003 as the School of Human Environmental Sciences). The College of Commerce was established in 1925, known today as the Gatton College of Business and Economics.
In 1929, Memorial Hall was completed, dedicated to the 2,756 Kentuckians who died in World War I. This was followed up by the new King Library, which opened in 1931 and was named for a long-time library director, Margaret I. King. The university became racially integrated in 1949 when Lyman T. Johnson, an African American, won a lawsuit to be admitted to the graduate program.[tpl]cite web | url=http://sweb.uky.edu/StudentOrgs/SDC/markers/DesegregationJohnson1.html | title=Desegregation of UK - Historical Marker | accessdate=July 24, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite press_release | url=http://www.uky.edu/PR/News/Archives/1999/APRIL99/johnsondedi.htm | title=UK DEDICATES HISTORICAL MARKER FOR 50 YEARS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS| publisher=University of Kentucky | date=April 22, 1999 | accessdate=July 24, 2012[/tpl]
Ground was broken for the Albert B. Chandler Hospital in 1955,when Governor of Kentucky Happy Chandler recommended that the Kentucky General Assembly appropriate $5 million for the creation of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and a medical center at the university.[tpl] cite news | title=Officials Break Ground on New UK Albert B. Chandler Hospital | first=Amanda | last=Nelson | publisher=University of Kentucky | date=May 30m 2007 |url=http://news.uky.edu/news/display_article.php?artid=2334[/tpl] This was completed after a series of studies were conducted that highlighted the health needs of the citizens, as well as the need to train more physicians for the state. Five years later, the College of Medicine and College of Nursing opened, followed by the College of Dentistry in 1962.
In 1959, the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce opened and began training professionals at the masters and doctoral level for careers in international affairs.  The program was the vision of UK’s first president James Kennedy Patterson who had identified the need for the United States to develop a cadre of professionals to advance its diplomatic and commercial interests around the globe.  Patterson bequeathed his entire estate to establish this entity.
Authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly and signed by Governor Bert Combs on March 6, 1962, a mandate was placed upon the University of Kentucky to form a community college system. Two years later, the Board of Trustees implements the legislation and established the Community College System, creating centers in Covington, Ashland, Fort Knox, Cumberland, Henderson and Elizabethtown. In 1969, the Patterson Office Tower was completed, currently the tallest building on campus.
thumb|Miller Hall In May 1970, students at the university began protesting the shootings at Kent State University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nunncenter.org/oralhistoryprojects/protests-at-uk/ |title=40th anniversary of Kent State protests at UK: Students burn ROTC Building Saving Stories | Saving Stories |publisher=Nunncenter.org |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2010[/tpl] In response, Governor Louie Nunn deferred to the National Guard in an attempt to disperse the protesters. An outdated ROTC building was destroyed by fire. The Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries has 13 oral history interviews with participants in the protests, university officials as well as former governor Nunn.  Nine years later, the Singletary Center for the Arts opened, named in honor of former university president Otis Singletary. In 1979, the University of Kentucky hosted the first Kentucky Women Writers Conference, which is now the longest-running conference of its kind. The Kentucky Women Writers Conference is now in its 31st year.

===Contemporary history===

In 1997, the Kentucky General Assembly reorganized the community college system, withdrawing the university's jurisdiction from all but the Lexington Community College. The other colleges were merged with the Kentucky Technical College system and were placed under a separate board of control.
On April 3, 1998, work began on the William T. Young Library, which was the largest university project at the time of completion.[tpl]Cite news | last = Jester | first = Art | last2 = Stepp | first2 = Holly | title = Hub of the University | date = March 22, 1998 | newspaper = Herald-Leader | page = 2 | postscript =  [/tpl] The six-level William T. Young Library was constructed on south campus and the largest book endowment among all public university libraries in the country. Nine-years later, on April 13, 2007, an entire city block of neighborhood homes were demolished and ground was broken for the Biological Pharmaceutical Complex Building, the largest academic building in the state of Kentucky, and one of the largest in the United States.[tpl]cite web | title = Future of Pharmacy | date=April 13, 2007 | publisher=University of Kentucky Albert B.

In 1997, the Kentucky General Assembly formed a compact with the university. The Top 20 Plan mandates that the University of Kentucky becomes a Top 20 public research university by 2020.[tpl]cite web|last=Todd|first=Lee|title=UK Reaching Top 20 Critical to Moving Kentucky Forward | publisher=University of Kentucky|date=February 28, 2007|url=http://www.uky.edu/OPBPA/whytop20.htm [/tpl] According to the compact, states with "Top 20" universities feature higher average household incomes, higher education attainments, healthier lives and more financial security.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 20 Business Plan Presentation | publisher=University of Kentucky|year=2005|accessdate=May 28, 2007 | url=http://www.uky.edu/OPBPA/Top20/Top20_sm.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] As a result, fewer citizens live in poverty and as a result, fewer public dollars are spent on health care. The plan would also spur technological advancements due to university-based research and increase the marketability of the state to investors.
As part of the "Top 20" plan, the university plans to,
The "Top 20" plan has already produced results,
In 2000, to help finance the "Top 20" plan, the university launched "The Campaign for the University of Kentucky", a $600 million fundraising effort that was used to "enhance facilities, academic programs, public service, and scholarships." It passed that goal and the effort was raised to $1 billion. In March 2007, $1.022 billion was raised, months before the fundraising effort was set to end.[tpl] cite news | url=http://www.uky.edu/ukymain/spots/spot-10106.html | title=Surpassing the Goal | publisher=University of Kentucky | year=2007 [/tpl]
According to the Statewide Facilities Condition Assessment Report released on April 4, 2007, the University needs $12.5 billion to complete the 1997 mandate to become a "Top 20" institution.[tpl]cite news | last=Jester | first=Art | title=Report: Kentucky needs $12.5 billion for university facilities by 2020 | publisher=Herald-Leader | date=April 7, 2007 | url=http://kentucky.com/181/story/33904.html | accessdate=April 3, 2007 [/tpl]

Students currently run two independent FM stations. The first, 91.3 FM WUKY, is an Triple-A station and was the first university-owned FM radio station in the United States and Kentucky's first public radio station.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wuky.org/history | title=History | publisher=WUKY | accessdate=July 24, 2012[/tpl] The operations started on October 17, 1940 as WBKY out of Beattyville, although the station moved five years later to Lexington.
In 1971, WBKY was one of the first to carry NPR's "All Things Considered" and helped debut National Public Radio, changing its call letters to WUKY in 1989 to better reflect its affiliation with the university. In 2007, it became the first Lexington radio station to broadcast in high-definition digital radio.

The "Wildcats" became associated with the university shortly after a football victory over Illinois on October 9, 1909. The then-chief of the military department, Commandant Carbuiser, stated that the team had "fought like wildcats." The slogan was later adopted by the university, and a costumed mascot debuted in 1976.
In 1930, then-high school coach Adolph Rupp was hired as a basketball coach for the university. He had a career that would span 42 years until 1972. During his tenure, he led the men's basketball team to four NCAA championships in 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958. The Wildcats later won a fifth championship under Joe B. Hall in 1978, another in 1996 under Rick Pitino and the next under Orlando "Tubby" Smith in 1998. In 2007, the University of Kentucky named Billy Gillispie as the head coach of the men's basketball team and on March 30, 2009, the University named John Calipari as the head coach of the Wildcats. Calipari coached the team to its eighth national title in 2012.
On December 21, 2009, the men's basketball team reached another milestone, becoming the first college basketball team to reach 2000 all time wins. The 2000th win was an 88–44 victory over the Drexel University Dragons. Kentucky was also the first school to reach the 1000 all time wins, which they accomplished in 1969.
The university boasts of numerous national championships, with its latest coming in 2012 when the men's basketball team won its eighth national title. UK also lost to Uconn in the 2014 championship game.

==Campus==

The University of Kentucky offers seven main dining facilities, 23 residence halls, and numerous recreation facilities spread between three distinct campuses: north, south, and central. It is also home to more than 250 student-run organizations. The annual cost per student to reside in the dormitories at the University of Kentucky in 2012 was $4,135.University of Kentucky at Locate Colleges
The university campus is home to numerous notable structures, such as Main Building, a four-story administration building dating to 1882, which was gutted by fire on May 15, 2001.
