"Männer sind Schweine" ("Men are pigs") is a pop/rock song by Die Ärzte. It's the thirteenth track from their 1998 album 13. The tongue-in-cheek lyrics are based on the cliché of men always wanting sex, warning girls not to fall for their false promises of true love.

==Ein Schwein namens Männer==

The song has also been released on the single Ein Schwein namens Männer ("A pig called men"). It's the first single release from the album 13. This was the band's first single to reach number one in the German charts.

==The video==

The video clip features a digital Lara Croft model, Eidos Interactive officially approved Lara's appearance. It starts with the band performing the song in an old warehouse. When Lara appears, the clip transforms into a John Woo style action movie including excessive shooting, fist fights and lots of sound effects actually eclipsing the song.
