==History==

The origins of Edith Cowan University date back to 1902 with the establishment of Claremont Teachers College, the first tertiary education institution in Western Australia
Other teacher training colleges were formed over the years, including Graylands Teachers College (GTC), the Western Australian Secondary Teachers College (WASTC), Nedlands College of Advanced Education (NCAE), Mount Lawley Teachers College (MLTC) and Churchlands Teachers College.
In 1982 these colleges were all merged to form the Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) - with campuses in Churchlands, Nedlands, Claremont, Bunbury and Joondalup.
Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) was granted university status on 1 January 1991[tpl]cite web|url=http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Agency_Detail.asp?Entity=Global&Search=&Op=Any&Page=41&Id=250&SearchPage=Global |title=WACAE Details - State Records Office of WA |accessdate=16 August 2010 |date=16 August 2010 |publisher=State Records Office of Western Australia[/tpl] and changed its name to Edith Cowan University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Agency_Detail.asp?Entity=Global&Search=&Op=Any&Page=41&Id=249&SearchPage=Global |title=ECU Details - State Records Office of WA |accessdate=16 August 2010 |date=16 August 2010 |publisher=State Records Office of Western Australia[/tpl]
Edith Cowan University was named after the first woman to be elected to an Australian Parliament, Edith Dircksey Cowan, and is the only Australian university named after a woman. Cowan worked tirelessly to raise funds for students to attend universities in other states, prior to a university being built in Western Australia, obtaining government support for her scheme.Edith Dircksey Cowan http://www.ecu.edu.au/about-ecu/welcome-to-ecu/edith-dircksey-cowan Her work in this area was acknowledged by naming Western Australia's oldest education institution and newest university after her, as well as her image being added to the Australian $50 note.
Cowan believed that education was the key to growth, change and improvement and her contribution to the development of Western Australian education was significant. She strove to achieve social justice and campaigned for the rights of women, children and families, for the poor, the poorly educated and the elderly. She promoted sex education in schools, migrant welfare, and the formation of infant health centres, and was instrumental in obtaining votes for women in Western Australia.
In 1991, the university purchased the house that Cowan, her husband and family resided in for approximately 20 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36356521 |title=Edith Cowan House : the reconstruction |accessdate=16 August 2010 |date=16 August 2010 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] The house was reconstructed on the university's Joondalup Campus[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105390041753483824209.00044742d2db39ccd9b7f&t=h&z=18 |title=Edith Cowan University - Joondalup Campus - Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl] with the assistance of the West Coast College of TAFE, the reconstructed house was opened in 1997.
