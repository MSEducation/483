Cytosolic beta-glucosidase, also known as cytosolic beta-glucosidase-like protein 1, is a beta-glucosidase ([tpl]EC number|3.2.1.21[/tpl]) enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GBA3 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: glucosidase| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=57733| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = de Graaf M, van Veen IC, van der Meulen-Muileman IH, Gerritsen WR, Pinedo HM, Haisma HJ | title = Cloning and characterization of human liver cytosolic beta-glycosidase | journal = Biochem.

==Function==

Cytosolic beta-glucosidase  is a predominantly liver enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes beta-D-glucoside and beta-D-galactoside, but not any known physiologic beta-glycoside, suggesting that it may be involved in detoxification of plant glycosides. GBA3 also has significant neutral glycosylceramidase activity ([tpl]EC number|3.2.1.62[/tpl]), suggesting that it may be involved in a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway of glucosylceramide metabolism.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hayashi Y, Okino N, Kakuta Y, Shikanai T, Tani M, Narimatsu H, Ito M | title = Klotho-related protein is a novel cytosolic neutral beta-glycosylceramidase | journal = J.
