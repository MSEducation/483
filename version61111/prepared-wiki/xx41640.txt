Norovirus is a genus of genetically diverse single-stranded RNA, non-enveloped viruses in the Caliciviridae family. The known viruses in the genus are all considered to be the variant strains of a single species called Norwalk virus. The viruses are transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces.[tpl]cite journal |author=Said MA, Perl TM, Sears CL |title=Healthcare epidemiology: gastrointestinal flu: norovirus in health care and long-term care facilities |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=47 |issue=9 |pages=1202–8 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18808354 |doi=10.1086/592299 [/tpl] Noroviruses are the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans, and affect people of all ages.[tpl]cite journal |author=Morillo SG, Timenetsky Mdo C |title=Norovirus: an overview |journal=Revista Da Associação Médica Brasileira (1992) |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=453–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21876931 |doi= 10.1016/s0104-4230(11)70094-x|url=[/tpl]
Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Norovirus/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Norovirus - NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=2014-01-20 |accessdate=2014-02-09[/tpl] The virus affects around 267 million people and causes over 200,000 deaths each year; these deaths are usually in less developed countries and in the very young, elderly and immuno-suppressed.Debbink K, Lindesmith LC, Donaldson EF, Baric RS (2012) Norovirus Immunity and the Great Escape" PLoS Pathog 8(10)  e1002921.

Winter vomiting bug is a common term for noroviruses in the UK, because the virus tends to cause vomiting and to spread more easily in winter, when people tend to spend more time indoors and near to each other.
After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary with one publication drawing the conclusion that protective immunity to the same strain of norovirus lasts for six months, but that all such immunity is gone after two years.  
Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories,  and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person.
Norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents, as it does not have a lipid envelope.
The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes approximately 90% of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world, and may be responsible for 50% of all foodborne outbreaks  of gastroenteritis  in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htm |title=Norovirus: Technical Fact Sheet |publisher=National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.
Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are  available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.

==Virology==

===Transmission===

Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection[tpl]cite journal |author=Morillo SG, Timenetsky Mdo C |title=Norovirus: an overview |journal=Revista Da Associação Médica Brasileira (1992) |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=453–8 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21876931 |doi= 10.1016/s0104-4230(11)70094-x|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-42302011000400023&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en[/tpl] (some research suggests as few as five). Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit, and can be aerosolized by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up."I've lost my appetite...": New Scientist article on spread of viral food poisoning across a restaurant by eating near where someone has vomited The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[tpl]cite journal |author=Atmar RL |title=Norwalk Virus Shedding after Experimental Human Infection |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=1553–7 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18826818 |pmc=2609865 |doi=10.3201/eid1410.080117|author-separator=, |author2= Opekun AR |author3= Gilger MA |author4=and others |displayauthors=3 [/tpl]
Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively, and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. 126 people were dining at six tables in December 1998; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the attack rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.
In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people. A CDC study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools and ice machines.
Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that have not been sufficiently heated poses a high risk for norovirus infection.Shellfish consumption and the risk of norovirus infection Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.

Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.
Noroviruses can genetically be classified into five different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, and GV), which can be further divided into different genetic clusters or genotypes. For example, genogroup II, the most prevalent human genogroup, presently contains 19 genotypes. Genogroups I, II and IV infect humans, whereas genogroup III infects bovine species, and genogroup V has recently been isolated in mice.
Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.
Noroviruses from Genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.
Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe. Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the viral capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shirato H |title=Norovirus and histo-blood group antigens |journal=Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=95–103 |year=2011 |pmid=21519121 |doi= |url=[/tpl]
A 2008 study suggests the protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[tpl]cite journal |author=McCartney SA, Thackray LB, Gitlin L, Gilfillan S, Virgin Iv HW, Colonna M|title=MDA-5 Recognition of a Murine Norovirus |journal=PLoS Pathog |date=July 18, 2008 |pmid=18636103 |volume=4 |issue=7 |page=e1000108 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000108 |pmc=2443291 |editor1-last=Baric |editor1-first=Ralph S.[/tpl]  Interestingly, some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.Researchers Discover Primary Sensor That Detects Stomach Viruses Newswise, Retrieved on July 20, 2008.
A 2010 study suggested a specific genetic version of norovirus (which would not be distinguishable from other types of the virus using standard viral antibody tests) interacts with a specific mutation in the ATG16L1 gene to help trigger symptomatic Crohn's disease in mice that have been subjected to a chemical that causes intestinal injury similar to the process in humans. (There are other similar ways for such diseases to happen like this, and this study in itself does not prove norovirus causes Crohn's in humans).

===Structure===

Noroviruses contain a positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kbp, encoding a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2). The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy and are between 27-38 nm in size.
The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.
The estimated mutation rate (1.21[tpl]e|−2[/tpl] to 1.41 [tpl]e|−2[/tpl] substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[tpl]cite journal | author = Victoria M, Miagostovich MP, Ferreira MS, Vieira CB, Fioretti JM, Leite JP, Colina R, Cristina J | year = 2009 | title = Bayesian coalescent inference reveals high evolutionary rates and expansion of Norovirus populations | url = | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 9 | issue = 5| pages = 927–932 | pmid = 19559104 | last2 = Miagostovich | last3 = Ferreira | last4 = Vieira | last5 = Fioretti | last6 = Leite | last7 = Colina | last8 = Cristina | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2009.06.014 [/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus begins to replicate within the small intestine. After approximately one to two days, norovirus infection symptoms can appear. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure, and lasts for 24–60 hours. The disease is usually self-limiting, and characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, coughs, and low-grade fever may occur.
Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 300 each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or not treated.

==Prevention==

Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope. Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htmhttp://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list_g_norovirus.pdf[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/interviews/interview/838/ |title=Gastroenteritis and Noroviruses - Dr Jim Grey, Health Protection Agency |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2014-02-09[/tpl]
In health-care environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems are used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.

The two vaccines rely on using a virus-like particle that is made of the Norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.

==Epidemiology==

Epidemiological data from developing countries about the importance of norovirus in pediatric diarrhea are limited. Recently, in Nicaragua, it has been observed that norovirus is responsible for 11% of the diarrhea cases occurring in children less than five years of age at community level and 15% of the moderate to severe cases requiring intravenous rehydration.Bucardo F, Nordgren J, Carlsson B, Paniagua M, Lindgren PE, Espinoza F, Svensson L., "Pediatric norovirus diarrhea in Nicaragua", J. Clin. Microbiology, 46: 8 (August 2008), pp. 2573–80.
In the Guangdong province of the People's Republic of China, the Provincial Health Department said on December 17, 2010, that it had confirmed 429 cases of norovirus infection in the November 2010 outbreak in Conghua, Guangzhou, but no one died from it.Norovirus infects 429 people in Guangzhou (CNTV reports)
During a two-year (October 2011–January 2013) surveillance for norovirus infection in Minnesota among callers to a complaint-based foodborne illness hotline who reported diarrhea or vomiting, 241 complainants were tested with 127 (52.7%) positive for norovirus. Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne disease in the United States.Saupe AA, Kaehler D, Cebelinski EA, Nefzger B, Hall AJ, Smith KE.

==History==

The norovirus was originally named the "Norwalk agent" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name "Norwalk virus". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae. The name was shortened to "norovirus" after being identified in a number of outbreaks on cruise ships and receiving attention throughout the United States. The name "norovirus" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.ICTVdB Management (2006). 00.012.0.03. Norovirus. In: ICTVdB—The Universal Virus Database, version 4. Büchen-Osmond, C. (Ed), Columbia University, New York, USA In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encourage the media, national health authorities and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus, when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name "Noro". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.
In addition to "Norwalk agent" and "Norwalk virus", the virus previously has been called "Norwalk-like virus", "small, round-structured viruses" (SRSVs), and "Snow Mountain virus".
Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include "winter vomiting disease",[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2001 |title=	'Norwalk-Like Viruses' Public Health Consequences and Outbreak Management |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports - Recommendations and Reports |volume=50 |issue= RR-9 |pages=1–18 |publisher=US CDC |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5009a1.htm |accessdate= [/tpl] "winter vomiting bug",[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-16509830 | title=Norovirus shuts wards and unit at three Sussex hospitals | work=BBC News | date=January 11, 2012 | accessdate=January 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-16531668 | title=Norovirus at Norfolk hospitals: Disruption continues | publisher=BBC News | date=January 12, 2012 | accessdate=January 20, 2012[/tpl] "viral gastroenteritis", and "acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis".
