[[Beware (EP)]]

CATEGORIES: Misfits (band) EPs, 1980 EPs, Plan 9 Records EPs

Beware was the fifth release from the Lodi, New Jersey horror punk band The Misfits. Since it was originally intended to be available for the group's 1979 UK tour, it combined two earlier, out of print releases, with the substitution of one new track. 

==Album information==

This 12" EP was co-released in the UK in January 1980 by Armageddon/Spartan Records and in the US by Glenn Danzig's Plan 9 Records as number PLP9.  A pressing run of 3000 was ordered with 3120 actually being delivered by the pressing plant.  A limited number of copies were sold within the US through the Misfits Fiend Club, which included an 8"x10" photo of the album cover as an insert. 
The first four songs were the same mixes used on the Bullet EP, but with the tracks in reverse order.  The other side was essentially the Horror Business EP.  However, the song "Children In Heat" was replaced by the only previously unreleased track, "Last Caress."
The entire EP was recorded at C.I. Recording in New York City, but on two separate occasions, one year apart. Bullet had been recorded in January 1978.  Horror Business was recorded one year later. "Last Caress" was also recorded at the first session, but was remixed, with reverb added to the vocals and a guitar overdub recorded in September 1979 by Glenn Danzig and Bobby Steele. It was the only track ever to be released from that particular mixing session.
"Last Caress" was later covered by Metallica with the song "Green Hell" off Garage Inc. and The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited. Punk rock band NOFX also covered "Last Caress" on the Misfits tribute, "Violent World" Others who have covered this song include AFI on Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes, Batman, Eye Q, a rockabilly version by the Bricats on Swing-A-Billy Chartbusters, acoustic versions by Local H and Papa M, and a jazz/lounge version by Daniel Jordan.
