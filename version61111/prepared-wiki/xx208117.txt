==History==

The hospital opened in 1972, as a foresight of the demands of the Craigavon new town, replacing Carleton House, Lurgan Hospital, Banbridge Hospital amongst others as the main acute centre in the region. Until the 2006 reform of the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care trusts, the hospital was the main centre of the Craigavon and Banbridge Health and Social Care Trust, which was amalgamated with several other trusts to form the Southern Health and Social Care Trust.
In June 2011, CAH was granted University Teaching Hospital status by Queen's University, Belfast, alongside the creation of an Undergraduate sub-deanery within the Southern Trust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southerntrust.hscni.net/about/1806.htm|title=Queen’s University Belfast visit Craigavon to award teaching hospital status |date=June 21, 2011[/tpl]
