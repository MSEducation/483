Primrose is presumed to have drowned during a gale "some 180 miles off the South Carolina coast" which sunk his 33Â ft yacht (a Moody 33), the Demon of Hamble.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Primrose is notable for his contribution to designs that changed some of the thinking behind cruising yachts. His Moody 33 (mk 1) centre cockpit design originated from his work in 1973 with A H Moody & Sons Ltd at Swanwick near Southampton. The boats were built in production by Marine Projects (Plymouth) Ltd, and led to the development of successive models: Moody 30, 36 and 39, all built at Plymouth. The custom Moody 42 was built by Moody's firm in Swanwick, with a centre cockpit and aft cockpit/deck saloon variants. In 1972 Angus Primrose designed the Warrior 35, built by Trident Marine Ltd. The long keel hull was also developed in various forms as the aft cockpit Challenger 35 and the deck saloon version the Voyager 35.
