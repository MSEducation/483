</ref> Critics of the government such as [[Joe Clark]] then pointed out that in the previous week, the ''Globe & Mail'' had run on its front page a photo of Canadian soldiers turning over POWs to American troops.<ref name="CBC News" /> Eggleton maintained that he and the rest of the Cabinet been kept unaware that the Canadian Forces were taking POWs in Afghanistan and turning them to the Americans, claiming that he had only learned of the policy of handing over POWs several days after the photo had appeared in the ''Globe''.<ref name="CBC News" /> When pressed by opposition critics about his apparent ignorance of what was Canada's policy on turning over POWs captured in Afghanistan, Eggleton then claimed that he had not only forgotten that he had been briefed by senior bureaucrats that Canadian forces were to hand over POWs to the Americans, but that he had also forgotten to inform the Cabinet.<ref name="Globe and Mail">
</ref> When pressed by the opposition critics to fire Eggleton under the grounds that the Minister of Defense was either lying to Parliament or, if his story was true, that someone so forgetful should not be directing the Defense Department in the midst of a war, Chrétien informed the House of Commons that: "Myself, cabinet and the Liberal Party have confidence in the abilities and dedication of the Minister of National Defence", and that Eggleton would stay on.<ref name="Globe and Mail"/>
In early January 2002, Chrétien's Quebec lieutenant Alfonso Gagliano resigned as Public Works minister following allegations from the "whistle-blower" Chairman of Canada Lands Jon Grant that Gagliano had involved in improper activities with Canada Lands by selling off Crown land at below market rates to politically well connected buyers.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 346. About the sale of a Montreal property valued at $9 million which was sold to Entreprises El-Pine Inc, a firm owned by a well known Liberal contributor for $4 million, the real estate agent Shelia Weitzman told The Montreal Gazette: "That price was a joke". Grant alleged that an aide of Gagliano's had told him in 1998: "The rest of Canada is yours, Quebec is ours", meaning Grant should not concern himself with any land sales in Quebec. Grant claimed that he gone to the Cabinet and the PMO three times between 1998-2002 to express his concerns about Gagliano and certain land sales in Quebec without result, finally leading him to go public with his allegations.[ref]
