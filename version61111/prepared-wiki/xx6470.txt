[[Laser science]]

CATEGORIES: Laser science

Laser science or laser physics is a branch of optics that describes the theory and practice of lasers. 
Laser science is principally concerned with quantum electronics, laser construction, optical cavity design, the physics of producing a population inversion in laser media, and the temporal evolution of the light field in the laser. It is also concerned with the physics of laser beam propagation, particularly the physics of Gaussian beams, with laser applications, and with associated fields such as nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

==History==

Laser science predates the invention of the laser itself. Albert Einstein created the foundations for the laser and maser in 1917, via a paper in which he re-derived Max Planck’s law of radiation using a formalism based on probability coefficients (Einstein coefficients) for the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.[tpl]cite journal |first=Albert |last=Einstein |title=Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung |trans_title=On the Quantum Theory of Radiation|language=German |year=1917[/tpl] The existence of stimulated emission was confirmed in 1928 by Rudolf W. Ladenburg.Steen, W. M. "Laser Materials Processing", 2nd Ed. 1998. In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant predicted the use of stimulated emission to amplify "short" waves;[tpl]cite web |url=http://wwwold.unimib.it/ateneo/presentazione/direzione_ammva/prevenzione_protezione/Semin_sicur_laser.ppt |title=Il rischio da laser: cosa è e come affrontarlo; analisi di un problema non così lontano da noi |language=Italian |trans_title=The risk from laser: what it is and what it is like facing it; analysis of a problem which is thus not far away from us. |work=Programma Corso di Formazione Obbligatorio Anno 2004 |year=2004 |first=Dimitri |last=Batani |format=Powerpoint |accessdate=January 1, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614115935/http://wwwold.unimib.it/ateneo/presentazione/direzione_ammva/prevenzione_protezione/Semin_sicur_laser.ppt |archivedate = June 14, 2007[/tpl] In 1947, Willis E. Lamb and R. C. Retherford found apparent stimulated emission in hydrogen spectra and effected the first demonstration of stimulated emission; in 1950, Alfred Kastler (Nobel Prize for Physics 1966) proposed the method of optical pumping, experimentally confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1966/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1966 |work=Presentation Speech by Professor Ivar Waller |accessdate=October 17, 2010[/tpl] 
The theoretical principles describing the operation of a microwave laser (a maser) were first described by Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov at the All-Union Conference on Radio Spectroscopy in May 1952. The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 for their research in the field of stimulated emission,.
The first working laser (a pulsed ruby laser) was demonstrated on May 16, 1960, by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Laboratories.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/284158_townes.html |title=The first laser |publisher=University of Chicago |author=Townes, Charles Hard[/tpl]
