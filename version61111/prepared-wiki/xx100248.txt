The World Championship commenced on 26 May 1963, and ended on 28 December after ten races.

==Season summary==

Jim Clark won his first championship with seven wins to two by Graham Hill and one by John Surtees in a revised Ferrari. This record number of wins stood until it was beaten by Ayrton Senna in 1988 in the McLaren MP4/4, one of the most dominant cars of all time, in a season with sixteen rounds. The ATS venture, founded by ex-Ferrari workers, a complete disaster which ruined Phil Hill's Grand Prix career, was unrelated to the late 1970s German operation which was marginally more successful.
