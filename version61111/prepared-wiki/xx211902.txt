William Chesney "Chez" Reavie (born November 12, 1981) is an American professional golfer. 
Reavie was born in Wichita, Kansas. He played college golf at Arizona State University.
Reavie was a rookie member of the PGA Tour in 2008. He finished 18th on the money list on the Nationwide Tour in 2007 to earn his card. He played on the Nationwide Tour from 2005 through 2007. On July 27, 2008, Reavie won the 2008 RBC Canadian Open. The win, his first on the PGA Tour, earned him $900,000 and a two-year exemption to remain on the Tour. Knee surgery limited Reavie in 2010 and he began the 2011 season on a major medical exemption where he had thirteen events to keep his Tour Card. Reavie did not earn enough to retain full tour privileges, but by merely making the cut at the 2011 Memorial Tournament (the final start of his exemption), he earned conditional status for the rest of 2011. Reavie still managed to play in 22 events, making 15 cuts, and placing high enough to earn a spot in the FedEx Cup playoffs. His earnings of over one million dollars prior to the FedEx Cup secured his 2012 Tour Card. He nearly won his first event in over three years at the 2011 Deutsche Bank Championship, but had problems on the 18th hole before losing to Webb Simpson on the second playoff hole. He would finish 10th in the FedEx Cup, 34th on the money list with $2,285,067, and an OWGR rank of 67th after ending 2010 762nd in the world.
After a mediocre 2012 saw Reavie finish 135th on the money list, he went back to Q School to regain his Tour card. He finished T22 and is one of the last players and last former PGA Tour winner to earn a Tour card through Q School.
