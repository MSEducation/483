The New Age movement is a Western spiritual movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and metaphysical traditions and infusing them with influences from self-help and motivational psychology, holistic health, parapsychology, consciousness research and quantum physics".[tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=12[/tpl] The term New Age refers to the coming astrological Age of Aquarius.
The movement aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and pluralistic.[tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=8[/tpl] It holds to "a holistic worldview",[tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=11[/tpl] emphasising that the Mind, Body, and Spirit are interrelatedMelton, J.

Langone, Ph.D. Cult Observer, 1993, Volume 10, No. 1. What Is "New Age"?, retrieved 2006-07 It attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality"[tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=10[/tpl] and embraces a number of forms of mainstream science as well as other forms of science that are considered fringe.
The origins of the movement can be found in Medieval astrology and alchemy, such as the writings of Paracelsus, in Renaissance interests in Hermeticism, in 18th-century mysticism, such as that of Emanuel Swedenborg, and in beliefs in animal magnetism espoused by Franz Mesmer. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, authors such as Godfrey Higgins and the esotericists Eliphas Levi, Helena Blavatsky, and George Gurdjieff articulated specific histories, cosmologies, and some of the basic philosophical principles that would influence the movement. It experienced a revival as a result of the work of individuals such as Alice Bailey and organizations such as the Theosophical Society. It gained further momentum in the 1960s, taking influence from metaphysics, perennial philosophy, self-help psychology, and the various Indian gurus who visited the West during that decade.[tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=8–10[/tpl]  In the 1970s, it developed a social and political component.
The New Age movement includes elements of older spiritual and religious traditions ranging from monotheism through pantheism, pandeism, panentheism, and polytheism combined with science and Gaia philosophy; particularly archaeoastronomy, astronomy, ecology, environmentalism, the Gaia hypothesis, UFO religions, psychology, and physics.
New Age practices and philosophies sometimes draw inspiration from major world religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Chinese folk religion, Christianity, Hinduism, Sufism (Islam), Judaism (especially Kabbalah), Sikhism; with strong influences from East Asian religions, Esotericism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Idealism, Neopaganism, New Thought, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Universalism, and Wisdom tradition.[tpl]Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=15–18[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

The author Nevill Drury claimed there are "four key precursors of the New Age", who had set the way for many of its widely held precepts.
The term New Age was used as early as 1809 by William Blake who described a coming era of spiritual and artistic advancement in his preface to Milton a Poem by stating: "... when the New Age is at leisure to pronounce, all will be set right ..."[tpl]Citation |last1=Blake |first1=William |last2=Sampson |first2=John |editor=John Sampson|title=The Poetical Works of William Blake: Including the Unpublished French Revolution; Together with the Minor Prophetic Books and Selections from the Four Zoas, Milton and Jerusalem |url=http://books.google.com/?id=uWblZFfnZEsC&pg=PA369&dq=Milton+%22New+Age%22#v=onepage&q=Milton%20%22New%20Age%22&f=false |accessdate=2010-10-05 |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location=Whitefish, Montana, US |isbn=978-1-4286-1155-9 |page=369 |chapter=Selections from Milton[/tpl]
Some of the New Age movement's constituent elements appeared initially in the 19th-century metaphysical movements: Spiritualism, Theosophy, and New Thought and also the alternative medicine movements of chiropractics and naturopathy. These movements have roots in Transcendentalism, Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and various earlier Western esoteric or occult traditions, such as the hermetic arts of astrology, magic, alchemy, and Kabbalah. The term New Age was used in this context in Madame Blavatsky's book The Secret Doctrine, published in 1888.[tpl]Citation|last=Spencer|first=Neil|title=True as the Stars above: Adventures in Modern Astrology|publisher=Victor Gollancz|year=2000|pages=115–27|isbn=978-0-575-06769-1[/tpl]
A weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled The New Age was published as early as 1894;General Introduction to The New Age 1907–1922, Brown University & The University of Tulsa—The Modernist Journals Project, retrieved 2010-10-28 it was sold to a group of socialist writers headed by Alfred Richard Orage and Holbrook Jackson in 1907. Contributors included H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and William Butler Yeats; the magazine became a forum for politics, literature, and the arts.Modernism In and Beyond the “Little Magazines”, Winter 2007, Professor Ann Ardis, Brown University"The New Age" Encyclopædia Britannica article on Orage Between 1908 and 1914, it was instrumental in pioneering the British avant-garde from Vorticism to Imagism. Orage met P. D. Ouspensky,  then a young original philosopher of metaphysics, in 1914 and began correspondence with Harry Houdini; he became less interested in literature and art with an increased focus on mysticism and other spiritual topics; the magazine was sold in 1921. According to Brown University, The New Age "... helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922."[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2006-07/06-143.html|title=Modernist Journals Project Has Grant to Digitize Rare Magazines|date=2007-04-19|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl]

===Development===

Popularisation behind these ideas has roots in the work of early 20th century writers such as D. H. Lawrence and William Butler Yeats. In the early- to mid-1900s, American mystic, theologian, and founder of the Association for Research and Enlightenment Edgar Cayce was a seminal influence on what later would be termed the New Age movement; he was known in particular for the practice some refer to as channeling.[tpl]Citation|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements|first=Michael|last=York|year=1995|page=60|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-8001-6[/tpl]
The psychologist Carl Jung was a proponent of the concept of the Age of Aquarius.[tpl]Citation|last=Stein|first=Murray|title=Transformation |publisher=Texas A & M University Press|year=2005|page=138|isbn=978-1-58544-449-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uZK_clekR9gC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=Carl+Gustav+Jung+++Age+of+Aquarius[/tpl] In a letter to his friend Peter Baynes, dated 12 August 1940, Jung wrote a passage:

Former Theosophist Rudolf Steiner and his Anthroposophical movement are a major influence. Neo-Theosophist Alice Bailey published the book Discipleship in the New Age (1944), which used the term New Age in reference to the transition from the astrological age of Pisces to Aquarius. While claims of racial bias in the writings of Rudolf Steiner and Alice Bailey were made,Acta no. 13, Analysis of Current Trends in Antisemitism.

Another early usage of the term, was by the American artist, mystic, and philosopher Walter Russell, who spoke of
in his essay "Power Through Knowledge", which was also published in 1944.(The University of Science and Philosophy). "Power Through Knowledge", retrieved 2010-10-12

===Contemporary usage of the term===

The subculture that later became known as New Age already existed in the early 1970s, based on and adopting ideas originally present in the counterculture of the 1960s. Two entities founded in 1962: the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California and the Findhorn Foundation—an intentional community which continues to operate the Findhorn Ecovillage near Findhorn, Moray, Scotland—played an instrumental role during the early growth period of the New Age movement.[tpl]Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | pp=38–39[/tpl]
Widespread usage of the term New Age began in the mid-1970s (reflected in the title of monthly periodical New Age Journal), "when increasing numbers of people ... began to perceive a broad similarity between a wide variety of "alternative ideas" and pursuits, and started to think of them as part of one "movement"".[tpl]sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97[/tpl] This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores".[tpl]Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first=John|last=Algeo|coauthors=Adele S. Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7[/tpl][tpl]Citation |title=Modernist Alchemy: Poetry and the Occult |first=Timothy |last=Materer |year=1995 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=14 |isbn=978-0-8014-3146-3 [/tpl] As a result of the large-scale activities surrounding the Harmonic Convergence in 1987, the American mass-media further popularised the term as a label for the alternative spiritual subculture, including practices such as meditation, channeling, crystal healing, astral projection, psychic experience, holistic health, simple living, and environmentalism; or belief in phenomena such as Earth mysteries, ancient astronauts, extraterrestrial life, unidentified flying objects, crop circles, and reincarnation. Several New Age publications appeared by the late 1980s such as Psychic Guide (later renamed Body, Mind & Spirit), Yoga Journal, New Age Voice, New Age Retailer, and NAPRA ReView by the New Age Publishers and Retailers Alliance.
Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: the production of the musical Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical (1967) with its opening song "Aquarius" and its memorable line "This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius";[tpl]Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | pp=10–11[/tpl] publication of Linda Goodman's best-selling astrology books Sun Signs (1968) and Love Signs (1978); the release of Shirley MacLaine's book Out on a Limb (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "Harmonic Convergence" planetary alignment on August 16 and 17, 1987,[tpl]Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335[/tpl] organized by José Argüelles in Sedona, Arizona. The claims of channelers Jane Roberts (Seth Material), Helen Schucman (A Course in Miracles), J. Z. Knight (Ramtha), Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations with God) (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to automatic writing), and Rene Gaudette (The Wonders) contributed to the movement's growth.[tpl]Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34[/tpl] Relevant New Age works include the writings of James Redfield, Eckhart Tolle, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Christopher Hills, Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, John Holland, Gary Zukav, Wayne Dyer, and Rhonda Byrne.

==Spirituality==

===Philosophy and cosmology===

While the New Age lacks any unified belief-system, many spiritual practices and philosophies feature commonly among adherents of the movement—sometimes referred to as New Agers.

===Religion and science===

==Lifestyle==

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, fairs, and festivals.[tpl]Citation|title=Alternative medicine: from New Age to mainstream|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/54102508.html|author=University of Montana|publisher=Montana Business Quarterly|date=Winter 1998[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]Citation|title=The New Age Movement: Religion, Culture and Society in the Age of Postmodernity|last=Heelas|first=Paul|year=1996|page=116|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-19332-6[/tpl]

===Holistic health===

Practitioners of New Age spirituality may use alternative medicine in addition to or in place of conventional medicine;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, ISBN 978-90-04-15355-4.[tpl]Citation|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/|title=National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|accessdate=2006-06-01[/tpl] while some conventional physicians have adopted aspects or the complete approach of holistic health. The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in the Republic of Ireland.

===Music===

New Age music is peaceful music of various styles intended to create inspiration, relaxation, and positive feelings while listening. Studies have determined that New Age music can be an effective component of stress management.[tpl]Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition|last=Lehrer|first=Paul M.|coauthors=David H.

The style began in the 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno and classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka.Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New Age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, and world music sounds to spiritual chanting from other cultures.
Many online radio stations exemplify New Age, which has always been a non-empirical phenomenon-intuitive-ethereal genre.  For example, Gaia Radio

He identifies two trends which he terms, " the rise of improvisational millennialism" and "the popularity of stigmatized knowledge". He voices concern that these trends could lead to mass hysteria and could have a devastating effect on American political life. Richard H.

The author Ken Wilber posits that most New Age thought falls into what he termed the pre/trans fallacy.[tpl]Citation |last=Wilber |first=Ken |title=The Collected Works of Ken Wilber |publisher=Shambhala Publications |location=Boston, MA, US |year=1999 |volume=3 |chapter=Introduction to the Third Volume |isbn=978-1-59030-321-4 |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/ |accessdate=2009-06-12 [/tpl] According to Wilber, human developmental psychology moves from the pre-personal, through the personal, then to the transpersonal (spiritually advanced or enlightened) level.[tpl]Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=250[/tpl] He regards 80 percent of New Age spirituality as pre-rational (pre-conventional) and as relying primarily on mythic-magical thinking; this contrasts with a post-rational (including and transcending rational) genuinely world-centric consciousness. Despite his criticism of most New Age thought, Wilber has been categorized as New Age due to his emphasis on a transpersonal view,Wouter J. Hanegraaff, New Age Religion and Western Culture, SUNY, 1998, pp.70 ("Ken Wilber ... defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'"). and more recently, as a philosopher.Marian de Souza (ed.), International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education.

===Indigenous peoples of the Americas===

Some adherents of traditional disciplines, such as the Lakota people—a tribe of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, reject "the expropriation of their ceremonial ways by non-Indians". They see the New Age movement as either not fully understanding, deliberately trivializing, or distorting their disciplines.[tpl]Citation|last=Fenelon|first=James V.|title=Culturicide, resistance, and survival of the Lakota ("Sioux Nation")|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DYDeLzTyWQQC&lpg=PA297&pg=PA297 |accessdate=2009-03-16|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8153-3119-3|pages=295–97[/tpl]
They have coined the term plastic medicine men to describe individuals, from within their own communities "who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole". The term plastic shaman has been applied to outsiders who identify themselves as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent.
The academic Ward Churchill criticized the New Age movement as an instrument of cultural imperialism that is exploitative of indigenous cultures by reducing them to a commodity to be traded. In Fantasies of the Master Race, he criticized the cultural appropriation of Native American culture and symbols in not only the New Age movement, but also in art and popular culture.[tpl]Citation|title=Fantasies of the Master Race: Literature, Cinema and the Colonization of American Indians|last=Churchill|first=Ward|authorlink=Ward Churchill|year=1992|publisher=Common Courage Press|location=|isbn=978-0-9628838-7-3|page=304[/tpl]

===Goddess movement===

Followers of the Goddess movement have severely criticized the New Age as fundamentally patriarchal, analytical rather than intuitive, and as supporting the status quo, particularly in its implicit gender roles. Monica Sjöö (1938–2005) wrote that New Age channelers were virtually all women, but the spirits they purported to channel, offering guidance to humanity, were nearly all male. Sjöö was highly critical of Theosophy, the "I AM" Activity, and particularly Alice Bailey, whom she saw as promoting Nazi-like Aryan ideals. Sjöö's writings also condemn the New Age for its support of communication and information processing technologies which, she believes, may produce harmful low-level electromagnetic radiation.Sjöö, Monica (1998).Bristol, England: Green Leaf Bookshop.

==Social and political movement==

While many commentators have focused on the personal aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a social and political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.Kyle, Richard G. (Autumn 1995).  "The Political Ideas of the New Age Movement".  Journal of Church and State, pp. 831–48.  Alternate version in Kyle, Richard (1994).  The New Age Movement in American Culture.  University Press of America, pp. 113–31.  ISBN 978-0-7618-0010-1.  In the 21st century, the political movement evolved in new directions.

===Late 20th century===

After the political turmoil of the 1960s, many activists in North America and Europe became disillusioned with traditional reformist and revolutionary political ideologies.Cloud, Dana L. (1994). "'Socialism of the Mind': The New Age of Post-Marxism".  In Simons, Herbert W.; Billig, Michael, eds. (1994).  After Postmodernism: Reconstructing Ideology Critique.  SAGE Publications, Chap. 10.  ISBN 978-0-8039-8878-1.  Alternate version in Cloud, Dana (1997).  Control and Consolation in American Life: Rhetoric of Therapy.  SAGE Publications, Chap. 6.  ISBN 978-0-7619-0506-6.  Some began searching for a new politics that gave special weight to such topics as consciousness, ecology, personal and spiritual development, community empowerment, and global unity.Gottlieb, Annie (1987).  Do You Believe in Magic?: Bringing the 60s Back Home.  Simon & Schuster, pp. 124–62.  ISBN 978-0-671-66050-5.Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, pp. 188–92.  ISBN 978-0-609-60467-0.  An outpouring of books from New Age thinkers acknowledged that search and attempted to articulate that politics.

All these books were issued by major publishers.  Some became international bestsellers.  By the 1980s, New Age political ideas were being discussed in big-city newspapersSidenbladh, Erik (5 October 1980). "Krerativ Rorelse for 'Den Nya Tidsaldern'".  Svenska Dagbladet (Stockholm), "Idag" section, p. 1.  Swedish language publication.Thomas, Bill (17 April 1984). "Now 'New Age' Activists Search for Alternatives".  The Baltimore Sun, pp. B1–2. and established political magazines.McClaughry, John (August 1980). "What's This New Age Stuff?"  Reason, pp. 46–47.  In addition, some of the New Age's own periodicals were regularly addressing social and political issues.  In the U.S., observers pointed to Leading Edge Bulletin,Ferguson (1980), cited above, p. 426.  New Age Journal,Gottlieb (1987), cited above, p. 372.Satin (1978), cited above, p. 316.

New York Times Service article.  Other such periodicals included New Humanity (England),Ferguson (1980), cited above, pp. 229 and 410. Alterna (Denmark),Ferguson (1980), cited above, p. 409. Odyssey (South Africa), and World Union from the Sri Aurobindo Ashram (India).
As with any political movement, organizations sprang up to generate popular support for New Age political ideas and policy positions.  In the U.S., commentators identified the New Age Caucus of California,Satin (1978), cited above, pp. 339–40.Henderson (1981), cited above, p. 383. the New World Alliance,Clark, Jerome (1990).

A publication of the Association for Humanistic Psychology.  Accessed 23 August 2012.  There may have been more New Age political organizing outside the U.S.; writer-activists pointed to the Future in Our Hands movement in Norway (which claimed 20,000 adherents out of a population of four million),Ferguson (1980), cited above, pp. 409–10. the early European Green   movements,Satin (1978), cited above, pp. 14–15. and the Values Party of New Zealand.Henderson (1980), cited above, pp. 373 and 397.
Although these books, periodicals, and organizations did not speak with one voice, commentators found that many of them sounded common themes:
Over time, these themes began to cohere.  By the 1980s, observers in both North America and EuropeJamison, Andrew (2001).  The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation.  Cambridge University Press, p. 5.  ISBN 978-0-521-79252-3.Zizek, Slavoj (2000).  The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology.  Verso Books, pp. 1–2.  ISBN 978-1-85984-291-1. were acknowledging the emergence of a New Age political "ideology".

===Political objections at century’s end===

Toward the end of the 20th century, criticisms were being directed at the New Age political project from many quarters,Sessions, George (23 September 1987).  "Deep Ecology and the New Age".  Earth First! Journal, pp. 27–30.  Deep ecologist says New Age politics is too enamored of high technology, space exploration, and computer management systems.  Accessed 15 September 2012.Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  American Purpose, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 21–22.  Mainstream conservative says New Age politics is just a retooled version of leftism. but especially from the liberal left and religious right.
On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics is an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.Jamison (2001), cited above, p. 169.Zizek (2000), cited above, pp. 1–2 and 70.  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the "realities" of economic and political power; another faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.  Antinuclear activist Harvey Wasserman argued that New Age politics is too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.
On the right, some worried that the drive to come up with a new consciousness and new values would topple time-tested old values.  Others worried that the celebration of diversity would leave no strong viewpoint in place to guide society. The passion for world unity – one humanity, one planet – was said to lead inevitably to the centralization of power.LaHaye, Tim; Hindson, Ed (2001).  Seduction of the Heart: How to Guard and Keep Your Heart from Evil.  W Publishing Group / Thomas Nelson, Inc., p. 178.  ISBN 978-0-8499-1726-4.Rhodes, Ron (1995).  New Age Movement.  Zondervan Publishing House, p. 20.  ISBN 978-0-310-70431-7. Some doubted that networking could provide an effective counterweight to centralization
and bureaucracy.
Neither left nor right was impressed with the New Age's ability to organize itself politically.  Many explanations were offered for the New Age's practical political weakness.  Some said that the New Age political thinkers and activists of the 1970s and 1980s were simply too far in advance of their time.Ray and Anderson  (2000), cited above, pp. 206–07.   Others suggested that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making was at fault.  After it dissolved, New World Alliance co-founder Marc Sarkady told an interviewer that the Alliance had been too "New Age counter-cultural" to appeal to a broad public.Gottlieb (1987), cited above, p. 153.

===New directions in the 21st century===

In the 21st century, writers and activists continue to pursue a political project with New Age roots. However, it differs from the project that had come before.
The principal difference was anticipated in texts like New Age Politics author Mark Satin's essay "Twenty-eight Ways of Looking at Terrorism" (1991),Satin, Mark  (1991).  New Options for America: The Next American Experiment Has Begun.  Foreword by Marilyn Ferguson.  The Press at California State University / Southern Illinois University Press,  Chap. 19.  ISBN 978-0-8093-1794-3. human potential movement historian Walter Truett Anderson's essay "Four Different Ways to Be Absolutely Right" (1995),Anderson, Walter Truett, ed. (1995). "Four Different Ways to Be Absolutely Right". In Anderson, Walter Truett, ed. (1995). The Truth About the Truth: De-Confusing and Re-Constructing the Postmodern World.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam’s Sons, Chap. 18.  ISBN 978-0-87477-801-4. and mediator Mark Gerzon's book A House Divided (1996).Gerzon, Mark (1996).  A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam’s Sons.  ISBN 978-0-87477-823-6.As shown above, the Satin text was published in a book foreworded by Marilyn Ferguson, and the Anderson and Gerzon texts were published under the imprint of Ferguson's publisher, Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc.  In these texts, the New Age political perspective is recognized as legitimate.  But it is presented as merely one among many, with strong points and blind spots just like all the rest.  The result was to alter the nature of the New Age political project.  If every political perspective had unique strengths and significant weaknesses, then it no longer made sense to try to convert everyone to the New Age political perspective, as had been attempted in the 1970s and 1980s.  It made more sense to try to construct a higher political synthesis that took every political perspective into account, including that of the New Age.McLaughlin (1993), cited above, p. 81 (quoting Satin).Gerzon (1996), cited above, Chaps. 7–8.
Many 21st century books have attempted to articulate foundational aspects of this approach to politics and social change.  They include Ken Wilber's A Theory of Everything (2001),Wilber, Ken (2000).  A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science, and Spirituality.  Shambhala Publications.  ISBN 978-1-57062-724-8. Mark Satin's Radical Middle (2004),Satin, Mark (2004).

Harper Perennial.  ISBN 978-0-06-191613-7.  In addition, many organizations are providing opportunities for focused political listening and learning that can contribute to the construction of a higher political synthesis.

Retrieved 31 August 2012. and World Public Forum: Dialogue of Civilizations.World Public Forum: Dialogue of Civilizations.  Official website.  Retrieved 31 August 2012.
Another difference between the two eras of political thought is that, in the 21st century, few political actors use the term New Age or post-New AgeMelton, John Gordon (2012). "New Age Movement".  In Encyclopedia Britannica (2012).  Encyclopedia Britannica Online.  Encyclopedia Britannica Inc.  Retrieved 30 August 2012. to describe themselves or their work.  Some observers attribute this to the negative connotations that the term "New Age" had acquired.  Instead, other terms are employed that connote a similar sense of personal and political development proceeding together over time.  For example, according to an anthology from three political scientists, many writers and academics use the term "transformational" as a substitute for such terms as New Age and new paradigm.  Ken Wilber has popularized use of the term "integral", Carter Phipps emphasizes the term "evolutionary", and both terms can be found in some authors' book titles.
