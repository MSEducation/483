==Brought Back Again==

In 2005 Brought Back to Life was re-released by Hellcat Records under the title Brought Back Again. The album was digitally remastered by Kim Nekroman, Geoff Kresge, and Henrik Neidemeier. The re-release added an introduction and alternate versions of two tracks. The introduction had been recorded during the original sessions, but the recording tape had become tangled in the tape machine and could not be used on the original release. The tape was restored by Nekroman and Kresge and the intro was able to be incorporated on the re-release. The re-release also replaced the original version of "Monster Movie Fan" with an alternate version containing a slightly different ending, and added an additional version of "Nekrofelia" that included organ and bell instruments.[ref]

The re-release altered the album's artwork, replacing the original cover with one showing the three band members' heads, thus matching the covers of most of their other albums. The original band photo was used as the back cover artwork. Finally, the new cover crossed out the "to Life" in the title and added "Again" in scrawl above it, effectively titling the re-release Brought Back Again. However, as the cross-out markings are difficult to see in small or low-resolution images and without looking closely, most retailers and music sources interpret the new title as Brought Back to Life Again.
