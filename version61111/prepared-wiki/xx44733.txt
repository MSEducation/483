Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series, created by Dick Wolf and part of the Law & Order franchise. It originally aired on NBC and, in syndication, on various cable networks. Law & Order premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its 20th and final season on May 24, 2010. At the time of its cancellation, Law & Order was the longest-running crime drama on American primetime television.  Its record of 20 seasons is a tie with Gunsmoke for the longest-running live-action scripted American prime-time series with ongoing characters, although it had fewer episodes than Gunsmoke, and both series are surpassed by the animated series The Simpsons (renewed for a 26th season in October 2013).
Set and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: The first half hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department homicide detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the New York County Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.
The show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Season 1 starred George Dzundza as Sergeant Max Greevey, Chris Noth as Detective Mike Logan, Dann Florek as Captain Donald Cragen, Michael Moriarty as Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone, Richard Brooks as Assistant District Attorney Paul Robinette and Steven Hill as District Attorney Adam Schiff. After numerous cast shuffles, its final season starred Jeremy Sisto as Detective Cyrus Lupo, Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard, S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren, Linus Roache as Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter, Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Connie Rubirosa, and Sam Waterston as District Attorney Jack McCoy. Another one of the series' most notable cast members was the late Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe, who starred on the show for twelve years (1992-2004).
The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making Law & Order a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards. On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had cancelled Law & Order and would air the final episode on May 24, 2010.[tpl]Cite news|title=Law & Order cancelled|publisher=The Spy Report|date=May 15, 2010|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/05/15/law-order-cancelled/|accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/arts/television/15law.html|title=One 'Law & Order' Gets a Death Sentence, as Another Joins the Force|author=Brian Stelter|coauthors=Bill Carter|authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/nbc-cancels-law-order/|title=NBC Cancels 'Law & Order'|author=Brian Stelter|coauthors=Bill Carter|authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=https://www.nbcumv.com/mv/#1274052289516|title=NBC announces pickups for new drama 'LOLA' ('Law & Order: Los Angeles') and returning 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' and 'Law & Order' ends its historic run on NBC May 24|publisher=NBC Universal|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl] Immediately following the show's cancellation, Wolf stated that he was attempting to find a new home for the series and would also consider a "last resort" plan to conclude the show with a two-hour TV film to air on NBC.[tpl]cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/law-order-creator-still-looking-to-bring-original-back/ | work=The New York Times | title='Law & Order' Creator Still Looking to Bring Original Back | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=May 17, 2010[/tpl] In July 2010, however, he indicated that those attempts had failed and declared that the series had now "moved to the history books".[tpl]Cite news  |title=Law & Order is dead, says Wolf|publisher=The Spy Report |date=July 31, 2010|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/31/us-law-order-is-dead-says-wolf/|accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]

==Production==

===History and development===

In 1988, Dick Wolf developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.Courrier and Green (1999), p. 17
Wolf took the idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week.  Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 17–18
Initially, Fox ordered thirteen episodes based on the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head Barry Diller reversed the decision. Although he loved the idea, he didn't believe it was a "Fox show". Wolf then went to CBS, which ordered a pilot, "Everybody's Favorite Bagman", written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars. In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield, screened the pilot and liked it; but they were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated week after week. However, by 1990, NBC executives had enough confidence that the innovative show could appeal to a wide audience that they ordered the series for a full season.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 21–22

===Filming===

The series was shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of local color.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainmentheadlines/ci_10868230|title=Can "Law & Order" outlive "Gunsmoke"?|last=Carlson|first=Erin|date=October 31, 2008|agency=Associated Press |work= San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=November 6, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/law-order/cast/100255|title=Law and Order: Cast and details|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 6, 2008[/tpl] In later seasons, New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, attorney William Kunstler and Bronx Congressman José Serrano all have appeared on the show as themselves. Local personalities also have had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as Donna Hanover and Fran Lebowitz as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at Chelsea Piers (where the series is mostly shot) was renamed "Law & Order Way" in tribute to the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/091604_commissioner_oliver_presents.shtml |title=Commissioner Oliver Presents "Law & Order Way" |publisher=NYC.gov |accessdate=September 14, 2004[/tpl]

===Music and sound effects===

 
 Audio samples of ''Law & Order''  (media help)

The music for Law & Order is composed by veteran composer Mike Post. The music is deliberately designed to be minimalist to match the abbreviated style of the series.Courrier and Green (1999), p. 69 Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet.[tpl]cite news | first=Lisa | last=Schwarzbaum |  title=The Jailhouse Rock | date=February 26, 1993 |  url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305720,00.html | work =Entertainment Weekly | accessdate =January 5, 2010 [/tpl] In addition, scene changes are accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as "The Clang," while Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the "ominous chung CHUNG", actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the "doink doink",[tpl]cite news | last = Ryan  | first = Maureen  | title = Thunk-thunk!

"The Clang" is an amalgamation of nearly a dozen sounds, including an actual gavel, a jail door slamming, and five hundred Japanese monks walking across a hardwood floor.12 Things You Didn't Know About Law & Order.

==Casting and characters==

For the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Mike Logan.Courrier and Green (1999), p. 25 Among others, Dzundza was up against Jerry Orbach, who had just recently become available due to his The Law & Harry McGraw series being cancelled, for the role, and the producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 110–111 Noth and Michael Madsen were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 25–26 Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.
On the prosecutor's side, Michael Moriarty was Dick Wolf's choice to play Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone. The network, however, preferred James Naughton, but, in the end, Wolf's choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role. As his ADA, Richard Brooks and Eriq La Salle were being considered for the role of Paul Robinette. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers' choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role.Courrier and Green (1999), pp 26 As their boss, Roy Thinnes was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.
Nearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty, and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in Dark Shadows and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped Steven Hill to play District Attorney Adam Schiff, a character loosely based on real-life New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 131–132
Dzundza was disappointed when he realized that the show would be more of an ensemble show rather than a show starring him. Though the cast liked his portrayal of Greevey, they increasingly felt uncomfortable around Dzundza, who was also under stress due to the constant commute between New York City and his home in Los Angeles. Dzundza quit after only one season on the show and his character was written out as having been killed in the line of duty.Courrier and Green (1999), p. 111 Dzundza was replaced on the show by Paul Sorvino as Detective Sergeant Phil Cerreta, who was considered more even tempered than either Greevey or Logan. Sorvino was initially excited about the role, but would leave after twenty-nine episodes, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by the filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing opera as reasons for leaving the show; to give Sorvino the out, Sergeant Cerreta was written out by having been shot in the line of duty and being transferred out of the precinct.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 123–125
Also introduced on a recurring basis Season 2 was Carolyn McCormick as Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, a police psychologist brought in on a case-by-case basis. NBC had been pushing for the producers to add female characters to the all male cast.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 144–145 She was added to the opening credits as "also starring" in seasons three and four[tpl]cite episode| title = Conspiracy| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Michael S.

She left to star in Cracker after Season 8.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 144–146 After the cancellation of Cracker, she returned beginning in Season 13 and appeared occasionally until Season 20.[tpl]cite episode| title = American Jihad| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Aaron Zelman & Marc Guggenheim.

Jerry Orbach was initially hesitant about starring in an hour-long drama after witnessing the exhausting effect it had on his friend David Janssen on The Fugitive, but changed his mind as he got older. He had twice before auditioned for the role of the senior detective (1988 and 1991). When Dzundza and Sorvino were picked instead of him, he made a guest appearance as a defense lawyer in Season 2 episode "The Wages of Love" while returning to his recurring role on Murder, She Wrote where his Harry McGraw character had originated. While there, Orbach heard Sorvino raving about the quality of the show and how Sorvino believed he had found a winning series to do. After Sorvino's departure during the third season, Orbach decided to audition a third time and was given the role of Detective Lennie Briscoe.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 120–122
By the end of Season 3, network executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of Warren Littlefield, new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday night time slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be fired. He chose Florek and Brooks, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings, especially Brooks', who was said not to get along with Moriarty, were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 33–34 To replace Florek, S. Epatha Merkerson was cast as new squad leader Lieutenant Anita Van Buren, as Captain Cragen was given a position at the Internal Affairs Bureau (and a recurring role for the next several years).Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 115–117 Jill Hennessy replaced Brooks as Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid, and the Paul Robinette character became a race-baiting defense attorney.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 128–131
Meanwhile, Moriarty's behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General Janet Reno a "psychopathic Nazi" for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week, and the final storyline for Ben Stone involved him resigning over his guilt that a woman he compelled to testify against a Russian mobster was murdered by his cohorts. To replace Moriarty, Sam Waterston was Wolf's first choice to join the cast as Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy, a character markedly different from Moriarty's Stone in that McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal than Stone.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 35–37
Wolf fired Noth when his contract ended at the end of Season 5 because he felt that Briscoe and Logan were too alike and the writers were having trouble finding ways to write them since they agreed on everything. Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the firings of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The decision to fire Noth was extremely controversial with fans and critics alike, who felt that Noth's absence left a void on the show that was never filled. Perhaps due to the bad blood, the final story line for Detective Logan involved him being sent to work on Staten Island in a domestic violence crimes unit as punishment for his punching of a city councilmember who had orchestrated the murder of a gay colleague. Noth was replaced by Benjamin Bratt as Detective Rey Curtis, who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 34–35
Hennessy chose not to renew her three-year contract at the end of Season 6 to pursue other projects, and Claire Kincaid was killed in a drunk driving accident.Courrier and Green (1999), p. 130 She was replaced by Carey Lowell as Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross. Lowell remained with the show for two seasons until the end of Season 8, when she left the show to spend more time with her daughter.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 134–135 Lowell, whose character resigned to become a law professor and eventually returned to law practice, was replaced by Angie Harmon as Assistant District Attorney Abbie Carmichael, who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with eighty-five other women, including Vanessa Williams, for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texas accent.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 333–335
Bratt left the series at the end of Season 9, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances. His character, who had a wife who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, was written out as having left the force in order to take care of her in her final days.[tpl]cite news|last=Huff|first=Richard|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/04/30/1999-04-30_bratt_leaving_order__.html|title=Bratt Leaving 'Law & Order'; 'Ally' Doc Joining Force |work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] He was replaced by Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green, who was conceived of as more of a loose cannon in the mold of Logan than Bratt's Curtis had been.Courrier and Green (1999), pp. 331–332 In 2000, Hill announced he was leaving the series at the end of Season 10. Hill, who was the last remaining member of the original cast, said his departure was mutual with the producers. He was replaced by Dianne Wiest as Interim District Attorney Nora Lewin and Schiff left to work with Jewish charities and human-rights organizations in Europe.[tpl]cite news |date=July 14, 2000 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/07/14/2000-07-14_hill_leaves_order_.html |title=Hill Leaves 'Law & Order' |work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=December 20, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The following year, Harmon departed the show after three seasons (as Abbie Carmichael was called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) and was replaced by Elisabeth Röhm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn.[tpl]cite news|last=Shister|first=Gail|date= April 23, 2001|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5884955_ITM|title='Law & Order' gets its first blonde as Rohm joins the cast.|publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] After two seasons, Wiest left the show at the end of Season 12 and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks.[tpl]cite news|date=August 29, 2002|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2002-08-29-law-order-thompson_x.htm|title=Sen.

After twelve years on Law & Order, Orbach announced in 2004 that he was leaving the show for the third Law & Order spin-off, Law & Order: Trial by Jury, and Lennie Briscoe was written off as having retired from the NYPD full-time. At the time, Orbach would not state the reason for his departure.[tpl]cite news|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=May 18, 2004|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120231,00.html|title=Jerry Orbach Signs Off After 12 Years on 'Law & Order'|publisher=Fox News |accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] In December of the same year, however, Orbach revealed he had prostate cancer and Wolf said the role on Trial by Jury was designed to be less taxing than his role on the original series. Orbach was only able to complete filming of two episodes of Trial by Jury (although he had filmed scenes for the first six episodes) before succumbing to his cancer on December 28, 2004.[tpl]cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|coauthors=Severo, Richard|date=December 29, 2004|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/arts/29cnd-orba.html|title=Jerry Orbach, Star of 'Law & Order,' Dies at 69|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] Orbach was replaced on Law & Order by Dennis Farina as Detective Joe Fontana.
Season 15 would also see the departure of Röhm mid-season. Röhm's final scene on the show sparked controversy within the fanbase, as Southerlyn asked Branch if she was being fired because she was gay, a fact never cited until then. Wolf said Röhm's departure was unexpected, and she exited the show in January 2005. Her replacement was Annie Parisse as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Borgia. Later that season, Martin departed early for the season to film Rent. During his absence, he was temporarily replaced by Michael Imperioli as Detective Nick Falco and Ed Green was written out of the series as having been shot in the line of duty and recovering from his injury.[tpl]cite news|last=Levin|first=Gary|date=December 6, 2004|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-12-06-lno-inside_x.htm?csp=34|title='Law & Order' stays orderly|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] Parisse left the series at the end of Season 16 when Borgia was killed, and Farina announced shortly afterward that he was leaving Law & Order to pursue other projects.[tpl]cite news |last=Marinovich |first=Milosh |date= May 31, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/31/entertainment/main1671381.shtml |title='Law & Order' Cast Shakeup |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl]
By this point, NBC executives believed the franchise was beginning to show its age as ratings for the show had dropped 15 percent from the previous season and 30 percent over the previous three seasons. Farina had never been popular with fans when he replaced Orbach, and it was felt that the cast just did not seem to mesh well together. In an effort to revitalize the show, Wolf brought in Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Connie Rubirosa to replace Parisse. Martin's Green was promoted to senior detective, replacing Farina, and his new partner was Detective Nina Cassady, played by Milena Govich, who had worked with Wolf on the short-lived series Conviction, and served as the show's first female detective.[tpl]cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|date=July 16, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/arts/television/16stei.html|title='Law & Order' Meets the Law of Supply and Demand|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] Govich proved to be even more unpopular with fans than her predecessor, however.
Govich only stayed with the show one season and was replaced the next year by Jeremy Sisto as Detective Cyrus Lupo (with the explanation being that Detective Cassady was only working with the precinct on a temporary basis with a promotion to full-time only if she earned it). Around the same time, Thompson announced he would leave the show to seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. Waterston's McCoy was promoted to Interim District Attorney (later made full District Attorney) and Linus Roache joined the cast as Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter.[tpl]cite news|last=Cooper|first=Gael Fashingbauer|date=July 18, 2007|url=http://testpattern.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/18/274549.aspx|title='Law & Order' Shows Get New Blood|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl]
Sisto in particular received praise for his portrayal of Lupo, with critics saying he was an improvement over Govich.[tpl]cite news|last=Fretts|first=Bruce|date=January 2, 2008|url=http://www.tvguide.com/cheers-jeers/Cheers-Sisto-Lays-8673.aspx|title=Cheers: Sisto Lays Down the Law|work=TV Guide|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] Ken Tucker sees the relationship between McCoy and Cutter as "a nicely overstated case of oedipal conflict. McCoy sees in Cutter his younger, more impetuous self, while Cutter sees an aging father figure he wants to vanquish by proving he's smarter and more daring than the old coot. It makes for some superfine debates over points of law that also carry personal, emotional weight for the protagonists, an approach the Law & Order mothership has rarely taken over the years."[tpl]cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=December 19, 2008 |url=|title=TV: Sam Waterston's bark keeps giving Law & Order its bite |work=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl] Other critics said the line-up was the best in years, with the chemistry finally seeming just right after years of cast members who did not seem to fit well in the cast.[tpl]cite news |last=Roush |first=Matt|date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/roush/dramatic-exit-jesse-9896.aspx |title=A Dramatic Exit for Jesse L.

Despite critics' praise, the line-up was short-lived.

Law & Order episodes are typically segmented into two parts, roughly at the halfway point; the first part follows police and detective work, and the second follows the courtroom proceedings of the case.

==="Ripped from the headlines"===

Often the plot of an initial portion of an episode resembles a recognizable aspect of an actual case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://insidetv.aol.com/2009/10/22/law-and-order-fictionalizes-taconic-tragedy-is-it-too-soon?icid=main|title='Law & Order' Fictionalizes the Taconic Parkway Tragedy – Is It Too Soon?|last=Conroy|first=Tom|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=AOL Television|accessdate=October 23, 2009[/tpl] In early seasons, the details of these cases often closely followed the real stories, such as the season one episode "Subterranean Homeboy Blues", which had a woman shooting two attempted muggers, paralleling the Bernhard Goetz case. Another early episode, "Out of the Half-Light", focused on a racially charged rape case that mimicked the Tawana Brawley case.  This "ripped from the headlines" style is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper halftones to high-resolution photos. Another first season episode, "Poison Ivy", would be based on the Edmund Perry case where an NYPD officer fatally shot a returning black honor student who was committing a crime in front of the officer upon returning to the city after recently graduating from an Ivy League prep school. Later seasons would take real life cases as inspiration but diverge more from the facts. Often this would be done by increasing the severity of the crime in question, usually by adding a murder. As a result, the plot would tend to veer significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode. Promotional advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels regularly use the "ripped from the headlines" phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional. This format lends itself to exploring different outcomes or motives that similar events could have had under other circumstances.
Some real life crime victims have felt used and exploited, with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for libel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504029.html |title=Ripped From the Headlines – and From the Heart|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2009|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 23, 2009[/tpl]

==Cancellation==

On May 13, 2010, reports surfaced of the possibility that Law & Order could be canceled after 20 seasons on the air, preventing it from unseating Gunsmoke as longest running American primetime drama unless another network picked it up.[tpl]cite web|author=1:27 pm ET |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37140119/ns/today-entertainment/ |title=It's official: NBC cancels 'Law & Order' |publisher=msnbc.com |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] By May 14, 2010, The New York Times, Daily Variety and the Los Angeles Times reported official cancellation of the series.[tpl]cite news|last=Schneider|first=Michael|title='s official: Original 'Law and Order' to end – Entertainment News, TV News, Media|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019334.html |accessdate=May 15, 2010|newspaper=Variety|date=May 14, 2010[/tpl] Continuation of characters on spin-off series – including Law & Order: Los Angeles — has been mentioned as a possible means of providing closure beyond the series finale.
On May 14, 2010, NBC officially canceled the show, opting instead to pick up Law & Order: Los Angeles for a first season, and renewed Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for a twelfth. The cancellation was announced after last-minute talks between NBC and Dick Wolf to extend the series failed to lead to an agreement.
The chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, Jeff Gaspin, stated: "The full measure of the collective contributions made by Dick Wolf and his Law & Order franchise over the last two decades to the success of NBC and Universal Media Studios cannot be overstated. The legacy of his original Law & Order series will continue to make an impact like no other series before."[ref]

Angela Bromstad, President, Primetime Entertainment, NBC and Universal Media Studios, said, "Law & Order has been one of the most successful franchises in the history of television, which is why it is so critical that we continue this important brand and our relationship with Dick Wolf and his team with L&O: LA and Law & Order: SVU."
Following the cancellation announcement, Wolf announced that he still hoped to continue the series, and stated that he was seeking "other offers" from potential outlets to air the series. Wolf also discussed the possibility of airing a two-hour TV film on NBC to conclude Law & Order, but said that such a plan had been delayed until he had exhausted every other possibility for continuing the series. Wolf did not specify whether NBC had already offered to air such a movie.
Dick Wolf stated that, "The flagship series is in a medically induced coma, waiting for a life-saving medicine." Wolf was pressuring the series' producer NBC/Universal Media Studios to make a deal with TNT, which holds syndication rights to the show, for originals if an acceptable license fee could be bargained. Talks between the two started up after upfronts.[tpl]cite news | first=Nikki | last=Finke |  title=TOLDJA! 'Law & Order' Heading To TNT?

Executive producer René Balcer spoke to Neal Conan on Talk of the Nation on May 24, stating that "we're not dead yet" and noting that there were still ongoing negotiations with cable outlets to see if the original series could be refloated. Balcer referenced the "medically induced coma" brought up by Wolf, calling the show's cancellation "corporately-induced".Rene Balcer on Talk of the Nation. Npr.org (May 24, 2010).

Although NBC cancelled the series, AMC started talking about reviving Law & Order;[tpl]cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/07/law_order_amc.html |title=AMC Investigates Reviving Law & Order |date=July 6, 2010 |work=New York |accessdate=February 23, 2011[/tpl]  however, attempts to revive it failed, and according to creator Dick Wolf, the series "moved into the history books".
Almost exactly one year later, on May 13, 2011, NBC canceled Law & Order: LA following a decline in the ratings after the show had been retooled and moved to Monday nights.

==Spin-offs and adaptations==

The longevity and success of Law & Order has spawned four American television series (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Trial by Jury, and Law & Order: LA) as well as a television film (Exiled: A Law & Order Movie), all of which use the name Law & Order. Although there were fears initially that the failure of such shows could hurt the original series, it was felt the brand name was needed because of the commercial desirability such a brand name creates.Green and Dawn (2009), pp. 10–11 To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, Law & Order is often referred to as "The Mother Ship" by producers and critics.Green and Dawn (2009), p. 2
The original series has also been adapted for British television as Law & Order: UK, with the setting changed to London.  Similarly, Law & Order: Criminal Intent has been adapted for French and Russian television under the respective titles Paris enquêtes criminelles and Закон и порядок. Преступный умысел, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has also had a Russian version, Закон и Порядок: Отдел Оперативных Расследований.
