The Auckland University of Technology (AUT) ([tpl]lang-mi|Te Wānanga Aronui o Tāmaki Makau Rau[/tpl]) is a university in New Zealand. It was formed on 1 January 2000 (1895 originally Auckland Technical School) when the Auckland Institute of Technology was granted university status. Its primary campus is on Wellesley Street in Auckland's Central business district (CBD). AUT has three secondary campuses: North Shore, South, and the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health (AUT Millennium Campus). For branding purposes, since 2010 the Auckland University of Technology refers to itself as AUT University.

==History==

AUT was originally founded as Auckland Technical School in 1895, offering evening classes only. Daytime classes began in 1906 and its name was changed to Auckland Technical College. In 1913 it was renamed Seddon Memorial Technical College. In the early 1960s educational reforms resulted in the separation of secondary and tertiary teaching; two educational establishments were formed; the tertiary (polytechnic) adopting the name Auckland Technical Institute (ATI) in 1963 and the secondary school continuing with the same name. For three years they co-existed on the same site, but by 1964 the secondary school had moved to a new site in Western Springs and eventually became Western Springs College. In 1989 ATI became Auckland Institute of Technology (AIT), and the current name was adopted when university status was granted in 2000.AUT University: Celebrating the first ten years[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
