Tropical Storm Barry was a rapidly forming tropical cyclone that made landfall on Florida, United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low pressure in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5.
The precursor trough produced heavy rainfall across the western Caribbean Sea, which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7.8 inches (200 mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate amount of precipitation across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99 inches (178 mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, which led to two indirect traffic fatalities. Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor.

==Meteorological history==

By late on May 29, a weak trough over the Yucatán Peninsula produced a small area of convection over the Yucatán Channel.[tpl]cite web|author=Waddington|date=2007-05-29|title=May 29 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2007052917.AXNT20[/tpl] Convection increased in association with the trough, and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba.[tpl]cite web|author=John Cangialosi|year=2007|title=May 30 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2007053017.AXNT20[/tpl] A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward,[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Barry Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-22|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL022007_Barry.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear.[tpl]cite web|author=John Cangialosi|date=2007-05-31|title=May 31 Tropical Weather Discussion 17z|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2007053117.AXNT20[/tpl] The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.
The depression developed a large area of squalls, and organized enough to warrant a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area.[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2007-06-01|title=June 1 Tropical Weather Outlook 15z|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2007060115.ABNT20[/tpl] The plane reported flight level winds of [tpl]convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and a pressure of 1000 mbar near the increasingly well-defined low-level circulation. Initially it maintained characteristics of both a tropical and subtropical cyclone, although deep convection continued to organize near the center; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Barry at 2100 UTC on June 1 while the storm was centered about 235 miles (375 km) west of Key West, Florida.[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2007-06-01|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al02/al022007.discus.001.shtml[/tpl] Embedded within the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching mid-level trough, it tracked quickly northward, and early on June 2 attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h).
Shortly after reaching peak intensity, strong wind shear removed most of the deep convection; the cloud pattern consisted of an exposed yet well-defined center surrounded by a curved convective band extending from Cuba along the eastern Gulf of Mexico.[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2007-06-02|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al02/al022007.discus.002.shtml[/tpl] The center became elongated and weakened as it accelerated northeastward, and at 1400 UTC on June 2 Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida, as a weakening tropical depression.[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila and Xavier William Proenza|date=2007-06-02|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al02/al022007.discus.004.shtml[/tpl] As it continued inland, it rapidly lost tropical characteristics, and later that day the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Barry while it was located over northeastern Florida.[tpl]cite web|author=Lixion Avila|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Five|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al02/al022007.discus.005.shtml[/tpl] The extratropical remnants strengthened as the system continued northeastward, and on June 3 it moved ashore along South Carolina.[tpl]cite web|author=Rubin-Oster|year=2007|title=Public Advisory Number 7 for Remnants of Barry|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-06-03|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/2007/BARRY/BARRY_7.html[/tpl] Spiral bands developed to the north of the system as it moved up the coast, and a large plume of moisture extended well ahead of the low-level circulation.[tpl]cite web|author=Kong|date=2007-06-03|title=Public Advisory Number 9 for Remnants of Barry|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-06-03|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/2007/BARRY/BARRY_9.html[/tpl] Late on June 4, the extratropical remnant entered New England,[tpl]cite web|author=Fracasso|date=2007-06-03|title=Public Advisory Number 13 for Remnants of Barry|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-06-03|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/2007/BARRY/BARRY_13.html[/tpl] and late on June 5 the remnants of Barry were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone near the border between the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.

==Preparations==

Coinciding with its classification as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach, with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks.[tpl]cite web|author=Avila|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Barry Public Advisory One-A|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al02/al022007.public_a.001.shtml?[/tpl] An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for non-coastal and non-tidal areas of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area.[tpl]cite web|author=Ruskin, FL National Weather Service|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Local Statement|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=http://www.weather.unisys.com/hurricane/archive/07060200[/tpl] A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin Merzer|year=2007|title=Barry weakens but drenches South Florida|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=2007-06-02|url=http://www.neorunner.com/archive/2007/06/03/Barry_Weakens_but_Drenches_South_Florida.php[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl]
After becoming an extratropical cyclone, local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of South Carolina, much of eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland. Later, flood and flash flood watches were issued for southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, and southern New England. Wind and lake wind advisories were posted in parts of Georgia.[tpl]cite web|author=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|title=Tropical Storm Barry Event Report for Georgia|year=2007|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5pO1SQz0N[/tpl]

==Impact==

===Caribbean===

In El Salvador, the precursor trough produced about 2.76 inches (70 mm) of rainfall in about ten hours.[tpl]cite web|author=Mike Tichacek|year=2007|title=May 31 Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Atl-Dis/2007053111.AXNT20[/tpl]
The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall across western Cuba, peaking at 12.0 inches (305 mm) in Sancti Spíritus Province. Several other locations recorded over 4 inches (100 mm) of precipitation, which caused flooding along rivers and low-lying areas. The city of Guane was isolated after flooding cut off communications. In total, more than 2,000 people were evacuated due to the threat for flooding. Additionally, the precursor disturbance spawned four tornadoes in Pinar del Río Province; the tornadoes injured three people and damaged fifty-five houses, of which four collapsed.[tpl]cite web|author=EFE|year=2007|title=La tormenta tropical "Barry" baña con sus lluvias a Cuba|publisher=Cuba Debate|language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-06-02|url=http://archivo.cubadebate.cu/index.php?tpl=design/noticias.tpl.html&newsid_obj_id=9291[/tpl]

The storm produced heavy surf along the western coastline, as well as a storm tide of 4.78 feet (1.46 m) at Clearwater Beach. The wave action caused minor beach erosion, with 50–60 feet (15–18 m) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach. The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area,[tpl]cite web|author=McMichael|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Barry Post Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=Ruskin, Florida National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-06-11|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/warn_archive/TBW/PSH/0609_100716.txt[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] which trapped some automobile travelers.[tpl]cite web|author=Fox13|year=2007|title=Barry leaves his calling card|accessdate=2007-06-03|url=http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/Barry_leaves_his_calling_card[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] At Indian Shores, a woman died after sustaining injuries from the rough surf.
