The George Washington University (GW, GWU, or George Washington) is a private, coeducational research university located in the United States' capital, Washington, D.C.. The university was chartered by an Act of Congress on February 9, 1821, as the Columbian College in the District of Columbia.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~dcbook/hilltopdowntown.html | title = From Hilltop to Downtown[/tpl] In 1904, it changed its name to the George Washington University in honor of George Washington, the first President of the United States.
The main campus of the university is situated in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in close proximity to the White House, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the headquarters of the United States Department of State.
The university awards undergraduate and graduate degrees in several disciplines through all of its ten different schools. The university's Law School, Business School and School of International Affairs are consistently ranked highly by several national and international publications.
Many of the university's graduates have gone on to high positions within both the United States Government and in foreign governments. Notable alumni include US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former First-Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and US House of Representative Majority Leader Eric Cantor. There are currently four George Washington University alumni serving in the United States Senate, nine serving in the United States House of Representatives, and ten serving as United States ambassadors.
Current and former students are referred to as Colonials.

==History==

===Founding and early history===

Baptist missionary and leading minister Luther Rice raised funds to purchase a site for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation in Washington, D.C. A large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as Meridian Hill, and on February 9, 1821, President James Monroe approved the congressional charter creating the non-denominational Columbian College in the District of Columbia. The first commencement in 1824 was considered an important event for the young city of Washington, D.C. In attendance were President Monroe, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Marquis de Lafayette and other dignitaries. During the Civil War, most students left to join the Confederacy and the college's buildings were used as a hospital and barracks. Walt Whitman was among many of the volunteers to work on the campus. Following the war, in 1873, Columbian College became the Columbian University and moved to an urban downtown location centered on 15th and H streets, NW.
In 1904, Columbian University changed its name to the George Washington University in an agreement with the George Washington Memorial Association to build a campus building in honor of the first U.S. president. Neither the university nor the association were able to raise enough money for the proposed building near the National Mall; however, the institution retained the name. Eventually the association donated the remaining funds that had been raised to the university for the development of Lisner Auditorium.[tpl]cite news|first=Daniel|last=Luzer|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/feature/the_prestige_racket.php?page=all|title=The Prestige Racket|work=Washington Monthly|date=September–October 2010|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl] The university moved its principal operations to the D.C. neighborhood of Foggy Bottom in 1912.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.gwu.edu/gwencyclopedia/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_of_GW|title=Brief History of GW|publisher=The George Washington University|accessdate=2007-10-26[/tpl]
The George Washington University, like much of Washington, D.C., traces many of its origins back to the Freemasons. The Bible that the presidents of the university use to swear an oath on upon inauguration is the Bible of Freemason George Washington. Freemasonry symbols are prominently displayed throughout the campus including the foundation stones of many of the university buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2005/10/17/News/Building.The.University.Freemasonry.Sjt.And.Gw-1022600.shtml|title=Building the University: Freemasonry, SJT, and GW|publisher=GW Hatchet|accessdate=2007-11-01[/tpl]

===Expansion===

The majority of the present infrastructure and financial stability at GW is due to the tenures of Presidents Cloyd Heck Marvin, Lloyd Hartman Elliott and Stephen Joel Trachtenberg. In the 1930s, the university was a major center for theoretical physics. The cosmologist George Gamow produced critical work on the Big Bang theory at GW in the 1930s and 1940s. In one of the most important moments in the 20th century, Niels Bohr announced that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom on January 26, 1939, at the Fifth Washington Conference on theoretical physics in the Hall of Government.[tpl]cite book | title = Physics and Nuclear Arms Today | author = David W. Hafemeister | publisher = Springer (1991)[/tpl] According to campus folklore, during the Vietnam War era, Thurston Hall, an undergraduate dormitory housing 1,116 students[tpl]cite web|url=http://living.gwu.edu/thurston-hall|title=Thurston Hall|accessdate=11 February 2014[/tpl]  was a staging ground for Student Anti-War Demonstrations (at 1900 F Street NW, the building is 3 blocks from the White House). In 1996, the university purchased the Mount Vernon College for Women in the city's Palisades neighborhood that became the school's coeducational Mount Vernon Campus. The campus was first utilized in 1997 for women only, but became co-educational in a matter of years. The Mount Vernon campus is now totally integrated into the GW community, serving as a complement to the Foggy Bottom campus. In December 2006, the university named Johns Hopkins University provost Steven Knapp its next president. He began his presidency on August 1, 2007.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/04/News/Johns.Hopkins.Provost.To.Succeed.Trachtenberg-2521025.shtml?sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title = Johns Hopkins Provost To Succeed Trachtenberg | publisher = GW Hatchet | accessdate = 2007-02-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070129124155/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/04/News/Johns.Hopkins.Provost.To.Succeed.Trachtenberg-2521025.shtml?sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com  |archivedate = 2007-01-29[/tpl]

==Campuses==

===Foggy Bottom===

The main GW campus consists of [tpl]convert|43|acre|m2[/tpl] in historic Foggy Bottom and is located a few blocks from the White House, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, State Department and the National Mall. Barring a few outlying buildings, the boundaries of campus are delineated by (running clockwise from Washington Circle) Pennsylvania Avenue, 19th Street, E Street, Virginia Avenue, 24th Street, and New Hampshire Avenue. The university owns much of the property in Foggy Bottom and leases it to various tenants, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Other nearby institutions include the Harry S. Truman Building (Department of State headquarters), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, United States Institute of Peace, Watergate complex and the embassies of Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The University Yard is the main open space and historic heart of the university. Along with George Washington's main library, Gelman Library, they constitute the hub of the main campus. The seven-story Gelman Library building contains over two million volumes and is constructed in the Brutalist architectural style of the 1970s. It features a concrete façade punctuated by windows that are divided by projecting vertical slabs. For most of the year, parts of the library are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week for use by students, faculty and staff. The seventh floor of the library includes the Special Collections Research Center, National Security Archives (NSA), Global Resources Center and Kiev Library. The NSA is a research institution that publishes declassified U.S. government files concerning selected topics of American foreign policy. It was a National Security Archive Freedom of Information Act request that eventually made the Central Intelligence Agency's so-called "Family Jewels" public.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm | title = The CIA's Family Jewels | publisher = National Security Archive |accessdate = 2007-10-26[/tpl]
Close to the library is Lisner Auditorium and a large open area between them is known as Kogan Plaza. Southeast of the plaza and located near Monroe Hall and Hall of Government is the Monroe Court, a landscaped area with a large fountain. The Foggy Bottom–GWU Washington Metro station is located at the intersection of 23rd and I Streets NW due south of Washington Circle, and provides access to the Orange and Blue lines. The University Hospital is located next to the Metro station entrance.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/121406dnnatjohnson.235fa40.html | title = Democratic Senator Critical After Brain Surgery | publisher = Dallas Morning News |accessdate = 2006-12-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/30/national/main282669.shtml | title = 20 Years Since Reagan Shot | publisher = CBS News |accessdate = 2007-12-13 | date=2001-03-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/11/19/News/Cheney.Visits.Gw.Hospital-3115630.shtml| title = Cheney visits GW hospital | publisher = GW Hatchet |accessdate = 2007-12-13[/tpl]
The Foggy Bottom campus contains most of the residential dormitories in which GW students live. The most notable include: Ivory Tower, Thurston Hall, Madison Hall, Potomac House, Fulbright Hall, Mitchell Hall, Crawford Hall, Schenley Hall, Munson Hall, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Hall, Phillip Amsterdam Hall, the West End and the newest residence, South Hall, among others.
In late 2007, construction began on a large mixed-use residential, office and retail development located on the site of the old GW Hospital (Square 54) and just east of the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail station. It was the second-largest undeveloped lot in the District of Columbia at the time of initial construction activity.[tpl]cite web | url =http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/05/21/News/D.c-Zoning.Commission.Approves.Square.54.Plans-2905933.shtml | title = DC Commission Approves Square 54 Plans | publisher = GW Hatchet |accessdate = 2007-02-01[/tpl]

===Schools and colleges===

GW is organized into ten schools and colleges, each with a different dean and organization.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gwu.edu/colleges-schools | title = Colleges & Schools | publisher = The George Washington University |accessdate = 2012-11-25[/tpl]
thumb|right|200px | The historic Old President's Office features a time capsule with letters from former President George W. Bush and Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.  The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences (CCAS) is the oldest and largest college in the university. It was founded in 1821; at the beginning of the university's history, there was no distinction between this college and the university.  The School of Media and Public Affairs (SMPA), and the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration (SPPPA) belong to this college, although they are run separately. The Columbian College was among the first American institutions to grant a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), in 1888.[tpl]cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.gwu.edu/gwencyclopedia/index.php/Columbian_College_of_Arts_and_Sciences | title = Columbian College of Arts and Sciences | publisher = George Washington University |accessdate = 2007-10-26[/tpl] The Columbian College is notable for its academic diversity. Nonetheless, the student body lacks ethnic diversity in line with the general public. While blacks constitute 51% of the population of the District of Columbia, and 13% of the nation as a whole,[tpl]cite web | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/11000.html | title = District of Columbia QuickFacts from the U.S. Census | publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce | year=2011 | accessdate=2012-07-04[/tpl] they constitute 8.8% of the undergraduate population.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~ire/ethnicity_e13.htm | title = Demographic Statistics | publisher=George Washington University | year=2013 | accessdate=2014-03-19[/tpl] However, there are also 2,400 international students, approximately 10% of the total student population.http://international.gwu.edu/
The Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration is a graduate school in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The Trachtenberg School offers Master of Public Policy, Master of Public Administration, and PhD degrees in Public Policy and Public Administration. The school works in partnership with the Elliott School of International Affairs, the School of Public Health and Health Services, and the Graduate School of Education & Human Development to offer a variety of concentrations for its graduates. For Public Affairs Schools, it is ranked 12th nationwide by US News & World Report, and 10th in Public Management Administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-public-affairs-schools/george-washington-university-131469 |title=George Washington University | Best Public Affairs School | US News |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl]

It offers two undergraduate degrees, Journalism and Mass Communication and Political Communication and a master's degree in Media and Public Affairs. It is housed in the same building as the Graduate School of Political Management. The Public Affairs Project at GWU, part of SMPA, is responsible for the creation and production of the PBS special, Planet Forward. [School of Media and Public Affairs (SMPA) is one of the few schools in the country, and GWU was the first, to offer a Bachelor's Degree in political communication. The program boasts a faculty of retired and current professionals - including CNN correspondents, journalists, political analysts, and campaign professionals.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS) or simply the George Washington School of Medicine, the first in the nation's capital, was founded in 1824 due to the need for doctors in the District of Columbia.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gwumc.edu/smhs/about/history.html | title = About the School | publisher = The George Washington University |accessdate = 2007-11-14[/tpl]  In 1981, the Medical Center became the center of the national spotlight when President Ronald Reagan was rushed to the emergency room after an attempted assassination. The emergency room area was later renamed the Ronald Reagan Institute of Emergency Medicine, and other politicians, such as former Vice President Dick Cheney, come to GW for routine and emergency procedures.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/03/22/News/Vice-President.Dick.Cheney.Visits.Gw.Hospital.For.2nd.Time.In.A.Month-2786549.shtml | title = Vice President Dick Cheney visits GW hospital for 2nd time in a month | publisher = GW Hatchet |accessdate = 2007-11-14[/tpl] Cheney and wife Lynne Cheney then helped to start the Richard B. and Lynne V.

====Controversies====

The Program Board had, in years past, scheduled an X-rated film to show as part of their semester series. The film was usually partnered with a discussion of the First Amendment or a seminar on the sociological underpinnings of pornography. One year in the mid-1990s, "Porn Night" garnered national press coverage along with an ensuing protest. The film shown that night was John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut. The organized protest brought together College Republicans with College Democrats, Christians, Jews and Muslims and a bevy of diverse student organizations to speak out against pornography. A number of university administrators appeared that night to show their support of the students' right to assemble - on one hand to view the film and on the other to protest using student fees to show the film in the first place.[tpl]cite web | url = http://pb.gwu.edu/ | title = Program Board | publisher = The George Washington University |accessdate = 2007-10-26[/tpl]

===Medical school accreditation===

In 2008 the George Washington University Medical School was put on probation by its accrediting institution, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which cited a number of issues. Although GW declined to publish the entire list, among these were an outdated system of managing its curriculum, high levels of student debt, and inadequate study and lounge space for its students. A Washington Post article[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/22/AR2009022202031.html |title=Medical School's Problems Were Worse Than Described |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2009-02-23|accessdate=2012-06-24 |first=Susan |last=Kinzie[/tpl] uncovered other, more serious, problems.

==Athletics and spirit programs==

George Washington University is a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference and most of its teams play at the NCAA Division I level. All indoor sports play at the Smith Center on the Foggy Bottom campus. The outdoor events are held at the Mount Vernon campus Athletic Complex. The university's colors are buff and blue (buff being a color similar to tan, but sometimes represented as gold or yellow).

Mike Jarvis coached GW in the 1990s, and led the team to the NCAA Sweet 16 in 1993, where they were beaten by the Fab Five University of Michigan team (which later vacated its wins due to NCAA rule violations). Jarvis also coached former Colonials head coach Karl Hobbs in high school. Former NBA player Yinka Dare also played at George Washington for two years before being drafted in the first round by the New Jersey Nets.
Under former head coach Karl Hobbs, GW's basketball team returned to the national stage in 2004 after defeating No. 9 Michigan State and No. 12 Maryland in back to back games to win the 2004 BB&T Classic. That year, the men's basketball team went on to win the Atlantic 10 West Title and the Atlantic 10 Tournament Title, earning an automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA Tournament. The team received a No. 12 seed, losing to No. 5 seed Georgia Tech in the first round.
