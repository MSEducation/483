[[The Bible and homosexuality]]

Passages in the Old Testament book Leviticus that prohibit "lying with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination" and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah have historically been interpreted as condemning homosexual acts, as have several Pauline passages. Other interpreters, however, maintain that these passages do not condemn homosexuality, saying that historical context suggests other interpretations or that rare or unusual words in the passages may not be referring to homosexuality.

==Hebrew Bible==

===Leviticus 18 and 20===

Chapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus, which form part of the Holiness code and list prohibited forms of intercourse, contain the following verses:
The two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear blanket prohibitions against homosexual acts. More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the Canaanites.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N6nYCeP_w8YC&pg=PA67&dq=Siker+%22clear+blanket+condemnations%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_dcUUb_oKYaBhQf98oC4Bg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Siker%20%22clear%20blanket%20condemnations%22&f=false |title=Jeffrey S.

===Sodom and Gomorrah===

The story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Most interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests, rather than homosexuality, but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape the angels who retrieved Lot.
While the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom,[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&pg=PA37 |year=2006 |pages=37–39 |publisher=Harvard University Press |title=Homosexuality & Civilization |first=Louis |last=Crompton [/tpl] the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent that the name "Sodom" became the basis of the word sodomy, still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex.[ref]

While the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom, Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice:
[tpl]quote|49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.[tpl]Bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49–50|KJV[/tpl][/tpl]
The Talmudic tradition of between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality;[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qJMA_zTueTMC&pg=PA111 |title=J.A.

Later traditions on Sodom's sin, such as Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse. In Jude 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been "giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh,"[tpl]Bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV[/tpl] which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels. Jewish writers Philo (d. AD 50) and Josephus (37 – c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&pg=PA201&dq=Greenberg+%22assert+unambiguously%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dEQfUaG4IYPQhAe-yIGwDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Greenberg%20%22assert%20unambiguously%22&f=false |title=David F.

===David and Jonathan and Ruth and Naomi===

The account of the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream Christians as a relationship only of affectionate regard, but has been interpreted by some authors as of a sexual nature.Boswell, John. Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe. New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135–137)Halperin, David M. One Hundred Years of Homosexuality. New York: Routledge, 1990. (p. 83)
One relevant Bible passage in this respect is 1 Samuel 18:1:
Another relevant passage is 2 Samuel 1:26, where David says:
The story of Ruth and Naomi is also occasionally interpreted in this way.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G5_H76kOJtkC&pg=PA61 |title=Soliciting Interpretation |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-04-10[/tpl]

==New Testament==

===Romans 1===

[tpl]cquote|26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. (Romans 1:26–27 KJV) [tpl]Bibleverse||Romans|1:26–27|KJV[/tpl][/tpl]
This passage has been debated by some 20th and 21st-century interpreters both in terms of its relevance today and in terms of its actual prohibition: while Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=uVdmGZpSyr8C&pg=PA58|author=Mark Hertzog|page=58|isbn=0-8147-3530-4|publisher=NYU Press|year=1996|title=The lavender vote: Lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals in American electoral politics[/tpl] some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lSSWu9XsD3QC&pg=PA111 |year=2012 |page=111 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. |title=Paul Letter to the Romans |first=Colin|last=Kruse [/tpl] or that Paul's condemnation was relative to his own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. These interpretations are in a minority.

===Other Epistles===

In the context of the broader immorality of his audience, Paul the Apostle wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
[tpl]cquote|9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11 KJV)[tpl]Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9-11|KJV[/tpl][/tpl]
The Greek word arsenokoitai ([tpl]lang|grc|ἀρσενοκοῖται[/tpl]) in verse 9 has challenged scholars for centuries, and has been variously rendered as "abusers of themselves with mankind" (KJV), "sodomites" (YLT), or "men who have sex with men" (NIV).  Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἄῤῥην / ἄρσην[/tpl] / arsēn means "male", and [tpl]lang|grc|κοίτην[/tpl] koitēn "bed," with a sexual connotation.[tpl]cite book|author=Russell Pregeant|editor=Stefan Koenemann & Ronald A.

In the letter to the Corinthians, amid the list of those who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Malakoi is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, "soft" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, "gentle"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include "pathic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=MALAKO%2FS |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, entry μαλακός |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Nowhere else in scripture is it used to describe a person. Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a "soft" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or "those who abuse themselves"; all we actually, factually, know about the word is that it means soft.Robinson 2012
[tpl]cquote|8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of arsenokoitia as active or passive and says that "many men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives". Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity.[tpl]Cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C |title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-226-06711-7[/tpl] Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F.

===Matthew 8; Luke 7===

In Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. According to James Neill, the Greek term "pais" used for the servant in Matthew's account almost always had a sexual connotation. In support of this view, he remarks that the word pais, along with the word "erasthai" (to love) is the root of the English word "pederasty".[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&pg=PA216 |title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations In Human Societies |first=James |last=Neill |publisher=McFarland |page=216 |year=2009[/tpl] He sees in the fact that, in Luke's parallel account, the centurion's servant is described as "valued highly"[tpl]bibleverse||Luke|7:2|NRSV[/tpl] by the centurion an indication of a homosexual relationship between the two, and says that the Greek word "doulos" (a slave) used of him in Luke's account suggests he may have been a sex slave.

In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word "pais" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nz-E3rdDbpEC&pg=PA125&dq=mere+presence+of+%CF%80%CE%B1%E1%BF%96%CF%82&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n9EfUeWJJ4PIhAfplYGwAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mere%20presence%20of%20%CF%80%CE%B1%E1%BF%96%CF%82&f=false |title=Wendy Cotter, The Christ of the Miracle Stories (Baker Academic 2010 ISBN 978-0-80103950-8), p. 125 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10[/tpl] Neill himself compares the meanings of Greek "pais" to those of French "garçon", which, though also used to mean "waiter", "most commonly means 'boy'".
Matthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1–10 and John 4:46–53. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2–6 being present also in Matthew.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZC-tdB35bAC&pg=PA169&dq=Evans+%22John%27s+differences%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FXsDUorcMZPb7Aazj4G4BQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Evans%20%22John's%20differences%22&f=false |title=Craig A.

Evans states that the word pais used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as Q used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became doulos (slave) in Luke and huios (son) in John. Writers who admit John 4:46–53 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's pais as "child" or "boy", while those who exclude it see it as meaning "servant" or "slave".
Theodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the pais in Matthew's account is the centurion's "boy-love" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports "neither of these interpretations",The Centurion in Matthew 8:5–13: Consideration of the Proposal of Theodore W.

Others interpret Matthew's pais merely as a boy servant, not a male lover, and read nothing sexual into Luke's "valued highly".

===Matthew 19:12===

In Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven.[tpl]Bibleverse||Matthew|19:12|KJV[/tpl] Jesus' reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted as having to do with homosexual orientation; Clement of Alexandria, for instance, wrote in his commentary on it that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry.http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXAVf8m_HKgC&pg=PA333 "Those who are naturally so constituted do well not to marry."
