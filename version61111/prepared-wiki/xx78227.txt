==History==

Yakiuchi Village was established on April 1, 1908. It became Uken Village on November 1, 1917. Many inhabitants of the village emigrated to Brazil before World War II. As with all of the Amami Islands, the village came under the administration of the United States from July 1 1946 to December 25 1953.  Efforts to merge the village with neighboring municipalities collapsed in 2005. In 2006, the village government expressed an interest to be considered as a potential location for the disposal of high level radioactive wastes to the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan, much to the outrage of many inhabitants.
