==Technique Description==

Sankaku is translated as "triangle," Ude-Hishigi as arm break, with gatame roughly translated as control. The triangle is formed by the legs of Tori that cross behind the head of Uke. The form created by the crossed legs resembles a triangle, hence the name. Sankaku-waza is a term that includes several control techniques (levers, chokes and fixed assets) that are characterized by this particular method of maintaining control with the legs.
