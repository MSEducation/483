===Language===

Over 500 languages have been recorded as being spoken in Nigeria.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]  In some areas of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. The choice of English as the official language was partially related to the fact that a part of the Nigerian population spoke English as a result of British colonisation that ended in 1960.
Many French speakers from the surrounding countries influence the English spoken in border regions of Nigeria and a number of Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is most of the time spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English like it is done in Cameroon.  Most of the population speak English and their native language.
The major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of African languages: the majority are Niger–Congo languages, such as Igbo, Yoruba and Fulfulde; Hausa is Afro-Asiatic; and Kanuri, spoken in the northeast, primarily in Borno and Yobe State, is part of the Nilo-Saharan family.
Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.
With the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. Nigerian Pidgin English, often known simply as 'Pidgin' or 'Broken' (Broken English), is also a popular lingua franca, though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the Niger Delta Regions, predominately in Warri, Sapele, Port Harcourt, Agenebode, Ewu, and Benin City.[tpl]cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008[/tpl]

===Religion===

Nigeria is home to a variety of religions which tend to be concentrated regionally. This situation accentuates regional and ethnic distinctions and has often been seen as a source of sectarian conflict amongst the population.Osita Agbu (2004) Ethnic Militias and the Threat to Democracy in Post-Transition Nigeria, Nordic African Institute, ISBN 91-7106-525-3, p. 6. Though Nigeria is divided about equally between followers of Islam and Christianity (which predominate in the north and south, respectively), across Nigeria there is widespread belief, albeit suppressed for political reasons, in traditional religious practices.[tpl]according to whom|date=April 2014[/tpl]
A December 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2012, 49.3% of Nigeria's population was Christian 48.8% was Muslim, and 1.9% were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. It also predicted that in 2030, Nigeria would have a slight Muslim majority (51.5%).The Future of the Global Muslim Population. Pewforum.org (27 January 2011). Retrieved on 9 October 2013. Among Christians, 24.8% are Catholic, 74.1% are Protestant, 0.9% belong to other Christian denominations and a few of them are Orthodox Christians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/global-christianity/population-number.php |title=Global Christianity Sortable Data Tables- Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life |publisher=Features.pewforum.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
2010 data of Association of Religion Data Archives has also reported that 46.5% of the total population is Christian, slightly larger than the Muslim population (45.5%),while 7.7% are members of other religious groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_166_2.asp|title=Religious Adherents, 2010 – Nigeria|publisher=World Christian Database|accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl] 2001 data from  The World Factbook of CIA, about 50% of Nigeria's population is Muslim, 40% are Christians and 10% adhere to local religions 
From the 1990s to the 2000s, there has been significant growth in Protestant churches including the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Winners' Chapel, Christ Apostolic Church (the first Aladura Movement in Nigeria), Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Evangelical Church of West Africa, the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, the Mountain of Fire and Miracles, Christ Embassy, The Synagogue Church of All Nations, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Aladura Church, indigenous Christian churches especially strong in the Yoruba and Igbo areas, and of evangelical churches in general. The Churches have spilled over into adjacent and southern areas of the middle belt. Denominations like the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Nigeria and the Mormons have also flourished.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0048-721X(88)80017-4[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.2307/1581109[/tpl]
Other leading Protestant churches in the country are Church of Nigeria, of the Anglican communion, Assemblies of God Church, Nigeria, the Nigerian Baptist Convention and The Synagogue, Church of All Nations. The Yoruba area contains a large Anglican population, while Igboland is predominantly Catholic and the Edo area is predominantly Assemblies of God which was introduced into Nigeria by Augustus Ehurie Wogu and his associates at Old Umuahia.
There are many types of Muslims, but the majority of Nigerian Muslims are Sunni, most of whom are Maliki, Shafi'i or Salafi. But a significant Shia and Sufi minority exists (see Shia in Nigeria). Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah and/or the Mouride movement. Some Muslims have incorporated radical and takfiri ideals, in particular the Vanguard for the Protection of Muslims in Black Lands. Some northern states have incorporated Sharia law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy.[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S0021855304482023[/tpl] Kano State has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution.[ref]
