The Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner are almost identical panel van and leisure activity vehicles produced by the PSA Peugeot Citroën alliance since 1996. They were based on the Citroën ZX/Peugeot 306 estate floorpan and mechanicals. With their rectangular, box like cargo space and aerodynamic front, conceptually they can be considered the descendants of the Citroën 2CV van (AK400).
Both the Berlingo and Partner have been produced in CNG and electric versions, all with four-cylinder engines.
The panel vans are the Berlingo and Partner, while the leisure activity vehicles are known as the Berlingo Multispace and Partner Combi. In Italy the Partner is known as the Peugeot Ranch.
A revised version featuring a redesigned interior and front end was released in November 2002 (Berlingo I / Partner I).

==Berlingo I / Partner I (1996–2008)==

The Berlingo was officially launched in July 1996.

===Berlingo concept cars===

When the Berlingo was first shown at the Mondial de l'Automobile (Paris Motor Show) in 1996, a set of three concept cars was also presented:
The Berline Bulle concept was roomy small car that could be considered as a precursor for the C3. Only one of these concepts was actually developed, the Grand Large version, which was developed into the Multispace and Combi people-carriers/leisure vans.

==Berlingo II / Partner II (2008–present)==

Two different models replaced the first generation of the Berlingo in 2008.
The smaller, known as the Citroen Nemo,[tpl]cite web |author=Par Joest Jonathan Ouaknine |url=http://www.leblogauto.com/2007/10/citroen-nemo-et-peugeot-bipper.html |title=Citroën Nemo et Peugeot Bipper |publisher=le blog auto |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2010-04-19[/tpl] was developed in cooperation with Fiat and Tofaş. Based on the Fiat Grande Punto platform, it is built in Turkey and is also marketed as the Peugeot Bipper and Fiat Fiorino. The Peugeot and Citroën are almost identical; the Fiorino will also have a different, Fiat made, diesel engine. The Nemo is intended to be cheaper and smaller than the original Berlingo.
The Berlingo II, styled by Gilles Vidal, is based on PSA's Platform 2 (like the Citroën C4) and therefore is slightly larger, and considerably more expensive than its predecessor.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] The engine range is similar to other current models of the PSA group. The Berlingo and Partner were officially unveiled in January 2008, with the Berlingo launched first, in the European market, in April 2008,[tpl]cite web|title=PSA Annual Report 2012|url=http://annualreport.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/wp-content/themes/psa/pdf/pdf/PSA-2012-03_memento_en.pdf|work=Car manufacturers|publisher=PSA|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] followed by the Partner in May 2008.
Mexico still sells this generation alongside the original Partner, as do a few other countries, as the Grand Raid and Partner Origin.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
