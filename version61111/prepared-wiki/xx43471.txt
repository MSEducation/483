Arriva Trains NorthernCompanies House extract company no 3007932 Arriva Trains Northern Limited  was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by Arriva that operated the Regional Railways North East franchise from February 2000 until December 2004.

==History==

The Regional Railways North East franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to MTL with the franchise commencing on 2 March 1997.  Originally trading as Regional Railways North East it was rebranded Northern Spirit in May 1998 with longer distance services running under the TransPennine Express brand.  On 18 February 2000 MTL was purchased by Arriva.Recommended Cash Offer for MTL Services Arriva plc Press Release 18 February 2000

==Services==

Arriva Trains Northern operated a mix of long distance regional, local urban and rural passenger services in the North of England and Yorkshire extending across the Pennines.  
The network extended from Carlisle and Newcastle in the north to Scarborough, Hull and Cleethorpes on the east coast down to Sheffield and across to Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and Morecambe on the West Coast.  The long distance regional services connecting Sunderland, Newcastle, Scarborough and Hull with Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool were operated under the TransPennine Express banner, the rest as Arriva Trains Northern.
Northern Spirit had introduced a daily Leeds to Glasgow Central via the Settle & Carlisle and West Coast Main Lines in September 1999.  This service ceased in September 2003 at the request of the Strategic Rail Authority.Stakeholder Briefing: Northern Rail Franchise Strategic Rail Authority Briefing June 2003

there was also a service between Newcastle and Whitehaven (reversing at carlisle)

==Problems==

During the first half of the franchise period, Arriva Trains Northern suffered many problems. Carried over from the Northern Spirit era, a shortage of drivers and rolling stock lead to many cancellations on a daily basis. An emergency timetable was later brought in which cancelled many services on a permanent basis rather than random as before. A long running dispute with the RMT union lead to a prolonged period of industrial action.

==Rolling Stock==

Arriva Trains Northern inherited a fleet of Class 142, Class 144, Class 150, Class 155, Class 156, Class 158, Class 308 and Class 321s from Northern Spirit.  In 2000 16 Class 333s that had been ordered by Northern Spirit to replace the Class 308s, entered service.
A shortage of available rolling stock to meet increasing demand led Arriva Trains Northern to lease Class 37s and Mark 2 carriages from EWS to top and tail a daily service from Leeds to Carlisle for 12 months from September 2003.Rail Magazine Issue 480 4 February 2004 Page 40

==Depots==

Arriva Trains Northern's fleet was maintained at Heaton and Neville Hill depots.

==Demise==
