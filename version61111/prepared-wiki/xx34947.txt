It was resumed from five pastoral properties. Sturt National Park was featured in British documentary called Planet Earth. The Dingo Fence was built along the national park's northern boundary.

==Attractions==

The park contains aboriginal middens and stone relics. There are many walking trails and an extensive network of roads.  Most roads in the park are gravel with some sandy stretches and can be driven on with a conventional vehicle. A 4WD vehicle is needed after heavy rains.
In the east of the park are flood plains, dotted with occasional trees which then give way to small rocky gorges and creek beds. Located here is Mount Wood, Gorge Lookout and the Mount Wood camping ground.
Towards the middle of the park, The Olive Downs, or "Jump Up" country has flat topped mesas rising up to 150 metres above the surrounding plains, granite outcrops and flat valleys. The Jump Ups are the remains of an ancient mountain range.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24757958-17102,00.html |title=Corner Country's where three states meet and tourists roam |author=Chris Pritchard |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=7 December 2008 |work=Courier Mail |publisher=Queensland Newspapers [/tpl] The park's second camping site called Dead Horse Gully camping ground is located here.

In the far west of the National Park, the gibber plains are replaced by sandhills of the Strzelecki Desert. Cameron Corner is a remote but popular tourist destination where the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland meet. Also in this part of the park is Fort Grey—the fourth camp ground and a heritage site. The holding yards visible here and a remnant from the explorer Charles Sturt. The fort is a stockade that was built to protect Sturt's supplies and prevent the exploration party's sheep from wandering away. While searching for a fabled inland sea, Captain Charles Sturt, after whom the park is named, spent a year in the area. Fort Grey is sited on the edge of the ephemeral, and Ramsar-listed, Lake Pinaroo - an important breeding and drought refuge for waterbirds when it contains water.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/wetlands/LakePinarooRamsar.htm |title= Lake Pinaroo (Fort Grey Basin) Ramsar site |accessdate=2013-07-22 |work=NSW Ramsar sites |first= |last= |publisher=Dept of Environment & Heritage, NSW |date=2012-10-26 [/tpl]
