==Career==

After graduating from Juilliard, Kenny was a member of John Houseman's The Acting Company.  His New York acting debut was in The Normal Heart at Joseph Papp's Public Theater, and his Broadway debut was as "Motel, the tailor" in the 25th anniversary production of Fiddler on the Roof.
Kenny co-created the television comedy series Titus (broadcast by Fox Network from 2000 to 2002) with his writing partner Brian Hargrove and comedian Christopher Titus.
He was the creator of the 2006 NBC television show The Book of Daniel, which was cancelled after four episodes had aired. Though NBC gave no official explanation, the program had been the victim of a threatened advertiser boycott by the American Family Association and other groups for its content before a single episode had aired.  In a 2006 article in The Advocate, Kenny, who is gay, took issue with the LGBT community for not acting when he and the show were attacked.
In 2008, he signed on as show runner and executive producer of the original Syfy series Warehouse 13.
In 2014, Kenny joined the advisory board of Sci-Fest, the first annual Los Angeles Science Fiction One-Act Play Festival, to be held in May 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Sci-Fest Team|url=http://www.sci-fest.com/#!team/c1a9y|accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl]
