Nicholas "Nicky" Wu (born October 31, 1970) is a Taiwanese singer and actor. He found fame in 1988 when he became a member of the boy band, Little Tigers Team (小虎隊), performing alongside Alec Su and Julian Chen. The trio were extremely popular and successful in Taiwan, selling many records in the process. During his time with Little Tigers Team, he pursued a solo career, releasing an extensive catalogue of songs, Mandarin and Cantonese albums as a solo artist when member Julian Chen left the group to serve compulsory military service. Wu released his debut solo album in 1992.
After the break-up of the Little Tigers Team in 1995, Wu continued his solo career and embarked on a career in acting. Since then, his career has expanded into film and television in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. 
Wu married Chinese actress Ma Yashu in 2006. They filed for divorce in 2009.

==Career==

In 1988, Wu was spotted by an entertainment agent, and after an audition he was chosen to be part of the Little Tigers Team and given the nickname of "Pilihu" (霹靂虎; Thunderbolt Tiger). The group quickly became successful throughout Asia but disbanded due to one member's compulsory military service requirement. Wu continued solo, and began singing and acting in Taiwan and Hong Kong.http://baike.baidu.com/view/38049.htm
In five years, he released 13 Mandarin and Cantonese albums. As an actor, Wu won the 1993 Best New Artist award in Hong Kong, and the next year played the lead in the 1994 film The Lovers, his greatest commercial success. In February 1997, Wu went into the army to complete his military service. He returned to the entertainment industry in late 1998.
Just around the new millennium, with the broadcast of television series such as At the Threshold of an Era, Treasure Venture and Treasure Raiders, Wu achieved fame in the television industry. Since then, he has been working consistently in both film and television.
Since 2002, he focused his career in mainland China and moved to Beijing. With his background as a professional athlete, he is best known for playing fighting scenes and never uses stuntmen as he trusts his own ability. At times, he has also played complete different roles, proving himself to be a very skillful actor. During this period, Wu participated in more than 20 television series and more than 10 films as the lead actor.
In February 2010, Wu and the other members of Little Tigers Team reunited to perform during the Chinese New Year. In late 2011, Wu acted in the television series Scarlet Heart,  and is set to return to film its sequel Scarlet Heart 2 in 2013 in a different role.
