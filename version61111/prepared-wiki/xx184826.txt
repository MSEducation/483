[[Registered Building]]

CATEGORIES: Religious buildings

In England and Wales a religious building of a denomination other than the Church of England or the Church in Wales can be certified by the Registrar General as a place of worship and subsequently registered by the Registrar General for the solemnisation of religious marriage.   The marriage would be preceded by civil legal preliminaries and would be registered by either a local Registrar or by an Authorised Person.
