When the school was closed, portable classrooms were set up down the road at another site. In 1966 the first group of high school students were bussed to Fox Harbour, a community 12 kilometers away. Two years later a new high school opened in Placentia and both Ship Harbour and Fox Harbour students went to Laval High School. Presentation Sisters taught girls in one wing and Irish Christian Brothers taught boys in the other wing of Laval High School. In 1986 the portable school was permanently closed in Ship Harbour and all students, to this day are bussed to Dunville to St. Anne's Academy for kindergarten to Grade 6 and to Placentia for Grade 7 to Grade 12.http://www.shipharbour.bravepages.com/
