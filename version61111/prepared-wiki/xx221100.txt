Douglas Coupland  (pronounced [tpl]respell|KOHP|lənd[/tpl])Steve Lohr, "No More McJobs for Mr. X", The New York Times, May 29, 1994  (born December 30, 1961) is a Canadian novelist. His fiction is complemented by recognized  works in design and visual art arising from his early formal training.  His first novel, the 1991 international bestseller Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, popularized terms such as McJob and Generation X. He has published thirteen novels, two collections of short stories, seven non-fiction books, and a number of dramatic works and screenplays for film and television. A specific feature of Coupland's novels is their synthesis of postmodern religion, Web 2.0 technology, human sexuality, and pop culture.
Coupland lives in West Vancouver, British Columbia with his partner David Weir.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/garden/13location.html|title=Saving the House Next Door|last=Kurutz|first=Steven|date=2009-08-12|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-21[/tpl]  He published his twelfth novel Generation A in 2009.

==Early life==

Coupland was born on December 30, 1961 at Royal Canadian Air Force base RCAF Station Baden-Soellingen (later CFB Baden-Soellingen) in Baden-Söllingen, West Germany, the second of four sons to Dr. Douglas Charles Thomas Coupland, a medical officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and homemaker C. Janet Coupland, a graduate in comparative religion from McGill University.  In 1965, the Coupland family relocated to West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Coupland's father opened private family medical practice at the completion of his military tour.
Coupland describes his upbringing as producing a "blank slate".Wark, Penny."Trawling for Columbine". The Times, September 12th, 2003. "My mother comes from a sour-faced family of preachers who from the 19th century to well into the 20th scoured the prairies thumping Bibles. Her parents tried to get away from that but unwittingly transmitted their values to my mother. My father's family weren't that different."
Graduating from Sentinel Secondary School in West Vancouver in 1979, Coupland went to McGill University with the intention of (like his father) studying the sciences, specifically physics.Colman, David. "Take a Sharp Turn at Fiorucci". The New York Times, September 30, 2007. Coupland left McGill at the year's end and returned to Vancouver to attend art school.
At the Emily Carr College of Art and Design (now the Emily Carr University of Art and Design) on Granville Island in Vancouver, in Coupland's words, "I ... had the best four years of my life. It's the one place I've felt truly, totally at home. It was a magic era between the hippies and the PC goon squads. Everyone talked to everyone and you could ask anybody anything."Jackson, Alan. "I didn't get where I am today without..." The Times, June 17, 2006. Coupland graduated from Emily Carr in 1984 with a focus on sculpture, and moved on to study at the European Design Institute in Milan, Italy and the Hokkaido College of Art and Design in Sapporo, Japan. He also completed courses in business science, fine art, and industrial design in Japan in 1986.
Established as a designer working in Tokyo, Coupland suffered a skin condition brought on by Tokyo's summer climate, and returned to Vancouver. Before leaving Japan, Coupland had sent a postcard ahead to a friend in Vancouver. The friend's husband, a magazine editor, read the postcard and offered Coupland a job writing for the magazine. Coupland began writing for magazines as a means of paying his studio bills."The week in Reviews:Talkin' about his generation". The Observer, April 26, 1998. Reflecting on his becoming a writer, Coupland has admitted that he became one "By accident. I never wanted to be a writer. Now that I do it, there's nothing else I'd rather do."http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-40958285.html[tpl]failed verification|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Coupland's work regimen has been characterized as anti-slacker. He works seven days a week, with no vacations. Coupland is quoted as saying: "I've never taken a holiday. To lie on a beach someplace seems almost sinful. What's the point of being around unless you're working on something?"

==Novels==

===Generation X===

From 1989 to 1990, Coupland lived in the Mojave Desert working on a handbook about the birth cohort that followed the baby boom.Barker, Pat. "Behind the Lines". The Times, October 9, 2007. He received a $22,500 advance from St. Martin's Press to write the nonfiction handbook. Instead, Coupland wrote a novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture.Dafoe, Chris. "Carving a profile from a forgotten generation". The Globe and Mail, November 9, 1991. It was rejected in Canada before being accepted by an American publishing house in 1991.McLaren, Leah. "Birdman of BC". The Globe and Mail, September 28, 2006. Reflecting on the writing of his debut novel years later, Coupland said, "I remember spending my days almost dizzy with loneliness and feeling like I'd sold the family cow for three beans. I suppose it was this crippling loneliness that gave Gen X its bite. I was trying to imagine a life for myself on paper that certainly wasn't happening in reality."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/26/douglas-coupland-generation-x | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Guardian book club: week three | first=Douglas | last=Coupland | date=September 26, 2009[/tpl] Not an instant success, the novel steadily increased in sales, eventually attracting a following behind its core idea of "Generation X". Over his own protestations, Coupland was dubbed the spokesperson for a generation,Muro, Mark. "'Baby Busters' resent life in Boomers' debris". The Boston Globe, November 10, 1991. stating in 2006 "I was just doing what I do and people sort of stuck that on to me. It's not like I spend my days thinking that way."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3652914/Ask-the-author.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Ask the author | first=Douglas | last=Coupland | date=June 4, 2006[/tpl] Terms popularized by Coupland in the novel, including Generation X and McJob, ultimately entered the vernacular.Gilbert, Matthew. "Life after 'X'". The Boston Globe, March 16, 1994.

===Shampoo Planet to Life After God===

His second novel, Shampoo Planet, was published by Pocket Books in 1992. It focused on the generation after Generation X, the group called "Global Teens" in his first novel and now generally labeled Generation Y. Coupland permanently moved back to Vancouver soon after the novel was published. He had spent his "twenties scouring the globe thinking there had to be a better city out there, until it dawned on him that Vancouver is the best one going".Coupland, Douglas. City of Glass He wrote a collection of small books, which together were compiled, after the advice of his publisher, into the book Life After God. This collection of short stories, with its focus on spirituality, initially provoked polarized reaction before eventually revealing itself as a bellwether text for the avant-garde sensibility identified by Ferdinand Mount as "Christian post-Christian".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/the-magazine/books/539756/the-downfall-of-a-pessimist.thtml|accessdate=2009-01-03|title=The downfall of a pessimist|date=2008-03-05|last=Mount|first=Ferdinand|work=The Spectator[/tpl]

===Microserfs to All Families are Psychotic===

In 1994, Coupland was working for the newly formed magazine Wired. While there, Coupland wrote a short story about the life of the employees at Microsoft Corporation. This short work provided the inspiration for a novel, Microserfs. To research the culture that the novel depicted, Coupland had moved to Palo Alto, California and immersed himself in Silicon Valley life.Grimwood, Jon Courtenay. "Nerds of the cyberstocracy". The Independent, November 13, 1995
Coupland followed Microserfs with his first collection of non-fiction pieces, in 1996. Polaroids from the Dead is a manifold of stories and essays on diverse topics, including: Grateful Dead concerts; Harolding; Kurt Cobain's death; the visiting of a German reporter; and a comprehensive essay on Brentwood, California, written at the time of the O. J. Simpson murder case and the anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death.
That same year Coupland toured Europe to promote Microserfs, but the high workload brought on fatigue and mental strain.Smith, Stephen. "Dictators and comas". The Globe and Mail, March 14, 1998."Dealing with the X factor". The Age, July 30, 2005. He reportedly incorporated his experience with depression during this period into his next novel, Girlfriend in a Coma. Coupland noted that this was his last novel to be "...written as a young person, the last constructed from notebooks full of intricate observations".Wheelwright, Julie. "Talking About Which Generation?" The Independent, February 12, 2000.
In 1998, Coupland contributed the short story "Fire At The Ativan Factory" to the collection Disco 2000, and in 2000, he published Miss Wyoming.
Coupland then published his photographic paean to Vancouver, City of Glass. The book incorporates sections from Life After God and Polaroids from the Dead into a visual narrative, formed from photographs of Vancouver locations and life supplemented by stock footage mined from local newspaper archives.
Coupland's next novel, All Families Are Psychotic, tells the story of a dysfunctional family from Vancouver coming together to watch their daughter Sarah, an astronaut, launch into space.
In 2004, the dormant Saarinen-designed TWA Flight Center (now Jetblue Terminal 5) at JFK Airport briefly hosted an art exhibition called Terminal 5, curated by Rachel K. Ward and featuring the work of 18 artists including Coupland.

===Souvenir of Canada to Worst. Person. Ever.===

The promotional rounds for All Families are Psychotic were underway when the September 11 attacks took place.  In a play called September 10 performed later at Stratford-upon-Avon by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Coupland felt that this was the last day of the 1990s, and the new century had now truly begun.Gill, Alexandra. "Mirror, mirror on the page". The Globe and Mail, December 30, 2004."A slacker hero hits the stage". The Globe and Mail, July 31, 2004.
The first book that Coupland published after the September 11 attacks was Souvenir of Canada, which expanded his earlier City of Glass to incorporate the whole of Canada. There are two volumes in this series, which was conceived as an explanation to non-Canadians of uniquely Canadian things.
Coupland's second book in this period, Hey Nostradamus!, describes a fictitious high school shooting similar to the Columbine High School in 1999Anthony, Andrew. “Close to the Edge”. ‘’The Observer’’, August 24, 2003. Coupland relocates the events to a school in North Vancouver, Canada.
Coupland followed Hey Nostradamus! with Eleanor Rigby. Similarly to the titular original written and sung by The Beatles, the novel examines loneliness.”Dealing with the X factor”. ‘‘The Age’’, July 30, 2005. The novel received some positive acclaim as a more mature work, a notable example being novelist Ali Smith's review of the book for the Guardian newspaper.
Using the format of City of Glass and Souvenir of Canada, Coupland released a book for the Terry Fox Foundation called Terry. It is a photographic look back on the life of Fox, the result of Coupland's exhaustive research through the Terry Fox archives, including thousands of emotional letters from Canadians written to Fox during his one-legged marathon across Canada on Highway 1.
The third work of fiction in this period, written concurrently with the non-fiction Terry,[tpl]cite web|author=Ken Macqueen |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20060508_126415_126415 |title=Douglas Coupland: Playing with the Google generation | Macleans.ca - Culture - Books |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2006-05-08 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] is another re-envisioning of a previous book. jPod, billed as Microserfs for the Google generation, is his first Web 2.0 novel. The text of jPod recreates the experience of a novel read online on a notebook computer.  jPod was a popular success, giving rise to a CBC Television series for which Coupland wrote the script. The series lasted one season before cancellation.
Coupland's next novel, The Gum Thief, followed jPod in 2007. The Gum Thief was Coupland's first foray into the standard epistolary novel format following the 'laptop diaries'/'blog' formats of Microserfs and jPod.
Coupland published his eleventh novel, Generation A, in late 2009. In terms of style, Generation A "mirrors the structure of 1991's Generation X as it champions the act of reading and storytelling as one of the few defenses we still have against the constant bombardment of the senses in a digital world".http://www.coupland.com/2009/04/04/news-generation-a/[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] The novel takes place in the near future, after bees have become extinct, and focuses on five people from around the globe who are connected by being stung.
Coupland's contribution for the 2010 Massey Lectures, as opposed to a standard long essay, was 50,000 word novel entitled Player One – What Is to Become of Us: A Novel in Five Hours. Coupland wrote the novel as five hour-long lectures aired on CBC Radio from Nov. 8–12, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/google/article.cfm?article_id=11245|title=Coupland submits novel (!) for 2010 Massey Lecture[/tpl] According to Coupland, the novel "...presents a wide array of modes to view the mind, the soul, the body, the future, eternity, technology, and media." and is set "In a B-list Toronto airport hotel’s cocktail lounge in August of 2010."[tpl]cite web|last=Whittall |first=Zoe |url=http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/index.php/2010/04/29/qa-with-douglas-coupland-about-his-upcoming-massey-lectures-title/ |title=Q&A with Douglas Coupland about his upcoming Massey Lectures title | Quillblog | Quill & Quire |publisher=Quillandquire.com |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl]
The lecture/novel was published in its own right on October 7, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://anansi.ca/titles.cfm?pub_id=1447 |title=TITLES |publisher=Anansi.ca |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] House of Anansi Press' advance publicity for the novel stated that "Coupland's 2010 Massey Lecture is a real-time, five-hour story set in an airport cocktail lounge during a global disaster. Five disparate people are trapped inside: Karen, a single mother waiting for her online date; Rick, the down-on-his-luck airport lounge bartender; Luke, a pastor on the run; Rachel, a cool Hitchcock blonde incapable of true human contact; and finally a mysterious voice known as Player One. Slowly, each reveals the truth about themselves while the world as they know it comes to an end. In the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut and J. G. Ballard, Coupland explores the modern crises of time, human identity, society, religion, and the afterlife. The book asks as many questions as it answers, and readers will leave the story with no doubt that we are in a new phase of existence as a species – and that there is no turning back." On September 20, 2010, Player One was announced as part of the initial longlist for the 2010 Scotiabank Giller Prize literary award,[tpl]cite web|author=lrojas@capitalc.ca |url=http://www.scotiabankgillerprize.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Scotiabank Giller Prize |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/canadas-giller-prize-reveals-nominees-2084827.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Canada's Giller Prize reveals nominees | date=September 20, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/small-presses-dominate-giller-long-list/article1715325/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=John | last=Barber | title=Small presses dominate Giller long list | date=September 20, 2010[/tpl] Coupland's second longlisting for the prize after being longlisted in 2006 with jPod.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/09/20/2010-scotiabank-giller-prize-longlist-revealed/ |title=2010 Scotiabank Giller Prize longlist revealed | Afterword | National Post |publisher=Arts.nationalpost.com |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] However, the book didn't make it any further than the longlisthttp://scotiabankgillerprize.ca/scotiabank-giller-prize-2010-announces-its-short.html[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] and Coupland was denied the honour a second time, with the prize being eventually won by Johanna Skibsrud for her novel The Sentimentalists (novel).
Coupland followed Player One in November 2011 with a second short stories collection in collaboration with the artist Graham Roumieu entitled Highly Inappropriate Tales for Young People....Young People was a collection of seven short stories written by Coupland with illustrations provided by Romieu, described by the publisher as "Seven pants-peeingly funny stories featuring seven evil characters you can't help but love". The stories in the collection are 'Donald, the Incredibly Hostile Juice Box'; 'Kevin, the Hobo Minivan with Extremely Low Morals'; 'Brandon, the Action Figure with Issues'; 'Sandra, the Truly Dreadful Babysitter'; 'Hans, the Weird Exchange Student'; 'Cindy, the Terrible Role Model'; and, 'Mr. Fraser, the Undead Substitute Teacher'.http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/highly-inappropriate-tales-for-young-people/9780434021598

==Visual arts==

In 2000, Coupland resumed a visual arts practice dormant since 1989. His is a post-medium practice that employs a variety of materials. A common theme in his work is a curiosity with the corrupting and seductive dimensions of pop culture and 20th century pop art, especially that of Andy Warhol. Another recurring theme is military imagery, the result of growing up in a military family at the height of the Cold War. He is represented by the Clark & Faria Gallery in Toronto. In June 2010 he announced his first efforts as a clothing designer by collaborating with Roots Canada on a collection that is a representation of classic Canadian icons. The Roots X Douglas Coupland collection was announced in The Globe and Mail and featured clothing, art installations, sculpture, custom designed art and retail spaces.

All proceeds from the book are donated to the foundation for cancer research. Terrys format is similar to that of Coupland's City of Glass and Souvenir of Canada books. Its release coincided with the 25th anniversary of Terry Fox's 1980 Marathon of Hope.
Coupland codesigned Toronto Park, eight-hectare urban park called the Canoe Landing Park in downtown Toronto adjacent to the Gardiner Expressway.  The park, opened 2009, is embedded with a one-mile run called the Terry Fox Miracle Mile. The Miracle Mile contains art from Terry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/toronto/story.html?id=f79f834e-d85d-4b6e-8779-c27e8ecb6278&p=1 |title=National Post Article on Miracle Mile |publisher=Nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl]
Coupland has raised money for the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee by participating in advertising campaigns.
Coupland is also a regular contributor to Wikipedia; during his appearance at the Cheltenham Literary Festival (UK) in 2013, to promote his novel Worst.Person.Ever., Coupland said that he gives $200 a year the online encyclopaedia.
