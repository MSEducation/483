[tpl]Nihongo|Sora o Tobu, Mittsu no Hōhō.|空を飛ぶ、3つの方法。||lit. Three Ways to Fly in the Sky, commonly abbreviated as [tpl]Nihongo|Soramitsu|そらみつ[/tpl][/tpl] is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by La'cryma. It was released on July 25, 2008 for the PC as a limited edition DVD. The gameplay in Soramitsu follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters.
Soramitsu has also been adapted into other media. Before the game's release, a manga adaptation based on the visual novel illustrated by Japanese illustrator Kinusa Shimotsuki was serialized in the seinen manga magazine Comp Ace published by Kadokawa Shoten on November 26, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comptiq.com/ace/index.php?%CB%DC%BB%EF%2F2007%C7%AF%2FVOL.21|title=Information on Comp Ace[tpl]'[/tpl]s January 2008 issue|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|accessdate=2008-05-21|language=Japanese[/tpl]

==Gameplay==

The gameplay in Soramitsu requires little interaction from the player, as most of the duration of the game is only spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Occasionally, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from a list of options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, the gameplay pauses until the player makes a decision, which effectively furthers the plot. There are multiple plot lines that the player may experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is for the player to view the hentai scenes depicting the protagonist and the heroines having sexual intercourse, in addition to the game's story.

==Development==

Soramitsu was first announced to the public at Broccoli's 2007 content lineup media conference as the second project of the visual novel studio La'cryma,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.akibaos.com/?p=1834|title=New Di Gi Charat's appearance!
