Golden rice is a variety of Oryza sativa rice produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of rice.[tpl]cite journal| doi= 10.1126/science.287.5451.303| last1= Ye| first1= X| last2= Al-Babili| first2= S| last3= Klöti| first3= A| last4= Zhang| first4= J| last5= Lucca| first5= P| last6= Beyer| first6= P| last7= Potrykus| first7= I| title= Engineering the provitamin A (beta-carotene) biosynthetic pathway into (carotenoid-free) rice endosperm| journal= Science| volume= 287| issue= 5451| pages= 303–5| year= 2000| pmid= 10634784 [/tpl] The research was conducted with the goal of producing a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A,One existing crop, genetically engineered "golden rice" that produces vitamin A, already holds enormous promise for reducing blindness and dwarfism that result from a vitamin-A deficient diet. - Bill Frist, physician and politician, in a Washington Times commentary - November 21, 2006 http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20061120-094716-8709r.htm a deficiency which is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5 each year.Black RE et al., Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences, The Lancet, 2008, 371(9608), p. 253.
Golden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-carotene biosynthesis genes. The scientific details of the rice were first published in Science in 2000, the product of an eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. At the time of publication, golden rice was considered a significant breakthrough in biotechnology, as the researchers had engineered an entire biosynthetic pathway.
In 2005, a new variety called Golden Rice 2, which produces up to 23 times more beta-carotene than the original golden rice, was announced.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Paine |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n4/full/nbt1082.html |journal=Nature Biotechnology |first1=Jacqueline A |volume=23 |last2=Shipton |issue=4 |first2=Catherine A |pages=482–7 |last3=Chaggar |first3=Sunandha |last4=Howells |first4=Rhian M |last5=Kennedy |first5=Mike J |last6=Vernon |first6=Gareth |last7=Wright |first7=Susan Y |last8=Hinchliffe |first8=Edward |last9=Adams |first9=Jessica L | displayauthors=9 |year=2005 |pmid=15793573 |title=Improving the nutritional value of Golden Rice through increased pro-vitamin A content |doi= 10.1038/nbt1082 [/tpl] Although golden rice was developed as a humanitarian tool, it has met with significant opposition from environmental and anti-globalization activists.

==Creation==

Golden rice was designed to produce beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible part of rice, the endosperm. The rice plant can naturally produce beta-carotene in its leaves, where it is involved in photosynthesis. However, the plant does not normally produce the pigment in the endosperm, where photosynthesis does not occur. A key breakthrough was the discovery that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) can be used to produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce the multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants.[tpl]cite journal|last=Romer|first=S.|coauthors=Fraser, P.D., Kiano, J.W., Shipton, C.A., Misawa, N, Schuch, W. and Bramley, P.M.|title=Elevation of provitamin A content of transgenic tomato plants.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|year=2000|volume=18|pages=666–669|doi=10.1038/76523|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v18/n6/full/nbt0600_666.html|pmid=10835607|issue=6[/tpl] Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in Golden Rice.[tpl]cite web|title=The Science of Golden Rice|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/Content2-How/how1_sci.php|accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl]
Golden rice was created by transforming rice with only two beta-carotene biosynthesis genes:
(The insertion of a lcy (lycopene cyclase) gene was thought to be needed, but further research showed it is already being produced in wild-type rice endosperm.)
The psy and crtI genes were transformed into the rice nuclear genome and placed under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, so they are only expressed in the endosperm. The exogenous lcy gene has a transit peptide sequence attached so it is targeted to the plastid, where geranylgeranyl diphosphate formation occurs.  The bacterial crtI gene was an important inclusion to complete the pathway, since it can catalyze multiple steps in the synthesis of carotenoids up to lycopene, while these steps require more than one enzyme in plants.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-5266(00)00163-1 | last1 = Hirschberg | first1 = J. | year = 2001 | title = Carotenoid biosynthesis in flowering plants | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VS4-42T4DVS-9&_coverDate=06%2F01%2F2001&_alid=261007621&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6252&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000028338&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=554534&md5=153b20341f39ec8105f53f6a7927e12d | journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 210–218 | pmid = 11312131 [/tpl] The end product of the engineered pathway is lycopene, but if the plant accumulated lycopene, the rice would be red. Recent analysis has shown the plant's endogenous enzymes process the lycopene to beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving the rice the distinctive yellow color for which it is named.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1104/pp.104.057927 | last1 = Schaub | first1 = P. | last2 = Al-Babili | year = 2005 | first2 = S | last3 = Drake | first3 = R | last4 = Beyer | first4 = P | title = Why Is Golden Rice Golden (Yellow) Instead of Red? | url = | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 138 | issue = 1| pages = 441–450 | pmid = 15821145 | pmc = 1104197 [/tpl] The original golden rice was called SGR1, and under greenhouse conditions it produced 1.6 µg/g of carotenoids.

===Subsequent development===

Golden rice has been bred with local rice cultivars in the Philippines[tpl]cite web|url=http://investvine.com/gm-rice-field-destroyed-by-activists-in-the-philippines/|title=GM rice field destroyed by activists in the Philippines|first=Todd|last=Watson|work=Inside Investor|date=10 August 2013|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] and Taiwan and with the American rice cultivar 'Cocodrie'.LSU AgCenter Communications. ‘Golden Rice’ Could Help Reduce Malnutrition, 2004 The first field trials of these golden rice cultivars were conducted by Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in 2004. Field testing provides a more accurate measurement of nutritional value and enables feeding tests to be performed. Preliminary results from the field tests have shown field-grown golden rice produces 4 to 5 times more beta-carotene than golden rice grown under greenhouse conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/Content2-How/how8_tests.php |title=Testing the performance of Golden Rice |publisher=Goldenrice.org |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2013-08-26[/tpl]
In 2005, a team of researchers at biotechnology company, Syngenta, produced a variety of golden rice called "Golden Rice 2".  They combined the phytoene synthase gene from maize with crt1 from the original golden rice. Golden rice 2 produces 23 times more carotenoids than golden rice (up to 37 µg/g), and preferentially accumulates beta-carotene (up to 31 µg/g of the 37 µg/g of carotenoids). To receive the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), it is estimated that 144 g of the most high-yielding strain would have to be eaten. Bioavailability of the carotene from golden rice has been confirmed and found to be an effective source of Vitamin A for humans.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10681-006-9311-4 | last1 = Datta | first1 = S.K. | last2 = Datta | year = 2007 | first2 = Karabi | last3 = Parkhi | first3 = Vilas | last4 = Rai | first4 = Mayank | last5 = Baisakh | first5 = Niranjan | last6 = Sahoo | first6 = Gayatri | last7 = Rehana | first7 = Sayeda | last8 = Bandyopadhyay | first8 = Anindya | last9 = Alamgir | first9 = Md. | displayauthors=9 | title = Golden rice: introgression, breeding, and field evaluation | url = | journal = Euphytica | volume = 154 | issue = 3| pages = 271–278 [/tpl]Norton, Amy (15 August 2012) Genetically modified rice a good vitamin A source Reuters, Retrieved 20 August 2012

==Potential use to combat vitamin A deficiency==

The research that led to golden rice was conducted with the goal of helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). In 2005, 190 million children and 19 million pregnant women, in 122 countries, were estimated to be affected by VAD.Staff (2009) Global Prevalence Of Vitamin A Deficiency in Populations At Risk 1995–2005  WHO Global Database on Vitamin A Deficiency. Geneva, World Health Organization, ISBN 978924159801[tpl]Please check ISBN|reason=Invalid length.[/tpl],  Retrieved 10 October 2011 VAD is responsible for 1–2 million deaths, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of xerophthalmia annually.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = J.H. | last2 = West | first2 = K.P. Jr | last3 = Sommer | first3 = A. | year = 1992 | title = Vitamin A deficiency and attributable mortality in under-5-year-olds | url = | journal = WHO Bulletin | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 225–232 [/tpl] Children and pregnant women are at highest risk. Vitamin A is supplemented orally and by injection in areas where the diet is deficient in vitamin A. [tpl]As of|1999[/tpl], there were 43 countries that had vitamin A supplementation programs for children under 5; in 10 of these countries, two high dose supplements are available per year, which, according to UNICEF, could effectively eliminate VAD.UNICEF. Vitamin A deficiency However, UNICEF and a number of NGOs involved in supplementation note more frequent low-dose supplementation should be a goal where feasible.Vitamin A Global Initiative. 1997. A Strategy for Acceleration of Progress in Combating Vitamin A Deficiency
Because many children in countries where there is a dietary deficiency in vitamin A rely on rice as a staple food, the genetic modification to make rice produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene is seen as a simple and less expensive alternative to vitamin supplements or an increase in the consumption of green vegetables or animal products.
Initial analyses of the potential nutritional benefits of golden rice suggested consumption of golden rice would not eliminate the problems of vitamin A deficiency, but should be seen as a complement to other methods of vitamin A supplementation.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0306-9192(02)00065-9 | last1 = Dawe | first1 = D. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = R. | last3 = Unnevehr | first3 = L. | year = 2002 | title = Golden rice: what role could it play in alleviation of vitamin A deficiency? | url = | journal = Food Policy | volume = 27 | issue = 5–6| pages = 541–560 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.foodpol.2004.03.001 | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = R. | last2 = Qaim | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Potential health benefits of Golden Rice: a Philippine case study | url = http://croplife.intraspin.com/Biotech/potential-health-benefits-of-golden-rice-a-philippine-case-study/ | journal = Food Policy | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 147–168 [/tpl] Since then, improved strains of golden rice have been developed containing sufficient provitamin A to provide the entire dietary requirement of this nutrient to people who eat about 75g of golden rice per day.
In particular, since carotenes are hydrophobic, there needs to be a sufficient amount of fat present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to be able to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. In that respect, it is significant that vitamin A deficiency is rarely an isolated phenomenon, but usually coupled to a general lack of a balanced diet (see also Vandana Shiva's arguments below). The RDA levels accepted in developed countries are far in excess of the amounts needed to prevent blindness. Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of RDA for healthy children.

Dr. Jose' L. Domingo of the Laboratory of Toxicology and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, at Rovira I Virgili University in Spain said, "According to the information reported by the WHO, genetically modified products that are currently on the international market have all passed risk assessments conducted by national authorities." These assessments found no risk to human health.

===Clinical trials / food safety and nutrition research===

In 2009, research results of a clinical trial of Golden Rice with adult volunteers from the USA, was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. It concluded that "beta carotene derived from Golden Rice is effectively converted to vitamin A in humans".Golden Rice is an effective source of vitamin A, by Guangwen Tang, Jian Qin, Gregory G Dolnikowski, Robert M Russell, and Michael A Grusak in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2009;89:1776–83.  In a summary about the research the American Society for Nutrition suggests the implications of the research are that "Golden Rice could probably supply 50% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A from a very modest amount — perhaps a cup — of rice, if consumed daily. This amount is well within the consumption habits of most young children and their mothers".American Society of Nutrition: Researchers Determine That Golden Rice Is an Effective Source of Vitamin A
In response to the research, a group of 20 scientists suggested in an open letter that there might be deficiencies in clinical trials: "There is now a large body of evidence that shows that GM crop/food production is highly prone to inadvertent and unpredictable pleiotropic effects, which can result in health damaging effects when GM food products are fed to animals. More specifically, our greatest concern is that this rice, which is engineered to overproduce beta carotene, has never been tested in animals, and there is an extensive medical literature showing that retinoids that can be derived from beta carotene are both toxic and cause birth defects."

==Controversy==

Critics of genetically engineered crops have raised various concerns. One of these is that golden rice originally did not have sufficient vitamin A. This problem was solved by the development of new strains of rice. However, there are still doubts about the speed at which vitamin A degrades once the plant is harvested, and how much remains after cooking.[ref]Then, C, 2009, "The campaign for genetically modified rice is at the crossroads: A critical look at Golden Rice after nearly 10 years of development."

Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-GMO activist, argued the problem was not that the crop had any particular deficiencies, but that there were potential problems with poverty and loss of biodiversity in food crops. Shiva claimed these problems could be amplified by the corporate control of agriculture via control of genetically modified organisms. By focusing on a narrow problem (vitamin A deficiency), Shiva argued, the golden rice proponents were obscuring the larger issue of a lack of broad availability of diverse and nutritionally adequate sources of food.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/GEessays/goldenricehoax.html |title=THE "GOLDEN RICE" HOAX -When Public Relations replaces Science |publisher=Online.sfsu.edu |date=2000-06-29 |accessdate=2013-08-26[/tpl] Other groups argued that a varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, leafy green vegetables and fruit would provide children with sufficient vitamin A.Friends of the Earth.

In 2008 WHO malnutrition expert Francesco Branca cited the lack (in 2008) of real-world studies and uncertainty about how many people will use golden rice, concluding "giving out supplements, fortifying existing foods with vitamin A, and teaching people to grow carrots or certain leafy vegetables are, for now, more promising ways to fight the problem".[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Enserink | first1 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Tough Lessons From Golden Rice | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue =5875 | pages = 468–471 | doi=10.1126/science.320.5875.468 | pmid = 18436769 [/tpl]

Golden rice was said to be the first recombinant DNA tech crop that was unarguably beneficial. Monsanto Company was one of the first companies to grant free licences.Dobson, Roger (2000) Royalty-free licenses for genetically modified rice made available to developing countries Bulletin of the World Health Organisation, 78 (10), P 1281, retrieved August 10, 2010
The cutoff between humanitarian and commercial use was set at US$10,000.  Therefore, as long as a farmer or subsequent user of golden rice genetics does not make more than $10,000 per year, no royalties need to be paid. In addition, farmers are permitted to keep and replant seed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why3_FAQ.php#Licence |title=Frequently asked questions (1) |publisher=Goldenrice.org |date=2004-10-13 |accessdate=2013-08-26[/tpl]
