==History==

The formerly bicameral Venezuelan legislature was transformed by the 1999 constitution into a unicameral National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional). The political system described below is that defined by the 1999 Constitution, which was approved by popular referendum in 1999 and first came into force on 30 December 1999.

==Overview==

Legislation can be initiated by the executive branch, the legislative branch (either a committee of the National Assembly or three members of the latter), the judicial branch, the citizen branch (ombudsman, public prosecutor, and controller general) or a public petition signed by no fewer than 0.1% of registered voters. The president can ask the National Assembly to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple majority of the Assembly can override these objections.
The voting age in Venezuela is 18 and older. Voting is not compulsory.[tpl]cite news |publisher=The Guardian |title=Compulsory voting around the world |date=4 July 2005 |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html |accessdate=10 March 2007 | location=London | first=Elliot | last=Frankal[/tpl]
