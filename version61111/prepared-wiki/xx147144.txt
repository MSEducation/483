==Literary career==

Moira Crone's first book The Winnebago Mysteries was published in 1982 by the Fiction Collective and praised by John Barth as "a pure delight."  The story "Kudzu" with its tobacco country setting and frustrated father presaged  her later work in What Gets Into Us. The debut novel that followed.  A Period of Confinement (Putnam, 1985) was listed as new and noteworthy by the New York Times, which commented, 'This is a first novel that makes you sit up and pay attention." [tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=George|title=New & Noteworthy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/books/new-noteworthy.html?pagewanted=2|newspaper=The New York Times Book Review|date=September 6, 1987[/tpl]  The novel set in Baltimore in the late 70's tells of "the confinement of Alma Taylor, a young artist, begins when she falls in love; then she gets pregnant, marries and finally flees to New York." Publisher's Weekly found "much to savor in this small, deeply affecting novel, written in the voice of a woman who abandons her baby and husband in a depressed, confused postpartum "period of confinement."
In 1981 Crone moved to Louisiana to teach at Louisiana State University and began writing stories set in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, among them Oslo which appeared in The New Yorker [tpl]cite journal|last=Crone|first=Moira|title=Oslo|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 28, 1984|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1984/05/28/1984_05_28_038_TNY_CARDS_000339304[/tpl]  The Louisiana stories were gathered in Dream State, often depicting the plight of "transplanted Northerners" who "feel trapped in Louisiana, where "all the big questions are still left open.. are women people, did Elvis die, was slavery wrong?"  The New York Times Book Review praised her "fresh version of the Deep South, one that is exotic without being either grotesque or romanticized" and reported  that "the sensibility embodied in Ms. Crone's energetic fiction ...is utterly sui generis."[tpl]cite news|last=Krist|first=Gary|title=Louisiana Limbo|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/17/nnp/crone-dream.html|newspaper=The New York Times Book Review|date=October 29, 1995[/tpl] 
Turning her attention to her childhood in eastern North Carolina, Crone's next collection What Gets Into Us recreates the life of a small town in the Carolinas, as seen across racial and class lines over a period from the 1950s to the present. Writing for Popmatters, Phoebe Kates Foster states: " What Gets Into Us is a complex and remarkable book that deserves to be read slowly and re-read meditatively. Like the works of Flannery O’Connor, this collection transcends the genre of “Southern Literature” and probes deeply into the paradoxes of the psyche and the zeitgeist of modern America...Crone has the lyric touch of a poet and the visionary spirit of a mystic, conjuring images that are both disturbing and startlingly beautiful. The reader will never forget Claire McKenzie’s last memory of her mother or Sidney Byrd’s symbolic dream about her dead friend Pauline or Lily Stark’s stunning vision that closes this collection. Though Crone provides no easy way out for the tormented individuals of Fayton, North Carolina, there is redemption in this book. Like her characters, the reader just has to have faith in the midst of darkness and look for it.[tpl]cite web|last=Foster|first=Phoebe|title=What Gets Into Us by Moira Crone|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/what-gets-into-us-by-moira-crone/|publisher=Popmatters|accessdate=August 14, 2006[/tpl] Recently Crone has ventured into speculative fiction with the 2012 publication of "The Not Yet", which Publishers Weekly described as "an impressive genre debut with a strong literary voice...". Reviewer Greg Langley, wrote:
"...  What Crone has combined is wry social commentary in the vein of Swift or Voltaire with a dystopian coming-of-age tale. It’s a brilliant book full of adventure and humor and no small amount of pathos. Best of all, Crone uses her book to ask what it means to be human, a question all of us Nats need to keep asking ourselves. (Baton Rouge Advocate). The Not Yet was a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award for best science fiction of the year in paperback format.[tpl]cite web|title=Philip K. Dick Award|url=http://www.philipkdickaward.org/2013/01/index.html[/tpl]
