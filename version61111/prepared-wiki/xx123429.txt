==History==

===Smooth Jazz 100.9===

Prior to October 2007, the 100.9 frequency was home to WYJZ, a smooth jazz station that began broadcasting on June 15, 1998.

===RadioNow 100.9===

On Monday, October 8, 2007, at Noon, the "RadioNow" format was dropped from the 93.1 frequency (then owned by Emmis Communications when it switched to Christmas music in advance of picking up the talk format from sister WIBC, which in turn was moving from AM 1070 to clear a spot for sports radio WFNI in December 2007.
Two days later, on Wednesday, October 10, 2007, at 4:30 PM, after playing "Anthem For a New America" by Jeff Lorber, WYJZ dropped its smooth jazz format and picked up the contemporary hit radio format of WNOU after stunting for a half-hour with a loop of someone saying "RadioNOW, Now At 100.9". Radio One purchased the intellectual property of WNOU including its "RadioNOW" branding, format and logo, which were all installed on 100.9 FM.  Radio One management claimed that they will offer the displaced staffers of the original WNOU the first chance of joining the station's lineup, and will use the same imaging as the former 93.1.
The last song played on "RadioNow 93.1" was "When You're Gone" by Avril Lavigne.  The first song played on "RadioNOW 100.9" was "Bartender" by T-Pain and Akon.
On October 31, 2007, WYJZ picked up the WNOU call sign, completing the "move" of "Radio Now" to 100.9.
By 2009, when Cumulus Media's WRWM picked up the contemporary hit radio format, WNOU started to lean more rhythmic as it forced sister station WHHH to move from rhythmic to urban.  The rhythmic lean was reduced when WRWM switched to hot adult contemporary.
