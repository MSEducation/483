During this period he was also successful at qualifying school on three occasions, allowing him to play limited events on the main European Tour in 2000, 2002 and 2003. In 2004 Eliasson finished in eleventh place on the Challenge Tour rankings, which gave him full promotion to the European Tour. He went on to play at that level for three seasons, from 2005 to 2007.
