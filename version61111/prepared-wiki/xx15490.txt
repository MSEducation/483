[[Mountain]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains, Geography terminology

A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth by over [tpl]convert|10000|ft|m[/tpl]. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.
High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.
The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is [tpl]convert|8849.868|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at [tpl]convert|21171|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Definition==

There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain.[tpl]sfn|Gerrard|1990[/tpl] In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."[tpl]sfn|Gerrard|1990[/tpl]
Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. The highest point in San Francisco, California, is called Mount Davidson, notwithstanding its height of [tpl]convert|300|m|abbr=on[/tpl], which makes it twenty feet short of the minimum for a mountain by American designations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Similarly, Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only [tpl]convert|251|m|abbr=on[/tpl] from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography[tpl]cite book|last=Whittow|first=John|year=1984|title=Dictionary of Physical Geography|location=London|publisher=Penguin|page=352|isbn=0-14-051094-X[/tpl] states "Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."
In the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high,[tpl]cite book| last=Nuttall| first=John & Anne| work=The Mountains of England & Wales|volume=2|title=England| edition=3rd| year=2008| publisher=Cicerone| location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria| isbn=1-85284-037-4[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7623904.stm|title=Survey turns hill into a mountain|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.go4awalk.com/uk-mountains-and-hills/a-mountain-is-a-mountain.php|title=A Mountain is a Mountain – isn't it?|publisher=www.go4awalk.com|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mountain|title=mountain|work=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Peter|year=2001|title=Listing the Irish hills and mountains|journal=Irish Geography|volume=34|issue=1|publisher=University of Ulster|location=Coleraine|page=89|url=http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/34-1/hills.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1080/00750770109555778[/tpl] whilst the official UK government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher.[tpl]cite web|url=http://metricviews.org.uk/2008/09/what-is-a-mountain-mynydd-graig-goch-and-all-that/|title=What is a "Mountain"?

Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gallery.usgs.gov/audios/127|title=What is the difference between lake and pond; mountain and hill; or river and creek?|publisher=USGS|accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl]

Using these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa.[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002|p=14[/tpl] As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.[tpl]cite web|url= http://panos.org.uk/wp-content/files/2011/03/high_stakeshVwvcI.pdf|author=Panos|year=2002|title=High Stakes|accessdate=17 February 2009[/tpl]

==Geology==

There are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block.[tpl]cite book |title=Science matters: earth and beyond; module 4 |isbn=0-7986-6059-7 |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson South Africa |chapter=Chapter 6: Mountain building |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qoZftjymxFsC&pg=PA75 |page=75[/tpl] All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.

===Volcanoes===

Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot.[tpl]cite book |title=Science of Earth Systems |first=Stephen D|last=Butz |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JB4ArbvXXDEC&pg=PA136 |page=136 |chapter = Chapter 8: Plate tectonics |isbn=0-7668-3391-7 |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson/Delmar Learning[/tpl]  At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano.[tpl]sfn|Gerrard|1990|p=194[/tpl] Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the United States.

===Fold mountains===

Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.[tpl]cite book |title=4-D framework of continental crust |editor=Robert D. Hatcher Jr., MP Carlson, JH McBride & JR Martinez Catalán |first=Michael P|last=Searle |page=41 ff |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jD-zXhTfJuMC&pg=PA41 |chapter=Diagnostic features and processes in the construction and evolution of Oman-, Zagros-, Himalyan-, Karakoram-, and Tibetan type orogenic belts |isbn=0-8137-1200-9 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=2007[/tpl] Since the less dense continental crust "floats" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas.[tpl]cite book|last1=Press|first1=Frank|last2=Siever|first2=Raymond|title=Earth|publisher=W. H. Freeman|edition=4th|year=1985|page=413|isbn=978-0-7167-1743-0[/tpl] Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.

===Block mountains===

Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a seam where rocks can move past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain.[tpl]cite book |title=CliffsQuickReview Earth Science |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PV_BabxTTkcC&pg=PA94 |chapter=Figure 13-1 |first=Scott|last=Ryan |isbn=0-471-78937-2 |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley[/tpl] The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range province of Western North America and the Rhine valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.

===Erosion===

During and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves.[tpl]sfn|Fraknoi|Morrison|Wolff|2004|p=160[/tpl] Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge arêtes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the Catskills, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.

==Climate==

Climate on mountains become colder at high elevations, due to the way that the sun heats the surface of the Earth.[tpl]cite book|title=First Principles of Meteorology and Air Pollution|first=Mihalis|last=Lazaridis|page=70|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-9400701618[/tpl] The sun warms the ground directly, while the greenhouse effect acts as a blanket, reflecting heat back towards the Earth that would otherwise be lost to space. The greenhouse effect thus keeps the air at low elevations warm. As elevation increases, there is less greenhouse effect, so the ambient temperature goes down.[tpl]cite book|last1=Lutgens|first1=Frederick K.|last2=Tarbuck|first2=Edward J.|title=The Atmosphere: An Introduction to Meteorology|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1998|pages=15–17, 30–35, 38–40|isbn=0-13-742974-6[/tpl]
The rate at which the temperature drops with elevation, called the environmental lapse rate, is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a typical lapse rate is 5.5°C per 1,000 m (3.57°F per 1,000 ft).[ref]
