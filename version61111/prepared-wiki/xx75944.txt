Gish was called "creationism's  T.H. Huxley" for the way he "relished the confrontations" of formal debates with prominent evolutionary biologists, usually held on university campuses."[tpl]harvnb|Numbers|2006|page=316[/tpl]  A creationist publication noted in his obituary that "it was perhaps his personal presentation that carried the day.  In short, the audiences liked him."Acts & Facts, May 2013.

==Early life and education==

Gish, a twin, was born in White City, Kansas, the youngest of nine children.  He served in World War II, attaining the rank of captain, and was awarded the Bronze Star.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/utsandiego/obituary.aspx?n=duane-t-gish&pid=163795335#fbLoggedOut He earned a B.S. degree from UCLA in 1949 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1953.  He worked as an Assistant Research Associate at Berkeley, and Assistant Professor at Cornell University Medical College performing biomedical and biochemical research for eighteen years, joining the Upjohn Company as a Research Associate in 1960.[tpl]cite book |author=Smout, Kary D. |title=The creation/evolution controversy: a battle for cultural power |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-275-96262-8 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl][tpl]pn|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Creationism==

A Methodist from age ten, and later a fundamentalist Baptist, Gish believed that the Biblical creation story was historical fact.[tpl]harvnb|Numbers|2006|page=251[/tpl]  After reading Evolution: Science Falsely So-Called in the late 1950s, Gish became persuaded that science had produced falsifying evidence against biological evolutionary theory and that various fields of science offered corroborating evidence in support of Biblical creation."Dr. Duane Gish: Crusader", Creation Matters, Volume 1, Number 1 January/February 1996 He joined the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an association of Christian scientists, mistakenly assuming the group supported creationism.  Through his affiliation at the ASA, Gish met geneticist and creationist, William J. Tinkle, who in 1961 invited Gish to join a newly formed anti-evolution caucus within the ASA.
In 1971, Gish became a member of the faculty at San Diego Christian College, working in its research division before accepting a position at the Institute for Creation Research (independent since 1981).  He was the author of several books and articles espousing creationism.  His best known work, Evolution: The Fossils Say No!, published in 1978, has been widely accepted by antievolutionists as an authoritative reference. Gish initially "assigned low priority to the question of age the Earth".[tpl]harvnb|Numbers|2006|page=260[/tpl].
At his death on March 5, 2013, Gish held the position of Senior Vice-President Emeritus at the ICR.

==Debates==

Debating opponents said that Gish used a rapid-fire approach during a debate, presenting arguments and changing topics quickly.  Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, dubbed this approach the "Gish Gallop," describing it as "where the creationist is allowed to run on for 45 minutes or an hour, spewing forth torrents of error that the evolutionist hasn't a prayer of refuting in the format of a debate."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/debating/globetrotters.html | title = Debates and the Globetrotters | last = Scott | first = Eugenie | date = 1994-07-07 | publisher = Talk Origins Archive | accessdate = 2007-10-30  | authorlink = Eugenie Scott [/tpl] She also criticized Gish for failing to answer objections raised by his opponents.[tpl]cite web | url = http://ncse.com/rncse/24/6/confronting-creationism | title = Confronting Creationism: When and How | last = Scott | first = Eugenie | authorlink = Eugenie Scott | accessdate = 2009-01-19  | date = November–December 2004 | publisher = National Center for Science Education [/tpl] The phrase has also come to be used as a pejorative to describe similar debate styles employed by proponents of other, usually fringe beliefs, such as homeopathy or the moon landing hoax.[tpl]cite web|title=Homeopathy: Recedit ad anum|url=http://blog.anarchic-teapot.net/2012/02/18/homeopathy-recedit-ad-anum/|publisher=Short and spiky|accessdate=21 May 2012|date=15 Feb 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=St. Whitehall|first=Nigel|title=Skeptoid #167|url=http://www.skepreview.com/2009/08/skeptoid-167.html|publisher=The Skeptical Review|accessdate=21 May 2012|date=18 Aug 2009[/tpl]
Gish was also criticised for using a standardized presentation during debates. While undertaking research for a debate with Gish, Michael Shermer noted that Gish used similar openings, assumptions about his opponent, slides, and even jokes. Although Shermer said that while he stated he was not an atheist and was willing to accept the existence of a divine creator, Gish attempted to prove that Shermer was indeed an atheist and therefore immoral.[tpl]cite book |authorlink =Michael Shermer | last = Shermer | first = Michael |title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, And Other Confusions Of Our Time |publisher=A.W.H.

Creationists view Gish's performances differently.  In the early days of his debates, one creationist wrote, "evolutionists were caught somewhat by surprise when a qualified speaker—complete with a working knowledge of the relevant literature and research—challenged their worldview....Soon spokespersons for evolution publicly recommended that evolutionists not debate Duane Gish because they would surely lose."
