The Willam-Warnke yield criterion Willam, K. J. and Warnke, E. P. (1975). Constitutive models for the triaxial behavior of concrete. Proceedings of the International Assoc. for Bridge and Structural Engineering , vol 19, pp. 1- 30. is a function that is used to predict when failure will occur in concrete and other cohesive-frictional materials such as rock, soil, and ceramics.  This yield criterion has the functional form

==Willam-Warnke yield function==

In the original paper, the three-parameter Willam-Warnke yield function was expressed as

The Haigh-Westergaard representation of the Willam-Warnke yield condition can be
written as

==Modified forms of the Willam-Warnke yield criterion==

An alternative form of the Willam-Warnke yield criterion in Haigh-Westergaard coordinates is the Ulm-Coussy-Bazant form:Ulm, F-J., Coussy, O., Bazant, Z. (1999) The ‘‘Chunnel’’ Fire. I: Chemoplastic softening in rapidly heated concrete. ASCE Journal of Engineering Mechanics, vol. 125, no. 3, pp. 272-282.
