Association of Free Lutheran Congregations is the fifth largest Lutheran church body in the United States. The AFLC includes congregations in 27 different states, as well as four Canadian provinces. The AFLC is not an incorporated synod, but a free association. Each local congregation is a separate corporation.

==History==

The AFLC was formed by 40 churches in 1962. The churches that formed the AFLC were members of the Lutheran Free Church who did not wish to join The American Lutheran Church. The body was originally called the Lutheran Free Church-not merged. The ALC filed suit against the group for using the name Lutheran Free Church. By 1964 the name Association of Free Lutheran Congregations was established.

==Today==

In 2006 the AFLC had 43,360 baptized members in 267 churches.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1302.asp| title = 2008 Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches|publisher = The National Council of Churches|accessdate = 2009-12-04[/tpl] The estimate for 2009 saw the AFLC growing to 44,000 members.LWF Statistics 2009 Minnesota remains the geographic center of the organization, with over 80 congregations and over 12,000 members.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/maps/map.asp?variable=67&state=101&variable2=| title = 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study|publisher = Glenmary Research Center|accessdate = 2009-12-04[/tpl] There are also numerous congregations in the neighboring states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

There are two auxiliary corporations in the AFLC: the Women's Missionary Federation (WMF)  and Free Lutheran Youth (FLY).

====Schools Corporation====

The schools corporation's main delegation is the election of the board of trustees, which governs the seminary and Bible school.  This corporation consists of fifty members from the congregations of the AFLC.

=====Association Free Lutheran Bible School=====

The AFLC leaders came to the consensus to create a Lutheran Bible School patterned after the fundamental teachings of the Lutheran Bible Institute founded in 1919.  The school was opened in 1966 with 13 students, but grew to 35 the next year.  By the 1990s, the AFLBS was averaging 105 students.  Today there are approximately 200 students attending the school.

====Missions Corporation====

The missions corporation consists of one hundred members of the congregations of the AFLC, and elects from itself a World Missions Committee and a Home Missions Committee, which are involved in the outreach of the AFLC into the United States and several other countries.

The Association Retreat Center (ARC) is a separate organization of the AFLC near Osceola, Wisconsin that serves as a retreat center for various activities within the AFLC.
The Women's Missionary Federation (WMF) serves the women of the churches with Bible studies, fellowship, and has an emphasis on missionary services.
The Free Lutheran Youth (FLY), formerly known as the Luther League Federation, is a youth organization dealing with youth ministry.

===Doctrine===

The AFLC accept and believe in the Holy Bible as the complete written Word of God, preserved by the Holy Spirit for salvation and instruction. The AFLC accepts the ancient ecumenical symbols, namely, the Apostles, the Nicene, and the Athanasian Creeds; Luther's Small Catechism and the unaltered Augsburg Confession as the true expression of the Christian faith and life.

==Annual Conferences==

The AFLC schedules each year a conference to share reports of congregations and other various ministries.  The main reason for these conferences is spiritual edification, as the schedules include prayer times, worship hours, and business meetings together.  It is here that suggestions to changes are presented and discussed.  It is also here that the elections for positions in committees/corporations are made.
