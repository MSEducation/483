 Has several examples of Steinitz testing his theories in top-class play.</ref> This is generally seen as the point at which Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world's leading active player. Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been floating around since the 1840s,<ref name="Spinrad2006EarlyWorldRankings" /> the 1866 Anderssen–Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship, and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive.  Furthermore, Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments & in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871.<ref>[tpl]cite book | title=The Centenary Match, Kasparov–Karpov III | author=[[Raymond Keene]] and David Goodman | year=1986| pages=1–2 [/tpl]</ref>

===1866–79===

By this time tournaments were becoming more frequent, and the round-robin format was adopted.  At the same time, Anderssen, after losing the match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866, re-dedicated himself to chess, particularly studying both endgames and positional play.  The result was that Anderssen, in his early fifties, was playing the finest chess of his career.  As a result, Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career: five first places, two second places, two third places; and a sixth place in the final year of his life, when his health was failing. One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz, Gustav Neumann, Joseph Henry Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. This is regarded as one of the top 20 strongest tournaments ever despite the proliferation of "super tournaments" since 1990.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/g.giffen/tournaments.htm | title=The Strongest Tournaments in Chess History | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Formulas.asp?Params=199510SS0SS3S000000000000111000000000000010100#ClassExplanation | title=Formulas | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] One of Anderssen's third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament, when he was 55. About half of Anderssen's tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations; but these were open to all nationalities, and most of them had a few "top ten" or even "top five" competitors. Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches but his dominance came to an end came 1871.
The Leipzig 1877 tournament, in which Anderssen came second behind Louis Paulsen, was organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Anderssen's learning the chess moves. The initiative sprang from the Central German Chess Federation. It is the only tournament ever organized to commemorate a competitor. 
Still at Leipzig, Anderssen lost a match against tournament winner Louis Paulsen (three wins, one draw, and five losses). Matches were Anderssen's relative weakness; his only match win in this period was in 1868, against the 26-year-old Johann Zukertort (eight wins, one draw, and three losses).

==Assessment==

===Playing strength and style===

Anderssen was very successful in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in over half of the events in which he played. His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live. His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six.
Arpad Elo, inventor of the Elo rating system, retroactively calculated ratings through history, and estimated that Anderssen was the first player with a rating over 2600. Chessmetrics ranks Anderssen as one of the top five players for most of the period from 1851 to shortly before his death in 1879.[tpl]cite web | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S003629000000111000000000001310100 | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Adolf Anderssen | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl]
Steinitz, who spoke his mind without fear or favor, rated Anderssen as one of the two greatest attacking players of his time: "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/steinitz.html | title=Steinitz Quotes | author=Winter, E. | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509063357/http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/steinitz.html| archivedate= 9 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Although Anderssen is regarded as a member of the "heroic" attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack",[tpl]cite book | title=Manual of Chess | author=Emanuel Lasker | url=http://www.exeterchessclub.org.uk/quotes.html | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080524182118/http://www.exeterchessclub.org.uk/quotes.html| archivedate= 24 May 2008 | deadurl= yes [/tpl] a principle more recently labelled "Makogonov's rule".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessdevon.co.uk/HTML/archives/chessbase/Arch13/base.htm | title=The secret weapons of the champions | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] Nevertheless his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.
Anderssen's home town was so proud of him that in 1865 Breslau University awarded him an honorary doctorate.

===Influence on chess===

The "heroic" attacking school of play to which Anderssen belonged was eclipsed by Steinitz' positional approach – by 1894 it was generally acknowledged that the only way to beat Steinitz was to apply Steinitz' principles.[tpl]cite journal | journal=New York times | date=11 March 1894 | title=Ready for a big chess match | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=9400E4DF1630E033A25752C1A9659C94659ED7CF&oref=slogin&oref=slogin  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | format=PDF[/tpl]
Anderssen has had a more enduring influence on chess problem composition. He started composing in the last years of the "Old School", whose compositions were fairly similar to realistic over-the-board positions and featured spectacular "key" moves, multiple sacrifices and few variations. He was one of the most skilful composers of his time, and his work forms an early stage of the "Transition Period", between the mid-1840s and the early 1860s, when many of the basic problem ideas were discovered, the requirement for game-like positions was abandoned and the introduction of composing competitions (the first of which was in 1854) forced judges to decide on what features were the most desirable in a problem.
Outside the field of chess problems Anderssen was not a prolific author. However he edited the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) from 1846 to 1865, and was co-editor with          Gustav Neumann of Neue Berliner Schachzeitung from 1864 to 1867.

===Personality===

Steinitz wrote: "Anderssen was honest and honourable to the core. Without fear or favour he straightforwardly gave his opinion, and his sincere disinterestedness became so patent....that his word alone was usually sufficient to quell disputes...for he had often given his decision in favour of a rival..." On the other hand Reuben Fine, who was born decades after Anderssen, wrote, "There is a curious contrast between his over-the-board brilliance and his uninspired safety-first attitude in everyday affairs."

==Death==

Anderssen died on March 13, 1879 in his hometown. The Deutsche Schachzeitung noted his death in 1879 with a nineteen-page obituary. 
Bombing raids during World War II damaged his grave in Breslau. After the war, the city became part of Poland and is now known under its Polish name Wrocław. In 1957, the Polish Chess Federation decided to re-bury Anderssen in a new grave at the Osobowicki Cemetery.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Anderssen&GSfn=Adolf&GSbyrel=in&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=29440828& | title=Find A Grave: Adolf Anderssen | accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl]]For a picture of his grave, see [tpl]cite web | publisher=Ken Whyld Association | url=http://www.kwabc.org/Homepage-UK/breslau.htm | accessdate=2008-11-19 | title=At the grave of Adolf Anderssen [/tpl] The source for the date of the reburying is SchachReport, no. 9/1995, p.74
