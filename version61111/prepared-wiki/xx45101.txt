[[Shiga toxin]]

CATEGORIES: AB5 toxins

Shiga toxins are a family of related toxins with two major groups, Stx1 and Stx2, expressed by genes considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedman D, Court D |title=Bacteriophage lambda: alive and well and still doing its thing |journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=201–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11282477 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5274(00)00189-2[/tpl]  The toxins are named for Kiyoshi Shiga, who first described the bacterial origin of dysentery caused by Shigella dysenteriae. The most common sources for Shiga toxin are the bacteria S. dysenteriae and the Shigatoxigenic group of Escherichia coli (STEC), which includes serotypes O157:H7, O104:H4, and other enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).[tpl]cite journal |author=Beutin L |title=Emerging enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, causes and effects of the rise of a human pathogen |journal=J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=299–305 |year=2006 |pmid=16930272 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0450.2006.00968.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Spears et al.|title=A comparison of Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorragic E.coli pathogenesis|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letter|year=2006|pages=187–202[/tpl]

==Nomenclature==

There are many terms that microbiologists use to describe Shiga toxin and differentiate between different forms of it.  Many of these terms are used interchangeably.

==Mechanism==

Shiga toxins act to inhibit protein synthesis within target cells by a mechanism similar to that of ricin toxin produced by Ricinus communis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sandvig K, van Deurs B |title=Entry of ricin and Shiga toxin into cells: molecular mechanisms and medical perspectives |journal=The EMBO Journal|volume=19 |issue=22 |pages=5943–50 |year=2000 |pmid=11080141 |doi=10.1093/emboj/19.22.5943 |pmc=305844[/tpl]  After entering a cell via a macropinosome,[tpl]cite PMID|21832249[/tpl] the protein functions as an N-glycosidase, cleaving a specific adenine nucleobase from the 28S RNA of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, thereby halting protein synthesis.[ref]

==Structure==

The toxin has two subunits—designated A(mol. wt. 32000 D) and B(mol. wt. 7700 D)—and is one of the AB5 toxins. The B subunit is a pentamer that binds to specific glycolipids on the host cell, specifically globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Following this, the A subunit is internalised and cleaved into two parts. The A1 component then binds to the ribosome, disrupting protein synthesis.  Stx-2 has been found to be approximately 400 times more toxic (as quantified by LD50 in mice) than Stx-1.
Gb3 is, for unknown reasons, present in greater amounts in renal epithelial tissues, to which the renal toxicity of Shiga toxin may be attributed. Gb3 is also found in CNS neurons and endothelium, which may lead to neurotoxicity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Obata F, Tohyama K, Bonev AD, Kolling GL, Keepers TR, Gross LK, Nelson MT, Sato S, Obrig TG |title=Shiga Toxin 2 Affects the Central Nervous System through Receptor Globotriaosylceramide Localized to Neurons |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=198 |issue=9 |pages=1398–1406 |year=2008 |pmid=18754742 |doi=10.1086/591911 |pmc=2684825[/tpl] 
Stx-2 is also known to increase the expression of its receptor GB3 and cause neuronal dysfunctions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tironi-Farinati C, Loidl CF, Boccoli J, Parma Y, Fernandez-Miyakawa ME, Goldstein J. |title=Intracerebroventricular Shiga toxin 2 increases the expression of its receptor globotriaosylceramide and causes dendritic abnormalities|journal=J Neuroimmunol |volume=222 |issue=1–2 |pages=48–61 |year=2010 |pmid=    20347160 |doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2010.03.001[/tpl]
The toxin requires highly specific receptors on the cells' surface in order to attach and enter the cell; species such as cattle, swine, and deer which do not carry these receptors may harbor toxigenic bacteria without any ill effect, shedding them in their feces, from where they may be spread to humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Asakura H, Makino S, Kobori H, Watarai M, Shirahata T, Ikeda T, Takeshi K |title=Phylogenetic diversity and similarity of active sites of Shiga toxin (stx) in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates from humans and animals |journal=Epidemiol Infect |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=27–36 |year=2001 |pmid=11561972 |doi=10.1017/S0950268801005635 |pmc=2869726[/tpl]
