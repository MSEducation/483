</ref> In a pragmatic move, he did not ally with the latter in the North because the League disliked them. As a result, [[Forza Italia]] was allied with two parties that were not allied with each other.
Berlusconi launched a massive campaign of electoral advertisements on his three TV networks, grooming with seminars and screen tests his top advertisement salesmen, of whom 50, subsequently elected though devoid of legislative experience, came from his own advertising company alone. He subsequently won the elections, with Forza Italia garnering 21% of the popular vote, the highest percentage of any single party.[tpl]cite web | url = http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&dt=27/03/1994&cta=I&tpEnte=A&tpSeg=C&numEnte=0&sut1=&sut2=&sut3=&descEnte=&descArea=ITALIA&codTipoSegLeader= | title = Elezioni della Camera dei Deputati del 27 Marzo 1994 | language = Italian | publisher = Italian Chamber of Deputies  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120712/http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&dt=27/03/1994&cta=I&tpEnte=A&tpSeg=C&numEnte=0&sut1=&sut2=&sut3=&descEnte=&descArea=ITALIA&codTipoSegLeader= |archivedate=12 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] One of the most significant promises that he made in order to secure victory was that his government would create "one million more jobs". He was appointed Prime Minister in 1994, but his term in office was short because of the inherent contradictions in his coalition: the League, a regional party with a strong electoral base in northern Italy, was at that time fluctuating between federalist and separatist positions, and the National Alliance was a nationalist party that had yet to renounce neo-fascism at the time.

===Fall of the Berlusconi I cabinet===

In December 1994, following the leaking to the press of news of a fresh investigation by Milan magistrates, Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Nord, left the coalition claiming that the electoral pact had not been respected, forcing Berlusconi to resign from office and shifting the majority's weight to the centre-left. Lega Nord also resented the fact that many of its MPs had switched to Forza Italia, allegedly lured by promises of more prestigious portfolios. In 1998 various articles attacking Berlusconi were published by Lega Nord's official newspaper (www.lapadania.it), with titles such as "La Fininvest è nata da Cosa Nostra" – "Fininvest (Berlusconi's principal company) was founded by the Mafia".
Berlusconi remained as caretaker prime minister for a little over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was only supported by most opposition parties but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070313005130/http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archivedate=13 March 2007 | title = The First Seven Years Of Forza Italia [/tpl]

===Electoral victory of 2001===

In 2001 Berlusconi ran again, as leader of the right-wing coalition House of Freedoms ([tpl]lang-it|La Casa delle Libertà[/tpl]), which included the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, the Lega Nord, the National Alliance and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the May 2001 general election led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 42.5% for the Senate.
On the television interviews programme Porta a Porta, during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called Contratto con gli Italiani ([tpl]lang-en|Contract with the Italians[/tpl]), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election.[ref]
</ref> This was considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 bid for prime ministership. Berlusconi committed in this contract to improve several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed).  Secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate.  Thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros.  Fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities.<ref>
</ref> Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.

===The Berlusconi II cabinet===

Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his Contratto con gli Italiani. Some of his partners in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html |title=Berlusconi: 'Successi straordinari Contro di me l'85% dei giornali', La Repubblica, 24 maggio 2004 |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=24 May 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi's view, honoured, in particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime.[ref]
</ref>

===Subsequent elections===

House of Freedoms did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.

===The Berlusconi III cabinet===

In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the centre-left gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition held only two of the regional bodies (Lombardy and Veneto) up for re-election. Three parties, Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, National Alliance and New Italian Socialist Party, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. Berlusconi after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point demanded by the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (and to a lesser extent by National Alliance) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction central to the government's ambitions be changed.

===Attempt to reform the Italian constitution===

A key point in the Berlusconi government's programme was a planned reform of the Italian Constitution, which Berlusconi considered to be 'inspired by the Soviets',[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/berluparla/torino/torino.html|title=Berlusconi: "La Costituzione è di ispirazione sovietica"|language=Italian|publisher=la Repubblica|date=12 April 2003 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120913/http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/berluparla/torino/torino.html |archivedate=13 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] an issue the coalition parties themselves initially had significantly different opinions about. The Lega Nord insisted on a federalist reform (devolution of more power to the regions) as a condition for remaining in the coalition. The National Alliance party pushed for a so-called 'strong premiership' (more powers to the executive), intended as a counterweight to any federalist reform, in order to preserve the integrity of the nation. The Union of Christian and Centre Democrats asked for a proportional electoral law that would not damage small parties, and was generally more willing to discuss compromises with the moderate wing of the opposition.
Difficulties in arranging a mediation caused some internal unrest in the Berlusconi government in 2003, but then they were mostly overcome and the law (comprising power devolution to the regions, Federal Senate and "strong premiership") was passed by the Senate in April 2004; it was slightly modified by the Chamber of Deputies in October 2004, and again on October 2005, and finally approved by the Senate on 16 November 2005 with a bare majority. Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to amend the Italian Constitution without a qualified two-thirds parliamentary majority. The referendum was held on 25–26 July 2006 and resulted in the rejection of the constitutional reform, refused by 61.3% of the voters.

===The 2006 elections===

Operating under a new electoral law written unilaterally by the governing parties over strong criticism from the parliamentary opposition, the April 2006 general election was held. The results of this election handed Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, known as The Union, (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms in the Lower House, and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The Court of Cassation subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.
According to the new electoral rules, The Union, (nicknamed "The Soviet Union" by Silvio Berlusconi[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/politica/cdltre/berlusparla/berlusparla.html | title = Berlusconi sull'Unione "Rimpiangono quella Sovietica" | language = Italian | publisher = la Repubblica|date=11 February 2005  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120909/http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/politica/cdltre/berlusparla/berlusparla.html |archivedate=9 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]) with a margin of only 25,224 votes (out of over 38 million voters), nevertheless won 348 seats (compared to 281 for the House of Freedoms) in the lower house as a result of a majority premium given to whichever coalition of parties was awarded more votes.
Ironically, this electoral law, approved shortly before the election by Berlusconi's coalition in an attempt to improve their chances of winning the election, led to the coalition's defeat and gave Prodi the chance to form a new cabinet. However, Prodi's coalition consisted of a large number of smaller parties. If only one of these nine parties that formed The Union withdrew its support to Prodi, his government would have collapsed. This situation was also the result of the new "diabolic" electoral system.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208705.stm | title = Will Italian opposition's glee last? | publisher = BBC News|date=25 January 2008|accessdate=27 January 2008  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208705.stm |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no | first=Christian | last=Fraser[/tpl]
Centrist parties such as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats immediately conceded The Union's victory, while other parties, like Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4963882.stm | title = Berlusconi resigns as Italian PM | publisher = BBC News|date=2 May 2006  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4963882.stm |archivedate=15 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

===2008 electoral victory===

In the run-up to the 2006 general election, there had been talk among some of the coalition members of the House of Freedoms about a possible merger into a "united party of moderates and reformers". Forza Italia, the National Alliance party of Gianfranco Fini, and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats of Pier Ferdinando Casini all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, Casini started to distance his party from its historical allies.
On 2 December 2006, during a major demonstration of the centre-right in Rome against the government led by Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi proposed the foundation of a "Freedom Party", arguing that the people and voters of the different political movements aligned to the demonstration were all part of a "people of freedom".

After the sudden fall of the Prodi II Cabinet on 24 January, the break-up of The Union coalition and the subsequent political crisis (which paved the way for a fresh general election on April 2008), Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini and other party leaders finally agreed on 8 February 2008 to form a joint list named The People of Freedom ([tpl]lang-it|Il Popolo della Libertà[/tpl]), allied with the Lega Nord of Umberto Bossi and with the Sicilian Movement for Autonomy of Raffaele Lombardo.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp | title = Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: "Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo" | language = Italian | publisher = La Stampa|date=8 February 2008  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120804/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp |archivedate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
In the snap parliamentary elections held on 13/14 April 2008 this coalition won against Walter Veltroni's centre-left coalition in both houses of the Italian Parliament.
In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's coalition won 174 seats to Veltroni's 134. In the lower house, Berlusconi's conservative bloc led by a margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating economy and the unpopularity of Prodi's government. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of trash from the streets of Naples and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had underperformed the rest of the Eurozone for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight tax evasion, reform justice and reduce public debt. He intended to reduce the number of Cabinet ministers to 12.[tpl]Dead link| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/15/italy.election.ap/index.html|date=April 2010[/tpl] Berlusconi and his ministers (Berlusconi IV Cabinet) were sworn in on 8 May 2008.[tpl]Dead link| url = http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&article=485635&lng=1|date=April 2010[/tpl]

While Forza Italia had never held a formal party congress to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, all of them resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009 at the foundation congress of the People of Freedom political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval.

===The People of Freedom split===

Between 2009 and 2010 Gianfranco Fini, former leader of the national conservative National Alliance (AN) and President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on several issues but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation. His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a less structured form of party, a movement-party that organises itself only at election times.[tpl]cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml | title = Il premier consegna le prime case Poi l' attacco in tv | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=16 September 2009  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120709/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml |archivedate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
On 15 April 2010 an association named Generation Italy was launched in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml | title = Via a Generazione Italia la nuova associazione "benedetta" da Fini | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=15 March 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120711/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml |archivedate=11 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year.

Berlusconi asked Fini to step down, and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership of three MPs who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2010/07/29/news/pdl_il_documento_dell_ufficio_di_presidenza-5938625/?ref=HREA-1 | title = Pdl, il documento dell'Ufficio di Presidenza | publisher = Repubblica.it |date=29 July 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120907/http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2010/07/29/news/pdl_il_documento_dell_ufficio_di_presidenza-5938625/?ref=HREA-1 |archivedate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] As response, Fini and his followers formed their own groups in both chambers under the name of Future and Freedom (FLI).[tpl]cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/luglio/31/Via_gruppi_finiani_Qualche_difficolta_co_8_100731003.shtml | title = Via ai gruppi finiani "Qualche difficoltà ma numeri importanti" | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=31 July 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120707/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/luglio/31/Via_gruppi_finiani_Qualche_difficolta_co_8_100731003.shtml |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/01/Previsioni_sbagliate_sui_numeri_nel_co_8_100801004.shtml | title = Previsioni sbagliate sui numeri: nel mirino le fedelissime | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=1 August 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120701/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/01/Previsioni_sbagliate_sui_numeri_nel_co_8_100801004.shtml |archivedate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/02/Finiani_pronto_gruppo_anche_Senato_co_9_100802014.shtml | title = Finiani, pronto il gruppo anche al Senato | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=1 August 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120707/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/02/Finiani_pronto_gruppo_anche_Senato_co_9_100802014.shtml |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/node/16743353 | title = Italy's political crisis: A FLI in his ear | publisher = The Economist |date=5 August 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120729/http://www.economist.com/node/16743353 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] It was soon clear that FLI would leave the PdL and become an independent party.

Among other things, his perceived failure to tackle Italy's debt crisis with an estimated debt sum of € 1.9 trillion ($ 2.6 trillion) had urged Berlusconi to leave office. The popularity of this decision was reflected in the fact that while he was resigning crowds sang the hallelujah portion of George Frederick Handel's "Messiah", complete with some vocal accompaniment; there was also dancing in the streets outside the Quirinal Palace, the official residence of the President of Italy, where Berlusconi went to tender his resignation.[ref]

The austerity package was passed, it will raise €59.8 billion in savings from spending cuts and tax raises, including freezing public-sector salaries until 2014 and gradually increasing the retirement age for women in the private sector from 60 in 2014 to 65 in 2026.[ref]
