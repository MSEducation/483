[[Cyathea kanehirae]]

CATEGORIES: Cyathea, Fern species, Flora of Western New Guinea

Cyathea kanehirae is a species of tree fern native to western New Guinea, where it grows in montane forest at an altitude of 1600-2700 m. The trunk of this plant is erect and 1-4 m tall. Fronds may be bi- or tripinnate and 1-2 m in length. The rachis is smooth, while the stipe is dark and warty. The stipe is covered with flat, brown, scattered scales. Sori are borne near the fertile pinnule midvein . They are protected by small indusia that are cup-like in appearance. 
The type material of C. kanehirae originated from montane rain forest at an elevation of about 2500 m. 
Braggins and Large (2004) note that Rolla Tryon (1970) regarded Alsophila arfakensis as synonymous with this taxon, although it is still possible that they represent separate species.
