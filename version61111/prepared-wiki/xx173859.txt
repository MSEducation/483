Constantinous "Tarki" Micallef (born 24 January 1961 in Cardiff) is a Welsh former professional footballer.

==Career==

The son of a Greek restaurateur, Micallef was born in the Grangetown area of Cardiff and was a Welsh schoolboy international as a youngster before joining Cardiff City as a trainee, working his way up to the first team, making his debut in December 1978 at the age of seventeen against Sheffield United, which was to be his only appearance for the Bluebirds that year. Eventually he established himself in the team during the 1981â€“82 season but in September 1983 he moved to Newport County as part of a five man swap deal which saw Cardiff players Micallef, John Lewis and Linden Jones move to Newport in exchange for Nigel Vaughan and Karl Elsey.
However he only remained at Newport for one year before joining Gillingham on a short term non-contract basis, making two appearances before rejoining Cardiff, only playing a handful of games as they were relegated to the third division. He spent one year at Bristol Rovers before moving to non-league football with Barry Town.

==After football==

After retiring from football after leaving Barry Town, Micallef now works as a technician for the Welsh National Opera.  He lives in Penylan with his wife Maria and two children, Antonia and Tiago.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/tm_headline=tarki-still-prepared-to-go-with-the-flow&method=full&objectid=18006910&siteid=50082-name_page.html |title=Tarki still prepared to go with the flow |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=2006-10-28 |accessdate=2008-02-03[/tpl]
