Charon is a web browser for the Inferno operating system. It is a basic graphical browser with support for JavaScript, HTTPS, and basic support for FTP, but lacks support for any CSS.

==History==

Charon was originally written by Howard Trickey in Limbo for Inferno. It runs under the wm window manager, but can also run directly on the draw device. It supports a subset of the HTML and ECMAScript standards.
Charon was later ported to C by the author to become the unfinished Plan 9 i web browser.
As part of the acme standalone project, Charon was implemented as a client to run inside acme.[tpl]Citation | url = http://ipn.caerwyn.com/2006/02/lab-56-acme-web.html | title = Inferno programmer's notebook | date = 2006-2 | publisher = CÃ¦rwyn[/tpl].
