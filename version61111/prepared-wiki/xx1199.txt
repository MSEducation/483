The word "circle" derives from the Greek κίρκος (kirkos), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος (krikos), meaning "hoop" or "ring".krikos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The origins of the words "circus" and "circuit" are closely related.

Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy, and calculus.
Early science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles.Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe (1959)Proclus, The Six Books of Proclus, the Platonic Successor, on the Theology of Plato Tr.

Some highlights in the history of the circle are:

==Analytic results==

===Length of circumference===

The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is [tpl]pi[/tpl] (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the length of the circumference C is related to the radius r and diameter d by:

===Area enclosed===

As proved by Archimedes, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius,Measurement of a Circle by Archimedes which comes to [tpl]pi[/tpl] multiplied by the radius squared:
Equivalently, denoting diameter by d,
that is, approximately 79 percent of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d).
The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.

===Equations===

====Cartesian coordinates====

In an x–y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that
This equation, also known as Equation of the Circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the diagram to the right, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length [tpl]nowrap|x − a[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|y − b[/tpl]. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to
The equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as
where t is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2[tpl]pi[/tpl], interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (a, b) to (x, y) makes with the x-axis. An alternative parametrisation of the circle is:
In this parametrisation, the ratio of t to r can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the circle onto the line passing through the centre parallel to the x-axis.
In homogeneous coordinates each conic section with equation of a circle is of the form
It can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.

====Polar coordinates====

In polar coordinates the equation of a circle is:
In the general case, the equation can be solved for r, giving
the solution with a minus sign in front of the square root giving the same curve.

====Complex plane====

===Tangent lines===

The tangent line through a point P on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through P. If [tpl]nowrap|P [tpl]=[/tpl] (x1, y1)[/tpl] and the circle has centre (a, b) and radius r, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (a, b) to (x1, y1), so it has the form [tpl]nowrap|(x1 − a)x + (y1 – b)y [tpl]=[/tpl] c[/tpl]. Evaluating at (x1, y1) determines the value of c and the result is that the equation of the tangent is
or
If [tpl]nowrap|y1 ≠ b[/tpl] then the slope of this line is
This can also be found using implicit differentiation.
When the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes
and its slope is

==Properties==

===Chord===

===Sagitta===

Another proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows. Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the "missing" part of the diameter is ([tpl]nowrap|2r − x[/tpl]) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ([tpl]nowrap|2r − x)x [tpl]=[/tpl] (y / 2)2[/tpl]. Solving for r, we find the required result.

===Tangent===

===Theorems===

===Inscribed angles===

An inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).

==Circle of Apollonius==

Apollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, A and B.[tpl]cite book |author=Harkness, James |title=Introduction to the theory of analytic functions |location=London, New York |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1898 |page=30 |url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01680002[/tpl]Ogilvy, C. Stanley, Excursions in Geometry, Dover, 1969, 14–17. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of A and B, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points.
The proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci A and B and a ratio of distances, any point P satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let C be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment AB. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment PC will bisect the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:
Analogously, a line segment PD through some point D on AB extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.
Second, seeAltshiller-Court, Nathan, College Geometry, Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).[tpl]rp|p.15[/tpl] for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.

===Cross-ratios===

A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If A, B, and C are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points P for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:
Stated another way, P is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio A,B;C,P is on the unit circle in the complex plane.

===[tpl]anchor|Generalized circles[/tpl] Generalised circles===

If C is the midpoint of the segment AB, then the collection of points P satisfying the Apollonius condition
is not a circle, but rather a line.
Thus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying the above equation is called a "generalised circle." It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.
