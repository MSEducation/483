The Wa people (Wa language: Vāx; [tpl]lang-my|ဝလူမျိုး[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|wa̰ lùmjóʊ|[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|c=佤族|p=Wǎzú[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-th|ว้า[/tpl]) are an ethnic group that lives mainly in northern Burma, in the northern part of Shan State and the eastern part of Kachin State, near and along Burma's border with China, as well as in China's Yunnan Province.

==Cultural history==

According to Sir George Scott in the Wa origin myths the first Wa originated from two female ancestors Ya Htawm and Ya Htai who spent their early phase as tadpoles (rairoh) in a lake known as Nawng Hkaeo.Scott, James George, Sir. 1935. The Wa or Lawa: Head-Hunters. In Burma and Beyond. p. 292
The Wa originally had animist religious beliefs"Headhunting days are over for Myanmar's "Wild Wa"", Reuters, Sep 10, 2007. centered around ritual blood sacrifices. Villages had a spirit healer (Tax Cao Chai) and the traditional way of dealing with sickness or other problems was to sacrifice a chicken, a pig or a larger animal, depending from the magnitude of the affliction. According to local legend, the practice of cutting a human head was intended as a ritual sacrifice in order to improve the fertility of the rice fields. Traditional villages had also shrines (Nyiex Moeg) where a buffalo was sacrificed once every year at a special Y-shaped post named Khaox Si Gang with an offering of the blood, meat and skin performed at it. Animals were also sacrificed at celebrations such as marriages and funerary rituals among the traditional spirit-worshiping Wa, a practice that still endures among the Christian Wa. However, the Wa that were under Buddhist influence developed different traditions.Interview with Sara Yaw Shu (Joshua) Chin, co-inventor of the Wa alphabet and long-time Wa Baptist Church leader, 27 February 2006
In the traditional Wa society monogamous marriage was the norm and there was sexual freedom for both men and women before marriage. The chewing of betel with areca nut was formerly also an important custom.The Va ethnic minority (People's Daily) The Wa have different kinds of traditional dances.

===Language and script===

The Wa language forms a language group belonging to the Palaungic branch of the Austroasiatic language family. It formerly had no script and the few Wa that were literate used Chinese characters, while others used the Shan language and its script. Christian missionary work among the Wa began at the beginning of the 20th century first in the Burmese and later in the Chinese areas of the Wa territory. It was lead by William Marcus Young, from Nebraska. The first transcription of the Wa language was devised by Young and Sara Yaw Shu Chin in 1931 with the purpose of translating the Bible. This first Wa alphabet was based on the Latin script and the first publication was a compilation of Wa hymns in 1933,The Young Family’s Work with the Wa People the Wa New Testament being completed in 1938. This transcription, known as "Bible orthography" is known as lǎowǎwén, 老佤文 "old Wa orthography" in Chinese, and is now used mainly in the Burmese Wa areas and among the Wa in Thailand. A revised Bible orthography has been adopted as "official Wa spelling" by the authorities of the Wa Special Region 2 in Pangkham which have published a series of primers in order to improve the literacy of the United Wa State Army troops. Also, after 2000 Wa people in social networks such as Facebook and other online media, as well as Wa songwriters in karaoke lyrics of Wa songs use this Myanmar (revised Bible) "official Wa orthography" in its main variations.Justin Watkins, Wa Dictionary, 2 vols. Introduction
In China, a transcription adapted to the new pinyin romanization, known as "PRC ortography" or "Chinese ortography", was developed for the Wa people in 1956. However, its publications, mainly propagated through the Yunnan administration, are yet to reach a wider public beyond academics.SOAS - Writing of the Wa Language Communist propaganda documents often portray the Chinese version of the Wa alphabet as the first script of the Wa.Large Minority Groups in Southern China - Wa Ethnic Group

===British rule and enduring prejudices===

Very little has been written about the Wa people except in the Chinese language.Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy, Harvard University Press The area were they live was remote and of difficult access and there was considerable prejudice against the Wa during British rule in Burma. They were largely portrayed by colonial administrators as wild and dirty people owing to their practice of headhunting. However, Chinese documents written prior to the twentieth century rarely mentioned the Wa as headhunters and yet it is this aspect of Wa culture that has been cited more than any other in order to emphasize the primitiveness of the Wa.Magnus Fiskesjö, The Fate of Sacrifice and the Making of Wa History, 2000: 3-5 
The prejudice continues in modern times when the Wa, who are economically not that different from other ethnic hill tribes in the area such as the Lahu people, are largely known for their rebel army and as being involved in drug-trafficking, overshadowing other aspects of their culture.Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy, Harvard University Press

===Post World War 2===

The international border that had been defined between Burma and China made that the Wa people were divided between the two countries. The Wa regions in Burma were largely left alone until the 1950s, when remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army fled the 1949 communist revolution in China. A decade and a half later, the region was under the influence of the Communist Party of Burma, which was very active in the area. During that time opium cultivation and sales grew and the ancient traditional life became disrupted, but also an administrative system that collected revenue and maintained a significant armed force, as well as a rudimentary infrastructure, ushered the Wa region into the modern era.Ronald D. Renard, The Wa Authority and Good Governance, 1989 – 2007 
In 1989 the Wa authorities expelled the Burma Communist Party and negotiated a cease-fire with the then leader of Burma's military junta Khin Nyunt. They founded the United Wa State Army and United Wa State Party with a centralized command. In return for agreeing to the ban of poppy cultivation and opium production the region experienced a massive influx of international development aid. The Wa Special Region 2 was created within the northeastern Shan State, with its de facto capital in Pangkham.Ronald D. Renard, The Wa Authority and Good Governance, 1989 – 2007

===Military activity and drug production===

The United Wa State Army was one of the world's largest narco-armies, with up to 10,000 men under arms. Until 1996 the UWSA was involved in a conflict against the Mong Tai Army which suited the objectives of the Tatmadaw in the area. During this conflict the Wa army occupied areas close to the Thai border, ending up with the control of two separate swathes of territory north and south of Kengtung. In 1999 when the Burmese military requested the Wa fighters to return to the northern area the UWSA refused.Wa will not budge from Thai border areas 
During the 1990s the areas controlled by the UWSA were involved in heroin production.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.geopium.org/yaabaa-methamphetamine-production-traffic-consumption.htm|author=Chouvy, Pierre-Arnaud & Meissonnier, Joël|title= Yaa Baa.

Records of official seizures compiled by the United Nations suggest that in 2006 Myanmar was the source of half of Asia's methamphetamine, known in Thailand as yaba, and some experts believe that most drug labs are in areas under Wa control.

Their population in China is estimated at around 400,000.

====Benren====

The "Benren" 本人 of Yongde County and Zhenkang County, Yunnan are officially classified as Wa by the Chinese government, but consider themselves to be a separate ethnicity from the Wa.Zhao Mingsheng, Gao Honghui 高宏慧. 2012. 佤族支系“本人(佤)”的产生及其特征. http://www.doc88.com/p-212753943335.html Their autonym is "Siwa" 斯佤.

===Burma===

The Wa are one of the 135 officially recognized ethnic groups in Burma. Their proportion to Burma's total population is 0.16.http://www.economonitor.com/analysts/2012/04/25/myanmar-and-chinas-complex-relationship/ Although little is known about the ancient history of the Wa, they are acknowledged by other dominant ethnic groups in Shan State, such as the Tai Yai people, to be the original inhabitants of the area.Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy, Harvard University Press
In Burma, the Wa live mostly in small villages near Kengtung and north and northeastwards close to the Chinese border, as well as a small area east of Tachileik. The Wa Special Region 2 of the Northern Shan State or Wa State was formed by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the remains of the former Burmese Communist Party rebel group that collapsed in 1989. The Wa State and the UWSA are in a fragile cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military government.Tensions Rise in Wa Region They have been accused by Western governments of involvement in drug trafficking but have banned opium production since 2005 and have received United Nations aid in improving legitimate agriculture.
As stipulated by the 2008 Burmese Constitution, on 20 August 2010 the Wa Self-Administered Division has been estabilished.[tpl]my|ပြည်ထောင်စုသမ္မတမြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော် ဖွဲ့စည်းပုံအခြေခံဥပဒေ (၂၀၀၈ ခုနှစ်)|[/tpl] (in Burmese) Constitution PDF[tpl]cite news |title=တိုင်းခုနစ်တိုင်းကို တိုင်းဒေသကြီးများအဖြစ် လည်းကောင်း၊ ကိုယ်ပိုင်အုပ်ချုပ်ခွင့်ရ တိုင်းနှင့် ကိုယ်ပိုင်အုပ်ချုပ်ခွင့်ရ ဒေသများ ရုံးစိုက်ရာ မြို့များကို လည်းကောင်း ပြည်ထောင်စုနယ်မြေတွင် ခရိုင်နှင့်မြို့နယ်များကို လည်းကောင်း သတ်မှတ်ကြေညာ |newspaper=Weekly Eleven News |date=2010-08-20 |url=http://www.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4375:2010-08-20-12-39-51&catid=42:2009-11-10-07-36-59&Itemid=112 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |language=Burmese[/tpl] It is set to be administred by the Wa people and its territory is between the gorges of the Mekong and Salween rivers, in the east part of the Shan State, near the border with the Chinese province of Yunnan.

In recent times some Wa communities from Burma have crossed the border and settled in Thailand, where they have no official status as a Hill Tribe. The Wa live mainly in the Mae Sai District and Mae Yao subdistrict of Chiang Rai Province, as well as in Wiang Pa Pao District in southern Chiang Rai Province and Chiang Dao District in Chiang Mai Province.Wa, Parauk
