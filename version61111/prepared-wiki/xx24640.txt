Lenny is a 1974 American biographical film about the comedian Lenny Bruce, starring Dustin Hoffman and directed by Bob Fosse. The screenplay by Julian Barry is based on his play of the same name.

==Plot==

The film jumps between various sections of Bruce's life, including scenes of when he was in his prime and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. We watch as up-and-coming Bruce courts his "Shiksa goddess", a stripper named Honey. With family responsibilities, Lenny is encouraged to do a "safe" act, but he cannot do it. Constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, Lenny develops a near-messianic complex which fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. Worn out by a lifetime of tilting at Establishment windmills, Lenny Bruce dies of a morphine overdose in 1966.

==Casting==

One of the more interesting casting decisions was made while filming in the Broward County Courthouse; used as the set for the Miami Courthouse. Director Fosse decided to cast a real life Broward County Bailiff in the role of the Dade County Bailiff that would drag Dustin Hoffman (Lenny) out of the Courtroom. Aldo DeMeo, the President of the Bailiff's Association at the time, was offered the role. Though Aldo was uncredited, the scene when Lenny is removed from the courtroom was chosen as the clip screened at the Academy Awards to represent the film as a candidate for Best Picture.[tpl]cite web|title=Robert DeMeo Bio|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0218317/bio[/tpl] Casting was completed by Florida-based casting director, Beverly McDermott.[tpl]cite news|title=Beverly McDermott dies at 83|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/entertainment/sns-201201231449reedbusivarietynvr1118049029jan23,0,2222238.story|accessdate=22 September 2012|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=23 January 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ar9ZiHVT|archivedate=22 September 2012[/tpl]
