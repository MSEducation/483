A U-Boot is a beer cocktail (popular in Germany, Poland, Serbia and Flanders)  that is made with a glass of beer and a shot glass of vodka.Info about the Polish national football team, see the "Perfect Night watching, What to drinkâ€¦" sectionRecipe for an U-boot/U-boat drink (in Polish) In Germany, the liquor korn is sometimes used instead, while in Flanders and the Netherlands, jonge jenever is preferred.
It is called a U-Boot (German abbreviation of Unterseeboot, "submarine") because the shot glass of vodka sinks to the bottom of the glass of beer. The shot glass then "surfaces" when the cocktail is drunk.
In Flanders, it is called a "Duikboot", literally translated "Submarine". It is seen as a variant on the kopstoot (lit. "headbutt") in the Netherlands; generally speaking, the kopstoot is taken as a shot followed by beer as a chaser, although dropping the glass of jenever is not unheard-of.
In Serbia, it is called "Podmornica", literally translated "Submarine".
In southern Germany, U-Boot is usually served as a combination of Fanta and cognac instead of beer and vodka.
In Mexico, it is called "Submarino", Spanish for "Submarine". Instead of vodka, it uses tequila, and the shot glass must be left inverted inside of the beer glass.
The variation "Atom-U-Boot" ("nuclear submarine") is a shot of beer in a glass of liquor - used more jokingly than actually commonly consumed.
