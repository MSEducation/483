Orgreave forms part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham; until 1974, it was part of the Rotherham Rural District, the town of Rotherham being [tpl]convert|6|mi[/tpl] to the north.
Orgreave became nationally famous in 1984 due to the "Battle of Orgreave", when Orgreave Coking Plant was picketed by striking coal miners, with several days of confrontation between miners and police officers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7543530.stm | title=All change for miners' strike battlefield | publisher=BBC News | date=2008-08-26 | accessdate=2008-08-31 [/tpl]
Orgreave Coking Plant closed in 1990. In the 1990s a large area of the parish formed part of a [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site used for opencast mining by UK Coal; production ended in 2005 when the site ran out of coal.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4526274.stm | title=Orgreave opencast mine to close | publisher=BBC News | date=2005-12-13 | accessdate=2008-08-31 [/tpl]  The site is now known as Waverley and is to be redeveloped in the next 20 years. The first major planning application, which includes the construction of 4,000 homes, was submitted in August 2008 by Harworth Estates.
