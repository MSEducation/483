[[Wally Squad]]

CATEGORIES: Judge Dredd

The Wally Squad is a fictional undercover police force in the Judge Dredd stories of 2000 AD. Wally Squad agents were undercover judges noted for their eccentricity and borderline lunacy; these characteristic behaviours were an inevitable consequence of working undercover in a world of complete future shock.
It was also the name of one story in progs #390-392 (1984).
