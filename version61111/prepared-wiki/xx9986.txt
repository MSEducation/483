Russian ([tpl]lang|ru|ру́сский язы́к[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ru-Latn|russkij jazyk[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA-ru|ˈruskʲɪj jɪˈzɨk|[/tpl]) is a Slavic language spoken primarily in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the Soviet Union and former participants of the Eastern Bloc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/109228/russian-language-enjoying-boost-postsoviet-states.aspx |title=Russian Language Enjoying a Boost in Post-Soviet States|publisher=Gallup.com|date=August 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Арефьев|first=Александр|title=Падение статуса русского языка на постсоветском пространстве|journal=Демоскоп Weekly|year=2006|issue=251|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2006/0251/tema01.php|language=Russian[/tpl] Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages. Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards.
It is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages. It is also the largest native language in Europe, with 144 million native speakers in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Russian is the 8th most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the 5th by total number of speakers.[tpl]cite web|title=The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages|url=http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm|work=Saint Ignatius High School|accessdate=17 February 2012|location=Cleveland, Ohio[/tpl] The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.
Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without, the so-called soft and hard sounds. This distinction is found between pairs of almost all consonants and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically[tpl]sfn|Timberlake|2004|p=17[/tpl] though an optional acute accent ([tpl]lang|ru|знак ударения, znak udareniya[/tpl]) may be used to mark stress (such as to distinguish between homographic words, for example замо́к (meaning lock) and за́мок (meaning castle), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names).

==Classification==

Russian is a Slavic language of the Indo-European family.  It is a lineal descendant of the language used in Kievan Rus'. From the point of view of the spoken language, its closest relatives are Ukrainian and Belarusian, the other two national languages in the East Slavic group. In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures, e.g. Surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and Trasianka in Belarus. An East Slavic Old Novgorod dialect, although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th–20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.[tpl]sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477–478, 480[/tpl] In the 19th century, the language was often called "Great Russian" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called "White Russian" and Ukrainian, then called "Little Russian".
The vocabulary (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by Church Slavonic, a developed and partly russified form of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic language used by the Russian Orthodox Church. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the Church Slavonic forms are in use, with many different meanings. For details, see Russian phonology and History of the Russian language.
Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as Greek, Latin, Polish, Dutch, German, French, and English,[tpl]cite web | title=Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911 | url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Russian_Language[/tpl] and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: Uralic, Turkic, Persian, Arabic.
According to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency.Thompson aboutlanguages.com It is also regarded by the United States Intelligence Community as a "hard target" language, due to both its difficulty to master for English speakers and its critical role in American world policy.

==Standard Russian==

The standard well-known form of Russian is generally called the modern Russian literary language (современный русский литературный язык). It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of Peter the Great, and developed from the Moscow (Middle or Central Russian) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancellery language.
Mikhail Lomonosov first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755 and in 1783 the Russian Academy's first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, during a period known as the "Golden Age", the grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.
Until the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were finally forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the Soviet government, as well as the influence of the mass media (radio and television). However, despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some dialectal features—such as fricative [tpl]IPA|/ɣ/[/tpl]—are still observed in colloquial speech.

==Geographic distribution==

During the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the official language only in 1990."Закон СССР от 24.04.1990 О языках народов СССР" (The 1990 USSR Law about the Languages of the USSR) [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.
In 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia - 137.5, in the CIS and Baltic countries - 93.7, in Eastern Europe and the Balkans - 12.9, Western Europe - 7.3, Asia - 2.7, Middle East and North Africa - 1.3, Sub-Saharan Africa - 0.1, Latin America - 0.2, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - 4.1. Thus, the Russian language is the 6th largest in the world by number of native speakers, after English, Chinese, Hindi/Urdu, Spanish and Arabic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2013/0571/tema02.php |title=Демографические изменения - не на пользу русскому языку |publisher=Demoscope.ru |accessdate=2014-04-23[/tpl]
According to the census of 2010 in Russia Russian language skills were indicated by 138 million people (99.4% population), while according to the 2002 census - 142.6 million people (99.2% population). Among the urban residents 101 million people (99.8% population) had Russian language skills, while in rural areas - 37 million people (98.7% population).[tpl]cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2011/0491/perep01.php |title=Демоскоп Weekly.

In Latvia its official recognition and legality in the classroom have been a topic of considerable debate in a country where more than one-third of the population is Russian-speaking (see Russians in Latvia). Similarly, in Estonia, ethnic Russians constitute 25.5% of the country's current population[tpl]cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/igraph/MakeGraph.asp?gr_type=5&gr_width=600&gr_height=400&gr_fontsize=12&menu=y&PLanguage=2&pxfile=RV02222012112275739.px&wonload=600&honload=400&rotate= |title=Diagram |publisher=Pub.stat.ee |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl] and 58.6% of the native Estonian population is also able to speak Russian.[tpl]cite web|title=Population census of Estonia 2000.

Command of Russian language, however, is rapidly decreasing among younger Estonians (primarily being replaced by the command of English). For example, if 53% of ethnic Estonians between 15–19 claim to speak some Russian, then among the 10–14 year old group, command of Russian has fallen to 19% (which is about one-third the percentage of those who claim to have command of English in the same age group).
In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Russian remains a co-official language with Kazakh and Kyrgyz, respectively. Large Russian-speaking communities still exist in northern Kazakhstan, and ethnic Russians comprise 25.6% of Kazakhstan's population.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |author= |agency= Kazakhstan News Bulletin|title=Kazakhstan's News Bulletin, April 20, 2007 |work= |page= |date= April 20, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2009 |quote= |url= http://prosites-kazakhembus.homestead.com/042007.html[/tpl]

There are 33,400 Russian-speaking Finns, amounting to 0.6% of the population. Five thousand (0.1%) of them are late 19th century and 20th century immigrants or their descendants, and the remaining majority are recent immigrants, who have moved there in the 1990s and later.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
In the 20th century, Russian was widely and thoroughly taught in the schools of the members of the old Warsaw Pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the USSR. In particular, these countries include Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Albania, former East Germany  and Cuba. However, younger generations are usually not fluent in it, because Russian is no longer mandatory in the school system. According to the Eurobarometer 2005 survey,http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/pdf/doc631_en.pdf though, fluency in Russian remains fairly high (20–40%) in some countries, in particular those where the people speak a Slavic language and thereby have an edge in learning Russian (namely, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria). In 2005, it was the most widely taught foreign language in Mongolia,[tpl]cite news |first= James|last= Brooke|author= |agency= New York Times|title=For Mongolians, E Is for English, F Is for Future |work= The New York Times|page= |date= February 15, 2005|accessdate=May 16, 2009 |quote= |url=http://nytimes.com/2005/02/15/international/asia/15mongolia.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all[/tpl] and was compulsory in Year 7 onward as a second foreign language in 2006.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |author=  |agency= Новый Регион|title=Русский язык в Монголии стал обязательным |work= |page=  |date= September 21, 2006|accessdate=May 16, 2009|language= Russian |quote= |url=http://www.nr2.ru/83966.html[/tpl]
Russian is also spoken in Israel by at least 750,000 ethnic Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union (1999 census). The Israeli press and websites regularly publish material in Russian.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] Russian is also spoken as a second language by a small number of people in Afghanistan (Awde and Sarwan, 2003).
The language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 1700s. Although most colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003359.php |title=Ninilchik |publisher=languagehat.com |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl] Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore, Miami, Chicago, Denver and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early sixties). Only about a quarter of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterwards, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/acs/ACS-12.pdf |title=Language Use in the United States: 2007, census.gov |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl]
Significant Russian-speaking groups also exist in Western Europe. These have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the 20th century, each with its own flavor of language. The United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Brazil, Norway, and Austria have significant Russian-speaking communities, Germany has the highest Russian-speaking population outside the former Soviet Union with approximately 3 million people.Vgl.

(PDF) They are split into three groups, from largest to smallest: Russian-speaking ethnic Germans (Aussiedler), ethnic Russians, and Jews. Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney also have Russian speaking populations, with the most Russians living in southeast Melbourne, particularly the suburbs of Carnegie and Caulfield. Two thirds of them are actually Russian-speaking descendants of Germans, Greeks, Jews, Azerbaijanis, Armenians or Ukrainians, who either repatriated after the USSR collapsed, or are just looking for temporary employment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
According to the 2011 Census of Ireland, there were 21,639 people in the nation who use Russian as a home language.

===Official status===

Russian is the official language of Russia, although it shares the official status at regional level with other languages in the numerous ethnic autonomies within Russia, such as Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Yakutia. It is also a co-official language of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and a co-official language of the unrecognized country of Transnistria and partially recognized countries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In Ukraine the Russian language lacks the status of a state language, but still enjoys an extensive protection as a regional and minority language with some official functions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/5029-17 |title=Law of Ukraine "On Principles of State Language Policy" |publisher=Zakon2.rada.gov.ua |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl] The Constitution of Ukraine guarantees "free development, use and protection"[tpl]cite web|url=http://president.gov.ua/en/content/chapter01.html |title=Constitution of Ukraine, Article 10 |publisher=President.gov.ua |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl] of the Russian language.
