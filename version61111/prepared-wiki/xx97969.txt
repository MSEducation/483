Lonsdale Quay is a major transit hub for Vancouver's North Shore municipalities, as well as a public market and tourist destination. Located at the foot of Lonsdale Avenue in the City of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, it is the northern terminal for the SeaBus passenger ferry. A view of the Vancouver harbour can be seen from the plaza outside the public market, which is located adjacent to the terminal/bus loop. There is also a hotel located above the marketplace, and an adjacent building houses the headquarters for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. The marketplace features a number of food retailers, restaurants, and a second level consisting of specialty retail shops.
The quay is located on the former site of North Van Ship Repair, a major shipyard during World War II.

==Transit connections==

The SeaBus crosses Burrard Inlet to Waterfront Station in Downtown Vancouver. From there, transit users can connect to other TransLink services, including the SkyTrain system and the West Coast Express commuter train. Connected to the SeaBus terminal is a covered bus loop, from which passengers can board buses to Grouse Mountain, Lynn Valley, West Vancouver and other points of interest on the North Shore.
Security for the bus loop and Seabus terminal is the responsibility of the Transit Security Department. Transit Security Officers can be found patrolling the bus loop and the Seabus terminal. Transit Security Officers also conduct Fare Inspections on board the buses and within the Fare Paid Zone of the Seabus terminal.  North Vancouver RCMP also patrol the bus loop and Seabus terminal.
