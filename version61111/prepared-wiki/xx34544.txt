</ref> In the event, Clarke was eliminated in the first round of voting among MPs. Eventual winner [[David Cameron]] appointed Clarke to head a Democracy task force as part of his extensive 18-month policy review in December 2005, exploring issues such as the reform of the [[House of Lords]] and party funding. Clarke is president of the moderate, pro-European [[ginger group]] within the Conservative Party, [[Tory Reform Group]].
In 2006, he described Cameron's plans for a British Bill of Rights as "xenophobic and legal nonsense".[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5120894.stm |title=Clarke slams Cameron rights plan |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2009[/tpl]

===Promotion to the shadow cabinet===

Clarke was promoted to Shadow Business Secretary in opposition to the then current Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson. David Cameron described Clarke as the only one able to oppose Mandelson and Brown's economic credibility. Two days later it was revealed that Clarke had warned in a speech a month earlier that President Barack Obama could see David Cameron as a "right-wing nationalist" if the Conservatives maintained eurosceptic policies and that Obama would "start looking at whoever is in Germany or France if we start being isolationist." However, the Financial Times said "Clarke has in effect agreed to disagree with the Tories' official Eurosceptic line".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html |title=Interactive graphics – A Conservative Who's Who |work=Financial Times |location =London |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl]

===Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary===

On 12 May 2010, it was announced that Clarke had been appointed Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor by Prime Minister David Cameron in a coalition government formed from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/liveevent/ |title=Election 2010 – Live coverage – General Election 2010 |work=BBC News |date=May 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl] James Macintrye, Political Editor of Prospect magazine, argued that in this ministerial position he had instigated a process of radical reform.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ethosjournal.com/home/item/291-movers-and-shakers |title=Public service innovators |author=Macintyre, James |work=Ethos |publisher=Serco |location =Hook, Hants |year=2010[/tpl]
In June 2010, Clarke signalled an end to short prison sentences after warning it was "virtually impossible" to rehabilitate an inmate in less than 12 months. In his first major speech since taking office, Mr Clarke indicated a major shift in penal policy by saying prison was not effective in many cases. This could result in more offenders being handed community punishments. Mr Clarke, who described the current prison population of 85,000 as "astonishing", faced immediate criticism from some colleagues in a party renowned for its tough stance on law and order. He signalled that fathers who fail to pay child maintenance, disqualified drivers and criminals fighting asylum refusals could be among the first to benefit and should not be in prison.[tpl]cite news |last= Whitehead |first=Tom |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7863613/David-Cameron-insists-short-prison-sentences-to-stay.html |title=David Cameron insists short prison sentences to stay |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2010 |location=London[/tpl]
In December 2010 Clarke, in a move to cut prison numbers, said that a Conservative Party election pledge that anyone caught carrying a knife illegally could expect a jail term will not be implemented. Clarke said he would put sentencing policy in the hands of judges, not newspaper pundits but that those guilty of using a knife illegally would face a "serious" jail term. Asked by BBC political editor Nick Robinson whether people caught carrying knives illegally could expect a lesser punishment, Clarke said ministers would not insist on "absolute tariffs". It means that, as at present, someone caught carrying a knife illegally may not face a custodial sentence, and could even be cautioned instead.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Clarke announced in February 2011 that the government intended to scrutinise the relationship between the European Court of Human Rights and national parliaments. This followed calls from a large number of Conservative backbenchers for the UK to leave the ECHR because they are unhappy with its rulings. MPs subsequently[tpl]when|date=February 2014[/tpl] voted to maintain a ban on voting by prisoners despite an ECHR ruling that it was illegal. Many MPs[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] have also been outraged by the UK Supreme Court's ruling that the ECHR would uphold the right of sex offenders to appeal against having to register with the police for the rest of their lives.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/feb/20/kenneth-clarke-european-court-reform |title=Kenneth Clarke offers hope to Tory critics of human rights court |author=Stratton, Allegra |date=21 February 2011 |work=The Guardian |location =London |page=8[/tpl]
In May 2011, controversy related to Clarke's reported views on rape resurfaced after an interview on the radio station BBC 5 Live, where he discussed a proposal to further reduce the sentences of criminals, including rapists, who pleaded guilty pre-trial.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13444770 |title= In full: Ken Clarke interview on rape sentencing |work=BBC News |date=18 May 2011[/tpl]
In 2011 and 2012, Clark faced criticism for his Justice and Security Bill, in particular those aspects of it that allow secret trials when "national security" is at stake.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/nov/16/justice-and-security-green-paper |last= Rozenberg |first= Joshua |date= 16 November 2011 |title= The justice and security green paper is an attack on liberty |work= guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2 June 2012 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15565404 |title= Ken Clarke's justice bill passed despite 'attacks' |work= BBC News |date= 2 November 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2012 [/tpl] The Economist said: "The origins of the proposed legislation lie in civil cases brought by former Guantánamo detainees, the best-known of whom was Binyam Mohamed, alleging that government intelligence and security agencies (MI6 and MI5) were complicit in their rendition and torture."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21556252 |title= A question of balance |work= The Economist |location =London |date= 2 June 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya |title= Special report: Rendition ordeal that raises new questions about secret trials |last= Cobain |first= Ian |date= 9 April 2012 |work= The Guardian |page=1 |location =London |accessdate=9 April 2012 [/tpl] Prominent civil liberties and human rights campaigners argued: "The worst excesses of the war on terror have been revealed by open courts and a free media.

===Minister without portfolio===

Following the 2012 cabinet reshuffle, Clarke was removed from his position as Justice Secretary and made a minister without portfolio. He still attends Cabinet in this capacity. It was also announced that he would become a roving trade envoy, with responsibility for promoting British business and trade abroad.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19918533 |title=BBC News - Ken Clarke given trade envoy role |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]

==Expenses scandal==

On 12 May 2009, The Daily Telegraph reported that Clarke had "flipped" his council tax.  He had told the Parliamentary authorities that his main home was in his Rushcliffe constituency, enabling him to claim a second homes allowance on his London home and leaving the taxpayer to foot the bill for the council tax due on that property. However, he told Rushcliffe Borough Council in Nottinghamshire that he spent so little time at his constituency address that his wife Gillian should qualify for a 25% council-tax (single person's) discount, saving the former chancellor around £650 per year. Land registry records showed that Clarke did not have a mortgage on his home in Nottinghamshire, where he has lived since 1987. He instead held a mortgage on his London house, which he had most recently charged to the taxpayer at £480 per month.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5310015/MPs-expenses-Ken-Clarkes-council-tax-flip.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=MPs expenses: Ken Clarke's council tax 'flip' |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2010 | location=London[/tpl]

==Media work==

Also while a backbencher, Clarke engaged in non-political media work.

==Personal life==

Clarke married Gillian Edwards, also a Cambridge graduate, in November 1964.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] They have two children — a son and a daughter. He is well known for his enjoyment of cigars, jazz and motor racing. He also likes birdwatching and reading political history, and is popularly known for his love of suede Hush Puppies, a brand of shoes, which have been his "trademark" since his early ministerial days.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7126371.ece |title=Ken Clarke sheds Hush Puppies for new job |location=London | work=The Times |first=Philippe |last=Naughton |date=14 May 2010[/tpl]
He also likes watching sport. He is a supporter of Nottingham Forest and is a former President of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. He  is president of Radcliffe Olympic F C. He is a keen follower of Formula One motorsport. He was involved with tobacco giant British American Tobacco's Formula One team British American Racing and has attended Grands Prix in support of the BAR team. BAR was sold to Honda in 2005. He was also on the podium of the 2012 British Grand Prix to present the first place trophy to Mark Webber.
He attended the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and claims (with a little jest) to have been influential in persuading the man known vernacularly as "the Russian linesman" Tofik Bakhramov (who was actually from Azerbaijan), to award a goal to Geoff Hurst when the England striker had seen his shot hit the crossbar of opponents West Germany, leaving doubt as to whether the ball had crossed the line. Clarke's position in the Wembley crowd was right behind the linesman at the time, and he shouted at the official to award a goal.[ref]
