==History==

The previous Golani Junction experienced frequent traffic congestion on weekends and holidays when many Israelis traveled to the north of the country on vacation.  Construction began in 2012 on an interchange to replace the former junction at a cost of NIS 300 million.  The interchange opened for traffic in August 2013.
