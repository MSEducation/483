Hudson Strait (known previously as the Furious Overfall) was partly explored in 1578 by Sir Martin Frobisher, the English navigator. It was later fully explored by English explorer Henry Hudson in 1610 on the English ship Discovery. Hudson Strait links the northern seaports of Manitoba and Ontario with the Atlantic Ocean. It could be an eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage were it not for ice in the Fury and Hecla Strait south of western Baffin Island.
