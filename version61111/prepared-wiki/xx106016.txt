Xylene cyanol can be used as a colour marker to monitor the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.   Bromophenol blue and orange G can also be used for this purpose.

==Migration speed==

In 1% agarose gels, xylene cyanol typically migrates at about the same rate as a 4000 base pair DNA fragment [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl].  Xylene cyanol or tracking dye on a 6% polyacrylamide gel migrates at the speed of a 140 base pair DNA fragment. On 20% denaturating (7 M urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) xylene cyanol migrates at about rate of 25 base oligonucleotide. Typically 0.005-0.03% of final concentration of xylene cyanol is used.

==Conjugation==

Due to its large number of double bonds separated by single bonds, the molecule is said to be highly conjugated.
