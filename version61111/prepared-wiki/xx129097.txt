==Professional career==

With a father and grandfather in the wine industry, Tom Aikens discovered French gastronomy and the central importance of food in his life. From a young age, Tom helped his mother in the kitchen with the preparation of cakes, biscuits, jams and home cooked meals with fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden. This enthused Tom’s passion for using seasonal ingredients from the British Isles, provided by Tom’s suppliers.
To develop his cooking skills, Tom enrolled at the Norwich City College Hotel School. ‘I found something I was good at,’ he recalls, ‘and something I loved’. His first job after he left college was at Michelin starred, David Cavalier’s restaurant in Battersea, London. 
From there Tom went to work for Pierre Koffman’s La Tante Claire in Chelsea, London, which gained a third Michelin star during his time there. Tom also worked with Philip Britten at the Capital Hotel and as a sous chef at Pied à Terre in Charlotte Street, under Richard Neat. Tom gained further knowledge in Paris, cooking with Jöel Robuchon, and Gerard Boyer at Reims. 
Tom returned to the UK as Head Chef of Pied à Terre, where, at 26, he became the youngest British chef ever awarded two Michelin stars. Here he stayed for five years.
In 2003, Tom opened his own, eponymous restaurant in Chelsea; Tom Aikens Restaurant. On 12th January 2012, the Chelsea restaurant re-opened following extensive renovations.  
Tom’s second restaurant, the brasserie-style Tom’s Kitchen, opened in Chelsea in 2006. In conjunction with Compass Group, Tom also launched Tom’s Terrace, Tom’s Deli and a second Tom’s Kitchen site at Somerset House in September 2009.
Tom has written three books; Cooking (2006), Fish (2008), and Easy (2011), and has collaborated with designer David Linley on a range of kitchenware. This summer Tom collaborated with Qatar Airways and an all star team of culinary ambassadors to create the ‘Qatar airways culinary world menu’ for  air passengers.
He supports the Environmental Justice Foundation to raise awareness of illegal ‘pirate’ fishing and diminishing fish stocks.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]
