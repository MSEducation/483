Bradley James 'Dez' Fafara (born May 12, 1966) is an American metal vocalist who performs in the bands DevilDriver and Coal Chamber.

==Personal life==

Dez is of Portuguese and Sicilian descent.  His father, Tiger Fafara, and his late uncle, Stanley Fafara, were child actors on the Leave It to Beaver television sitcom.
Dez's wife is named Anahstasia, and she appears on the cover of the second Coal Chamber album Chamber Music.  Dez has three sons: Tyler, Simon and Kaleb. "Tyler's Song", from the album Chamber Music, was written for Tyler. Simon, age twelve, added backing growls on DevilDriver's third album, The Last Kind Words (2007), on the song "Tirades Of Truth", during the last two lines of the chorus.
He claimed during a performance of the song Sail to have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder when he was a little boy and still doesn't get a lot of sleep at night

==Coal Chamber==

Dez released a total of 3 albums with Coal Chamber.  Three of the albums, Coal Chamber (1997), which went gold, Chamber Music (1999), and Dark Days (2002), consisted of new material. An album of remixes, rarities, and b-sides, titled Giving the Devil His Due (2003) and a "Best Of" (2004) were also released. Coal Chamber disbanded in 2003, shortly after Dez formed his current band DevilDriver.
Contrary to some reports, Dez has often spoken freely of his time in Coal Chamber, although for a time he gave no indication  of any desire to reform the band. Meegs Rascon stated in an interview that he would miss performing Coal Chamber songs.
On September 26, 2011, it was announced that Coal Chamber would reunite for Australia's Soundwave Festival, which took place in early 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=163769 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - COAL CHAMBER To Reform For Australia's SOUNDWAVE Festival |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19[/tpl] As of October 2012, according to Dez, new material from Coal Chamber is in the works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=181009 |title=Reunited COAL CHAMBER Has Commenced Writing New Material, Says Singer DEZ FAFARA |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19[/tpl]

Dez has appeared on more than twelve soundtrack records, including Scream 3: The Album, which also went gold. He also collaborated with Ozzy Osbourne for a remake of "Shock the Monkey", a song originally by Peter Gabriel, that was released on the Coal Chamber album Chamber Music.
