In number theory, a sublime number is a positive integer which has a perfect number of positive divisors (including itself), and whose positive divisors add up to another perfect number.MathPages article, "Sublime Numbers".
The number 12, for example, is a sublime number.  It has a perfect number of positive divisors (6): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and the sum of these is again a perfect number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28.
There are only two known sublime numbers, 12 and (2126)(261 − 1)(231 − 1)(219 − 1)(27 − 1)(25 − 1)(23 − 1)  [tpl]OEIS|id=A081357[/tpl].Clifford A.
