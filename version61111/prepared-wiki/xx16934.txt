[[Bourbon whiskey]]

CATEGORIES: Bourbon whiskey, Kentucky culture, Whisky

Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey: a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name is ultimately derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is disputed whether the namesake Kentucky county or New Orleans street inspired the whiskey's name.Kiniry, Laura. "Where Bourbon Really Got Its Name and More Tips on America's Native Spirit". Smithsonian.com. 13 June 2013. Accessed 13 January 2014. Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century.[tpl]cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink = Leah A. Zeldes | title = Eat this!

While the liquor may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South in general, and Kentucky in particular.

==History==

The origin of bourbon is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims, some more credible than others. For example, the invention of  bourbon is often attributed to a pioneering Baptist minister and distiller named Elijah Craig. Rev. Craig (credited with many Kentucky firsts, e.g., fulling mill, paper mill, ropewalk, etc.) is said to also be the first to age the distillation in charred oak casks, "a process that gives the bourbon its reddish color and unique taste".John E. Kleber, ed., The Kentucky Encyclopedia (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1992), 103 Across the county line in Bourbon County, an early distiller named Jacob Spears is credited with being the first to label his product as "Bourbon whiskey". Spears' home, Stone Castle, warehouse and spring house survive; one can drive by the Spears' home on Clay-Kiser Road.
Although still popular and often repeated, the Craig legend has little credibility. Similarly, the Spears story is a local favorite, rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single "inventor" of bourbon, which developed into its present form only in the late 19th century.Cowdery, Charles K., "Who Invented Bourbon?" Malt Advocate Magazine, (4th Quarter 2002), pp. 72-75 Essentially any type of grain can be used to make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey (and charring the barrels) for better flavor had also been known in Europe for centuries. The use of the local American corn for the "mash" and oak for the barrels was making use of local materials by European-American settlers. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led Louisville historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity. He proposes that the whiskey was named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a major port where the Tarascon brothers' shipments of Kentucky whiskey sold well as a cheaper alternative to French cognac.
Distilling probably was brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including, English, Irish, Welsh, German and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The spirit they made evolved, and became known as bourbon in the early 19th century due to its historical association with the geographic area known as Old Bourbon (this consisted of the original Bourbon County of Virginia as organized in 1785, a region that included much of today's Eastern Kentucky – including 34 of today's counties in Kentucky.The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, John T. Edge, volume editor, Volume 7: Foodways, p. 128. One is the current Bourbon County of Kentucky).Charles K. Cowdery, "How Bourbon Whiskey Really Got Its Famous Name", The Bourbon Country Reader, Volume 3, Number 1, July 1996.Cowdery, Charles K., Bourbon, Straight: The Uncut and Unfiltered Story of American Whiskey, p. 25
A refinement variously credited to either James C. Crow or Jason S. Amburgey[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] was the sour mash process, by which each new fermentation is conditioned with some amount of spent mash (the wet solids strained from a previous batch of fermented mash, which still contain live yeast). Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers' spent grain, stillage, and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced by using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.
[tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], all straight bourbons use a sour mash process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightbourbon.com/faq.html#11|title=The Straightbourbon FAQ|publisher=Straight Bourbon.com|accessdate=2012-04-19[/tpl] Crow or Amburgey developed this refinement while working at the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery (now the Woodford Reserve Distillery) in Woodford County, Kentucky.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] As of today, there are no operating distilleries within the current boundaries of Bourbon County — due to new counties being formed from Bourbon County over time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bourbonky.com/|title=Bourbon County Kentucky|accessdate=2012-04-19[/tpl]

==Legal requirements==

Bourbon's legal definition varies somewhat from country to country, but many trade agreements require the name bourbon to be reserved for products made in the United States. The U.S. regulations for labeling and advertising bourbon apply only to products made for consumption within the United States; they do not apply to distilled spirits made for export. Canadian law requires products labeled bourbon to be made in the United States and also to conform to the requirements that apply within the United States. But in countries other than the United States and Canada, products labeled bourbon may not adhere to the same standards. For example, in the European Union, products labeled as bourbon are not required to conform to all of the regulations that apply within the United States, though they still must be made in the U.S.

===Geographic origin===

On May 4, 1964, the United States Congress recognized bourbon whiskey as a "distinctive product of the United States". Bourbon may be produced anywhere in the United States where it is legal to distill spirits.  But most brands are produced in Kentucky, where bourbon production has a strong historical association.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kybourbontrail.com/index.php/history/ |title=Kentucky Bourbon History |accessdate=2010-12-06 |work=Kentucky Bourbon Trail |publisher=Kentucky Distillers' Association |date= 2010-12-06[/tpl] Iron-free water that has been filtered through the high concentrations of limestone, unique to the area, is often touted by bourbon distillers in Kentucky as a signature step in the bourbon-making process.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kentuckybarrels.com/KentuckyBourbon.html |title=About Kentucky Bourbon |accessdate=2011-11-23 |work=Waters of Life |publisher=Kentucky Barrels LLC[/tpl] 
On August 2, 2007, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY) officially declaring September 2007 "National Bourbon Heritage Month", marking the history of bourbon whiskey.S. Res. No. 110-294 (2007). Notably, the resolution claimed that Congress had declared bourbon to be "America's Native Spirit" in its 1964 resolution. However, the 1964 resolution had not contained such a statement; it had declared bourbon to be a distinctive product identifiable with the United States (in a similar way that Scotch is considered identifiable with Scotland).Is Bourbon Officially America’s Native Spirit?, The Chuck Cowdery Blog, April 27, 2009. The resolution was passed again in 2008.
As of 2013, approximately 95% of all bourbon is produced in Kentucky.

Tennessee is home to other major bourbon producers, though most of its producers do not call their finished product bourbon; Jack Daniel's is the most well-known example. The methods for producing Tennessee whiskey fit the characteristics of bourbon production, and "Tennessee whiskey" is legally defined under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and at least one other international trade agreement,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/chap-034.asp |title=North American Free Trade Agreement Annex 313: Distinctive products |publisher=Sice.oas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14[/tpl]SICE - Free Trade Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Chile, Section E, Article 3.15 "Distinctive products". as the recognized name for a straight bourbon whiskey produced in Tennessee.

==Production process==

The typical grain mixture for bourbon, known as the mash bill, is a minimum of 51% corn, with the remainder being wheat, rye, and/or malted barley. A mash bill that contains wheat instead of rye produces what is known as a wheated bourbon.WL Weller[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/drinking/spirits/bourbon?page=all|title=Bourbon Guide|author=LeNell Smothers|publisher=epicurious.com|accessdate=May 1, 2014[/tpl] The grain is ground and mixed with water. Usually, though not always, mash from a previous distillation is added to ensure a consistent pH across batches, and a mash produced in that manner is referred to as a sour mash. Finally, yeast is added and the mash is fermented. The fermented mash, referred to as the wash, is distilled to (typically) between 65% and 80% alcohol. Distillation was historically performed using an alembic or pot still, although in modern production, the use of a continuous still is most common.
The resulting clear spirit is placed in newly charred American oak barrels for aging, during which it gains color and flavor from the caramelized sugars in the charred wood. Changes to the spirit also occur due to evaporation and chemical processes such as oxidation. Bourbons gain more color and flavor the longer they mature. Maturity, not a particular age, is the goal. Bourbon can age too long and become woody and unbalanced.
After maturing, bourbon is withdrawn from the barrel, usually diluted with water, and bottled to at least 80 US proof (40% abv).[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=21224b7c634d83e0fa329bfd18bb85dc&rgn=div8&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.3.3.25.2&idno=27|title=27 C.F.R. sec 5.22(b)|publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov|date= |accessdate=2010-08-05[/tpl] Most bourbon whiskey is sold at 80 US proof. Other common proofs are 86, 90, 94, 100, and 107, and whiskeys of up to 125 proof can be sold. Some higher-proof bottlings are marketed as "barrel proof", meaning that they have not been diluted or have been only lightly diluted after removal from the barrels. Bourbon whiskey may be sold at less than 80 proof but must be labeled as "diluted bourbon". 
After processing, barrels still contain 20 pounds of bourbon within the wood.[tpl]cite episode|title=Distilleries|series=Modern Marvels|serieslink=Modern Marvels|airdate=14 July 2004|season=11|episodeno=27[/tpl] They cannot be re-used for bourbon, and are sometimes sold to the Scotch whisky industry.

==Uses==

Bourbon is served neat, diluted with water, over ice cubes ("on the rocks"), or mixed with soda and into cocktails, including the Manhattan, the Old Fashioned, the whiskey sour, and the  mint julep.  Bourbon is also used in cooking, and was historically used for medicinal purposes.
