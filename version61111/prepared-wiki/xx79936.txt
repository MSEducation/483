James Graham Fair (December 3, 1831[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]December 28, 1894) was the overnight-millionaire part-owner of several successful silver mines on the Comstock Lode. Fair later became a real estate investor and railroad builder in California. In 1881, he was elected a United States Senator from Nevada.

==Early life==

Born to a poor Irish family in Clogher, County Tyrone, James Fair came with his father to the United States in 1843 and grew up on a farm in  Illinois. There he received an extensive education in business[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] before moving to California in 1850, where he prospected the Feather River country for gold embedded in quartz rather than pan for placer gold. His attention shifted to Nevada, where he operated a stamp mill on the Washoe River and landed various mine superintendent positions around the Comstock Lode region. He became superintendent of the Hale and Norcross Mine in Virginia City, Nevada in 1867.
He formed a partnership with three fellow Irishmen, John William Mackay, and the San Francisco saloon owners James C. Flood, and William S. O'Brien. The company was formally Flood and O'Brien, but popularly known as the "Bonanza firm". The four made large fortunes in shares in  silver mines on the Comstock Lode, struck in 1859. It was the first major silver discovery in the United States, producing over five hundred million dollars in twenty years' operation.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Although Fair was acknowledged to be a capable mine superintendent and a shrewd businessman, he was not well liked, and carried the nickname "Slippery Jim."Grant H. Smith (1943) The History of the Comstock Lode, Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, Geology and Mining Series No. 37, p.118. He invested much of his income from the Comstock in railroads and San Francisco real estate.  Fair and Mackay owned the Nevada Bank of San Francisco, a rival to William Chapman Ralston's Bank of California; after the collapse of Ralston's financial empire, the Nevada Bank was for a time the largest bank in America at the height of the silver boom.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

==South Pacific Coast Railroad==

In 1876, in partnership with several others, Fair established the narrow-gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad. From its beginning near present-day Newark, the line extended down the east side of San Francisco Bay, through San Jose and Los Gatos and southward over the Santa Cruz Mountains over a route that entailed a 6,200-foot tunnel, another 5,000-foot tunnel and six shorter ones. Some six hundred Chinese workers were employed in clearing, grading, laying track and tunneling. In that last activity, thirty-one workers lost their lives, primarily from explosions of underground natural gas. At its southern end, the tracks connected with the already-operational Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad in Felton. The line over the mountains was completed in May 1880.
The South Pacific Coast Railroad was immediately successful and soon profitable but in 1886, for unexplained reasons, Fair sold his interest in the railroad to the Southern Pacific, which later converted it to standard gauge and operated it until 1940, when the over-the-mountains portion of the line was abandoned.Hamman, Rick. 1980.

==Political career==

Fair was elected by the Nevada legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1881. He was not much interested in Washington, where he promoted silver issues in the Senate at a time when a movement was afoot to demonetize silver. Fair only served one term due to his defeat in the 1886 election. Following the end of his term, he moved back to San Francisco.

==Personal life==

In 1861 Fair married Theresa Rooney, who had been keeping a boarding house. She divorced him in 1883 on grounds of "habitual adultery" and brought up their four children on her own, with a very considerable settlement.
When his daughter, Theresa "Tessie" Alice Fair was married in 1890 to Hermann Oelrichs of Norddeutsche Lloyd shipping lines, in the grandest wedding San Francisco had seen, he remained in his hotel suiteHis hotel built that year survived the San Francisco Earthquake and continues as the "Queen Anne Hotel". without an invitation. He gave her a million dollars as a wedding gift nevertheless (Ferguson 1977 p. 2)
Fair is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. His will left $40 million in trust to his daughters, née Theresa "Tessie" Alice Fair, Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs, and Virginia Graham, later Mrs William Kissam Vanderbilt II and his surviving son, Charles Lewis Fair.
After his death, Mrs. Nettie Cravens came forward claiming to be his wife. She presented her evidence to the court trial, but lost the case. She moved to Iowa and lived in obscurity, spending her last days in a mental institution.  Later, another woman, Phoebe Couzins, a women's-rights advocate, also claimed a relationship with Fair.

==Legacy==

The Fairmont San Francisco hotel was built and named after Fair as grand monument by his daughters, Theresa Fair Oelrichs and Virginia Fair Vanderbilt who built the hotel[tpl]cite book | last=Woodbridge | first=Sally B. | coauthors=Woodbridge, John M. | pages=62 | title=San Francisco Architecture | location=San Francisco  | publisher=Chronicle Books | year=1992 | isbn=0-87701-897-9[/tpl] Construction began in 1902, but they sold their interests in 1906, days before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
