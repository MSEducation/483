A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.
Febricula is an old term for a low-grade fever, especially if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully in less than a week.

===Hyperpyrexia===

Hyperpyrexia is a fever with an extreme elevation of body temperature greater than or equal to [tpl]convert|41.5|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |author=Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L. Kasper; Hauser, Stephen L; Longo, Dan L. |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2008 |chapter=Chapter 17, Fever versus hyperthermia |isbn=0-07-146633-9 [/tpl]  Such a high temperature is considered a medical emergency as it may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to significant side effects.  The most common cause is an intracranial hemorrhage.  Other possible causes include sepsis, Kawasaki syndrome,Marx 2006, p. 2506 neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug effects, serotonin syndrome, and thyroid storm.[tpl]cite journal |author=McGugan EA |title=Hyperpyrexia in the emergency department |journal=Emerg. Med. (Fremantle) |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=116–20 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11476402 |doi= 10.1046/j.1442-2026.2001.00189.x|url=[/tpl]  Infections are the most common cause of fevers, however as the temperature rises other causes become more common.  Infections commonly associated with hyperpyrexia include: roseola, rubeola and enteroviral infections.  Immediate aggressive cooling to less than [tpl]convert|38.9|C|F[/tpl] has been found to improve survival.  Hyperpyrexia differs from hyperthermia in that in hyperpyrexia the body's temperature regulation mechanism sets the body temperature above the normal temperature, then generates heat to achieve this temperature, while in hyperthermia the body temperature rises above its set point due to an outside source.

===Hyperthermia===

Hyperthermia is an example of a high temperature that is not a fever.  It occurs from a number of causes including heatstroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine, idiosyncratic drug reactions, and serotonin syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==

A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, anorexia, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and the inability to concentrate.[tpl]cite journal | last1 =Hart | author-separator =, | first1 =BL | title =Biological basis of the behavior of sick animals | journal =Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews | volume =12 | issue =2 | pages =123–37 | year =1988 | author-name-separator= |pmid=3050629 | doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(88)80004-6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal  | last1 =Johnson  | author-separator =,  | first1 =RW  | title =The concept of sickness behavior: a brief chronological account of four key discoveries  | journal =Veterinary immunology and immunopathology  | volume =87  | issue =3–4  | pages =443–50  | year =2002 | author-name-separator=|pmid=12072271  | doi =10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00069-7[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 =Kelley | author-separator =, | first1 =KW | last2 =Bluthé | first2 =RM | last3 =Dantzer | first3 =R | last4 =Zhou | first4 =JH | last5 =Shen | first5 =WH | last6 =Johnson | first6 =RW | last7 =Broussard | first7 =SR | title =Cytokine-induced sickness behavior | journal =Brain, behavior, and immunity | volume =17 Suppl 1 | pages =S112–8 | year =2003 | author-name-separator= |pmid=12615196 | doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00077-6[/tpl]

==Differential diagnosis==

Fever is a common symptom of many medical conditions:
Persistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called fever of unknown origin.

==Pathophysiology==

Temperature is ultimately regulated in the hypothalamus. A trigger of the fever, called a pyrogen, causes a release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which generates a systemic response back to the rest of the body, causing heat-creating effects to match a new temperature level.
In many respects, the hypothalamus works like a thermostat.  When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retaining heat.  Vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold.  If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new setting in the hypothalamus, then shivering begins in order to use muscle movements to produce more heat.  When the fever stops, and the hypothalamic setting is set lower; the reverse of these processes (vasodilation, end of shivering and nonshivering heat production) and sweating are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.
This contrasts with hyperthermia, in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat.  Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment (heat stroke) or an adverse reaction to drugs.  Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to anti-pyretic medications.

===Pyrogens===

A pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body. The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of some bacteria, is an example of an exogenous pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as superantigens can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.

====Endogenous====

In essence, all endogenous pyrogens are cytokines, molecules that are a part of the immune system.  They are produced by activated immune cells and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. Major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (α and β),Chapter 58 in:  [tpl]cite book |author=Walter F., PhD. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2003 |page=1300 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl] interleukin 6 (IL-6). Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-β, macrophage inflammatory protein-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ. Tumor necrosis factor-α also acts as a pyrogen. It is mediated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) release.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stefferl|first=Andreas|coauthors=Stephen J. Hopkins, Nancy J. Rothwell & Giamal N. Luheshi|title=The role of TNF-a in fever: opposing actions of human and murine TNF-oa and interactions with IL-fl in the rat|journal=Brftish Journal of Pharmacology|date=April 25, 1996|pmc=1909906|volume=118|issue=8|pages=1919–1924|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1996.tb15625.x[/tpl]
These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the circumventricular organs of the brain due to easier absorption caused by the blood–brain barrier's reduced filtration action there. The cytokine factors then bind with endothelial receptors on vessel walls, or interact with local microglial cells. When these cytokine factors bind, the arachidonic acid pathway is then activated.

====Exogenous====

One model for the mechanism of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. An immunological protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBP–LPS complex then binds to the CD14 receptor of a nearby macrophage. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokine factors, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway.

===PGE2 release===

PGE2 release comes from the arachidonic acid pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.
PGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The set point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus . Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.

===Hypothalamus===

The brain ultimately orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system. These may be:
In infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-exercise-associated thermogenesis, also known as non-shivering thermogenesis). Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.

===Usefulness===

There are arguments for and against the usefulness of fever, and the issue is controversial.[tpl]cite journal | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=|last1= Schaffner|first1= A|title= Fever--useful or noxious symptom that should be treated?|journal= Therapeutische Umschau.

In theory, fever can aid in host defense. There are certainly some important immunological reactions that are sped up by temperature, and some pathogens with strict temperature preferences could be hindered.[tpl]cite journal  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=| last1 = Fischler | first1 = M.P. | last2 = Reinhart | first2 = W.H. | year = 1997 | title = Fever: friend or enemy? | url = | journal = Schweiz Med Wochenschr | volume = 127 | issue = 20| pages = 864–70 | pmid = 9289813 [/tpl]

==Management==

Fever should not necessarily be treated.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003090.htm |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |work=Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia |title=Fever |accessdate=20 May 2009[/tpl] Most people recover without specific medical attention.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/sick.htm |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=What To Do If You Get Sick: 2009 H1N1 and Seasonal Flu |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl] Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated.  Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 42 °C (107.6 °F), and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40.6 °C (105 °F).

===Conservative measures===

Some limited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meremikwu M, Oyo-Ita A|title=Physical methods for treating fever in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD004264 |year=2003|pmid=12804512 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004264 |url= |editor1-last=Meremikwu |editor1-first=Martin M[/tpl] The use of a fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required. In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated.[tpl]cite web|title=Fever|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fever.html|work=National Institute of Health[/tpl] Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.[tpl]cite journal|last=Guppy|first=MP|coauthors=Mickan, SM, Del Mar, CB, Thorning, S, Rack, A|title=Advising patients to increase fluid intake for treating acute respiratory infections|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Feb 16, 2011|issue=2|pages=CD004419|pmid=21328268|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004419.pub3|editor1-last=Guppy|editor1-first=Michelle PB[/tpl]

==History==

A number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was practicing medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days).[tpl]cite journal|last=Sajadi|first=MM|coauthors=Bonabi, R; Sajadi, MR; Mackowiak, PA|title=Akhawayni and the first fever curve.|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=October 2012|volume=55|issue=7|pages=976–80|pmid=22820543|doi=10.1093/cid/cis596[/tpl] It also became clear around this time that fevers were a symptom of a disease rather than a disease in and of itself.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===

Pyrexia is from the Greek pyr meaning fire. Febrile is from the Latin word febris, meaning fever, and archaically known as ague.

===Fever phobia===

Fever phobia is the name given by medical experts to parents' misconceptions about fever in their children.  Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a disease rather than a medical sign, that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified "normal" number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever.  They are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers.  The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is "as parents we tend to suspect that our children’s brains may melt."[tpl]cite news |title=Lifting a Veil of Fear to See a Few Benefits of Fever |author=Klass, Perri |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 January 2011 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/health/11klass.html [/tpl]
As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child's sleep to give the child more medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Crocetti M, Moghbeli N, Serwint J |title=Fever phobia revisited: have parental misconceptions about fever changed in 20 years? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=6 |pages=1241–6 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11389237 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.6.1241 [/tpl]

==Other animals==

Fever is an important feature for the diagnosis of disease in domestic animals. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a horse is said to have a fever above [tpl]val|101|u=°F[/tpl] ([tpl]val|38.3|u=°C[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/healthVitalSigns.shtml|title=Equusite Vital Signs|publisher=www.equusite.com | accessdate = 2010-03-22[/tpl] In species that allow the body to have a wide range of "normal" temperatures, such as camels,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/188/1/103|title=Body Temperature of the Camel and Its Relation to Water Economy |publisher=ajplegacy.physiology.org | accessdate = 2010-03-22[/tpl] it is sometimes difficult to determine a febrile stage.
Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever. For instance, some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2 - 5 °C higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as B. bassiana and M. anisopliae.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Matthew B.|author2=Simon Blanford|title=Thermal biology in insect-parasite interactions|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=344–350|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00069-7[/tpl] Honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite Ascosphaera apis.
