[[Caseolus sphaerulus]]

CATEGORIES: Hygromiidae

Caseolus sphaerulus is a species of small land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk.
The specific epithet is spelled C. sphaerulus in both of the references here cited, however the species is also often referred to in reputable sources as C. sphaerula, for example in the Convention of Berne and the Habitats Directive. Here we are assuming these usages are in error, firstly because the Latin word "caseolus" is masculine, and also for reasons of consistency, because R.T. Lowe named at least five other species in the genus Caseolus using masculine adjectival names.

It is mentioned in annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive. This species is threatened by forest replanting, mixed forms of pollution, erosion and the impact of improved access to its habitat. Its future prospects are bad and the species is likely to become extinct in its biogeographical region.Report on the main results of the surveillance under article 11 for annex II, IV and V species (Annex B) Factsheet : Caseolus sphaerula
