In Greek mythology, as recorded in Pindar's 9th Pythian ode, Cyrene [tpl]IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|r|iː|n|iː[/tpl] or Kyrene ([tpl]lang-grc|Κυρήνη[/tpl], "sovereign queen") was the daughter of Hypseus, King of the Lapiths, although some myths state that her father was actually the river-god Peneus and she was a nymph rather than mortal.Hyginus Fabulae 161, Virgil Georgics 4.320 
Cyrene was a fierce huntress, called by Nonnus a "deer-chasing second Artemis, the girl lionkiller."Nonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 300 ff Pindar describes her in his Pythian Ode: 
When a lion attacked her father's sheep, Cyrene wrestled with the lion. Apollo, who was present, immediately fell in love with her and kidnapped her. He took her to North Africa and founded the city of Cyrene in her name. The region, Cyrenaica, is also named for her. Together, she and Apollo had two sons: Aristaeus, the demigod who invented beekeeping, and Idmon, the Argonaut seer.http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/C/Cyrene.html Greek Myth Index: Cyrene Other stories say that Cyrene was not wrestling with a lion but instead tending her sheep along the marsh-meadow of the river Pineios, and that Apollo later transformed her into a nymph to grant her a longer life.http://www.maicar.com/GML/Cyrene.html Greek Mythology Link
Cyrene is also mentioned in the second and third hymns of Callimachus as well as in The Poet and the Women (written by Aristophanes) whence Mnesilochus comments that he "can't see a man there at all-only Cyrene" when setting eyes upon the poet Agathon who emerges from his house to greet Euripides and himself dressed in women's clothing.
With Ares, Cyrene (if indeed this is the same Cyrene) was the mother of Diomedes of Thrace.
