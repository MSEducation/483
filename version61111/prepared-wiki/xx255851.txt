==Purpose==

APEX was designed for the purpose of supporting, innovating and creating programs and services focusing on the needs of young people to help better their lives and keep them off the streets of New Orleans, and to create future leaders (or model citizens). The center services children, primarily ages 12 to 18, during the day, with special activities and programs in the evening targeted to teens and young adults between 15 and 25. Volunteers circulate, and facilitate positive social interaction, teaching the necessary verbal and non-verbal communication skills to resolve conflict and develop relationships.  Features such as homework help, tutoring, job-training, computer access, non-violent video games, a pool table and indoor and outdoor team sports are highlighted.  APEX Youth Center's theme is “Reconciliation, Never Retaliation”. [tpl]Citation needed|claim needs link to reliable sources|date=March 2014[/tpl]
