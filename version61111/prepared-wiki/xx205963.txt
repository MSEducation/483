===World War II history===

At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hakaze was assigned to Destroyer Division 34 under the command of the IJN 11th Air Fleet, and was based at Cape St. Jacques south of Saigon in French Indochina supporting the 22nd Air Flotilla. Its primary mission in the early stages of the Pacific War was to transport materials to Miri and Kuching in Sarawak and to Kota Bharu in Malaya for the construction for forward air bases.
In February 1942, after providing support for "Operation L" (the invasion of Palembang on Sumatra in the Netherlands East Indies, Hakaze was based out of Bangka, from which she made anti-submarine patrols. She was transferred to Bangkok in March, and Singapore in April. In May, Hakaze was based at Rabaul in the Solomon Islands, from which it supported the attempted "Operation Mo" (the invasion of Port Moresby).  After returning to Maizuru briefly for repairs at the end of May, Hakaze escorted a convoy to Saipan, and from Saipan to Hahajima in the Ogasawara Islands and back. In August, she escorted a convoy from Saipan to Rabaul and began patrols from that base through October. In October, she escorted several convoys in preparation of the Guadalcanal offensive. In November, after being used as a "Tokyo Express" high speed transport to convey troops from Buin to Munda, she made an additional four transport runs in the same month.[tpl]cite web| url=  http://www.combinedfleet.com/hakaze_t.htm| title=  IJN Hakaze: Tabular Record of Movement| last= Nevitt | first=  Allyn D.  | year= 1997 | work= Long Lancers | publisher= Combinedfleet.com[/tpl]
