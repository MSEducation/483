He was granted an audience by Adolf Hitler in Heidelberg in 1932. Hitler pointed out that blacks have no voting rights, and criticized them for being docile about their oppression, saying "Negroes must be definitely third-class people to allow whites to lynch them, beat them, segregate them, without rising up against them!" The Pittsburgh Courier ran a front page article on the conversation shortly after the U.S. entered the Second World War.  Wright noted that throughout the conversation, Hitler, though calm, asked questions and immediately gave his own answers. For example, he asked "Don't you think your people are destined perpetually to be slaves of one kind or another?" and replied "Yes! Your people are a hopeless lot. I don't hate them... I pity the poor devils."[tpl]cite book |author=Juliete Parker |title=A Man Named Doris |publisher=Xulon Press |location= |year=2003 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=509OchFCfRwC&dq=%22Milton+S+J+Wright%22&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&q=wright |isbn=1-59160-912-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=56[/tpl] The conversation was dramatically reenacted in 1944 on the anti-racist radio show New World A-Coming.New World A-Coming, WMCA, New York, 12 March 1944. 3-4.
