==History==

According to R.E.G. Davies in his Airlines of Latin America Since 1919, the first incarnation of Air Jamaica was founded on August 27, 1963 after the government of Jamaica decided not to invest in British West Indian Airways (BWIA). Dubbed Jamaica Air Service Ltd., its shareholders were the government of Jamaica (51 percent), BOAC in association with the Cunard Line (33 percent), and BWIA (16 percent). BWIA's employees in Jamaica were transferred to the new airline. Service to Miami and New York began on May 1, 1966.http://www.company-histories.com/Air-Jamaica-Limited-Company-History.html
BOAC, Britain's international airline, and BWIA had continued to maintain the leased aircraft (this operating arrangement would not expire until the end of May 1969). However, the Jamaican government preferred a more independent approach and eventually prepared to establish a new company, Air Jamaica (1968) Ltd.
Air Jamaica was established in October 1968 and started operations on April 1, 1969, connecting Kingston and Montego Bay, with New York and Miami.Flight International 27 March 2007 At that time the Jamaican government owned a substantial part of the airline, with Air Canada owning a minor share (40 percent) and providing technical, maintenance and logistical help.
During the 1970s, Air Jamaica expanded rapidly. Flights were added to Toronto and Montreal in Canada, to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico, to Philadelphia and many other destinations, especially across the Caribbean. Long-haul services to Europe were started on 1 April 1974. Air Jamaica used Douglas DC-8s for a large part of the 1970s, but the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 727 jets became a part of the fleet towards the end of the decade when the government bought out Air Canada's small share. During the 1980s, growth slowed. Nevertheless, new routes were opened to Baltimore and Atlanta.
In 1989 the Jamaican government announced plans for a privatization of the airline (which was fully state owned since 1980 when Air Canada divested its 40 percent shareholding in the airline). However, it was not until May 1994 that a partial sell-off was announced when a group of Jamaican and Canadian investors (known as the Air Jamaica Acquisition Group or AJAG) agreed to acquire a 70 percent share of the carrier for $26.5 million. Another 5 percent share was earmarked for employees. The government retained responsibility for liabilities, which were considerable.
A further merger of Air Jamaica with other Caribbean airlines was already being proposed, with British Airways invited to take a 25 percent holding in the venture. In the first stage, Air Jamaica was to have merged its operations with those of Trinidad and Tobago Airways, parent of BWIA.Guyana Airways Corporation, and Leeward Islands Air Transport would be included in the venture later.
During the 1990s Air Jamaica continued to expand: the airline took over the Kingston-Nassau, Bahamas route, which had been left by British Airways, began a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines and opened routes to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix (which was later dropped), and to Frankfurt, London, Manchester, Santo Domingo and Ft. Lauderdale. The route to Phoenix was opened because Air Jamaica was looking for expansion in the American West, beyond its route to Los Angeles. In 1994 the company was partially privatized, with the government retaining 25% of the company and giving 5% of it to the airline's employees. It began buying Airbus equipment, including the Airbus A340, and began a feeder service, a frequent flyer program (7th Heaven), and an inflight magazine, named SkyWritings.
In December 2004, after financial losses, the Government of Jamaica took back full ownership of Air Jamaica. It employed 2,522 as of March 2007.  The last private owner was Stephen Watson, an entrepreneur and billionaire in Jamaica.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/questex/ta-122208/#/57/OnePage|date=December 22, 2008|title=With Privatization, a New Era ahead for Air Jamaica|journal=Travel Agent|page=55[/tpl]

A private Jamaican, Spanish, British and American consortium was in talks with the Government of Jamaica to bid for the national carrier as well.Air J/Virgin deal a priority for new transport minister[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] Air Jamaica's complete privatisation and divestment was extended from March 2009 to June 2009.

Caribbean Airlines acquired the airline's fleet and route rights on 1 May 2010, and opened a new hub at Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport. The acquisition makes Caribbean Airlines the largest airline in the Caribbean. On 27 May 2011 Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw and Trinidadian Finance Minister Winston Dookeran signed the shareholding agreement, making Caribbean Airlines the national airline of Jamaica with access to all routes operated by the former Air Jamaica."Air Jamaica on course for possible April 12 takeover."
