Foster's Group is an Australian beer group with interests in brewing and soft drinks. Foster's Group Limited is based in Melbourne, Victoria and is a subsidiary of British multinational SABMiller.  Foster's Group is the brewer of the Foster's Lager.  Foster's wine business was split into a separate company, Treasury Wine Estates, in May 2011.

==History==

It was founded in Melbourne in 1888 by two American brothers William and Ralph Foster of New York, who happened to own a refrigeration plant. Cooling was necessary to brew and store acceptable lagers in Australia's hot climate, unlike the English-style dark ales commonly brewed at the time. They sold the brewery the following year and returned to the United States.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl]
In 1983 Elders IXL, a giant Australian diversified conglomerate, purchased Carlton and United Breweries, and renamed it Elders Brewing Group.  Then in 1990, the Elders Brewing Group changed its name to the Foster's Group, to reflect the name of their most internationally recognised product.
In 2005, Foster's Group acquired the Australian wine-making group Southcorp.  This acquisition added famous brands such as Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount to the Foster's stable and around A$1 billion to revenues.
Foster's Group was acquired by SABMiller plc in December 2011
In May 2011, Foster's Group's Treasury Wine Estates unit was spun off into a separate company. The first day of trading saw its share price soaring, valuing the separate entity at A$2.2 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-10/treasury-wine-valued-at-2-3-billion-after-spinoff-from-foster-s-group.html|title=Treasury Wine Valued at $2.3 Billion After Spinoff From Foster’s Group|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl] 
There had long been speculation that the beer sector or all of Foster's Group will be subject to a takeover by a larger firm. Groups to express such an interest over the years have included Diageo, SABMiller, Molson Coors and Heineken International. In September 2011, the board of Fosters agreed to a takeover bid by SABMiller, valuing the company at A$9.9bn (US$10.2bn; £6.5bn).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15001391|title=SABMiller agrees Foster's takeover deal|publisher=BBC News|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011[/tpl] Foster's Group Limited shares (ASX code: FGL) were suspended from trading on the ASX on 2 December 2011 and delisted from the ASX at close of trading on 20 December 2011.Investors, Foster's Group Limited (accessed 13 June 2012)
