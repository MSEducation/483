Evanston is the home of Northwestern University.

==History==

Prior to the 1830s, the area now occupied by Evanston was mainly uninhabited, consisting largely of wetlands and swampy forest. However, Potawatomi Indians used trails along higher lying ridges that ran in a general north-south direction through the area, and had at least some semi-permanent settlements along the trails.
French explorers referred to the general area as "Grosse Pointe" after a point of land jutting into Lake Michigan about [tpl]convert|13|mi|0[/tpl] north of the mouth of the Chicago River. After the first non-native Americans settled in the area in 1836, the names "Grosse Point Territory" and "Gross Point voting district" were used through the 1830s and 1840s, although the territory had no defined boundaries.[tpl]Cite book| last1 = Illinois State Historical Society | last2 = Currey | first2 = Seymour | title = Transactions of the Illinois State Historical Society for the year 1908 | chapter = Chicago's North Shore | publisher = Illinois State Historical Library | year = 1909 | location = Springfield, Illinois | pages = 101–109 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-EXWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109 | accessdate = August 26, 2010 [/tpl]"This is Evanston," League of Women Voters of Evanston, 2000, ISBN 0-9676994-0-1 http://www.lwve.org/pdf/Complete-ThisIsEvanston.pdf pp. 8–18 The area remained only sparsely settled, supporting some farming and lumber activity on some of the higher ground, as well as a number of taverns or "hotels" along the ridge roads.
In 1850, a township called Ridgeville was organized, extending from Graceland Cemetery in Chicago to the southern edge of the Ouilmette Reservation, along what is now Central Street, and from Lake Michigan to Western Avenue in Chicago. The 1850 census shows a few hundred settlers in this township, and a post office with the name of Ridgeville was established at one of the taverns. However, no municipality yet existed.
In 1851, a group of Methodist business leaders founded Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute. They chose a bluffed and wooded site along the lake as Northwestern's home, purchasing several hundred acres of land from Dr. John Foster, a Chicago farm owner. In 1854, the founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for a city to be named Evanston after John Evans,[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

Today these hopes have been fulfilled, as Northwestern consistently ranks with the best of the nation's universities.
Evanston was formally incorporated as a town on December 29, 1863, but declined in 1869 to become a city despite the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose. Evanston expanded after the Civil War with the annexation of the village of North Evanston. Finally, in early 1892, following the annexation of the village of South Evanston, voters elected to organize as a city.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = | first = | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = Newton Bateman & Paul Selby | encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois | title = Evanston | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lxoVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=Northwestern+University+founders+railroad&source=web&ots=MI42CBTn0s&sig=1sNzuElhPmebarMhe_PW0X17_Ew&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPP11,M1 | accessdate = December 14, 2008 | edition = | date = | year = 1917 | publisher = Munsell Publishing Co. | volume = 1 | location = Chicago | id = | doi = | pages = 160 | quote = [/tpl] The 1892 boundaries are largely those that exist today.

==Transportation==

Evanston's growth occurred largely because of its accessibility from Chicago by rail. The Northwestern founders did not finalize their commitment to siting the university there until they were assured the Chicago & Milwaukee Railway line would run there. C&M trains began stopping in Evanston in 1855.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/history/begin.html | title = History of Northwestern University Library | accessdate = December 14, 2008 | date = March 3, 2001 | publisher = Northwestern University Library [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Evanston later experienced rapid growth as one of the first streetcar suburbs. The North Shore Line which gave the area its nickname started at Church Street in Evanston and continued up to Waukegan.
Transit continues to make Evanston attractive today. The CTA's Purple Line, part of the Chicago 'L' system, runs through Evanston. From its terminal at Howard in Chicago, the line heads north to the South Boulevard, Main, Dempster, Davis, Foster, Noyes, and Central stations, before terminating at Linden station in Wilmette. Metra's Union Pacific/North Line also serves Evanston, with stations at Main Street, Davis Street and Central Street, the first two being adjacent to Purple Line stations. The CTA's Yellow Line also runs through the city, though it only stops at Howard.
Evanston is served by six CTA bus routes as well as four Pace bus routes.
Active modes of transportation include miles of sidewalks and bicycle lanes.
The largest automobile routes from Chicago to Evanston include Lake Shore Drive, the Edens Expressway (I-94), and McCormick Boulevard, although the first two of those do not extend to Evanston itself and require driving through Rogers Park (via Sheridan Road or Ridge Avenue) and Skokie, respectively. The principal routes from the north are the Edens, Green Bay Road, and Sheridan Road.

==University-city relations==

A perennial debate in Evanston is the issue of Northwestern University's status as a tax-exempt institution. In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions,[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D6173EF93BA15752C1A966958260 | title =Harvard Will Pay More To Cambridge in Accord | work = The New York Times | date = November 28, 1990 | accessdate = May 2, 2010 [/tpl] it provides its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and building permit fees, but not property taxes. Northwestern does not make Payments in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls.
Northwestern's critics allege that it consumes far more from the city than it contributes. However, its backers, like former Evanston mayor and Northwestern alumna Lorraine H. Morton, contend that the benefits of having an elite research institution justify Northwestern's tax status.[tpl]cite news|title=Nu Celebrates Landmark Birthday|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-22/news/0010220428_1_postal-card-postal-service-celebration|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 22, 2000|first=J Linn|last=Allen[/tpl] These supporters highlight the fact that Northwestern University is the largest employer in Evanston,Evanston, Illinois#Top employers and that its students and faculty constitute a large consumer base for Evanston businesses. This controversy was revived in 2003 when the university purchased an eight-story office building downtown, removing it from the tax rolls. An advisory referendum put on the April elections ballot, dubbed by supporters as a "Fair Share Initiative", received a majority, but was not passed into ordinance by the City Council.
In September 2009, Northwestern purchased a fire truck for the city of Evanston at a cost of $550,000. Northwestern President Morton Schapiro stated, "We are pleased to fund the purchase of this new fire engine, which was the top priority of the City in our discussions with how we might assist the City financially."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/09/truck.html | title = Northwestern Purchases Fire Truck for Evanston | work = Northwestern University News | publisher =  Northwestern.edu | date = September 23, 2009 | accessdate = July 14, 2013[/tpl]
