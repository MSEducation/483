[[Tram stop]]

A tram stop is a place designated for a tram to stop so passengers can board or alight it. Tram stops share most characteristics of bus stops, but because trams operate on rails, they often include railway platforms, especially if stepless entries are provided for accessibility. However, trams may also be used with bus stop type flags and with mid-street pavements as platforms, in so-called street running operation.

==Examples==

Most tram stops in Melbourne and Toronto have no associated platforms, and stop in the middle of the road; traffic cannot legally pass a tram whose doors are open, unless the tram is behind a safety zone. 
On the other hand, the Metrolink system in Greater Manchester, England, has high-floor tram stops at dedicated platforms at railway platform height, because the system was created from former heavy rail routes. Such trams also stop at dedicated platform stops on Stadtbahns in Germany, especially in underground stations in city centres.
The Toronto streetcar system has Sunday stops in addition to regular tram stops. Sunday stops may only be used on a Sunday and, with few exceptions, are always near a church. A few Sunday stops near a subway station are usable only before 9 am, the Sunday opening time of the subway system. Most Sunday stops are along current and former streetcar routes.
