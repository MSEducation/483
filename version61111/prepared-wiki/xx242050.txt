==Going Solar==

Just recently, the school has completed their latest energy project. The project consisted of installing photovoltaic panels. The project was funded by Northern Ireland Electricity's Smart programme and the North Eastern Education and Library Board. Once in use, it will produce about 2400 units of electricity each year. With the amount of electricity saved, it will save the school 250 sterling pounds each year on their electricity bill. With the system in place, it will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the local environment by around 1.5 tonnes. NIE Energy has installed those solar panels at five other schools in the area.
