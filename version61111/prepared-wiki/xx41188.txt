[[Nestor (genus)]]

CATEGORIES: Nestor, Bird genera, Tribes of birds, Parrots

The genus Nestor is one of two genera of the family Nestoridae.  Together with the  Kakapo in the Strigopidae tribe, they form the small parrot superfamily Strigopoidea. The genus Nestor contains two extant parrot species from New Zealand and two extinct species from Norfolk Island, Australia and Chatham Island, New Zealand, respectively. All species are large stocky birds with short squarish tails. A defining characteristic of the genus is the tongue, which is tipped with a hair-like fringe.[tpl]Cite book | first= Joseph M.| last= Forshaw| coauthors= Cooper, William T.|year= 1981|origyear=1973, 1978|edition=corrected second| title= Parrots of the World|publisher=David & Charles, Newton Abbot, London|isbn=0-7153-7698-5[/tpl] The superficial resemblance of this tongue to that of lorikeets has led some taxonomists to consider the two groups closely related, but DNA evidence shows they are not.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00199.x|last=Tokita |first=M|coauthors=Kiyoshi T and Armstrong KN |year=2007|title=Evolution of craniofacial novelty in parrots through developmental modularity and heterochrony.|journal=Evolution & Development|volume=9|issue=6|pages=590–601|pmid=17976055[/tpl]

==Classification==

All four species in the genus Nestor are thought to stem from a 'proto-Kākā', dwelling in the forests of New Zealand 5 million years ago.[tpl]Cite journal|title=A Multilocus Molecular Phylogeny of the Parrots (Psittaciformes): Support for a Gondwanan Origin during the Cretaceous|journal=Mol Biol Evol|year=2008|first=T.F. |last=Wright|coauthors=Schirtzinger E.

==Species==

There are two surviving species and at least one well documented extinct species in the genus Nestor. Very little is known about the fourth, the Chatham Kaka, which may have been conspecific with another Kaka species.
