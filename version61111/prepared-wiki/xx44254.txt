Mountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname of some of the descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh under an Order in Council issued in 1960,[tpl]cite web |title=The Royal Family name |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheRoyalFamilyname/Overview.aspx |publisher=The British Monarchy |accessdate=2011-05-05[/tpl] which has not been applied consistently.  While the Order specifically applies the surname "Mountbatten-Windsor" to those descendants of the Queen not holding Royal styles and titles, "Mountbatten-Windsor" has been formally used by some descendents of Queen Elizabeth II who do hold Royal styles. For example, both Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Anne, the Princess Royal, children of the Queen, used the surname "Mountbatten-Windsor" in official marriage registry entries.
Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the British Royal Family or Royal House, which remains Windsor. The adoption of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname applies only to members of the Royal Family who are descended from the Queen, and not, for example, to her cousins, or descendants of her sister, Princess Margaret.
Mountbatten-Windsor may be considered a cadet branch of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, which in turn is a branch of the House of Oldenburg.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w1MHY8-dMX0C&pg=PT363&dq=cadet+branch+Mountbatten-Windsors&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Nbr-Uc2BEeiKiAKZwYGoAw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=cadet%20branch%20Mountbatten-Windsors&f=false | title=Popular Errors Explained | publisher=Random House | author=McCartney, Stewart | year=2012 | location=New York | isbn=1409021890[/tpl]
