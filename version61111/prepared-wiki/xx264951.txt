Silver Lake is an unincorporated community in Preston County, West Virginia, United States. Silver Lake is located along U.S. Route 219 [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km[/tpl] north of Thomas in Tucker County.
The community is named for a man-made lake of the same name, which is located within a private campground in the community.  Built in 1928, the lake is retained by a small concrete splash dam and is located at the headwaters of the Youghiogheny River.  The park and campground was also built in the 1930s, and was at one time one of the more popular vacation destinations in the area, featuring camping, boating, swimming, picknicking, a restaurant and game room, a small motel, and six small vacation cabins.  The park's overnight facilities were particularly popular during the 1940s and early 1950s, prior to the development of rental cabins and a large lodge at nearby Blackwater Falls State Park, although the vacation cabins at Silver Lake were available for nightly rentals into the late 1990s.  The restaurant closed in the early 2000s and today, the park is primarily a private campground, with many camping trailers permanently placed around the lake, and the cabins rented to monthly tenants.
The trailhead to Hoye-Crest, the highest point in Maryland, is just south of Silver Lake.  Hoye-Crest, the summit of Backbone Mountain, lies along the eastern edge of the West Virginia - Maryland state line, while Silver Lake is just west of the border.  The Hoye-Crest trail, a one-time logging road on private property, is about one mile (1.6 km) long with [tpl]convert|700|ft|m[/tpl] of elevation gain.
