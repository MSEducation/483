William Roger Clemens (born August 4, 1962) is an American former baseball starting pitcher. Clemens played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four teams. Clemens was one of the most dominant pitchers in major league history, tallying 354 wins, a 3.12 earned run average (ERA), and 4,672 strikeouts, the third-most all time. An 11-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion, he won seven Cy Young Awards during his career, the most of any pitcher in MLB history. Clemens was known for his fierce competitive nature and for his hard-throwing pitching style that he used to intimidate batters. He is nicknamed "The Rocket".
Clemens debuted in the major leagues in 1984 with the Boston Red Sox, whose pitching staff he anchored for 12 years. In 1986, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award, the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, and the All-Star Game MVP Award, and he struck out an MLB-record 20 batters in a single game. After the 1996 season, Clemens left Boston via free agency and joined the Toronto Blue Jays. In each of his two seasons with Toronto, Clemens won a Cy Young Award, as well as the pitching triple crown by leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. Prior to the 1999 season, Clemens was traded to the New York Yankees where he won his only two World Series titles. In 2003, he reached his 300th win and 4,000th strikeout in the same game. Clemens left for the Houston Astros in 2004, where he spent three seasons and won his seventh Cy Young Award. He rejoined the Yankees in 2007 for one last season.
Clemens was alleged by the Mitchell Report to have used anabolic steroids during his late career, mainly based on testimony given by his former trainer Brian McNamee.Exclusive: McNamee stands by story SI.com, Jan. 7, 2008 Clemens firmly denied these allegations under oath before Congress, leading congressional leaders to refer his case to the Justice Department on suspicions of perjury. On August 19, 2010, a federal grand jury at the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., indicted Clemens on six felony counts involving perjury, false statements and obstruction of Congress.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/08/19/2010-08-19_rocket_indicted_for_lying_to_congress.html|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York|title=Roger Clemens indicted for lying to Congress about steroid use|first=Teri|last=Thompson|date=August 19, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] Clemens pleaded not guilty,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/08/30/2010-08-30_exyankees_pictcher_roger_clemens_arrives_in_dc_federal_court_to_plead_not_guilty.html|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York|title=Roger Clemens pleads not guilty; feds cite "voluminous" evidence|first=Nathaniel|last=Vinton|date=August 30, 2010[/tpl] but proceedings were complicated by prosecutorial misconduct, leading to a mistrial.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101209/SPORTS04/12090350/Roger-Clemens-trial-date-gets-moved-to-July|newspaper=The Tennessean |agency=Associated Press|location=Nashville|title=Roger Clemens' trial date gets moved to July|date=December 9, 2010[/tpl]Government Errors, Judge Hits, Roger Clemens Runs The verdict from his second trial came in on June 18, 2012.

==Early life==

Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens still considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was only nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt envious of other players is when he saw them in the clubhouse with their fathers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/14749611.htm|title=22 things you should know about 'Rocket'|accessdate=2009-07-11|last=Story|first=Mark|date=2006-06-06|publisher=Lexington Herald-Leader|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060615043527/http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/14749611.htm|archivedate=2006-06-15[/tpl] Clemens lived in Vandalia, Ohio until 1977, and then spent most of his high school years in Houston. At Spring Woods High School, Clemens played baseball for longtime head coach Charles Maiorana[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.karlyoungbaseball.com/Administration/Bio%20Charlie%20Maioranal.htm|title=Charlie Maiorana|publisher=Karl Young College Baseball|accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] and also starred in football and basketball. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted instead to go to college.Roger Clemens Foundation

==Career==

===College===

He began his college career pitching for San Jacinto College North in 1981, where he was 9–2. The New York Mets selected Clemens in the 12th round of the 1981 draft, but he did not sign.The One the Mets lost He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, compiling a 25–7 record in two All-American seasons, and was on the mound when the Longhorns won the 1983 College World Series. He became the first player to have his baseball uniform number retired at The University of Texas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Roger_Clemens_1962|title=The Ballplayers – Roger Clemens|accessdate=2008-12-19 |work=BaseballLibrary.com[/tpl] In 2004, the Rotary Smith Award, given to America's best college baseball player, was changed to the Roger Clemens Award, honoring the best pitcher.[tpl]cite web|url=http://clemensaward.com/index.html|title=Welcome to the home of the Roger Clemens Award|publisher=Clemensaward.com|accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/roger_clemens_award.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Award on Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl]
At Texas, Clemens pitched 35 consecutive scoreless innings, a NCAA record that stood until Justin Pope broke it in 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-04-12/sports/0104120217_1_justin-pope-roger-clemens-ucf|title=`Bulldog' Pope Has Ucf Loaded With Rich Pitching: Junior Right-hander Justin Pope Broke Roger Clemens' Scoreless Innings Streak Of 35|date=April 12, 2001|first=Jeff|last=Case|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=February 14, 2012[/tpl]

===Boston Red Sox (1984–96)===

Clemens was drafted 19th overall by the Boston Red Sox in 1983 and quickly rose through the minor league system, making his major league debut on May 15, [tpl]Baseball Year|1984[/tpl]. In 1986, his 24 wins helped guide the Sox to a World Series berth and earned Clemens the American League MVP award for the regular season. He also won the first of his seven Cy Young Awards. When Hank Aaron said that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP, Clemens responded: "I wish he were still playing. I'd probably crack his head open to show him how valuable I was." Clemens was the only starting pitcher since Vida Blue in [tpl]Baseball Year|1971[/tpl] to win a league MVP award until Justin Verlander won the award in [tpl]Baseball Year|2011[/tpl].
On April 29, [tpl]mlby|1986[/tpl], Clemens became the first pitcher in history to strike out 20 batters in a nine-inning major league game, against the Seattle Mariners at Fenway Park. Other than Clemens, himself, only Kerry Wood has matched the total. (Randy Johnson fanned 20 batters in nine innings on May 8, 2001.  However, as the game went into extra innings, it is not categorized as occurring in a nine-inning game. Tom Cheney holds the record for any game: 21 strikeouts in 16 innings.) Clemens attributes his switch from what he calls a "thrower" to a "pitcher" to the partial season Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver spent with the Red Sox in 1986.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=October 1986[/tpl]
On June 21, 1989, Clemens surrendered the first of 609 home runs in the career of Sammy Sosa.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1989-06-22/sports/sp-2747_1_american-league-roundup-singles-left-center-field|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=Petralli Leads Attack as Rangers Rough Up Clemens and Red Sox, 10–3|agency=Associated Press|date=June 22, 1989|accessdate=August 18, 2010[/tpl] Sosa was then a rookie for the Texas Rangers.
Clemens accomplished the 20-strikeout feat twice, the only player ever to do so. The second performance came more than 10 years later, on September 18, [tpl]Baseball Year|1996[/tpl] against the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium. This second 20-K day occurred in his third-to-last game as a member of the Boston Red Sox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=clemero02&t=p&year=1996|title=Roger Clemens 1996 Pitching Gamelogs|accessdate=May 21, 2011|work=Baseball-Reference.com[/tpl]  Later, the Tigers presented him with a baseball containing the autographs of  each batter that had struck out (and those who had struck out more than once signed the appropriate number of times).
Clemens recorded 192 wins for the Red Sox, tied with Cy Young for the franchise record.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_pitch.shtml|title=Boston Red Sox Pitching Leaders|accessdate=2008-12-19|work=Baseball-Reference.com[/tpl] No Red Sox player has worn his #21 since Clemens left the team in 1996.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1997–98)===

The Red Sox did not re-sign Clemens following the 1996 season, despite offering him "by far the most money ever offered to a player in the history of the Red Sox franchise." General Manager Dan Duquette remarked that he "hoped to keep him in Boston during the twilight of his career," though Clemens left and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays.Baseball END OF AN ERA No return fire from Sox Brass tried to keep ace Boston Herald
Clemens signed a four-year, $40 million deal with the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1996 season, and won the pitching triple crown and the Cy Young Award in both his seasons in Toronto. 
In Clemens's first start in Fenway Park as a member of the Blue Jays (July 12, 1997) he pitched an inspired game, giving up only 4 hits and 1 run in 8 innings. 16 of his 24 outs were strikeouts, and every batter who faced him struck out at least once.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07120BOS1997.htm|title=Retrosheet complete box score[/tpl]
The emphasis on the misquoted 1996 "twilight" comment took on a life of its own following Clemens's post-Boston successes, and Duquette was vilified for letting the star pitcher go.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_10_223/ai_54117613|title=Losing Momentum – Boston Red Sox|last=Doyle|first=Paul|accessdate=2006-09-15|date=1999-03-08|publisher=The Sporting News[/tpl] Ultimately, Clemens would go on to have a record of 162–73 for the rest of his career after leaving the Red Sox.

===New York Yankees (1999–2003)===

Clemens was traded to the New York Yankees before the [tpl]mlby|1999[/tpl] season for David Wells, Homer Bush, and Graeme Lloyd. In 1999 and [tpl]mlby|2000[/tpl], he won World Series titles with the Yankees. Since his longtime uniform number #21 was in use by teammate Paul O'Neill, Clemens initially wore #12, before switching mid-season to #22.
Clemens made an immediate impact on the Yankees' staff, anchoring the top of the rotation as the team went on to win a pair of World Series titles in 1999 and 2000. During the 1999 regular season, Clemens posted a 14–10 record with a 4.60 ERA. He logged a pair of wins in the postseason, where he pitched 7.2 innings of 1-run baseball during the Yankees' game 4 clincher over the Atlanta Braves. Clemens followed up 1999 with a strong 2000 season, in which he finished with a 13–8 record with a 3.70 ERA for the regular season. During the 2000 MLB postseason, he helped the Yankees win their third championship in as many years. He pitched a shutout against the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS that year and also pitched eight scoreless innings against the New York Mets in the World Series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics and History|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl] Clemens set the ALCS record for strikeouts in a game when he fanned 15 batters in a one-hit shutout of the Mariners in Game 4 of the ALCS. A seventh inning lead-off double by Seattle's Al Martin was all that prevented Clemens from throwing just the second no-hitter in postseason history (Yankee Don Larsen threw a perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series). The Yankees won the 2000 World Series.
Clemens' best year with the Yankees came in 2001, when he became the first pitcher in MLB history to start a season 20–1. He finished at 20–3 and won his sixth Cy Young Award. He became the last Yankee pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. Clemens started for the Yankees in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he dueled Curt Schilling to a standstill after 6 innings, yielding only one run. The Diamondbacks went on to win the game in the 9th.
Early in [tpl]mlby|2003[/tpl], Clemens announced his retirement, effective at the end of that season. On June 13, 2003, pitching against the St. Louis Cardinals in Yankee Stadium, Clemens recorded his 300th career win and 4,000th career strikeout, the only player in history to record both milestones in the same game. The 300th win came on his fourth try; the Yankee bullpen had blown his chance of a win in his previous two attempts. He became the 21st pitcher ever to record 300 wins and the third ever to record 4,000 strikeouts, joining Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Steve Carlton (4,136). Randy Johnson (4,875) has since also joined the 4,000 strikeout club. His career record upon reaching the milestones was 300–155; his record at the end of the season was 310–160 with 4,099 strikeouts. Clemens finished the season with a 17–9 record and a 3.91 ERA.
The end of Clemens' 2003 season became a series of public farewells met with appreciative cheering. His last games in each AL park were given extra attention, particularly his final regular season appearance in Fenway Park, when despite wearing the uniform of the hated arch rival, he was afforded a standing ovation by Red Sox fans as he left the field. (This spectacle was repeated when the Yankees ended up playing the Red Sox in the 2003 ALCS and Clemens got a second "final start" in his original stadium.) As part of a tradition of manager Joe Torre, Clemens was chosen to manage the Yankees' last game of the regular season. Clemens made one start in the World Series against the Florida Marlins; when he left trailing 3–1 after seven innings, the Marlins left their dugout to give him a standing ovation.

===Houston Astros (2004–06)===

Clemens chose to come out of retirement, signing a one-year deal with his adopted hometown Houston Astros on January 12, [tpl]Baseball Year|2004[/tpl], joining close friend and former Yankees teammate Andy Pettitte. On May 5, [tpl]Baseball Year|2004[/tpl], Clemens recorded his 4,137th career strikeout to place him second on the all-time list behind Nolan Ryan. He was named the starter for the National League All-Star team but ultimately was the losing pitcher in that game after allowing six runs on five hits including a three run home run to Alfonso Soriano. Clemens finished the season with 4,317 career strikeouts, and his 18–4 record gave him a career record of 328–164. After the season, he won his seventh Cy Young Award, extending his record number of awards. He became the oldest player ever to win this award, at age 42. This made him one of five pitchers to win the award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martínez, and Randy Johnson and later joined by Roy Halladay. In Houston, Clemens wore # 22, his number with the Yankees, partly because Pettitte had chosen # 21, in Clemens' honor.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Clemens again decided to put off retirement before the [tpl]Baseball Year|2005[/tpl] season after the Houston Astros offered salary arbitration. The Astros submitted an offer of $13.5 million, and Clemens countered with a record $22 million demand. On January 21, 2005, both sides agreed on a one-year, $18,000,022 contract, thus avoiding arbitration. The deal gave Clemens the highest yearly salary earned by a pitcher in MLB history.[tpl]cite web |url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050121&content_id=933093&vkey=news_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou|title=Astros ink Clemens to record deal|accessdate=2009-07-11|first=Alyson|last=Footer|date=2005-01-21|publisher=MLB.com[/tpl] It also made him the sixth-highest paid player in baseball that year.
Clemens' 2005 season ended as one of the finest he had ever posted. His 1.87 ERA was the lowest in the major leagues, the lowest of his 22-season career, and the lowest by any National Leaguer since Greg Maddux in 1995. He finished with a lackluster 13–8 record, primarily due to the fact that he ranked near 30th in run support. The Astros scored an average of only 3.5 runs per game in games in which he was the pitcher of record. The Astros were shut out nine times in Clemens' 32 starts, and failed to score in a 10th until after Clemens was out of the game. The Astros lost five Clemens starts by scores of 1–0. In April, Clemens did not allow a run in three consecutive starts. However, the Astros lost all three of those starts by a 1–0 score in extra innings.
He has the second most career wins (behind Maddux) of any right-handed pitcher of the live-ball era. On April 8, [tpl]mlby|2005[/tpl], Clemens won his first start of the season against the Cincinnati Reds, which tied him with Steve Carlton for second in wins for live-ball pitchers, and first among pitchers whose career began after World War II. However, it took him a month to surpass Carlton, as he had low run support in a string of five starts that produced one loss and four no-decisions. On May 9, he got his second win of the season against the Florida Marlins, giving him 330 for his career. Only Greg Maddux and left-hander Warren Spahn are ahead of Clemens in wins among live-ball pitchers. Passing Carlton also gave Clemens more wins at the time than any pitcher alive.
Clemens won an emotional start on September 15, following his mother's death that morning.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/games/2005-09-14-marlins-astros_x.htm|title=Clemens wins one for his late mother|accessdate=January 27, 2007|date=September 15, 2005|newspaper=USA Today[/tpl] In his final start of the 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On October 9, 2005, Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to help the Astros defeat the Atlanta Braves in the longest postseason game in MLB history. The game ran 18 innings, and Clemens picked up the win.
After the NLCS victory, Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the 2005 World Series. The Astros went on to lose all four games of the franchise's first World Series to the Chicago White Sox. A hamstring pull had hampered Clemens' performance since at least September.[tpl]cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|title=Clemens' hamstring may put strain on staff|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-23/sports/0510230351_1_pitch-strain-hamstring|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 23, 2005[/tpl]
The Astros declined arbitration to Clemens on December 7, [tpl]mlby|2005[/tpl], which prevented them from re-signing him before May 1, [tpl]mlby|2006[/tpl]. The Astros, Rangers, Red Sox, and Yankees expressed an interest in signing him, but Clemens implied that he was finally retiring after his Team USA was eliminated by Mexico in the second round from the 2006 World Baseball Classic on March 16, 2006. However, there was no formal retirement announcement.
On May 31, 2006, following another extended period of speculation, it was announced that Clemens was coming out of retirement for the third time to pitch for the Astros for the remainder of the 2006 season. Clemens signed a contract worth $22,000,022 (his uniform number is #22), which would have been the highest one-year deal in MLB history. But since Clemens did not play a full season, he received a prorated percentage of that: approximately $12.25 million. Clemens made his return on June 22, 2006, against the Minnesota Twins, losing to their rookie phenom, Francisco Liriano, 4–2. For the second year in a row, his win total did not match his performance, as he finished the season with a 7–6 record, a 2.30 ERA, and a 1.04 WHIP. However, Clemens averaged just under 6 innings in his starts and never pitched into the eighth.

===Second stint with the New York Yankees (2007)===

Following what was becoming familiar annual speculation, Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, [tpl]mlby|2007[/tpl], during the seventh-inning stretch in a game against the Seattle Mariners, and made a brief statement: "Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you its a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon." It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster,Associated Press, "Roger Clemens Is Returning to the Yankees", NYTimes.com, May 6, 2007. agreeing to a pro-rated one-year deal worth $28,000,022, or about $4.7 million per month.[tpl]cite web|last=Olney|first=Buster|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2887224|title=If inclined, Yankees would need Rocket's OK on trade|publisher=ESPN The Magazine|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2007-05-30[/tpl] Over the contract life, he would make $18.7 million.  This equated to just over $1 million per start that season.
Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates with six innings of 3-run, 5-hit, 2-walk, 7-strikeout pitching. On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history.[tpl]Cite news|last=Kepner|first=Tyler|title=Yanks Let Winning Feeling Slip Away|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/sports/baseball/25yankees.html?_r=1&ref=sports&oref=slogin[/tpl]
On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens' manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008.
After reaggravating a hamstring injury during Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS, Clemens was removed from the team's starting rotation. He was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. With his last pitch, he struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians.[tpl]Cite news|last=Bastian|first=Jordan|title=Clemens off Yanks' Postseason Roster|newspaper=MLB.com|year=2007|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071008&content_id=2257302&vkey=ps2007news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb[/tpl] Clemens had finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6–6 and a 4.18 ERA.  His final regular season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed 2 hits and 1 unearned run in 6 innings, and received a no-decision.

==Postseason performance==

In the 1986 American League Championship Series, Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3–0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The 1986 ALCS clincher was Clemens' first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later.
After a bad start in Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, Clemens returned to the mound for Game 6, which would have clinched the World Series for the Boston Red Sox. Clemens left the game after 7 innings leading 3–2, but the Red Sox infamously went on to lose the game in the 10th inning, and subsequently, the championship. Clemens' departure was highly debated and remains a bone of contention among the participants. Red Sox manager John McNamara claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that.Nocera, Joseph, "Roger Clemens, Choke Artist", Slate.com, October 10, 2000.
Clemens most explosive postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, when he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, putting a dismal stamp on an A's sweep. He was suspended for the first five games of the [tpl]Baseball Year|1991[/tpl] season and fined $10,000. Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept. Clemens' overall postseason record with Boston was 1–2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings.
After surrendering the New York Yankees' only loss in the 1999 playoffs in a much-hyped contest with Red Sox ace Pedro Martínez, Clemens began improving his postseason numbers. His 3–0 record in the World Series includes a performance with New York down 2–0 in the 2001 series;Buscema, Dave, "Rocket's long, magic journey", Times Herald-Record (Middletown, Orange County, New York), October 23, 2003. then, in Game 7, it was Clemens who matched Curt Schilling; his start (6 innings, 1 run, 10 strikeouts) was forgotten in the wake of the Diamondbacks' famous ninth-inning comeback. In 2000, after losing two division series games to Oakland, Clemens pitched his most spectacular game as a Yankee in the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners: a complete game one-hit shutout with an ALCS-record 15 strikeouts. Clemens' overall postseason record with the Yankees has been 7–4 with a 2.97 ERA, and 98 strikeouts and 35 walks in 102 innings. In the World Series Clemens became the first (and only pitcher) to pitch against the Mets in a World Series while with both the Red Sox and the Yankees, having been with the Red Sox in [tpl]wsy|1986[/tpl].
For the Astros, Clemens was the losing pitcher in game 7 of the 2004 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing 4 runs in 6 innings of work although he pitched well, he tired in the sixth inning surrendering all four runs. Clemens' 2005 postseason was marked by highs and lows. In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, he made a dramatic emergency relief appearance, entering as a pinch-hitter (the first pinch-hitting appearance of his career), then pitching the 16th through 18th innings and collecting the series-ending win. However, during the World Series, a hamstring pull ended Clemens' start after two innings, as his hometown team lost to the eventual World Champion Chicago White Sox, 5–3. It was Clemens' only World Series appearance for the Astros.Associated Press, "Crede keys Chicago win with bat, glove", ESPN.com, October 22, 2005 Clemens' overall postseason record with Houston was 4–2 with a 4.60 ERA, and 29 strikeouts and 15 walks in 41 innings.
Clemens' total postseason record is 12–8 in 34 starts, with a 3.75 ERA with a record 173 strikeouts in 199 innings pitched. His World Series record is 3–0 in 8 starts, with an ERA of 2.37.

==Independent League comeback==

On August 20, 2012, it was announced that Clemens would sign with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.Roger Clemens to sign with the Sugar Land Skeeters He pitched for the first time for the Skeeters on August 25, 2012 in front of a crowd of 7,724.

He faced the Bridgeport Bluefish and struck out two, including former major leaguer Joey Gathright to start the game, and allowed one hit without a walk and threw 37 pitches.Roger Clemens shines in return In his second start for the Skeeters, on September 7, he pitched 4[tpl]fraction|2|3[/tpl] scoreless innings, with his son, Koby, as his catcher.Roger Clemens solid in outing

==Pitching style==

Clemens for all of his career was a prototypical power pitcher with an aggressive edge. This was especially the case when he was a young man, when Clemens "threw two pitches: a 98-mph fastball and a hard breaking ball. At 23, Clemens simply reared back and threw the ball past batters."[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-10-16/sports/9910160169_1_clemens-and-martinez-roger-clemens-mvp-voting|title=Roger Clemens In 1986 And Pedro Martinez In 1999 Owned American League Hitters With Striking Ease|last=Doyle|first=Peter|date=October 16, 1999|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] Later in his career, Clemens developed a devastating split-finger fastball to use as an off-speed pitch in concert with his fastball.[tpl]cite web|url=http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/columns/candiotti_tom/1394841.html|title=Fastball, splitter key to Clemens' success|last=Candiotti|first=Tom|date=June 14, 2002|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] Clemens has jocularly referred to this pitch as "Mr. Splitty."[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2001-10-21/sports/0110212675_1_signature-postseason-babe-ruth-paul-o-neill|title=Clemens Better, Ready To Pitch - Hartford Courant|last=Amore|first=Dom|date=October 21, 2001|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=1558838|title=Seven years ago, Sox saw different Clemens|last=McAdam|first=Sean|date=May 25, 2003|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl]
By the time Clemens retired from Major League Baseball in 2007, his four-seam fastball had settled in the 91–94 mph range.

==Controversy==

Clemens has been the focal point of several controversies. His reputation has always been that of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in [tpl]mlby|1995[/tpl], but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. Still, Clemens' reputation precedes him. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate Alex Rodriguez and then argued with him, Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella called Clemens a "headhunter."[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/2000/world_series/news/2000/10/22/mets_yankees_game2_ap/|work=CNN|accessdate=April 10, 2010|title=Clemens dominates Mets; Yankees take 2–0 series lead[/tpl] His beaning earlier that year of Mike Piazza, followed by the notorious broken-bat incident in the 2000 World Series, cemented Clemens' surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many detractors. In 2009, former manager Cito Gaston publicly denounced Clemens as a "double-talker" and "a complete asshole".[tpl]cite news|title=Clemens lambasted by Blue Jays' Gaston|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2009-04-02|accessdate=2011-06-11|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/04/02/sp-bluejays-clemens-gaston.html[/tpl] Clemens was ranked 9th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HBP_p_career.shtml|title=Career Leaders & Records for Hit Batsmen –|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl]

Clemens has received criticism for receiving special treatment from the teams that sign him. While playing for Houston, Clemens was not obliged to travel with the team on road trips if he was not pitching. His 2007 contract with the New York Yankees had a "family plan" clause that stipulated that he not be required to go on road trips in which he was not scheduled to pitch and allowed him to leave the team between starts to be with his family. These perks were publicly criticized by Yankee reliever Kyle Farnsworth.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2007/05/18/2007-05-18_kyle_rocket_perks_bogus-1.html|title= Kyle: Rocket perks bogus|first=Mark|last=Feinsand|date=2007-05-18|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=2007-06-07[/tpl] Most of Clemens' teammates, however, did not complain of such perks because of Clemens' success on the mound and valuable presence in the clubhouse. Yankee teammate Jason Giambi spoke for such players when he said, "I'd carry his bags for him, just as long as he is on the mound."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/sports/baseball/07clemens.html|work=The New York Times|title=Clemens Returns, and So Does Hope for Yankees|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl]
Clemens would also find himself the point of minor controversy when it was revealed in the book The Yankee Years by Joe Torre and Tom Verducci that Clemens' bizarre pre-game ritual included soaking in extremely hot water then having the hottest possible muscle liniment applied to his genitals during his rub-down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5142053/roger-clemens-will-be-ready-to-pitchright-after-his-sadomasochistic-rubdown|title= Roger Clemens Will Be Ready To Pitch...Right After His Sadomasochistic Rubdown|author=DAULERIO|date=2009-01-29|publisher=Deadspin.com|accessdate=2009-01-29[/tpl]

In José Canseco's book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, Canseco suggested that Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and suggested that he used steroids, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox. While not addressing the allegations directly, Clemens stated: "I could care less about the rules" and "I've talked to some friends of his and I've teased them that when you're under house arrest and have ankle bracelets on, you have a lot of time to write a book."

Clemens faced steroid scrutiny when it was reported that pitcher Jason Grimsley had named him, as well as Andy Pettitte, as a user of performance enhancing drugs. According to a 20-page search warrant affidavit signed by IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky, Grimsley told investigators he obtained amphetamines, anabolic steroids and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee. McNamee was a personal strength coach for Clemens and Pettitte, hired by Clemens in 1998.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2006/10/01/clemens_named_in_affidavit/|title=Clemens named in affidavit|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2007-06-11|first1=Lance|last1=Pugmire|first2=Tim|last2=Brown[/tpl] At the time of the Grimsley revelations, McNamee denied knowledge of steroid use by Clemens and Pettitte.The sixth man ESPN.com, Nov. 14, 2006 Despite initial media reports, the affidavit made no mention of Clemens or Pettitte.Contrary to report, Clemens, Pettitte not named in Grimsley affidavit ESPN.com, Nov. 14, 2006

Clemens' attorney Rusty Hardin denied the claims, calling McNamee "a troubled and unreliable witness" who has changed his story five times in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution. He noted that Clemens has never tested positive in a steroid test.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071213&content_id=2325308&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Clemens denies claims in Mitchell Report|publisher=Mlb.com|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2007-12-13[/tpl] Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who prepared the report, stated that he relayed the allegations to each athlete implicated in the report and gave them a chance to respond before his findings were published.
On January 6, 2008, Clemens appeared on 60 Minutes to address the allegations. He told Mike Wallace that his longevity in baseball was due to "hard work" rather than illegal substances and denied all of McNamee's assertions that he injected Clemens with steroids, saying that they "never happened".Clemens Vehemently Denies Steroid Use CBSNews.com, Jan. 6, 2008  On January 7, Clemens filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee, claiming that the former trainer lied after being threatened with prosecution.[tpl]cite news|title=Clemens Files Suit Against Ex-Trainer|first=Duff|last=Wilson|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/sports/baseball/08clemens.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 January 2007|accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl] McNamee's attorneys argued that McNamee was compelled to cooperate by federal officials and thus his statements were protected. A federal judge agreed, throwing out all claims related to McNamee's statements to investigators on February 13, 2009 but allowing the case to proceed on statements McNamee made about Clemens to Pettitte.
On February 13, 2008, Clemens appeared before a Congressional committee, along with Brian McNamee, and swore under oath that he did not take steroids; that he did not discuss HGH with McNamee; that he was not at a party at José Canseco's where steroids were the topic of conversation; that he was only injected with B-12 and lidocaine; and that he never told Pettitte that he had taken HGH. This last point was in contradiction to testimony Pettite had given under oath on February 4, 2008, wherein Pettitte said he repeated to McNamee a conversation Pettitte had with Clemens. During this conversation, Pettitte said Clemens had told him that McNamee had injected Clemens with human growth hormone.

==Other media==

Clemens has appeared as himself in several movies and television episodes. Perhaps best known was his appearance in the season three episode of The Simpsons ("Homer at the Bat") where he is hypnotized into thinking he is a chicken (he did his own clucking). Clemens has also made guest appearances as himself on the TV shows Hope and Faith, Spin City, Arli$$, and Saturday Night Live as well as in the movies Kingpin, and Anger Management.[tpl]IMDb name|0166048[/tpl]

Since 2005, Clemens has also appeared in many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain H-E-B. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of MythBusters ("Baseball Myths"). He has also starred in a recent commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement. He was calling his wife, Debra Godfrey, and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.
He released an early autobiography, Rocket Man: The Roger Clemens Story written with Peter Gammons, in 1987. Clemens is also the spokesperson for Champion car dealerships in South Texas.  In April 2009, Clemens was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Jeff Pearlman, titled The Rocket that Fell to Earth-Roger Clemens and the Rage for Baseball Immortaility, that focused on his childhood and early career and accused Mike Piazza of using steroids. On May 12, Clemens broke a long silence to denounce a heavily-researched expose by four  investigative reporters from the New York Daily News, called American Icon: The Fall of Roger Clemens and the Rise of Steroids in America's Pastime Clemens went on ESPN's Mike and Mike show to call the book "garbage", but a review by Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called the book "gripping" and compared it to the work of Bob Woodward.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/books/12kaku.html|newspaper=The New York Times|title=How a Man Who Threw Heat Was Consumed by His Own Fire|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=May 12, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl]

==Awards and recognition==

In [tpl]Baseball Year|1999[/tpl], while many of his performances and milestones were yet to come, he ranked number 53 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected by the fans to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In [tpl]Baseball Year|2005[/tpl], the updated Sporting News list moved Clemens up to #15.
By the end of the 2005 season, Clemens had won seven Cy Young Awards (he won the AL award in 1986, [tpl]Baseball Year|1987[/tpl], [tpl]Baseball Year|1991[/tpl], [tpl]Baseball Year|1997[/tpl], [tpl]Baseball Year|1998[/tpl], and [tpl]Baseball Year|2001[/tpl], and the National League award in [tpl]Baseball Year|2004[/tpl]), an MVP and two pitching triple crowns. With his 2004 win, he joined Gaylord Perry, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martínez as the only pitchers to win it in both leagues and became the oldest pitcher to ever win the Cy Young. He has also won The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award five times, was named an All-Star 11 times, and won the All-Star MVP in 1986.
In October 2006, Clemens was named to Sports Illustrated's "all-time" team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballist.com/lists/sialltimeteam06.php|title=Sports Illustrated's All-Time Team, 10/2006|accessdate=2007-06-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071009145532/http://www.baseballist.com/lists/sialltimeteam06.php|archivedate=October 9, 2007[/tpl]
On August 18, 2007, Clemens got his 1,000th strikeout as a Yankee. He is only the ninth player in major league history to record 1,000 or more strikeouts with two different teams. Clemens has recorded a total of 2,590 strikeouts as a member of the Red Sox and 1,014 strikeouts as a Yankee. Of his nearly quarter century in the Major Leagues, 13 years have been spent with the Red Sox and 6 with the New York Yankees.
In January 2013, in his first year of eligibility, Clemens received only 37.6% of the votes cast and was denied entry into the Hall of Fame, falling short of the 75% required for induction. With the inductions of Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine the following year, Clemens is currently the only eligible member of the 300 win club (Randy Johnson has not been retired for a minimum five years and is thus ineligible) to not be inducted into the Hall.

==Personal==

Clemens married Debra Lynn Godfrey (born May 27, 1963) on November 24, 1984. They have four sons: Koby Aaron, Kory Allen, Kacy Austin, and Kody Alec—all given "K" names to honor Clemens's strikeouts ("K's"). Koby was recently released by the Toronto Blue Jays organization.
Debra once left a Red Sox game, when Clemens pitched for another team, in tears from the heckling she received. This is documented in an updated later edition to Dan Shaughnessy's best-selling book, Curse of the Bambino. Debra also was quoted in the book as stating that it was the poor attitude of Red Sox fans that prevented the team from ever winning the World Series (this was quoted prior to the Red Sox' 2004 World Series victory). 
Clemens is a member of the Republican Party and donated money to Texas congressman Ted Poe during his 2006 campaign.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/03/30/cq_2496.html|work=The New York Times|title=Some Big Names in Lineup of Baseballers Who Pitch Campaign Cash|first1=Greg|last1=Giroux|first2=Congressional|last2=Quarterly|date=March 30, 2007[/tpl]  
Debra posed in a bikini with her husband for a Sports Illustrated pictorial regarding athletes and their wives. This appeared in the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition for 2003. Roger wore his Yankees uniform, with the jersey open.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.debbieclemens.com/|title=Debbie Clemens – Official Website|publisher=Debbieclemens.com|accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] 
On February 27, 2006, to train for the World Baseball Classic, Roger pitched in an exhibition game between the Astros and his son's minor league team. In his first at-bat, Koby hit a home run off his father. In his next at-bat, Roger threw an inside pitch that almost hit Koby. Koby laughed in an interview after the game about the incident.
