[[Observer (quantum physics)]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Quantum mechanics

In quantum mechanics, "observation" is synonymous with quantum measurement and "observer" with a measurement apparatus and observable with what can be measured. Thus the quantum mechanical observer does not
necessarily present or solve any problems over and above the (admittedly difficult) issue of measurement in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of observer effect.
A number of interpretations of quantum mechanics, notably "consciousness causes collapse",  give the observer a special role, or place
constraints on who or what can be an observer. For instance, Fritjof Capra writes:
  
 "The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the human observer is not
only necessary to observe the properties of an object, but is necessary
even to define these properties. ... This can be illustrated with the
simple case of a subatomic particle. When observing such a particle, one
may choose to measure — among other quantities — the particle's
position and its momentum" Fritjof Capra. The Tao  of Physics, p. 127

However, other authorities downplay any special role of human observers
 
     "Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective 
    features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of 
    registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an 
    apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual,"
