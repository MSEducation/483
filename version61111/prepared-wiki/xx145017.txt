[[Sri Rampai LRT Station]]

CATEGORIES: Kelana Jaya Line

Sri Rampai LRT station is a rapid transit station in northern Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, forming part of the Kelana Jaya Line (formerly known as PUTRA). The station, named after the nearby Taman Sri Rampai housing estate to the west, is located along the border between Taman Sri Rampai and Wangsa Maju to the east.

==History==

While construction of the station started along with the rest of the line in 1996, it was halted in 1997 due to low population in the surrounding area and the cancellation of a housing project nearby.http://www.myrapid.com.my/news-events/media-releases/2010/sri-rampai-station-be-opened-friday  While the rest of the line opened in 1999 with Sri Rampai station listed on transit maps, the station remained closed and all trains were programmed to simply pass through.
On the evening of August 25, 2006, the station's tracks were inundated by water from a flash flood, disrupting services along the entire Kelana Jaya Line for several hours and causing major passenger congestion between the KLCC station and the Kuala Lumpur Sentral station. Services were gradually restored by 8:30 pm (MST).[tpl]cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/26/nation/15252390&sec=nation |title= LRT services disrupted by flooding at new station |accessdate=2007-05-17 |author=Dharmender Singh|date=2006-08-26 |publisher=The Star Online [/tpl]
On 24 December 2010, the station was finally opened to public and began revenue service, likely as a response to new property developments in the area, including Wangsa Walk Mall and a local AEON BiG (formerly known as "Carrefour") supermarket. 

==Design==

The station is a two-level at-grade station, with the platform areas (containing two side platforms) constructed below the surface, while the rest of the structure is located above on the surface. The station is the only kind along the line to be at-grade, compared to other stations' elevated or underground design.
