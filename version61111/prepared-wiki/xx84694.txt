The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly shortened to Ensign [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|s|aɪ|n[/tpl], is an official periodical of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  The magazine was first issued in January 1971 along with the correlated New Era (for youth) and the Friend (for children), all of which replaced the older church publications Improvement Era, Relief Society Magazine, The Instructor, and the Millennial Star. Unlike some of its predecessors, the Ensign contains no advertisements.
As an official church publication, the Ensign contains faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, sermons, and often apostolic scholarship. 

Semiannually, the Ensign gives a full report of the proceedings of the annual and semi-annual general conferences of the church. These issues contain the full sermons and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the highest officers of the LDS Church, referred to as the general authorities.
The full text and page layout of every issue of the magazine is available on the church's web site. Each issue since January 2001 is also available in PDF format.
