Several species (H. nestianus, sainzelli, crenatidens, nihowanensis, ultimum)  are recognized from Eurasia, which differ mainly in the shape of the canines and in body size. But given the fluctuation range of the size of modern large cats, it is highly probable that all belong to one species, Homotherium latidens.
Two species described form the early Pleistocene of Africa are Homotherium ethiopicum and Homotherium hadarensis. But they also hardly differ from the Eurasian forms. On the African continent the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago. In North America, a very similar species, Homotherium serum occurred from the late Pliocene until the late Pleistocene. Remains have been found at various sites between Alaska and Texas. In the southern parts of its range the American Homotherium co-existed with Smilodon; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat. The American Homotherium was originally described by the name Dinobastis.
Despite Homotherium's vast range and the large amount of fossil remains from Eurasia, Africa and North America, complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare.  One of the most famous sites of Homotherium remains is Friesenhahn cave in Texas, where 30 Homotherium skeletons were found, along with hundreds of juvenile mammoths and several dire wolves.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rawn-Schatzinger|first=V.|year=1992|title=The scimitar cat Homotherium serum (Cope)|publisher=Illinois State Museum|journal=Report of Investigations|issue=47|pages=pp. 1–80[/tpl]

==Diet and habitat==

Besides mammoths, very few other potential prey species were found in Friesenhahn caves - it is therefore unlikely that Homotherium carried scavenged carcasses of already dead animals to the cave. Such specialization on prey of a particular species and age structure is not covenant with a scavenging lifestyle.  For the same reason it is also unlikely that the dire wolves carried the mammoths into the cave.
The worldwide association of Homotherium species with proboscidean (elephant and mastodon) and rhinoceros remains, mainly those of juveniles, suggests that Homotherium preyed selectively on these tough-skinned animals and probably hunted in packs, carrying away the large animals it brought down. The decline of Homotherium could be a result of the disappearance of large herbivorous mammals like mammoths in America at the end of the Pleistocene. In North America fossil remains of Homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary Smilodon. For the most part it probably inhabited higher latitudes and altitudes and therefore was likely to be well adapted to the colder conditions of the mammoth steppe environment.
The suggested large prey species make it probable that Homotherium hunted in packs. Reduced claws, relatively slender limbs and the sloping back indicate adaptations for endurance running in open habitats.M.
