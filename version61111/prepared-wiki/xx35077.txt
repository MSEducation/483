Horse Cave is a 4th-class city in Hart County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 2,252 at the 2000 U.S. census.

==History==

The town was settled by Maj. Albert Anderson in the 1840s. The landowner donated land for an L&N station in 1858 on the provision that it be named after nearby Horse Cave.The Kentucky Encyclopedia, pp. 442. "Horse Cave". University Press of Kentucky (Lexington), 1992. Accessed 30 Jul 2013. The community around the station developed quickly, so that a post office was erected in 1860[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3Lac2FUSj_oC&pg=PA144 | title=Kentucky Place Names | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | year=1987 | accessdate=28 Apr 2013 | author=Rennick, Robert M. | pages=144–145[/tpl] and the city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1864.Commonwealth of Kentucky.

The cave for which the city is named is located on the south side of Main Street. Various explanations are given for its unusual name. One is that Native Americans[tpl]which|date=July 2013[/tpl] or outlaws hid horses in the cave; another is that an early carriage may have lost a horse when it fell into the opening by accident; a third reason involves the 19th-century use of "horse" as slang for anything big or huge, related to a similar use of the Swedish hoss. The cave has also been known as Hidden River Cave, for an underground stream located inside. That stream was used to power a dynamo and, for a while in the late 19th century, Horse Cave was the only city in Kentucky apart from Louisville and Ashland to have electric lights.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Around World War I, the only air-conditioned tennis courts in the world were located near the entrance of the cave.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The stream also provided the town's water supply but mistaken development caused raw sewage to seep into the water and forced the closure of the cave for fifty years. The stench was so bad in the 1960s that pedestrians typically crossed to the other side of Main Street rather than walk near the entrance and birds would sometimes fall from the sky. The problem has been largely solved in recent years.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The town changed its name to Caverna in 1869 but the inability to change the name of the railroad station prompted the community to reconsider and restore the name Horse Cave in 1879. Owing to its early rail connection, Horse Cave was a major center of agricultural commerce for Hart, Metcalfe, Green, and Barren counties since the 1870s. Tobacco warehouses provided the majority of the income.
Since the 1970s, some factories have relocated to the area. Tourist attractions include the Kentucky Repertory Theatre, Kentucky Down Under/Kentucky Caverns, Hidden River Cave/American Cave Museum, and the nearby Mammoth Cave National Park. Civil War Days are an annual tourist event, during which time parades down Main Street and reenactments of a Civil War battle at Rowlett's Station between Horse Cave and Munfordville are staged.
Horse Cave was the birthplace of Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893), the father of noted author and journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and former NBA player Clarence Glover.
