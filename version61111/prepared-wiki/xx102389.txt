[[Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance]]

CATEGORIES: 1988 debut albums, TISM albums

Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance is the debut album by the Australian band TISM. The album title was suggested by Sean Kelly's good friend, the well-known Australian philosopher Michaelis Michael. Originally released on vinyl as a double album, it was later re-issued as a single compact disc.  The vinyl release has a different vocal mix on the track Saturday Night Palsy, including an alternate line of lyrics, with the vinyl release's line "I want to shoot heroin through the eye" replaced with the line "I want to shove a red-hot poker through the eye" on the CD.
The album reached #48 on the ARIA Charts in October 1988.
