===Career===

He took on a professorship at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin (then Lawrence College), where he published The Theory of Political Coalitions (1962). In 1962, he became the chair of the Political Science Department at the University of Rochester, where he remained chair until 1977, and remained active until his death.
He founded the now-mainstream field of positive political theory, which introduced game theory and the axiomatic method of social choice theory to political science.[tpl]Cite book |author=Eamonn Butler |title=Public Choice--A Primer |location=London |publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs |year=2012 |page=36 |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/IEA%20Public%20Choice%20web%20complete%2029.1.12.pdf |type=PDF[/tpl] Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Kenneth Shepsle in their memoir write that "These have proved crucial to predictive tests for political theory."[tpl]Cite web |title=William Harrison Riker |last1=Bueno de Mesquita |first1=Bruce |authorlink1=Bruce Bueno de Mesquita |last2=Shepsle |first2=Kenneth |series=Biographical Memoirs |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/wriker.html |accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]
Among other contributions, he is known for work on the theory and history of federalism and on something he called "heresthetics"—the art politicians use when they change political outcomes without changing peoples' underlying preferences, for example by manipulating the order in which decisions are made.
Concerning political coalition for the benefit of minorities, he argued that the larger the coalition, the shorter-lived it is.Eamonn Butler, Public Choice: A Primer, London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2012, p. 63
The William H. Riker Prize for excellence in undergraduate teaching is awarded by the University of Rochester bi-annually in his honor. The Political Economy section of the American Political Science Association awards an annual book prize in his name as well.
