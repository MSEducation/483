[[Delaware Punch]]

CATEGORIES: Coca-Cola brands, Cuisine of New Orleans, Louisiana

Delaware Punch is a fruit-flavored soft drink. Its formula uses a blend of fruit flavors, with grape being the most prominent. It is not carbonated and caffeine-free.
Delaware Punch was created by Thomas E. Lyons in 1913. The brand is currently owned by The Coca-Cola Company.
The beverage is difficult to find, but is still sold in some grocery stores in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, and some restaurants in Houston. Delaware Punch can also be found for sale on eBay.  Delaware Punch concentrate can be purchased from several online soft drink retailers. The bottled form is sold in Guatemala and Mexico, but is currently banned in much of  the United States due to a coloring agent, allura red, used [tpl]fact|date=June 2012[/tpl]. Delaware Punch was commonly sold at the New Orleans drug store chain K&B, before it was bought by Rite Aid in 1997.
Delaware Punch is named for the Delaware grape cultivar from which its flavor is derived.  The grape was first grown in Delaware County, Ohio, and the drink therefore has no affiliation with the state of Delaware.
