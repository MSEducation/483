In 2010, De Carvalho joined Lokomotiv Plovdiv as a replacement for Garra Dembele, who had just been sold to Levski Sofia. In six months there, he scored 7 goals in 13 matches.[tpl]cite web|publisher=soccerway.com|title=Basile de Carvalho player profile|url=http://uk.soccerway.com/players/basile-de-carvalho/37725/|accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl] In January 2011, De Carvalho was close to being transferred to Levski Sofia, but the deal eventually fell through, purportedly due to his chronic shoulder problems.[tpl]cite web|publisher=btv.bg|title=Левски се отказа от трансфера на Базил Де Карвальо|url=http://www.btv.bg/sport/bulgarian-football/story/1921027479-Levski_se_otkaza_ot_transfera_na_Bazil_De_Karvalyo.html|accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl] He continued to be a regular starter for Lokomotiv, when physically fit, during the 2011–12 season. On 15 March 2012, De Carvalho was sent off after an altercation with Hristo Yovov in the quarter-final of the Bulgarian Cup, which his team eventually won 2–1 after extra time.[tpl]cite web|publisher=topmatch.bg|title=Драма в Пловдив: Локо е на полуфинал след продължения|url=http://topmatch.bg/article-7253-na-zhivo-lokomotiv-plovdiv-levski|accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl]

===Levski Sofia===

On 12 June 2012, De Carvalho signed with Levski Sofia on a two-year deal. He made his competitive debut on 19 July, in a 1–0 home win over FK Sarajevo in a UEFA Europa League match, and scored his first goal (converting a penalty kick) in the return leg against the same opponent, which was lost by a score of 1–3.
On 28 November, Basile netted his first A Group hat-trick in a 7–1 home win against Etar 1924, scoring four goals. He became the first foreigner to score four goals in a one match for Levski.[tpl]cite web|publisher=gong.bg|title=Базил влезе в историята на "Левски", стана първият чужденец с 4 гола в мач|url=http://www.gong.bg/view_article.php?article_id=313135|accessdate=28 November 2012|language=Bulgarian[/tpl] He finished the 2012-13 A Group season as the top goalscorer in the league, having found the net 19 times in total.
