Matthew and Grace had adopted all three of their children from Africa. In all of the adoptions, the Huangs used a respected adoption agency and obtained all the proper visas from the State Department. The Huangs’ middle child was Gloria, whom they adopted from an orphanage in Ghana when she was 4 years old in 2009 and who had chronic eating disorders according to the parents.

==Gloria Huang==

In Ghana, Gloria was born into extreme poverty and grew up in impoverished conditions up through her time in an orphanage. "The Huangs describe her eating issues as a sporadic behavioral problem that resulted in Gloria sometimes going days where she refused to eat. She would then follow such fasting with unhealthy binge eating and attempts to find food from bizarre sources, such as in the trash or from neighbors. The Huangs were aware of their daughter’s eating issues, had educated themselves about the best way to handle those issues, and were attempting to manage the situation and help her grow out of it." Matthew and Grace Huang say that Gloria had eating disorders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/family-names-employer-us-couple-held-qatar |title=Family names employer of US couple held in Qatar |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]

==Case==

===Police investigation===

According to the "California Innocence Project" the report filed by the police in the investigation of noted that the children were not “good-looking” and did not share the “hereditary traits” as those of their parents. The CIP reports that investigations also theorize that Matthew and Grace “bought” their children in order to harvest their organs, or perhaps to perform medical experiments on them, allegation arising from the testimony of unnamed sources who claim that family kept to themselves and did not socialize
However, friends of the family in Qatar have come forward to praise Matthew and Grace’s parenting skills and the way they care for and love their children. One family was even at the Huang's home the night before Gloria's death, where they say that they witnesses Gloria walking around and sitting with the family.[tpl]cite web|title=Free Matt And Grace|url=http://freemattandgrace.com/about/|publisher=Freemattandgrace.com|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl]

===Forensic evidence===

While the death certificate indicates that the causes of death as "cachexia and dehydration," an independent review performed by a highly regarded pediatric forensice pathologist questions the determination. The formal definition of cachexia is the loss of body mass that cannot be reversed nutritionally. Cachexia can produce symptoms such as weight loss and muscle atrophy, which often looks similar to starvation, and can be caused by a range of conditions, including congestive heart failure and autoimmune diseases. These causes were not screened in the report by the medical examiner in Doha.
One theory of Gloria's death was that she was starved. However, Gloria was witnessed walking around her home the day before she died by a visiting family. Her brothers recounted to the police how they had played with her and that she had appeared normal in the days before she died. While a child can go a few days without eating without risk of starvation, a child would not have the physical strength to walk one day before death due to starvation.
As noted in the report by the Qatari medical examiner, Dr. Anis Mahmoud Khalifa, Gloria also lacked other physical hallmarks of a child who was starved to death or abused.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/30/U-S-couple-charged-in-Qatar-with-murder-of-their-8-year-old-daughter.html |title=U.S. couple charged in Qatar with murder of 8-year-old daughter - Alarabiya.net English | Front Page |publisher=Alarabiya.net English |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]
There were also several other considerations regarding Gloria's medical history that were not addressed by the medical examiner. Gloria suffered from giardia when she was adopted, an infection which is difficult to completely eliminate. She also had recent blood tests showing severely low levels of a certain type of leukocytes that may have been a sign of an underlying bone marrow condition. In addition, Gloria had a vitamin D deficiency.[tpl]cite news|last=Flaccus|first=Gillian|title=Calif couple charged in Qatar for daughter's death|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/calif-couple-charged-qatar-daughters-death|work=Associated Press|accessdate=6 August 2013[/tpl]
The medical examiner's report also made no mention of testing the vitreous humour, the clear gel inside the eyes, which is a standard way to diagnose dehydration. Gloria's bodily fluids were tested only for drugs, poison and semen, and all tests were negative.
Due to the non-conclusive results of the autopsy, the cause of death for Gloria was never established by the prosecution. Despite lacking this essential evidence for pursuing murder charges, the prosecutor insists that the parents intentionally harmed their daughter.

===Trial===

In the court hearing of June 18, 2013, several witnesses testified for the prosecution. A police detective from the criminal investigation department said that according to information gathered from “intelligence sources we knew that the defendant once has taken away a candy off the girl’s hand, and grounded her for eating it.”
Pertaining to the issue of adoption, detective Ahmad Issac Hamoudah Abu Zoro told the court, “As you are aware, the deceased child has black complexion, very skinny while her parents are white. Parents who wish to adopt children should be selective so that their kids are supposed to be beautiful.” Adoption outside of biological families does not occur in Qatar or in other Gulf Arab societies.
The California Innocence Project claims that Qatari police records stated that it was odd that the Asian Huangs adopted black children who were not “good looking” and who didn’t share their “hereditary traits.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://californiainnocenceproject.org/read-their-stories/grace-matthew-huang |title=Grace & Matthew Huang |publisher=Californiainnocenceproject.org |date=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]
In addition, Dr. Anis Mahmoud Khalifa, the medical examiner who conducted Gloria's autopsy, openly told the court, “I never mentioned in my report or statements the word “starvation” but rather emaciation,” contradicting the prosecution's basis for charging her parents with starving Gloria to death.[tpl]cite news|last=Ajbaili|first=Mustapha|title=U.S. couple charged in Qatar with murder of 8-year-old daughter|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/30/U-S-couple-charged-in-Qatar-with-murder-of-their-8-year-old-daughter.html|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=30 August 2013[/tpl]
The request to drop the charges against the American couple were rejected and bail was declined.
On Tuesday, October 1, 2013, Judge Abdullah Al-Emady ordered the Huangs to remain imprisoned until at least their next hearing, which is scheduled for November 6, 2013.[tpl]cite news|author= |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/10/01/qatar-americans-death/2904841/ |title=American couple remains jailed in Qatar over daughter's death |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= 2013-10-01|accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/466453 |title=US couple remains jailed in Qatar over daughter’s death | Arab News — Saudi Arabia News, Middle East News, Opinion, Economy and more |publisher=Arabnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl] Officials raised questions about the Huangs paying adoption fees to an adoption agency. After Tuesday's hearing, Matthew proclaimed his innocence.
On March 27, 2014, Matthew and Grace were each sentenced to three years in prison and fined 15,000 Qatari Riyals . No verdict was read by the judge. The couple was not detained, pending the appeals process, but remained restricted from leaving the country.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/us-couple-found-guilty-qatar-murder-case-2014326154016485260.html[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/qatari-court-sentences-us-couple-to-3-years-jail/2014/03/27/2ce0af36-b590-11e3-bab2-b9602293021d_story.html | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The travel ban went against the precedent set in the Villagio Mall fire, where 5 Qataris were sentenced to 6 years in prison after being convicted of murder by negligence, but were allowed to travel without restriction during appeals.http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/20/world/meast/qatar-mall-nursery-fire/ The U.S. State Department issued a statement following the judicial announcement, noting that they were "surprised and dissapointed" by the result.http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2014/03/224055.htm
Several weeks later, the defendants were notified that they had been found guilty of child endangerment, a different crime from that which they had been charged had been originally charged and tried.http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/world/middleeast/qatar-us-couple-seeks-respite.html?_r=1

===Employer pressure to return to work===

The new element is an increasingly bitter legal dispute with Matthew Huang’s American employer, MWH Global, which requested — now that he was out of prison — that Matthew return to work or forfeit further pay and benefits. In what the employer is calling a personnel issue and Matthew Huang is calling an unrealistic demand that amounts to forced dismissal, he resigned.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/world/middleeast/more-problems-for-american-couple-accused-in-qatar.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Rick | last1=Gladstone | first2=Shabina S. | last2=Khatri | title=More Problems for American Couple Accused in Qatar | date=2014-01-21[/tpl]

===Representation===

Due to the overwhelming medical evidence of Matthew and Grace Huang's innocence, they have been pro bono clients of the California Innocence Project (part of the Innocence Project based at the California Western School of Law in San Diego) since June 2013. The Huangs are also represented by Lewis and Roca.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/post/57155047453/silence-broken-on-case-of-american-couple-charged-with |title=Silence broken on case of American couple charged with murder in Qatar | Doha News |publisher=Dohanews.co |date=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]
The Huang case is being managed by the Los Angeles-based David House Agency, an international crisis resource agency that has handled other notable cases such as the case of American Hikers in Iran, Amanda Knox, and Jason Puracal.

===Petition to Qatar===

An official petition written by Grace's sister has been posted to Change.org. The petition is addressed to the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Susan L. Ziadeh, and Ambassador of the State of Qatar
Mohammed Jaham Al Kuwari. The request is for these individuals to compel the Qatar government to end the imprisonment they consider wrongful of Matthew and Grace, and allow them to be reunited with their sons in the U.S.
