Pavel Brendl (born March 23, 1981) is a Czech professional ice hockey forward who currently plays for the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in the Swiss National League A.

==Playing career==

Brendl was a highly-rated junior star with the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League, winning numerous awards and making the all-star team of the 1999 Memorial Cup. This led to him being drafted fourth overall in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. However, Brendl's talent never translated to stardom at the NHL level, where he managed only 22 points in 78 career games with the Philadelphia Flyers, Carolina Hurricanes and 2 games with the Phoenix Coyotes. He played the 2005–06 season for the Phoenix Coyotes in the NHL and the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League.
In 2006, Brendl joined the Swedish Elitserien team Mora IK for which he scored the most goals in the Elitserien during the regular season. After one season with the team he signed a three-year contract with Brynäs IF, also in Elitserien. Brynäs regards the signing of Brendl as one of the club's biggest and most spectacular signings in the recent history of the club.[tpl]cite web | title=Pavel Brendl till Brynäs | publisher=sr.se | language=Swedish | url=http://www.sr.se/dalarna/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=1310122 | date=April 13, 2007 | accessdate=April 16, 2007[/tpl] In June, 2008, Brendl signed with the Russian team Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod in the Kontinental Hockey League.[tpl]cite web | title=Pavel Brendl lämnar Brynäs | publisher=Brynäs IF | url=http://www.brynas.se/templates/BIF_NewsPage.aspx?id=6572 | accessdate=June 25, 2008 | language=Swedish[/tpl]  In the inaugural season of the KHL, Brendl led the league in scoring with 35 goals (with another Czech forward Jan Marek).
