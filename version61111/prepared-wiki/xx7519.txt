Although Malaysia is a federal state, political scientists have suggested that its "federalism is highly centralised":
[tpl]cquote2|Our federalism gives the federal government not only the most legislative and executive powers but also the most important sources of revenue. State governments are excluded from the revenues of income tax, export, import and excise duties, and they are also largely restricted from borrowing internationally. They have to depend on revenue from forests, lands, mines, petroleum, the entertainment industry, and finally, transfer payments from the central government.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=18724|title=Weakened federalism in the new federation|first=Chin Huat|last=Wong|date=25 July 2007|publisher=The Sun[/tpl][/tpl]

Race plays a large role in Malaysian politics, and many Malaysian political parties are ethnically based. The Government's New Economic Policy (NEP)[tpl]cite web|author=Jomo Kwame Sundaram, UNRISD |url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpPublications)/A20E9AD6E5BA919780256B6D0057896B?OpenDocument&panel=seriespapers |title=The New Economic Policy and Interethnic Relations in Malaysia |publisher=UNRISD |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=27 October 2010[/tpl] and the National Development Policy (NDP) which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of Bumiputera Malaysians. The policies provide preferential treatment to Malays over non-Malays in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. While improving in the economic position of Malays, it is a source of resentment amongst non-Malays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-english/news/general/4188-nem-cast-in-deviant-vision-2020-nep-moulds|title=NEM cast in deviant Vision 2020, NEP moulds|last=Fernandez|first=Joe|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] Prime Minister Dato Sri Mohd Najib Tun Razak has claimed to attempt to close racial divides through the 1Malaysia initiative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-1malaysia/|title= 1 Malaysia|last=Najib|first=Tun Razak|publisher=1Malaysia.com.my|accessdate=15 November 2010[/tpl]
The origin of race based politics can be traced back to independence of Malaysia from United Kingdom, who wanted all citizens of Malaysia to be equal upon independence, instead of dominance by Malays. This caused the political parties of the three major races at the time, the UMNO (representing Malays), the MCA (representing Chinese), and the MIC (representing Indians), to join and form the Alliance Party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/35825-was-merdeka-taken-or-was-it-given|title=THE CORRIDORS OF POWER |last=Kamarudin|first=Raja Petra|publisher=Malaysia Today|accessdate=15 November 2010[/tpl]
Students are not allowed to be involved in politics, due to the University and University College Act. A higher interest in the political process led to a slowdown in outbound corporate travel in anticipation of the general election in the first half of 2013, where many travellers postponed travel to ensure they had the chance to cast their votes.[tpl]cite web|title=Malaysians halt outbound MICE for elections|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/malaysians-halt-outbound-mice-for-elections/|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]

==Foreign relations==

Malaysia participates in international politics and engages in formal relationships with international bodies as well as with foreign states adopting various policies. Malaysia's participation in international politics also affects domestic politics for example the Israelâ€“Malaysia relations.
