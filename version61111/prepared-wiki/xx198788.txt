[[Logan's Sanctuary]]

CATEGORIES: Albums produced by Brian Reitzell, 2000 albums

Logan's Sanctuary is an electronica album by Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Brian Reitzell, conceived as the soundtrack for an imagined sequel to the film Logan's Run.
Manning's former bandmate in Jellyfish, Jason Falkner, contributed to two tracks. Also, photographs of Falkner dressed in costumes reminiscent of the film were incorporated into the CD booklet. Manning, Reitzell, and Falkner later formed the band TV Eyes, recording their first album between 2000 and 2003, although it was not released until 2006.
