Glucagon is a peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas, that raises blood glucose levels. Its effect is opposite that of insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels.[tpl]cite book | author = Reece J, Campbell N | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Biology | edition = | language = | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-8053-6624-5 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] The pancreas releases glucagon when blood sugar (glucose) levels fall too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin.  Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels at a stable level. Glucagon belongs to  a family of several other related hormones.

==Function==

Glucagon generally elevates the amount of glucose in the blood by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
Glucose is stored in the liver in the form of glycogen, which is a polymer made up of glucose molecules. Liver cells (hepatocytes) have glucagon receptors. When glucagon binds to the glucagon receptors, the liver cells convert the glycogen polymer into individual glucose molecules, and release them into the bloodstream, in a process known as glycogenolysis. As these stores become depleted, glucagon then encourages the liver and kidney to synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis. Glucagon turns off glycolysis in the liver, causing glycolytic intermediates to be shuttled to gluconeogenesis.
Glucagon also regulates the rate of glucose production through lipolysis. Glucagon has a minimal effect on lipolysis in humans.
Glucagon production appears to be dependent on the central nervous system through pathways yet to be defined. In invertebrate animals, eyestalk removal has been reported to affect glucagon production. Excising the eyestalk in young crayfish produces glucagon-induced hyperglycemia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Leinen RL, Giannini AJ | title = Effect of eyestalk removal on glucagon induced hyperglycemia in crayfish | journal = Society for Neuroscience Abstracts | year = 1983 | volume = 9 | pages = 604 [/tpl]

==Medical uses==

===Hypoglycemia===

An injectable form of glucagon is vital first aid in cases of severe hypoglycemia when the victim is unconscious or for other reasons cannot take glucose orally. The dose for an adult is typically 1 milligram, and the glucagon is given by intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, and quickly raises blood glucose levels. To use the injectable form, it must be reconstituted prior to use, a step that requires a sterile diluent to be injected into a vial containing powdered glucagon, because the hormone is highly unstable when dissolved in solution.  When dissolved in a fluid state, glucagon can form amyloid fibrils, or tightly woven chains of proteins made up of the individual glucagon peptides, and once glucagon begins to fibrilize, it becomes useless when injected, as the glucagon cannot be absorbed and used by the body.  The reconstitution process makes using glucagon cumbersome, although there are a number of products now in development from a number of companies that aim to make the product easier to use.

===Beta blocker overdose===

Anecdotal evidence suggests a benefit of higher doses of glucagon in the treatment of overdose with beta blockers; the likely mechanism of action is the increase of cAMP in the myocardium, in effect bypassing the β-adrenergic second messenger system.[tpl]cite journal | author = White CM | title = A review of potential cardiovascular uses of intravenous glucagon administration | journal = J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 442–7 |date=May 1999 |pmid = 10234590 | doi = | url =  [/tpl]

===Anaphylaxis===

Some people who have anaphylaxis and are on beta blockers are resistant to epinephrine. In this situation glucagon intravenously may be useful to treat their low blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tang AW | title = A practical guide to anaphylaxis | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 68 | issue = 7 | pages = 1325–32 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14567487 | doi = [/tpl]

===Impacted food bolus===

Glucagon relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter and may be used in those with an impacted food bolus in the esophagus ("steakhouse syndrome").[tpl]cite journal |author=Ko HH, Enns R |title=Review of food bolus management |journal=Can. J. Gastroenterol.|volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=805–8 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18925301 |pmc=2661297[/tpl] There is little evidence for glucagon's effectiveness in this condition,[tpl]cite journal |author=Arora S, Galich P |title=Myth: glucagon is an effective first-line therapy for esophageal foreign body impaction |journal=CJEM|volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=169–71 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19272219[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Leopard|first=D|coauthors=Fishpool, S; Winter, S|title=The management of oesophageal soft food bolus obstruction: a systematic review.|journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England|date=Sep 2011|volume=93|issue=6|pages=441–4|doi=10.1308/003588411X588090|pmid=21929913|pmc=3369328[/tpl] and glucagon may induce nausea and vomiting,[tpl]cite journal|last=Weant|first=KA|coauthors=Weant, MP|title=Safety and efficacy of glucagon for the relief of acute esophageal food impaction.|journal=American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|date=Apr 1, 2012|volume=69|issue=7|pages=573–7|doi=10.2146/ajhp100587|pmid=22441787[/tpl]  but considering the safety of glucagon this is still considered an acceptable option as long it does not lead to delays in arranging other treatments.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ikenberry|first=Steven O.|coauthors=Jue, Terry L.; Anderson, Michelle A.; Appalaneni, Vasundhara; Banerjee, Subhas; Ben-Menachem, Tamir; Decker, G.

==Adverse effects==

Glucagon acts very quickly; common side-effects include headache and nausea.
Drug interactions: Glucagon interacts only with oral anticoagulants, increasing the tendency to bleed.

===Contraindications===

While glucagon can be used clinically to treat various forms of hypoglycemia, it is severely contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, as the drug interaction with elevated levels of adrenaline produced by the tumor may produce an exponential increase in blood sugar levels, leading to a hyperglycemic state, which may incur a fatal elevation in blood pressure.[tpl]cite web | url =http://pi.lilly.com/us/rglucagon-pi.pdf | title =  Information for the Physician: Glucagon for Injection (rDNA origin) | format = | work = | publisher = Eli Lilly and Company | accessdate = 2011-11-19 [/tpl] Likewise, glucagon is contraindicated in patients with an insulinoma, as its use may lead to rebound hypoglycemia.

==Mechanism of action==

Glucagon binds to the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, located in the plasma membrane. The conformation change in the receptor activates G proteins, a heterotrimeric protein with α, β, and γ subunits. When the G protein interacts with the receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that results in the replacement of the GDP molecule that was bound to the α subunit with a GTP molecule. This substitution results in the releasing of the α subunit from the β and γ subunits.  The alpha subunit specifically activates the next enzyme in the cascade, adenylate cyclase.
Adenylate cyclase manufactures cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP or cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). This enzyme, in turn, activates phosphorylase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, converting into the active form called phosphorylase A. Phosphorylase A is the enzyme responsible for the release of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen polymers.
Additionally, the coordinated control of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver is adjusted by the phosphorylation state of the enzymes that catalyze the formation of a potent activator of glycolysis called fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hue L, Rider MH | title = Role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the control of glycolysis in mammalian tissues | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 245 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–24 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2822019 | pmc = 1148124 | doi = [/tpl] The enzyme protein kinase A that was stimulated by the cascade initiated by glucagon will also phosphorylate a single serine residue of the bifunctional polypeptide chain containing both the enzymes fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase and phosphofructokinase-2. This covalent phosphorylation initiated by glucagon activates the former and inhibits the latter. This regulates the reaction catalyzing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1, the enzyme that is the primary regulatory step of glycolysis)[tpl]cite journal | author = Claus TH, El-Maghrabi MR, Regen DM, Stewart HB, McGrane M, Kountz PD, Nyfeler F, Pilkis J, Pilkis SJ | title = The role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism | journal = Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 57–86 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6327193 | doi =  [/tpl] by slowing the rate of its formation, thereby inhibiting the flux of the glycolysis pathway and allowing gluconeogenesis to predominate. This process is reversible in the absence of glucagon (and thus, the presence of insulin).
Glucagon stimulation of PKA also inactivates the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase.[tpl]cite journal | author = Feliú JE, Hue L, Hers HG | title = Hormonal control of pyruvate kinase activity and of gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 73 | issue = 8 | pages = 2762–6 | year = 1976 | pmid = 183209 | pmc = 430732 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.73.8.2762[/tpl]

==Physiology==

===Production===

The hormone is synthesized and secreted from alpha cells (α-cells) of the islets of Langerhans, which are located in the endocrine portion of the pancreas. In rodents, the alpha cells are located in the outer rim of the islet. Human islet structure is much less segregated, and alpha cells are distributed throughout the islet in close proximity to beta cells.

===Regulation===

Secretion of glucagon is stimulated by:
Secretion of glucagon is inhibited by:

==Structure==

Glucagon is a 29-amino acid polypeptide. Its primary structure in humans is: NH2-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH.
The polypeptide has a molecular weight of 3485 daltons. Glucagon is a peptide (nonsteroid) hormone.
Glucagon is generated from the cleavage of proglucagon by proprotein convertase 2 in pancreatic islet α cells. In intestinal L cells, proglucagon is cleaved to the alternate products glicentin, GLP-1 (an incretin), IP-2, and GLP-2 (promotes intestinal growth).

==Pathology==

Abnormally elevated levels of glucagon may be caused by pancreatic tumors, such as glucagonoma, symptoms of which include necrolytic migratory erythema, reduced amino acids, and hyperglycemia. It may occur alone or in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

==History==

In the 1920s, Kimball and Murlin studied pancreatic extracts, and found an additional substance with hyperglycemic properties. They described glucagon in 1923.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kimball C, Murlin J | title = Aqueous extracts of pancreas III. Some precipitation reactions of insulin | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | year = 1923 | volume = 58 | pages = 337–348 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/58/1/337 | issue=1[/tpl] The amino acid sequence of glucagon was described in the late 1950s.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bromer W, Winn L, Behrens O | title = The amino acid sequence of glucagon V. Location of amide groups, acid degradation studies and summary of sequential evidence | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | year = 1957 | volume = 79 | issue = 11 | pages = 2807–2810|doi=10.1021/ja01568a038 [/tpl] A more complete understanding of its role in physiology and disease was not established until the 1970s, when a specific radioimmunoassay was developed.

===Etymology===

Glucagon was named in 1923, probably from the Greek γλυκός sweet, and ἄγειν to lead.glucagon on dictionary.com
