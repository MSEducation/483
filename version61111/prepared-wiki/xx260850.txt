McCartyville was founded during the mid-19th century, at the same time as the nearby settlement of St. Patrick.  Settlers in both areas, who were heavily Catholic, decided to split social functions between the two communities: their church was in St. Patrick, and their post office was in McCartyville.Brown, Mary Ann.

This post office was established as the "Reservoir Post Post Office" on 3 October 1876, but the name was changed to "McCartyville Post Office" on 26 July of the following year.  Mary Drees managed the post office in McCartyville around the turn of the 20th century. After its closure on 30 June 1904, the residents' mail went through the Anna post office.[tpl]gnis|2055258|McCartyville Post Office[/tpl]
