===In marine mammals===

The ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids, no larger than wolves, of about 53 million years (Ma) ago.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thewissen|first=J. G. M.|coauthors=Bajpai, S.|title=Whale Origins as a Poster Child for Macroevolution|journal=BioScience|date=1 January 2001|volume=51|issue=12|pages=1037–1049|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)0511037:WOAAPC2.0.CO;2|issn=0006-3568[/tpl] By 40 Ma ago, cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in Basilosaurus, an elongated, serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them. Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the Oligocene) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in body mass0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals. This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern blue whale. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer biomechanical constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with swimming movements as opposed to terrestrial locomotion. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulatory advantage of large body size in marine endotherms, although diminishing returns apply.
Cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach unprecedented size in the modern era. The largest carnivoran of all time is the mostly aquatic modern southern elephant seal.

===In flightless birds===

During the Paleocene, because of the small initial size of all mammals, apex predator niches were often occupied by members of other classes, such as terrestrial crocodilians (e.g. Pristichampsus), large snakes (e.g. Titanoboa), varanid lizards, or flightless birds (e.g. Gastornis in Europe and North America, Paleopsilopterus in South America). In the northern continents, large predatory birds were displaced when large eutherian carnivores evolved. In isolated South America, the phorusrhacids could not be outcompeted by the local metatherian sparassodonts and remained dominant until advanced eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the Great American Interchange) during the Pliocene. However, none of the largest predatory (Brontornis), possibly omnivorous (Dromornis) or herbivorous (Aepyornis) flightless birds of the Cenozoic ever grew to masses much above 500 kg, and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores, let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores. It has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds.[ref]
