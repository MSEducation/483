==Club career==

A former Northern Ireland international, Murdock started his career as an apprentice at Manchester United on leaving school in 1991. He featured in the youth side that were FA Youth Cup runners-up in 1993 and turned professional a year later, but never played a first team game for the club and was transferred to Preston for £165,000 in May 1997.
Murdock made more than 200 league and cup appearances while at Deepdale, collecting a Division Two title medal in 2000 and featuring in the side that reached the Division One playoff final in 2001 (losing 3–0 to Bolton Wanderers) before moving to Scottish club Hibernian in 2003. This gave him the long-awaited chance to experience top division football. During his time at Easter Road, he went from villain to hero when he scored the winning goal in a penalty shootout against Rangers in a CIS Cup semi-final. 
Murdock joined Crewe in the latter part of 2004–05. He skippered the team and his form helped to steer them clear of relegation. In summer 2005, Murdock signed for Rotherham, where he captained the team and brought experience to the centre of the Rotherham defence, making 43 league appearances in two seasons, scoring twice. At the end of the 2006–07 season after a season blighted by injuries he left Rotherham. Following a brief trial period he signed a one-year contract with Shrewsbury.[tpl]cite web | title=Defender Signs| work=shrewsburytown.co.uk | url=http://www.shrewsburytown.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10443~1081659,00.html | accessdate=31 July 2007 [/tpl] He made 29 league appearances and scored two goals for the Shrews, but was released by new manager Paul Simpson on 29 April 2008.[tpl]cite web | title=Retain List| work=shrewsburytown.co.uk | url=http://www.shrewsburytown.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10443~1301410,00.html| accessdate=29 April 2008 [/tpl]
