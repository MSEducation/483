Moonie is a pejorative term sometimes used to refer to members of the Unification Church. This is derived from the name of the church's founder Sun Myung Moon, and was first used in 1974 by the American media.  Church members have used the word "Moonie", including: Moon himself, President of the Unification Theological Seminary David Kim, and Moon's aide and president of The Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea Bo Hi Pak.[tpl]cite journal | last =Ofcom | title =Complaint by Mr Robin Marsh on behalf of The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification – UK (formerly known as the Unification Church) | journal =Broadcast Bulletin |issue=54 | publisher =www.ofcom.org.uk | date =February 20, 2006 | url =http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb41/ | accessdate = 2009-09-28 [/tpl]   In the 1980s and 1990s the Unification Church of the United States undertook an extensive public relations campaign against the use of the word by the news media.

Journalistic authorities, including the New York Times and Reuters, now discourage its use in news reporting.

Religious scholar Anson Shupe notes that "on many occasions" he heard "David Kim, President of the Unification Theological Seminary, refer to 'Moonie theology,' the 'Moonie lifestyle,' and so forth matter-of-factly". The principal aide to Sun Myung Moon, Bo Hi Pak, was quoted by Carlton Sherwood in his book Inquisition: The Persecution and Prosecution of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon as declaring to the United States Congress: "I am a proud Korean – a proud 'Moonie' – and a dedicated anti-Communist and I intend to remain so the rest of my life."[tpl]cite book  | last =Sherwood  | first =Carlton    |authorlink =Carlton Sherwood  | title =Inquisition: The Persecution and Prosecution of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon  | publisher =Regnery Gateway  | year =1991  | page =558 | isbn=978-0-89526-532-6[/tpl]
During the United States v. Sun Myung Moon in 1982, federal prosecutors argued that the word "Moonie" be banned during the jury selection process because they said it was considered "a negative term,"[tpl]cite news   | last =Berry  | first =John F.   | title =Court Impanels 200 in Effort to Find Impartial Jury to Try the Rev.

The court denied the prosecution's request, and ruled that the term was appropriately "descriptive." Judge Gerard L. Goettel instructed the jury that the case involved the Unification Church, Sun Myung Moon, and his followers, whom the judge stated were "sometimes referred to as Moonies."  That same year a report sponsored in part by Auburn University, P. Nelson Reid and Paul D.

For me, it is a sign that the American Unification Church has come of age. We can no longer allow our founder, our members, and allies to be dehumanized and unfairly discriminated against. ... We are now entering a period of our history where our Church development and family orientation are strong enough that we can turn our attention toward ending the widespread misunderstanding about our founder and the Unification movement."

==Commentary==

British sociologist Eileen Barker titled her 1984 book, which was based on seven years of first-person study of members of the Unification Church in the United States and Great Britain and has been influential in the field of the sociology of religion, The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?.[tpl]cite book  | last =Rhodes  | first =Ron   | title =The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions  | publisher =Zondervan  | year =2001  | pages =192, 335  | isbn = 0-310-23217-1[/tpl]   In the 1995 book America's Alternative Religions, published by the State University of New York Press, Baker wrote:  "Although they prefer to be called Unificationists, they are referred to in the media and popularly known as 'Moonies'."[tpl]cite book  | last =Miller  | first =Timothy  | title =America's Alternative Religions  | publisher =State University of New York Press  | year =1995 | pages =223, 414  | isbn =0-7914-2398-0 [/tpl]  In the same book, sociologists Anson Shupe and David Bromley, both noted for their studies of new religious movements, also use the word Moonies to refer to members of the Unification Church. In his 1998 book Religion, Mobilization, and Social Action, Shupe notes that Barker, Bromley, and he himself had used the term in other publications, "and meant no offense".  In his 2000 book Mystics and Messiahs, Philip Jenkins likens the term to "smear words such as Shaker, Methodist, Mormon". Jenkins mentions use of the word in book titles including Life among the Moonies and Escape from the Moonies, and comments: "These titles further illustrate how the derogatory term 'Moonie' became a standard for members of this denomination, in a way that would have been inconceivable for any of the insulting epithets that could be applied to, say, Catholics or Jews."[tpl]cite book  | last = Jenkins  | first = Philip   | title = Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 2000  | pages = 28, 200  | isbn = 0-19-512744-7 [/tpl]
