[[Regional Municipality of Durham]]

CATEGORIES: Durham Region

 
The Regional Municipality of Durham, informally referred to as Durham Region, is a regional municipality located in Southern Ontario east of Toronto, Ontario. It has an area of approximately 2,500 square kilometres. The towns of Pickering and Ajax, along with the township of Uxbridge, make up part of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area, with the communities of Oshawa, Whitby, and Clarington making up the Oshawa Census Metropolitan Area. The regional government is headquartered in Whitby.
The southern portion of the region, on Lake Ontario is primarily suburban in nature, forming the eastern end of the 905 belt of suburbs around Toronto. The northern area comprises rural areas and small towns.

==Subdivisions==

Durham Region consists of the following municipalities:
It also contains one Indian reserve: Mississaugas of Scugog Island.

==Local government==

Durham Region is governed by Durham Region Council, which consists of the Mayors of the local municipalities as well as Regional Councillors directly elected in each municipality.  The list below indicates the number of Regional Councillors elected in each local municipality.
The Council is led by a Chair, who is selected by the Council itself rather than direct election by the public.  The current Chair is Roger Anderson. In 2006, Pickering, Ajax, and Oshawa placed non-binding referendums on their local election ballots to ask voters whether the Chair should be directly elected.  Over 80% voted in the affirmative, and so this issue is likely to be a major one during the current term of Council.
The current council was elected in November 2006.  In the past, Council has sat for a three year term, but the Ontario Legislature recently passed legislation increasing the length of municipal council terms in Ontario to four years. A municipal election took place in November 2010.
Roger Anderson recently announced that during the 2014 municipal elections there will be a direct election for the Chair by the public.

==History==

The Region of Durham was established in 1974 as one of several new regional governments in the Province of Ontario, primarily in fast-growing urban and suburban areas. Durham Region it replaced the former Durham County in 1974, and encompasses areas that were previously part of Ontario County and the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham.  It was the culmination of a series of studies into municipal governance in the "Oshawa-Centred Region" that had begun in the late 1960s. The ultimate boundaries of the region were somewhat different than had been anticipated; for example, it was widely expected that Pickering would be annexed to Metropolitan Toronto, and that the region would extend further east to include Hope Township and the town of Port Hope.

===Automobile and other industries===

Durham Region is a major centre of the Canadian automobile industry. Oshawa is the Canadian headquarters of General Motors and home of GM's largest plant in North America. In addition, the Canadian headquarters of Volkswagen is located in the region, BMW was located in the region until moving to Richmond Hill in 2010.  The worldwide recession and spike in oil prices resulted in large-scale layoffs at GM beginning in 2008, along with the closure of the Oshawa Truck plant in 2009. This dramatically reduced employment levels at GM, and also resulted in significant employment losses and closures in the auto parts industry. This has recently turned around with the production of several new models in Oshawa.
However, one of the fastest growing industries in the region appears to be within the marketing field, more specifically, in the digital or online marketing sector. In short, Durham region is quickly becoming a "hub" for entrepreneurs and professionals from within this specialty field, where now more than a dozen can be found including: Search Engine People, YB Marketing Management Services, A Web that Works, Social Media Learning, and Scott Mckeagan - Small Business Internet Marketing.

==Education==

The Durham District School Board operates all English-language secular public schools within Durham Region, except for those schools within Clarington, which are part of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board. This is a holdover from the pre-1974 structure in which the area now forming Clarington was part of Durham County, while the other municipalities were part of Ontario County.
The Durham Catholic District School Board operates the separate English-language public Catholic school system within Durham Region, again with the exception of schools in Clarington, which are part of the Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board.
Neither school board is an operating division of the regional government.  Instead, as is true of all school boards in Ontario, they are separate entities with distinct but overlapped service areas.  Elected public trustees responsible for their operation.
