Country code (Top level domain): .vu 
Currently managed by Telecom Vanuatu Limited as "VUNIC".
Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 
Telecom Vanuatu Limited (TVL) - Provides WIMAX (256kb - 1Mb), ADSL (128kb - 1Mb), Wireless (limited to downtown Port Vila) and various fixed and leased line services.  VSAT is available for rural Vanuatu.  Prepaid and Postpaid options are available.  TVL does not have data caps but does lock customers into a 12-month contract.
Telsat Broadband Limited - Provides Carrier-Grade Wireless coverage to Port Vila and surrounds via their own independent network.  Telsat also supplies and maintains VSAT systems for the other remote parts of Vanuatu.  The minimum speed offered is 256kbit/s up to 2Mbit/s but can tailor plans to suit individual business requirements.  Pre-Paid and Subscription options are available.  Telsat Broadband has data caps in effect on all standard accounts but does not have lock-in contracts.
Digicel Vanuatu Limited - GPRS only.
A 128kbit/s ADSL connection costs 5,595 Vatu (almost US$60) per month while 512kb costs around 33,000 Vatu per month. Costs are expected to drop as competition heats up between TVL and  Telsat Broadband.  Telsat is already offering subscription plans starting from 4,000 Vatu per month.
Interchange Limited, is currently constructing the Interchange Cable Network which will initially connect Port Vila, Vanuatu to Suva, Fiji via a fiber optic cable, the cable is expected to be ready for service on 15 January 2014.http://interchange.vu/progress/ The initial capacity of the cable will be over 200 times Vanuatu's current capacity, with the ability to upgrade the capacity in the future should more bandwidth be required.http://interchange.vu/benefits-for-vanuatu/ Interchange plans to construct two more cables, one will connect Port Vila to the Solomon Islands (with a spur to the Vanuatu island of Espiritu Santo). The other will connect Vanuatu to New Caledonia (with a spur to the Vanuatu island of Tanna).http://interchange.vu/current-projects/
