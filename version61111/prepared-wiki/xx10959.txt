When the directive was revisited during 1977, some of the older units that were being reviewed (such as millimetre of mercury for blood pressure)The millimetre of mercury for blood pressure is one catalogued in Table 8 of SI Brochure. were retained but others were phased out, thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI.  The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances. It was reissued as directive 80/181/EEC. During subsequent revisions, the directive has reflected changes in the definition of SI. The directive also formalised the use of supplementary units, which in 1979 were permitted for a period of ten years.  The cut-off date for the use of supplementary units was extended a number of times and in 2009 was extended indefinitely.[tpl]cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF | author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=2009-05-27 | accessdate=2009-09-14[/tpl]

India was one of the last countries to start a metrication programme before the advent of SI. When it became independent in 1947, both imperial and native units of measure were in use. Its metrication programme started in 1956 with the passing of  the Standards of Weights and Measures Act.  Part of the act fixed the value of the seer (a legacy unit of mass) to 0.9331 kg exactly; elsewhere the Act declared that from 1960 all non-metric units of measure were to be illegal.
Four years after the Indian Government announced its metrication programme, SI was published. The result was that the initial metrication programme was a conversion to the CGS system of units and the subsequent adoption of SI has been haphazard.  Fifty years later, many of the country's schoolbooks still use CGS or imperial units. Originally the Indian Government had planned to replace all units of measure with metric units by 1960. In 1976 a new Weights and Measures Act replaced the 1956 Act which, amongst other things,  required that all weighing devices be approved before being released onto the market place. However, in 2012, it was reported that traditional units were still encountered in small manufacturing establishments and in the marketplace alongside CGS, SI and imperial measures, particularly in the poorer areas.
The use of the Indian numbering system of crores (10,000,000) and lakhs (100,000), which do not map onto the SI system of prefixes, is widespread and is often found alongside or in place of the western numbering system.
