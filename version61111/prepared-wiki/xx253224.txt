==Career==

===Hull City===

Born in Ashington, Northumberland, Cullen joined the Hull City youth system on a two-year scholarship in June 2008. He made his first team debut as a substitute in a 4–1 defeat against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup third round. He was given a place in the team after scoring 27 goals for the youth team during the 2009–10 season. He made his Premier League debut on 24 April 2010 when he came on as a substitute for George Boateng in the 75th minute of the home match against Sunderland, which Hull lost 1–0.[ref]

[/ref] He then went on to start in Hull's last game of the season against Liverpool in a 0–0 draw.
In January 2011 Cullen, along with fellow youth team graduate Tom Cairney, signed a new contract with the club until the summer of 2013. A few days later, Cullen joined League Two club Bradford City on a one-month loan. He played four games during his loan before returning to Hull.
For the 2011–12 season, Cullen was loaned to League One side Bury for six months. He made only four appearances in this time before returning to Hull in January 2012.
On 7 August 2012, Cullen returned to Bury for a further loan period, playing in 12 games and scoring once. His loan spell was brought to an end on 18 October 2012 following a shin injury. On 31 January 2013 Cullen went out on a month-long loan to Stockport County in the Conference Premier. This was later extended until the end of the season. On 12 March 2013 Cullen scored two goals in a 2–0 win against Barrow.

===Luton Town===

On 17 May 2013, Cullen signed for Conference Premier club Luton Town on a two-year contract following his release from Hull City. He scored his first goals for the club in a 3–2 win over Lincoln City on 21 September 2013. Cullen was primarily used as a substitute for much of the 2013–14 season due to the goalscoring form of Andre Gray. He came on as a substitute against Cambridge United to score a 90th minute "stunning" equaliser that kept Luton 15 points clear of their nearest title rivals. Cullen regained a place in the starting XI towards the end of the season, scoring three goals in five games as Luton won promotion to League Two.
