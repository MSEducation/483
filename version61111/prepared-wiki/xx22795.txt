The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the US and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. Extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.  Rapid mechanization of farm implements, especially small gasoline tractors and widespread use of the combine harvester, significantly impacted decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than [tpl]convert|10|in|mm|-1[/tpl] of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.
During the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust that the prevailing winds blew away in clouds that sometimes blackened the sky.  These choking billows of dust – named "black blizzards" or "black rollers" – reached such East Coast cities as New York City and Washington, D.C. and often reduced visibility to a meter (about a yard) or less.  Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma to witness the "Black Sunday" black blizzards of April 14, 1935; Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press coined the term "Dust Bowl" while rewriting Geiger's news story.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=blacksunday|title=The Black Sunday Dust Storm of 14 April 1935 |publisher=National Weather Service: Norman, Oklahoma|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Mencken|first=H.

The Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of families to abandon their farms.  Many of these families, who were often known as "Okies" because so many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left. Author John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men about such people.

==Causes==

During early European and American exploration of the Great Plains, the region in which the Dust Bowl occurred was thought unsuitable for European-style agriculture; the region was known as the Great American Desert.  The lack of surface water and timber made the region less attractive than other areas for pioneer settlement and agriculture.
Settlement was encouraged by the Homestead Act of 1862. With the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, waves of new immigrants arrived in the Great Plains, and cultivation increased significantly.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm | title = The Great Plains: from dust to dust | publisher = Planning Magazine | date = December 1987 | accessdate = December 6, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006015832/http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm |archivedate = October 6, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book | year =  1995 | url = http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu14re/uu14re00.htm  | title = Regions at Risk: a comparison of threatened environments | publisher = United Nations University Press | accessdate = December 6, 2007[/tpl]  An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that "rain follows the plow" (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the climate of the region had changed permanently.[tpl]cite book | year =  2006 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/DustBowl/DroughtintheDustBowlYears.aspx| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher = National Drought Mitigation Center | location = USA | accessdate = December 6, 2007[/tpl]  While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily cattle ranching, the impact on cattle herds from harsh winters beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general overgrazing, led to an expansion of land under cultivation.
Recognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the United States government expanded on the 160 acres offered under the Homestead Act—granting 640 acres to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the Kinkaid Act (1904) and 320 elsewhere in the Great Plains under the Enlarged Homestead Act (1909).  Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century.  A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the "formerly" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture, which was readily enabled by technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting.
The combined impact of the Russian Revolution and World War I increased agricultural prices, which further encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation.  For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.[tpl]cite book | year =  1995 | url = http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu14re/uu14re0n.htm#6.%20the%20ilano%20estacado%20of%20the%20american%20southern%20high%20plains | title = Regions at Risk: a comparison of threatened environments | publisher = United Nations University Press | accessdate = December 6, 2008[/tpl]
The favored agricultural methods of farmers during this period created the conditions for large scale erosion under certain environmental conditions.  The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods.  Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare over winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned the stubble as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thus depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.
When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it exposed the increased risk for erosion that was created by the farming practices in use at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains were able to create the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/aidd_wpa_1937.pdf |title=Areas of Intense Drought Distress, 1930–1936 |author1=Cronin, Francis D |author2=Beers, Howard W |publisher=U.S. Works Progress Administration |work=Research Bulletin |date=January 1937 |pages=1–23 |publisher=Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research (FRASER) |accessdate=September 12, 2013|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Geographic characteristics==

The Dust Bowl area lies principally west of the 100th meridian on the High Plains, characterized by plains which vary from rolling in the north to flat in the Llano Estacado. Elevation ranges from [tpl]convert|2500|ft|m[/tpl] in the east to [tpl]convert|6000|ft|m[/tpl] at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The area is semiarid, receiving less than [tpl]convert|20|in|mm[/tpl] of rain annually; this rainfall supports the shortgrass prairie biome originally present in the area. The region is also prone to extended drought, alternating with unusual wetness of equivalent duration.[tpl]cite web |date=February 2000 | url = http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf | title = A History of Drought in Colorado: lessons learned and what lies ahead | format = PDF | publisher = Colorado Water Resources Research Institute | accessdate= December 6, 2007[/tpl] During wet years, the rich soil provides bountiful agricultural output, but crops fail during dry years.  The region is also subject to high winds.[tpl]cite web | date = August 27, 1936 | url = http://newdeal.feri.org/hopkins/hop27.htm | title = A Report of the Great Plains Area Drought Committee | publisher = Hopkins Papers, Franklin D.

==Drought and dust storms==

The unusually wet period, which encouraged increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, ended in 1930.  This was the year in which an extended and severe drought began which caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion.  The fine soil of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.
On November 11, 1933, a very strong dust storm stripped topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in just one of a series of bad dust storms that year. Then, beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/drought_1934_aaa.pdf |title=The Drought of 1934 |first=Philip G.|last=Murphy |publisher=U.S. Drought Coordinating Committee |work=A Report of The Federal Government's Assistance to Agriculture |date=July 15, 1935 |publisher=Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research (FRASER) |accessdate=August 25, 2013|format=PDF[/tpl] The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust. Two days later, the same storm reached cities in the east, such as Buffalo, Boston, Cleveland, New York City, and Washington, D.C.Stock, Catherine McNicol (1992). Main Street in Crisis: The Great Depression and the Old Middle Class on the Northern Plains, p. 24. University of North Carolina Press. ISBN 0-8078-4689-9. That winter (1934–1935), red snow fell on New England.
On April 14, 1935,  known as "Black Sunday", 20 of the worst "black blizzards" occurred across the entire sweep of the Great Plains, from Canada south to Texas. The dust storms caused extensive damage and turned the day to night; witnesses reported they could not see five feet in front of them at certain points. Denver based Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma that day.  His story about Black Sunday marked the first appearance of the term Dust Bowl; it was coined by Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press, while rewriting Geiger's news story.

==Human displacement==

This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region. 

===U.S.===

In 1935, many families were forced to leave their farms and travel to other areas seeking work because of the drought (which at that time had lasted four years)."A Cultural History of the United States – The 1930s". San Diego, California: Lucent Books, Inc., 1999, p. 39. Dust Bowl conditions fomented an exodus of the displaced from Texas, Oklahoma, and the surrounding Great Plains to adjacent regions. More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless. Over 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone.[tpl]cite web | title=First Measured Century: Interview:James Gregory | url=http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/gregory.htm|accessdate=March 11, 2007 | publisher=PBS[/tpl] The severe drought and dust storms had left many homeless, others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks, and others felt they were left no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work.Babb, Sanora, Dorothy Babb, and Douglas Wixson.

San Diego, California: Lucent Books, Inc., 1999, p.19. Some residents of the Plains, especially in Kansas and Oklahoma, fell ill and died of dust pneumonia or malnutrition.
The Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history within a short period of time.  Between 1930 and 1940, approximately 3.5 million people had moved out of the Plains states; of those, it is unknown how many moved to California.[ref]
