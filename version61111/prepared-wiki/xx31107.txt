==Assessment==

Many authoritative voices have acclaimed Zidane's skills and importance in the history of football, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane "a monster" for his performance and abilities. German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated: "Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player." Italy's manager Marcello Lippi, who has also coached Zidane, opined "I think Zidane is the greatest talent we've known in football these last twenty years, yet he never played the prima donna. I am honoured to have been his manager."Jon Stevenson. Zidane's lasting legacy. BBC. Retrieved 15 July 2010. Former England manager Kevin Keegan said; "You look at Zidane and think 'I've never seen a player quite like that'. Diego Maradona was a great player. Johan Cruyff was a great player. They were different — but with similarities. What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn't there. Add his vision and it makes him very special".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/4769833/Zidane-has-the-measure-of-true-greatness.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Barclay | title=Zidane has the measure of true greatness | date=27 August 2000[/tpl] At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said: "I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad."Zizou Top, The Guardian, 2 July 2000
