[[Sonic Dream Collective]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish musical groups

Sonic Dream Collective was a Swedish pop band from the city of Uppsala. They had their greatest success in 1995 with the song “Oh, Baby All” which topped the Swedish national radio P3 Tracks chart. The debut album “Gravity” was also released the same year (1997 in the US).
Members of the band were singer Linn Engström, songwriter Jon Hällgren and producer Anders Wågberg.
Between 1994 and 1997 the band had their own record label Flying Duck Music together with producer Stefan Warnberg.
A close collaboration was soon established with Giovanni Sconfienza and the record label Remixed Records where the second and final album “Dustproof” was released in 1998. By then the name had been shortened to Sonic Dream.
"Dustproof" also featured a collaboration with American guitarist Raven Storm, who was recording his album at the Flying Duck studios.  Hearing Storm's playing, Wågberg decided to add a rock element to their music.  Storm recorded several guitar solos and rhythm guitar parts, but most of it, including all of the solos, were left out of the final cut due to the producers' reluctance to change the musical formula.  Storm is featured most prominently on the song "Colors of the Wind."
Their song "Love" is used in one of the Dancemania soundtracks and on Dance Dance Revolution 2nd ReMIX.
