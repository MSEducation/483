The LRAC F1, officially called Lance-Roquettes AntiChar de 89 mm modèle F1 (89 mm anti-tank rocket launcher model F1) is a French reusable rocket launcher developed by Luchaire Defense SA, and manufactured in cooperation with Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and was in the 1970s marketed by Hotchkiss-Brandt.Luchaire produces the different rocket projectiles for the LRAC F1 and Manufacture Nationale-d'Armes de Saint Etienne the launcher - both firms are now part of GIAT Industries  It replaced the 89 mm M20A1 Super Bazooka in French Army service. Through the use of fiberglass and plastic in the launcher it is over 2 kg lighter when loaded than the M20A1 while having a greater effective range.  The LRAC FI is sometimes referred to as the STRIM 89mm antitank rocket launcher from the abbreviations for the private firm Societe Technique de Recherches Industrielles  de la Mecanique  that was contracted in 1964 by the French Ministry of Defence, to research a replacement for the M20A1 Super Bazooka.  In the early 1970s, two antitank weapons were placed in production for evaluation by the French Army to replace the M20A1: the 80mm ACL-APX, a recoilless cannon with a rocket assist projectile, and the 89mm LRAC F1 STRIM 89mm rocket launcher.  The STRIM design was chosen as the replacement for the M20A1 based on its higher penetration ability of its antitank ammunition and the much lower over all manufacturing costs compared to the 80mm ACL-APX system.edited by D.H.R. Archer "Jane's Infantry Weapons 1976" page 576-578The sight developed for the ACL-APX was adopted for the LRAC F1

==Operation==

The launcher is normally operated by a crew of two, a loader and a gunner. The launcher is loaded by attaching a rocket container to the rear of the launcher. When the container is attached, the electrical firing circuit is connected. The rocket container is 626 millimeters long and weighs approximately 3.2 kilograms. On the left side of the launcher is the 3× APX M 309 optical sight, which is graduated between 100 and 1,000 meters. The launcher has a shoulder rest and forward pistol grip, both of which may be adjusted to suit the firer. The forward pistol grip contains a mechanical safety switch and the firing mechanism. When the safety is off, pulling the trigger generates a charge which fires the rocket.
The watertight rear plug of the rocket container is removed just before firing, which closes the firing circuit and allows the rocket to be fired. The rocket is propelled by a large number of long sticks of tubular propellant that produce a constant pressure while burning, providing constant acceleration. The engine burns out before the rocket leaves the launcher at a velocity of approximately 300 meters per second. As soon as the rocket leaves the launcher, nine fins fold backwards from the rear. These fins provide stability for the rocket while it is in flight. There are two safeties.  The first is a bore-riding pin located mid-body of the projectile that blocks the warhead firing circuit.  After the projectile leaves the tube, the bore-riding pin falls out releasing the second safety which prevents detonation until the rocket has traveled at least 10 meters from the launcher. The rocket reaches a range of 330 meters in about 1.25 seconds, and 360 meters in 1.36 seconds.
The rocket itself weighs 2.2 kilograms and has an 80 millimeter diameter shaped charge warhead. The warhead can penetrate 400 millimeters of armour or one meter of concrete at 0 angle impact of the armour plating, and is capable of penetrating NATO single heavy, double medium and double heavy targets while still having enough energy to penetrate multiple 10 millimeter thick steel witness plates.Jane's Infantry Weapons 1991–1992 gives detail of the penetration as a single heavy target at 65 degrees from the horizontal followed by seven 10 millimeter witness plates, a double heavy target followed by four witness plates, and a double medium target followed by eight witness plates.Luchaire in the mid 1980s developed a new antitank rocket that had the astonishing penetration of 600 millimeters of armour plating.  But it was not placed in production, as that was still insufficient to defeat the Russian T-62/T-72 main battle tanks in a frontal engagement
After firing the rocket container is removed, and a fresh one is reinserted. The launcher has a life of approximately 130 firings, after which the optical sight is removed and the launcher is discarded. The optical sight can then be fitted to a fresh launcher.
A number of other rockets were developed for the launcher, including a dual purpose anti-personnel/anti-vehicle rocket whose warhead contains 1,600 steel balls along with a smaller HEAT antiarmour warhead. The steel balls have a lethal radius of approximately 20 meters and the shaped charge is capable of penetrating up to 100 millimeters of steel plating. A smoke round was developed, that produces smoke for approximately 35 seconds; and an illumination round that produces 300,000 candela for 30 seconds.

==Service Use==

Besides the French Army, numerous other armies have the LRAC F1 in service, especially with former African colonies of France of which it still remains in service with today.  During the French intervention in Lebanon in 1982-83 many journalists in error reported the LRAC F1 as being the Milan wire guided antitank missile. As of 2008, the Swedish AT4-CS (confined space) individual antitank weapon and the 600m range ERYX wire guided antitank missile has replaced the LRAC F1 as the standard French military's short range and ultra-short range anti-tank and assault weapon.
