[[Suspensory ligament of eyeball]]

CATEGORIES: Human eye anatomy

The suspensory ligament (of Lockwood) forms a hammock stretching below the eyeball between the medial and lateral check ligaments and enclosing the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of the eye. It is a thickening of Tenon's capsule, the dense connective tissue capsule surrounding the globe and separating it from orbital fat.Snell R, Lemp, M. Clinical Anatomy of the Eye. 2nd Edition ed: Blackwell Science; 2009.
The ligament functions to support the eye,[tpl]DorlandsDict|five/000059518|Lockwood ligament[/tpl] and prevents downward displacement of the eyeball. 
It can be considered a part of the bulbar sheath.http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?Lockwood's+ligament
It is named for Charles Barrett Lockwood.
