Vitis has a small annex 42 kilometers from the center of town, named Chunurarran, which is inaccessible by road and is used by the townsfolk for their cows, llamas, and alpacas. Few people really live in Chunurraran throughout the entire calendar year. From Chunurraran as well as the path to the annex views of a small mini-chain of snow-covered mountains can be seen. As is the case with the rest of the Sierra mountains in Peru, much of these mountains' snow has receded a significant amount in the past decades and the last of the permanent snow-covered mountains in the whole province of Yauyos will have disappeared completely within the next few decades.

==Origins: Cochaswasi and Huayllugina==

The origins of the people of the town of Vitis lie in its archaeological sites, Cochaswasi and Huayllugina. With claims to existence before the times of the Incan Empire, Cochaswasi and Huayullugina are about an hour's walk from the town of Vitis and are composed of fallen houses as well as the remains of an old irrigation system. 
From Cochaswasi (Quechua Quchawasi, qucha lake, wasi house, "lake house") one has a view of two rivers, the River Canete and River Puente, as well as of the lake Pikiqucha down below. The people of Vitis call Cochaswasi "Mini Machu Picchu" because it is on top of a flat part of the mountain and two rivers can be seen from it, as is the case with Machu Picchu. Higher up the mountain is Huayllugina. From both sites views of dozens of mountaintops, sometimes snow-covered, can be seen.
