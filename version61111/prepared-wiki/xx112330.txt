Norristown Transportation Center is a two-level multimodal public transportation regional hub located in Norristown, Pennsylvania and operated by SEPTA. It opened in 1989 to replace the older Norristown High Speed Line (Route 100) terminus one block away at Main and Swede Streets, and integrated the former Reading Company DeKalb Street Norristown railroad station (built 1933) into its structure. A plaque embedded in the sidewalk (between the bus lane and Lafayette Streets) commemorates the location of one of the columns of the dismantled segment of the Philadelphia and Western Railroad (P&W) trestle.

Today, Norristown Transportation Center (NTC) is the final stop on the Norristown High Speed Line which runs from 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania to Norristown. It is also a stop on the Manayunk/Norristown Regional Rail Line which offers service to Center City Philadelphia via Conshohocken and Manayunk. 
In addition to rail service, NTC serves as the center of SEPTA's Frontier Division, particularly the routes operating in Montgomery County.  Bus routes serving NTC operate with a "timed transfer"; for the most part, buses leave at the same time, to maximize possible transfers between routes. These routes serve areas of Norristown and other areas in Montgomery County. 
SEPTA Frontier routes that serve Norristown Transportation Center are:
NTC is located at DeKalb & Lafayette Streets near the banks of the Schuylkill River and boasts a parking garage (built in 2008).[tpl]cite news|title=SEPTA unveils new Norristown parking garage|date=2008-04-07|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=16073|accessdate=2008-04-09[/tpl] Intercity bus service was recently introduced to Norristown.
Additionally, Norristown Transportation Center was formerly an important transfer point between electric and Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDCs) service to points north, such as Valley Forge, Phoenixville, Pottstown, Reading and Pottsville. RDC service was eliminated in 1981 due to budget cuts. Proposals for service restoration to Reading, dubbed the Schuylkill Valley Metro, have been floated around since the late 1990s, but nothing has gone past the discussion phase.
