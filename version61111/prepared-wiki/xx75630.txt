The Crowsnest Highway, also known as the Interprovincial or, in British Columbia, the Southern Trans-Provincial, is an east-west highway, [tpl]convert|1161|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, through the southern parts of British Columbia and Alberta, providing the shortest highway connection between British Columbia's Lower Mainland and southeast Alberta.  It is designated a core route in Canada's National Highway System,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/backgrounders-b05-r003e-1877.htm | title=National Highway System | publisher=Transport Canada | date=2009-12-13 | accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl] and is designated as Highway 3 for its entire length.
The highway, which is mostly two lanes, was officially established in 1932, mainly following a mid-19th century gold rush trail originally traced out by an engineer named Edgar Dewdney.  It takes its name from the Crowsnest Pass, the location at which the highway crosses the Continental Divide between British Columbia and Alberta.  
In British Columbia, the first segment of the highway between the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 5A is locally known as the Hope-Princeton Highway. In Alberta, the highway forms concurrencies with both the Red Coat Trail and the CANAMEX Corridor from Highway 2 west of Fort Macleod to Highway 4 at the eastern limits of Lethbridge.

==Route description==

===British Columbia===

The Crowsnest Highway's total length in British Columbia is [tpl]convert|837|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] and its total length within Alberta is [tpl]convert|324|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].  The Crowsnest Highway's western terminus is at Hope, where it branches off from Highway 1.  The highway goes east for [tpl]convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to its junction with Highway 5, then through Allison Pass and Manning Provincial Park for [tpl]convert|127|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] towards the Town of Princeton. There are several significant ascents in this stretch between Hope and Princeton. The first is the steep climb to the Hope Slide, followed later by the remainder of the climb up to Allison Pass at an elevation of 1,342m (4,473 ft).  After the summit of Allison Pass, where the Crowsnest crosses from the Fraser Valley Regional District into the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, the road descends for [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] before beginning another long climb up Sunday Summit (1,284m, 4,280 ft).  Soon after Sunday Summit is the descent into Princeton, where Highway 5A begins.
After Princeton, the Crowsnest goes southeast for [tpl]convert|67|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], through Hedley, to the Village of Keremeos, where a junction with a length of highway designated as 3A is located, leading towards Penticton and Highway 97.  Another [tpl]convert|46|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast, and the Crowsnest reaches the Town of Osoyoos and a junction with Highway 97. The highway then proceeds to hug the Canada-U.S. border east through a stretch of switchbacks known as Anarchist Mountain, which is also the name of the upland rural community beyond the summit.  A few kilometres east of Anarchist Mountain, the Crowsnest enters the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary.
[tpl]convert|52|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Osoyoos, the Crowsnest reaches its junction with Highway 33 at Rock Creek, then the highway heads east for [tpl]convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to its junction with Highway 41 at a location called Carson, just west of Grand Forks.  Another [tpl]convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east, passing through Grand Forks en route, the Crowsnest meets Highway 395 at the southern end of Christina Lake.
Further east from Christina Lake, the Crowsnest travels for [tpl]convert|47|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] through Bonanza Pass to its junction with Highway 3B at Nancy Greene Lake, which is the cutoff to the ski town of Rossland, shortly thereafter crossing into the Regional District of Central Kootenay.  It is another [tpl]convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east from Nancy Greene Lake to the junction with Highway 22 at Castlegar, and another [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] east to a junction with another stretch of Highway designated as 3A, also within Castlegar.  Leaving Castlegar, the Crowsnest reaches its eastern junction with Highway 3B [tpl]convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east. Highway 6 converges with the Crowsnest at Salmo, [tpl]convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of the 3B junction, and the two highways proceed south for [tpl]convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the Burnt Flat Junction, where Highway 6 diverges south.
East of Burnt Flat, the Crowsnest heads through the Kootenay Pass on a stretch known as the Kootenay Skyway, or Salmo-Creston Skyway.  [tpl]convert|67|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Burnt Flat, the Crowsnest reaches the Town of Creston, just past junctions with Highway 21 and Highway 3A.  [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] later, south of Yahk, Highway 95 merges onto the Crowsnest.  The two highways share a common alignment for [tpl]convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast along the Moyie River, crossing into the Regional District of East Kootenay along the way, to a junction with Highway 95A at Cranbrook.  Another [tpl]convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east, Highway 95 diverges north from the Crowsnest and Highway 93 merges onto the Crowsnest from the north.  Highway 93 and the Crowsnest share a common alignment for the next [tpl]convert|53|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast to Elko, where Highway 93 diverges south. [tpl]convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Elko, the Crowsnest reaches Fernie, then it goes north another [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to its junction with Highway 43 at Sparwood, and another [tpl]convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east, the highway reaches the boundary with Alberta at Crowsnest Pass.

===Alberta===

The Alberta portion of the Crowsnest Highway is designated Alberta Provincial Highway No. 3.[tpl]Citation | title=Provincial Highways Designation Order | publisher=Alberta Transportation | page=2[/tpl] Once into Alberta, the Crowsnest Highway goes east [tpl]convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the Bighorn Highway at  Coleman, then [tpl]convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east to its junction with Highway 22, another [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to its junction with Highway 6, then another [tpl]convert|44|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to its junction with Highway 2 north, then proceeding [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] east into the Town of Fort Macleod and the Crowsnest's junction with Highway 2 south.  After Fort Macleod, the Crowsnest goes [tpl]convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east, crossing the Oldman River, to Highway 3A southeast of Monarch, which feeds Highway 23. 
The highway reaches the first access (Westview Drive W) to the City of Lethbridge [tpl]convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] later. At this point, the Crowsnest's only freeway segment begins. [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] later, Highway 25 (University Drive W) branches to the north before crossing the Oldman River for the second time. The freeway segment ends at Mayor Magrath Drive, which branches as Highway 5 to the south. The highway intersects Highway 4 at the eastern limits of Lethbridge. 
[tpl]convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Lethbridge, the Crowsnest reaches the Town of Taber. Within Taber, Highway 36 runs concurrently with the highway for [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Upon dropping the concurrency, the Crowsnest ends [tpl]convert|113|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] later at the Trans-Canada Highway in the City of Medicine Hat.
