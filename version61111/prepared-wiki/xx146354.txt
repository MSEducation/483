[[Sardinella]]

CATEGORIES: Sardinella, Clupeidae

Sardinella is a genus of fishes in the family Clupeidae, the herrings and sardines. This genus currently contains 21 recognized species.Froese, R. and D. Pauly. (Eds.) Sardinella species list. FishBase. 2011. They are abundant in warmer waters of the tropical and subtropical oceans.
Sardinella are generally coastal, schooling marine fish. Juveniles are often found in lagoons and estuaries, and adults are more common off the coast.
Species are distinguished by their ranges and by specific body features, but they are often confused with one another. Fish of the genus have 7 to 14 striped markings along the scales of the top of the head. The paddle-shaped supramaxilla bones are characteristic; they separate Sardinella from other genera and their shapes help distinguish species. There are paired predorsal scales and enlarged fin rays.[tpl]cite book|last=Whitehead|first=P. J. P.|title=FAO species catalogue. Vol. 7. Clupeoid fishes of the world.

==Region==

Sardinella is distributed in both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, throughout the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans.

==Sardinella and Harengula==

Sardinella evolved from the small herring genus Harengula. The two genera are nearly indistinguishable, but have slight differences in morphology. The scales of Harengula have complete transverse grooves which became interrupted in Sardinella. The shape of the expanded portion of the second supramaxillary bone also helps to differentiate the taxa. Sardinella also has a more developed anal fin, with enlarged and elongated posterior rays.Chan, W. L. (1965). A systematic revision of the Indo-Pacific clupeid fishes of the genus Sardinella (Family Clupediae). Journal of Japanese Ichthyology 12(3/6) 104.
Sardinella and Harengula can distinguished from other Clupeidae genera by several shared characters. Both have a terminal mouth, lack a median notch in the upper jaw, lack radiating grooves in their smooth opercula, lack scales on the  predorsal ridge, and have no more than 24 rays on the anal fin. Both also have a unique dermal fold on the anterior edge of the cleithrum, a bone attached to the skull.
