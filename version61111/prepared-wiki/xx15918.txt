[tpl]Donizetti operas[/tpl]Belisario (Belisarius) is a tragedia lirica (tragic opera) in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti. Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian libretto after Luigi Marchionni's adaptation of [tpl]Link-interwiki |lang=de |en=Eduard von Schenk |en_text=Eduard von Schenk's[/tpl] play, Belisarius, first staged in Munich in 1820 and then (in Italian) in Naples in 1826.Osborne 1994, p. 246; Ashbrook 1982, p. 561; Ashbrook 1992, p. 384; Smart & Budden, 2001. Jean-François Marmontel's Bélisaire has also been suggested as a source: Weinstock 1963, p. 350; Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 237, state it was Marmontel's 1776 "play"), but Osborne strongly asserts that Cammarano's primary source must have been Marchioni's Italian translation of Schenk's 1820 play Belisar, which had been presented in Naples in 1826, and not Marmontel's 1766 novel. The plot is loosely based on the life of the famous general Belisarius of the 6th century Byzantine Empire.
It premiered to critical and popular success on 4 February 1836 at the Teatro La Fenice, Venice, and was given many additional performances that season,Osborne 1994, pp. 245-248 although Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook notes that there would have been more had the opera not been presented so late in the season.Ashbrook 1982, p. 637: Ashbrook states that there were "28 consecutive performances" that season (p. 107), whereas Osborne claims 17. (p. 246)
However, in spite of its initial short term success and critical reaction, as represented by a review in La Gazzetta privilegiata which stated that "A new masterwork has been added to Italian music.....Belisario not only pleased and delighted, but also conquered, enflamed and ravished the full auditorium",Quoted in Osborne, 1994, p. 246 in the long run, had "Donizetti poured music of the calibre of his Lucia di Lammermoor into the score of Belisario the shortcomings of its wayward plot and dramatic structure would matter less".Osborne, 1994, p. 247 By April 1836, even the composer himself recognized that the work stood below Lucia in accomplishment.

==Composition history==

With the success of Lucia di Lammermoor in September 1835, Donizetti moved on to stagings of Maria Stuarda, the first under that name at La Scala in late 1835.  He had signed the contract in July 1835 to present Belisario in Venice, for what would be the first visit to that city since 1819, but it was not until October that the subject was finally agreed upon.
There followed discussions with impresario Natale Fabbrici about employing a Venetian librettist, Pietro Beltrame. However, not only did the composer prefer to work with a librettist known to him and with whom he could work in close proximity,Commons 2013, pp. 12—14: "It would be imprudent to have the poet so far removed from the maestro" Donizetti had noted in a letter of 24 October. but he had already begun working with Cammarano who was revising - to the composer's satisfaction - an earlier version of BelisarioAshbrook 1982, pp. 103-105 which the librettist had submitted to the Teatro San Carlo management in 1832.
Of greater concern to Donizetti was the singers who were to be engaged. Primarily, he was concerned about the identity of the leading tenor: "Until I know for sure, I cannot compose duets, finales and trios", he writes in October.Donizetti to Fabbrici, 24 October 1835 in Ashbrook 1982, p. 106 By the time Donizetti arrived in Venice on 6 January 1836, the score of Belisario was almost finished, and because of delays, he had time to hear several of the proposed singers in a performance of Rossini's L'assedio di Corinto given on 12 January, the day before rehearsals of Belisario were to begin.
In the case of Antonietta Vial (who was to sing the role of Irene and whom he described on first hearing her as "both a bastard soprano and a veiled contralto",Donizetti to Giovanni Ricordi, 1 February 1836, in Commons 2013, p. 20 he was able to make adjustments to suit her vocal limitations.  By the time of the first performance, which was well received, Donizetti reported to his publisher the audience's reaction to most of the numbers, specifically that "in the duet for Vial and Salvatore, many shouts of bravi, but at the end (so they say) the situation is so moving that they were weeping".Donizetti to Ricordi, 5 February 1836, in Ashbrook 1982, p. 107
In a review of a 2011 London performance, some of the strengths of Donizetti's score are outlined:

==Roles==

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

Il Trionfo (Triumph)
The hall in the emperor's palace
Irene and the populace greet the victor Belisarius. Antonina hates her husband because Proclus, the slave of Belisarius, has confessed on his deathbed, that upon command of his master he had exposed her son on the shore of the ocean, thus causing his death. The Emperor Justinian greets his commander and grants his prayer for the release of the prisoners. The captive, Alamir, who adores Belisarius, refuses to leave him. (Recitative and duet: "What do I see, does Alamir reject my gift?") The general adopts him in place of his long lost son. Irene congratulates her father, but Antonina has already begun her work of hate, by traducing Belisarius to Justinian, and the innocent man is accused of high treason and thrown into prison on the evidence of his wife.

===Act 2===

L'Esilio (Exile)
Before the prison
Alamir and his friends lament the fate of Belisarius, whose eyes have been put out by his enemies, falsely construing and disobeying the commands of the emperor. Alamir swears vengeance. (Aria: Trema, Bisanzio! sterminatrice, Su te la guerra discenderà / "Tremble, Byzantia, I will repay.") Irene clad as a youth arrives to act as guide to her father, who is about to be released from prison. (Duet: "Oh thou, who in terrible darkness.")

===Act 3===

La Morte (Death)
In the mountains
As the clang of weapons is heard, Irene leads Belisarius to a cave for safety. Alamir now leads the army of the Alannae against Byzantium to avenge Belisarius. Belisarius confronts him and recognizes him as his son through an amulet. At his father's request, the son leaves the ranks of the enemies of Byzantium, and the Alannae, now under the command of Ottavio, march to Byzantium, having no fear, as the emperor's army is bereft of its leader.
Hall in Byzantium
Antonina, in remorse, tells the emperor that her testimony against Belisarius was false. Irene approaches with news of the victory and informs Antonina that Alamir is her son, and that it was the slave, not Belisarius, who had planned his death. Meanwhile the blind Belisarius has led the Byzantine army and defeated the Alannae, who had threatened Byzantium, but an arrow has mortally wounded him. He is carried in dying, and the sorrowing emperor promises to be a father to Alamir and Irene.
