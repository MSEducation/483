Tormented is the debut studio album by American rock band Staind, self-released in 1996. The album was originally only available in limited quantities in New England, United States, with the original release limited to 4,000 copies. There are cassette pressings of the album, but only two are known to exist making it impossible to find a copy. One was autographed by the band, and was later sold on eBay for a thousand dollars. Tormented would later be re-released several times, without modification, in response to overwhelming demand from fans amidst Staind's success in the early 2000s (decade). The album was never sold in stores, and was instead sold at concerts and on their website in several forms. The album contains an early version of "Mudshovel", named "Mudshuvel", the song which would propel Staind into mainstream rock success in 1999.

==Music and lyrics==

Many of the songs on Tormented deal with pain, hate and depression, including a gun being loaded and cocked at the start, and fired at the finish, which (along with the hidden track "The Funeral") make it something of a concept album revolving around a depressed individual who eventually commits suicide. Despite being an intense metal record, Staind's 1996 effort includes an acoustic song entitled "4 Walls". Frontman Aaron Lewis elaborated on the motivation for the musical style heard on Tormented:
In later years, Staind members have emphasized Tormented as an early primitive step in the band's musical evolution. Guitarist Mike Mushok noted in 2008 his lack of appreciation for the album: 

==Cover art==

The album is known for its controversial cover art, depicting a bloody Barbie doll on a crucifix, a buried person with a rosary protruding from its nose, and a knife impaling a Bible. This grotesque art appalled Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst so greatly that he attempted to remove Staind from a concert bill shortly before their performance. Durst failed, and after hearing the band play, was so impressed that he signed them to Flip/Elektra and co-produced their next album.

==Post-Tormented==

"Mudshuvel", renamed "Mudshovel", would be re-recorded and released as Staind's second single. It would become the band's breakout single and the most popular song from their 1999 album, Dysfunction.
The track "Come Again" was released with the 2004 single of "Right Here" and on the band's singles compilation in 2006. It has also since started being played at shows, along with "Break" and "Tolerate."
