|-
| Have a Nice Day with Leroy & Fuzz
| Seasons 4-6
| A parody of Sesame Street that features Leon Frierson as Leroy who hosted a children's TV show with the help of Fuzz (performed by Kevin Carlson), an annoying puppet similar to a Muppet. Leroy would discuss a typical topic that most children disliked, such as  homework, bedtime, brushing teeth, sharing, taking a bath, etc. Fuzz would frequently describe the "joy" of such feeling, only to have Leroy attack him, (for an example, Leroy stuck a high powered sander in Fuzz's mouth, Leroy flushing Fuzz into the toilet, and other varieties of dangerous things that Leroy can do to Fuzz). One segment detailing about babysitting had him change his mind about it when he met his teenage babysitter. At the end of the sketch, Leroy would find a way to get Fuzz painfully removed from the screen (like placing Fuzz in a crate marked "Cuba," launching Fuzz into space, flushing Fuzz down the toilet, etc.), and would then tell the children to "Have a Nice Day."

He and his three friends Pizza Face (played by Kel Mitchell) who had a slice of pizza for a face, Tinsel Teeth (played by Alisa Reyes) whose mouth was full of Christmas decorations, and Four Eyes (played by Angelique Bates) who had four eyeballs in two sockets faced teenage problems while trying to fit in at Dullmont Jr. High School. Thankfully, they had help from "a freak like us, but everyone likes him, and he's got a lot of money"-namely, Ross Perot (played by Katrina Johnson). Mocking Perot's wild attitude, Johnson often threw piles of money in the air and offered insane advice to the foursome. The four appear to be students as Dullmont Jr. High School.

| The Island Girls
| Seasons 2-3
| The Island Girls starred Lori Beth Denberg and Alisa Reyes as Fran and Kiki, two girls who were stranded on a deserted island after Kiki's boat collided with Fran's boat as seen in the theme song that is a spoof of Gilligan's Island. Fran desperately wanted to escape the island and often devised ways to reach civilization. Unfortunately, the happy-go-lucky (and stupid) Kiki would constantly end up ruining Fran's ideas. Occasionally, visitors would come to the island such as a group of pirates (played by Angelique Bates and Josh Server) looking for buried treasure, natives from a neighboring island (played by Kel Mitchell and Josh Server) looking for human sacrifices to give to their sacred hamster, three-armed aliens (played by Kenan Thompson and Josh Server) who are visiting Earth, and Kiki's sister Didi (played by Katrina Johnson) who has the same personality as her sister. Fran would always hope to escape with them only to see them driven away by Kiki's silly actions. The sketch always ended with Kiki singing her "Forever and Ever" song and Fran knocking herself unconscious so that she wouldn't have to hear Kiki sing. Alisa Reyes mentioned at the 2011 Comikazee Panel that this was her favorite sketch.

| Baggin' Saggin' Barry
| Seasons 1-2
| This sketch starred Kenan Thompson as Baggin' Saggin' Barry, a boy with extremely large pants. Barry's friends were often stuck in unfortunate situations. Thankfully, he would always have everything that the group needed in his enormous pants, including food, drinks, entertainment, and even transportation (one sketch featured him pulling a full-sized airplane out of his pants). In one notable episode in Season 2, Barry met Baggin' Saggin' Mary (Alisa Reyes), and the two engaged in a battle of who had more stuff in their pants. He lost the battle but he got some advice from Clavis to believe what's in his pants and he eventually beats Mary (Bu pulling Abraham Lincoln out of his pants) and they get married and have children. This sketch inspired the title of a later Kenan & Kel episode "Baggin' Saggin' Kel".

Superdude's one weakness was being lactose intolerant (he could not be touched by dairy products), therefore all of his villains were dairy-themed: Milk Man, Butter Boy, Cow Boy, and Yogurl (the majority of these villains are played by Kel Mitchell). A few notable characters appeared in Superdude sketches:

| Ask Ashley
| Seasons 3-6
| Ask AshleyAll That: Fresh Out the Box, Steve Holland, Pocket Books, 1998 was a sketch starring Amanda Bynes as a little girl named Ashley, who offered advice from her bedroom on a TV series. She was sweet and friendly until she read letters sent in by clueless viewers. After reading a letter, Ashley would go on a violent tirade against the letter's author (although in one scene did act normal, but that was after she read a letter from a boy who asked why he was being ignored, and Ashley does just that after she picks up another letter!). Her characteristic phrase, "Thaaaaat's me!" during the sketch became one of the sketch's trademarks. (In later sketches, children in the audience could be heard saying it with her.) The first letter that Ashley ever read was written by somebody who had no idea how to turn their peanut butter and jam sandwich over (her mother put the jelly on the wrong side and Ashley yelled "TURN THE STINKING SANDWICH OVER!!!!"). In one memorable sketch, Dr. Joyce Brothers made an appearance to talk to Ashley about her tirades and even read one of the letters, and like Ashley (who was her biggest fan) also launched into a tirade when it came to the letter about a kid who wasn't using the lights when the kid was stumbling in the dark. Another sketch had Danny Tamberelli playing a boy named Robert Freeman who arrived in Ashley's room and read her a letter on how he can get his letter to Ashley to which Ashley told him to use the mail and then orders him to get out of her room. The final letter read by Ashley (in the original series finale) was asking her why she is so mean to everyone who sends letters. In an episode of The Amanda Show, Amanda opens a letter on stage. She reads the greeting Dear Amanda, and the crowd responded "Thaaaaaat's me!". Amanda responded by saying "No, different show, different show". There is another episode where Stuart takes over Ashley. In the 10th anniversary, when Nick Cannon was introduced on Via Satellite, he said ''that's me, wait, that's not my sketch.

| Ishboo
| Seasons 1-3
| Ishboo was a foreign exchange student whose customs were rather unusual to Americans. It was proper in Ishboo's foreign land (which was never named) to shout "Walla Walla Woo!" and hide behind furniture in a panic after somebody sneezed. It was proper to bark like a dog while proposing a toast. It was customary to give your psychiatrist a live lobster on your first visit. When Ishboo's American friends gave him a birthday cake, he ran for a fire extinguisher in a panic and immediately doused the candles, asking, "How dare you set fire to my birthday cake?" It is suspected that Ishboo may have been a fake, as he is quite adept at getting out of troublesome situations-even those he "did not understand" seconds before. To escape from predicaments, he would hypnotize people by using his "swinging jewel". Comedian Sinbad guest starred as Ishboo's father Sinboo.

Captain Tantrum would often scream and cry when she encountered the villains.

| Repairman
| Seasons 2-5
| Whenever a device, item, or piece of equipment broke in a household, workplace, or public area, Repairman (played by Kel Mitchell) appeared (usually by falling from the sky and crashing into something on the way like a ceiling, roof, or wall), claiming he could fix it. However, he usually ends up further damaging the article he intended to repair, finding other things in the vicinity to “repair," and ultimately angering the owners (except Bacteria who, although initially angry, joined him in "repairing" things after their concert audience loved it). In the beginning of the sketch when asked to identify himself he exclaimed with a self-made echo, “I’M REPAIR MAN-MAN-MAN-MAN-MAN-MAN!!” He would finish off his introduction with a rather sinister and insane laugh. Once he called in a "second opinion" and introduced a one-time sidekick named REPAIR BOY-BOY-BOY-BOY-BOY-BOY-BOY (played by Leon Frierson) who also fell out of the sky.

|-
| Cooking with Randy and Mandy
| Seasons 1-4
| A sketch starring Kenan Thompson and Angelique Bates. Every now and then, When Cooking With Randy and Mandy started, the two greeted each other with "Hi, Randy," and "Hi, Mandy." The two played a duo named Randy and Mandy, who had their own cooking show on the fictional channel 106B. Every recipe concocted by the duo always contained massive amounts of chocolate (for example: spaghetti smothered in chocolate syrup). The only reason they had chocolate for every recipe is only because they are obsessed with chocolate. In one sketch, Randy gets in a hot tub that, instead of water, contains liquid chocolate. When Angelique Bates left the show, the sketch was renamed Cooking With Randy, with the explanation being that Mandy had been sent to a chocolate rehabilitation center after trying to drink an entire chocolate fountain during Randy and Mandy's chocolate-based weekend. A different chef would appear each time with their own preferred ingredient such as a chef (played by Chris Farley) who preferred ketchup and Randy would have to demonstrate chocolate's superiority. There were also some episodes like one involving Randy's grandfather (played by Tommy Davidson) who wants him to change his diet and another one which featured an appearance by Jack Campbell: Fat Cop.

PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO STUDY! HOW CAN YOU BE SO RUDE?! HUSH! IF YOU CAN'T BE SILENT, THEN I WILL BE VIOLENT!"  A trademark of the sketch was her air horn, and the signs she had placed around the library that read, "Quiet", "No Talking", "Stifle", "Hush", "Silence", and "Shhh".

|-
| Lemonade Scammer 
| Seasons 1-3
| A sketch featuring an adorable little girl (played by Katrina Johnson) who just wanted to make some money selling her homemade lemonade. Unfortunately for people passing by, the little girl was extremely "persuasive", utilizing methods such as giving away peanuts soaked in pepper juice and then charging ridiculously hefty prices for her drinks, or making people pay extra for a cup, ice, or sugar. If a customer refused to pay or buy lemonade, the girl would cry and make up something that her mom would do as a punishment. A later sketch had her meeting another girl (played by Amanda Bynes) who did a similar trick to people and ends up working with the Lemonade Scammer.

Usually the clients would stomp away after a while, leaving him to enjoy eating everything. This was used in the 10th anniversary, where Principal Pimpell observed, "That officer certainly is obese."

After a crime was committed, Dan would appear with two police officers and make a horrible mess of things. In one episode, a wealthy woman's jewelry was stolen. When the butler walked by Dan covered in pearls and other gems, he let him go by while investigating a statue. His famous line was "I'm Detective Dan" in a thick, cliché private eye voice. He would sometimes add on to the line depending on the situation, such as when he walked in wearing a trenchcoat and boxers, and said, "I'm Detective Dan, and I'm not wearing any pants." He had one daughter (Amanda Bynes) who was clearly more intelligent than him when it came to his house being robbed. After Detective Dan leaves, someone would quote "What a moron." This was used in the 10th anniversary and was Josh's favorite sketch.

|-
| Cheeseburger Doyle
| Seasons 6
| Featured a talking cheeseburger puppet named Cheeseburger Doyle (voiced by Danny Tamberelli) who ran a detective agency in the style of Dick Tracy. Hapless victims often appealed to him to solve some mystery, and Doyle would infiltrate the scene of the crime in a disguise (usually a false mustache). Astoundingly, everyone was always tricked by the disguise, and Doyle would catch the culprit red-handed, spraying mustard or other condiments on him or her. The victim would be nearby to thank Doyle-and then attempt to eat him. Also, it would show a guy named Bill (Leon Frierson) he would always say "Ay, it's a talking cheeseburger," in a manly voice and then jump out a window laughing.

| Stuart
| Seasons 5-6
| A sketch featuring Stuart (played by Mark Saul), a deranged individual who took on minimum wage jobs (one episode even had him taking over Ask Ashley) and believed (incorrectly) that he was the best person ever to do that job. Stuart's antics ranged from incompetent (such as a postman destroying a fragile parcel), to bizarre (such as a yearbook photographer using an iguana instead of a camera), to surreal (such as suddenly believing he is the customer, and asking the real customer for assistance). When his customers complained, his answers were nonsensical, and he frequently made animal noises, ate inedible things, spoke to inanimate objects and broke into dance. Eventually, it would emerge that Stuart had tied up and replaced the real person of that job. They appear out of nowhere with an officer saying "That's him! He tied me up and took my uniform!"  He ends with a monologue that would go along the lines of "Fine, I'm not the real . I'm just a guy, named Stuart. But you know, if I was the real , I'd be the greatest  in ALL THE LAND! And everyone would come up to me and say, 'Oh, Stuart. You're the best  EVERRRR! You all sicken me! Now I'm just gonna climb on my  and go", before making his escape on an imaginary animal.
| Mark Saul as Stuart
|-
| Complaint Department
| Seasons 2-4
| Complaint Department was set in a complaint department of a store, with people (portrayed by random cast members) waiting on line to complain about a purchased item to the clueless clerk, played by Lori Beth Denberg. The clerk would examine the item, and would either not find anything wrong with it, attempt to (badly) fix it herself, or give insane suggestions on how to fix it, until the consumer would leave, irritated. A common line from the clerk would be "...Is that your complaint?", which would further annoy the consumer. However, there was one special instance when Ed from "Good Burger" found her insane suggestions to make sense, and would fall in love with the clerk, the feeling being mutual.
| Lori Beth Denberg as the Clueless Complaint Department Clerk
|-
| Jimmy Bond: Agent 1/7
| Seasons 1, 4-6
| A parody of James Bond. Josh Server played Jimmy Bond, a teenage secret agent who often had to save the world from dangerous villains.

In later sketches "W" was replaced by "Z" (Nick Cannon). Jimmy's actual talent as a spy was questionable, but most of the villains were too strange or stupid to actually complete any evil plans.
The villains that Jimmy Bond fights included these:

| A parody of game shows, featuring host Jerry Fytootal (surname later changed to Futile), played by Josh Server. Three contestants, played by other cast members, would appear on the show. As the title suggested, it was quite literally impossible for the contestants to win. The first round featured quiz questions that either had no answer or were incomplete (a classic example: "How many shoes?"). In addition, certain events could trigger a massive loss of points, such as speaking when not supposed to, or saying a certain word (On one occasion, a contestant actually answered the question correctly; Jerry then claimed that he did not hear the contestant). After the quiz round, contestants would be asked to perform random and completely difficult tasks, such as transforming a sheep into a dolphin or putting their entire foot in their entire mouth in ten seconds, or speaking to a dog in another language. On one notable occasion, female bodybuilder Helga Schlumpkenfist (played by Danny Tamberelli) actually completed her task: eating 400 meatballs within 10 seconds.

| Dusty Pants
| Season 3-4
| A sketch about a dusty pants-wearing cowboy named Dusty Pants (played by Josh Server). His first appearance had him enrolled in Miss Fingerly's class while his other appearances had him in a wild wild west town. He would often end up in a fight with an outlaw cowboy named Nasty Nancy (played by Kenan Thompson) who's tagline has him quoting "you'd be nasty too if your name was Nancy." Before Dusty Pants and Nasty Nancy could go into their fight, there would be something that would prevent their duel from happening like Dusty Pants' Indian sidekick Chief Jerky telling Dusty Pants that his horse had to be rushed to the veterinarian hospital to an outlaw duo called the Slappy Brothers (played by Kel Mitchell and Leon Frierson) causing trouble enough for Dusty Pants and Nasty Nancy to team up to defeat them.

In Season 4, Maggot and Spew held an audition for a replacement member after Rash quit the band and they ended up with Bwah (played by Danny Tamberelli).
