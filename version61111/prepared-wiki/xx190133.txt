On May 2, 2012 it was announced that Luciano was no longer with NBC News, after it was found that the audio portion of the Trayvon Martin 9-1-1 call was edited in a manner that did not reflect the nature of the conversation and had the appearance of George Zimmerman making an unprompted statement that Martin was black instead as his direct answer to the 911 dispatcher's questions. NBC subsequently dismissed several employees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/business/media/tv-news-corrects-itself-just-not-on-the-air.html?pagewanted=all|title=TV Corrects Itself, Just Not on the Air|work=New York Times|author=David Carr|date=22 April 2012|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]

On 2 May 2012, it was reported that Luciano was no longer with NBC News. It was initially unclear if she was dismissed or resigned, but it was reported later she was fired.[tpl]cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/correspondent-involved-in-misleading-today-segment-leaves-nbc-news/|title=Correspondent Involved in Misleading ‘Today’ Segment Leaves NBC News|author=Brian Stelter|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl] A unnamed veteran NBC News producer and a local reporter, Jeff Burnside, were previously fired as a result of airing the misleading edited audio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/lilia-luciano-fired-misleading-edit_b125484|title=Another Misleading Edit Costs Another NBC News Employee Her Job|work=TVNewser.com|author=Chris Ariens|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]
All of Luciano's reports on the Trayvon Martin story which contained the misleading edit were removed from the Today website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/03/lilia-luciano-fired-nbc-news-george-zimmerman_n_1475454.html|title=Lilia Luciano Fired By NBC News Over Botched George Zimmerman Edit|work=The Huffington Post|author=Jack Mirkinson |date=3 May 2012|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]
NBC News president Steve Capus told Reuters that the edit, made by a Miami-based producer, was "a mistake and not a deliberate act to misrepresent the phone call." The network claimed that it was done in order to meet a maximum time requirement for the piece, a common pressure in morning television. The producer was subsequently fired and NBC News apologized for the error stating it was an "editing error in the production process."
On December 6, 2012, Luciano was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed against NBC by George Zimmerman with regard to the selective editing of Zimmerman's 911 call.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC Universal over edited 911 call|work=CNN.com|author=Michael Martinez|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=6 December 2012[/tpl] Zimmerman's criminal trial concluded with a "not guilty" jury verdict and acquittal on July 13, 2013, allowing his lawsuit to proceed.[tpl]cite news|title=How Will “Not Guilty” Verdict Affect George Zimmerman’s Libel Suit Against NBC| author=Ted Johnson|work=Variety|date=13 July 2013|url=http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/george-zimmerman-verdict-gives-new-twist-to-his-libel-suit-against-nbc-1200562075/|accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl]
