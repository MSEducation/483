Palumbo’s was a popular 20th century restaurant with nightclub entertainment located near the Italian Market section of South Philadelphia, Palumbo’s included a banquet hall and Nostalgia’s Restaurant. The format basically was an adaption of the music hall of the United Kingdom or vaudeville in the United States, showcasing live entertainment in a restaurant and saloon setting. It was owned by local celebrity/businessman/humanitarian Frank Palumbo. Amid unsubstantiated rumors of mafia connections, Palumbo expanded a boardinghouse started by his grandfather, Antonio Palumbo into the entertainment complex.[ref]

Well beyond the club’s heyday, the restaurant remained popular. Sinatra visited the “black tie saloon” frequently and Mayor Frank Rizzo spent most evenings there during his rise to power, years in office and beyond.[ref]

The banquet hall became a popular cultural tradition for many social groups, business organizations, family celebrations, and special events that were mostly attracted by the reasonable prices, menu items and entertainment. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
