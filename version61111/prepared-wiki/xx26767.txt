[[Metre per second]]

CATEGORIES: Units of velocity

Metre per second (U.S. spelling: meter per second) is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar) and velocity (vector quantity which specifies both magnitude and a specific direction), defined by distance in metres divided by time in seconds.
The SI unit symbols are m·s−1, m s−1, m/s, or [tpl]sfrac|m|s[/tpl],SI brochure, Section 5.1 sometimes (unofficially) abbreviated as "mps". Where metres per second are several orders of magnitude too slow to be convenient, such as in astronomical measurements, velocities may be given in kilometres per second, where 1 km/s is 1000 metres per second, sometimes unofficially abbreviated as "kps".

==Conversions==

1 m/s is equivalent to:
1 foot per second = 0.3048 m/s (exactly)
1 mile per hour = 0.44704 m/s (exactly)
1 km/h = 0.2[tpl]overline|7[/tpl] m/s (exactly)
1 kilometre per second is equivalent to:

==Relation to other measures==

Although m/s is an SI derived unit, it could be viewed as more fundamental than the metre, since the metre is now derived from the speed of light in vacuum, which is defined as exactly 299 792 458 m/s by the BIPM.BIPM - metre One metre per second is 1/299 792 458 of the speed of light in vacuum.
The benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second.  Although it has seen some support as a practical unit, primarily from German sources, it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity and has not seen widespread use or acceptance.
