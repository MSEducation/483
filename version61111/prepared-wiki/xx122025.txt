==History==

Llanhari is one of the older Welsh medium secondary schools in the area, having opened in 1974. It followed Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen in the vanguard of such schools in South Wales. Over time, it became apparent that Llanhari would not be able to cope with the pupil numbers, as it was oversubscribed, and in 1978, Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf opened in Cardiff in order to take the South Glamorgan pupils and relieve Llanhari.Merfyn Griffiths, 'Growth in Secondary Education in Mid Glamorgan', in Iolo Wyn Williams (ed.), Our Children's Language: The Welsh-medium Schools of Wales 1939â€“2003 (Talybont, 2003), p. 115; retrieved 23 September 2013. On the 6th of June 2011, it was publicly announced that from 2012 the school would incorporate a primary unit and become a 3-18 school. On September 3rd 2012, the Primary Unit was handed over to Mr Meirion Stephens and the school was formally designated a 3-18 school with the new name of Ysgol Llanhari.My Local School: Ysgol Llanhari; retrieved 23 September 2013.
