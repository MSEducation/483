</ref> XeO<sub>2</sub> forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice. Its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals.<ref name="ChemistryWhere2011">[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/471138d[/tpl]</ref> The XeOO<sup>+</sup> cation has been identified by [[infrared spectroscopy]] in solid [[argon]].<ref>

Xenon does not react with oxygen directly; the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of [tpl]chem|XeF|6[/tpl]:[ref]

[tpl]chem|XeO|3[/tpl] is weakly acidic, dissolving in alkali to form unstable xenate salts containing the [tpl]chem|HXeO|4|−[/tpl] anion. These unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and perxenate salts, containing the [tpl]chem|XeO|6|4−[/tpl] anion.[ref]

Barium perxenate, when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, yields gaseous xenon tetroxide:
To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9 °C into xenon and oxygen gas.
A number of xenon oxyfluorides are known, including [tpl]chem|XeOF|2[/tpl], [tpl]chem|XeOF|4[/tpl], [tpl]chem|XeO|2|F|2[/tpl], and [tpl]chem|XeO|3|F|2[/tpl]. [tpl]chem|XeOF|2[/tpl] is formed by the reaction of [tpl]chem|OF|2[/tpl] with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by the partial hydrolysis of [tpl]chem|XeF|4[/tpl]. It disproportionates at −20 °C into [tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|XeO|2|F|2[/tpl].[ref]
</ref> [tpl]chem|XeOF|4[/tpl] is formed by the partial hydrolysis of [tpl]chem|XeF|6[/tpl],<ref>
