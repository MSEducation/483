[[Fourth World (comics)]]

Fourth World is a storyline told through a metaseries of interconnecting comic book titles written and drawn by Jack Kirby, and published by DC Comics from 1970 to 1973. Although not marketed under this title originally, the term Fourth World or Jack Kirby's Fourth World is a retronym that has gained usage in the years since.

==Publication history==

===Initial 1970s comics===

Published as the newsstand distribution system for comics began to break down, Kirby foresaw a day when comics would need to find alternate, more legitimate venues for sale.Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus, Vol. 1. Afterword by Mark Evanier. Toward this end, Kirby envisioned a finite series that would be serialized and collected in one tome after the series had concluded.
The three original titles comprising the "Fourth World" were The Forever People, Mister Miracle and The New Gods.[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 145 |quote = As the writer, artist, and editor of the Fourth World family of interlocking titles, each of which possessed its own distinct tone and theme, Jack Kirby cemented his legacy as a pioneer of grand-scale storytelling.[/tpl] The pre-existing title Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen was used by Kirby to introduce the Fourth World concept and characters.
Unhappy with Marvel Comics at the time, as he had created or co-created a plethora of characters without having copyright or creative custody of them, he turned to rival publisher DC Comics, with his sketches and designs for a new group of heroes and villains.

[tpl]bquote|The idea of the New Gods had come to Jack years earlier, when he was plotting 90 percent of the "Tales of Asgard" stories in Thor. He wanted to have two planets at war and end with Ragnarok, the battle that would kill Thor's lucrative pantheon. Instead, he tried the idea in his Inhumans stories. Now he was presenting it in its original context. Though he wouldn't ever say it publicly, the New Gods books started right after the gods in Thor killed one another. The first page of Orion of the New Gods showed the same scenes from Thor — a planet torn in half and armored gods holding swords and dying on a fiery battleground.[tpl]Cite book | last=Ro | first=Ronin | title=Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution | page=148 | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=July 2004 | isbn=1-58234-345-4[/tpl][/tpl]
"The Fourth World" dealt with the battle between good and evil as represented by the worlds of New Genesis and Apokolips. Darkseid, the evil lord of Apokolips, seeks the Anti-Life Equation which will allow him to control the thoughts of all living beings. Opposing him is Orion, his son raised by Highfather and his enemies on New Genesis. Other characters caught in the deadly battle included the Forever People, an extension of the kid gang concept from the 1940s with a group of adolescents adventuring without an adult supervisor;[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Mister Miracle, a native of New Genesis raised on Apokolips who triumphed over a torturous childhood to become the world's greatest escape artist; and Lightray, the heroic warrior of New Genesis. Their adventures would take them to Earth where the war continued.
Kirby was writer and editor on each of the series. After learning that the books were going to be canceled, Kirby attempted to tie up the storylines in the final issues of each series.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The Fourth World characters reappeared in various titles and were fully integrated into the DC Universe. The 1982 "The Great Darkness Saga" storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2 is an early example of the characters being used in other DC titles.

===1984 reprint series===

In 1984, DC Comics reprinted Jack Kirby's original 11 issues of The New Gods in a six-issue limited series. The first five issues each reprinted two consecutive issues of the original series.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Issue six was originally to have included the final issue of The New Gods and a new 24-page story by Kirby intended to bring the saga to a close.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] However, Kirby clashed with DC editors who refused to publish Kirby's original planned ending to the series, in which Darkseid and Orion would die in a fiery battle in the streets of Armagetto.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Kirby responded by producing a one-off story called "On the Road to Armagetto", which DC also rejected since it failed to bring closure to the series.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Ultimately, a 48-page story, "Even Gods Must Die", was published in New Gods vol. 2, #6, which served as a lead-in to the 1985 graphic novel The Hunger Dogs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Hunger Dogs was designed to give an ending to the story of the New Gods, while fulfilling editorial mandates that the New Gods would be kept alive in order to ensure future use of the characters by later writers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] It incorporated several pages from the unpublished "On the Road to Armagetto" story and also brought Kirby's New Gods series to a close as the final battle between Orion and Darkseid is averted when the "hunger dogs", the tortured citizens of Apokolips, finally overthrow Darkseid and his regime, forcing Darkseid and his allies into exile.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.aai-nyc.org/cuchifritos/Exhibits/Cartoonisiada/index.html | title=Exhibits: Cartoonisiada | work=AAI-NYC.org | date=October 2, 2004 | accessdate=2010-10-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Later revivals===

Concurrent with DC's New Gods reprint series in 1984, Kirby worked on two Super Powers comic book limited series for DC Comics in which he continued the Fourth World characters and mythology.
A Forever People miniseries appeared in 1988. Mister Miracle and Jack Kirby's Fourth World series (the latter by John Byrne) were launched in the 1990s, and Orion had a solo series with art and story by Walt Simonson from 2000 to 2003. Mister Miracle was featured in the Giffen-DeMatteis incarnation of the Justice League. Giffen had been involved previously in the use of Fourth World elements in "The Great Darkness Saga", a Legion of Super-Heroes story appearing in 1982. The characters were prominently featured in Cosmic Odyssey, which led to a new New Gods series which was written by Mark Evanier and which fleshed out details about the history of many New Gods (most notably introducing Darkseid's father Yugo Sothern).   
Writer Grant Morrison also used some of the Fourth World mythology in various titles he worked on, including his run on JLA, with Orion and Big Barda becoming members and more recently in the Seven Soldiers metaseries, in which the New Gods, especially Mister Miracle,Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle #1-4 (November 2005 – May 2006) played a major role. They are also seen creating Aurakles, the first superhero.Seven Soldiers of Victory #1 (December 2006)
The Death of the New Gods limited series (October 2007 – April 2008) was written and drawn by Jim Starlin. Final Crisis brought the Fourth World to an end and brought about the dawn of the Fifth as Darkseid was forevermore destroyed and the heroic new Gods (sans Scott Free and Orion) are reborn and made guardians of Earth-51, home of Kamandi and the Great Disaster. 
With the reboot of the DC Universe following Flashpoint, however, the deaths of the New Gods and Darkseid have been removed from canon and the New Gods are still active. In particular, Darkseid and his uncle Steppenwolf and their attacks on the main DC Universe and Earth 2 play a major role in the rise of the superheroes: the Earth 2 versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman die fighting Steppenwolf while the Justice League form specifically to fight Darkseid and thwart his invasion of Earth.

==The Fifth World==

In December 2007, DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio was discussing the aftermath of Death of the New Gods and said, "It’s the advent of the Fifth World... I think we’ve telegraphed so much that the New Gods are coming upon a rebirth, and the story that we’re telling with them now is a continuation of the story that was established when Kirby first conceived the concept. Talk about death — Kirby blew up worlds at the start of the series. The story started with, 'The Old Gods Died!' which made room for the New Gods — we’re picking up that thread and launching the DCU into the future."[tpl]Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=140510 | title=Talking to Dan DiDio 2007, Part Two | work=Newsarama | date=December 21, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090203031252/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=140510|archivedate=Feb 3, 2009[/tpl]
That series led into Final Crisis and DiDio clarified things further, saying "the Fourth World is over. The battle between the forces of Darkseid and those of Highfather is over, and a new direction is in place for the characters in what will be deemed the Fifth World."[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120810-DiDio-20.html | title=Dan DiDio: 20 Answers, 1 Question - Batman and More | work=Newsarama | date=December 10, 2008[/tpl] The series' writer, Grant Morrison, added, "In Jack Kirby’s Fourth World books... it’s pretty clear that the New Gods have known about Earth for a long time and in JLA ten years ago, I suggested that part of their interest in us was rooted in the fact that Earth was destined to become the cradle of a new race of 'Fifth World' super-divinities — an eventuality Darkseid is eager to prevent from occurring."[tpl]Cite web | url=http://newsarama.com/comics/080609-MorrisonFC01.html | title=Grant Morrison on Final Crisis #1 | work=Newsarama | date=June 9, 2008[/tpl] It was during that run on JLA that Morrison had Metron deliver a speech outlining the general principles:
Later, in the JLA storyline "World War III," Metron's dialog is more specific: "As New Genesis is to the Fourth World, Earth shall be to the Fifth that is to come."JLA #40 (April 2000)
