==Reception==

The original pilot episode of Public Morals was scrapped because critics and some CBS affiliates believed the language was too vulgar. However, the episode that did air was also poorly received. Critics argued that the characters were one-dimensional and that some of the humor involved racial stereotypes.Allan Johnson. "Boorish Bochco: Stereotypical 'Public Morals' is nothing to laugh at".
