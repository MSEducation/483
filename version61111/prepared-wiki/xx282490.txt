The Wolfram Language is a highly general multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research, that serves as the main interfacing language for Mathematica.Celebrating Mathematicaâ€™s First Quarter Century It is designed to be as general as possible, with emphasis on symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming.What Should We Call the Language of Mathematica? It is built to represent arbitrary structures and data.
The language is very large, touching on numerous domains, often specialized. For example, it includes built-in functions for generating and running Turing machines, creating graphics and audio, analyzing 3D models, and solving differential equations.
It also has a large amount of documentation, but it is not standardized. A partial standardization is planned[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl], and an incomplete pre-release already exists.Wolfram Language & System Documentation Center
It is bundled with the system software installed on every Raspberry Pi.Putting the Wolfram Language (and Mathematica) on Every Raspberry Pihttp://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57613462-92/premium-mathematica-software-free-on-budget-raspberry-pi/ Intel Edison, introduced at CES 2014, also integrates the language.http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Intels-Edison-Pentium-System-im-Format-einer-SD-Karte-2076917.htmlhttp://tech.ca.msn.com/intel-ceo-points-toward-wearable-future-with-%E2%80%98smart-earbud%E2%80%99-smartwatch-1 The language will also be integrated in the Unity game engine.The Wolfram Language will soon be integrated into Unity

==Naming==

Despite existing in some form for more than 25 years, the name of the language was not officially announced until June 2013.Stephen Wolfram has an algorithm for everything ReadWriteWeb Before this it was internally referred to by several names, such as "M" and "Wolfram Language". Many other possible names were considered, such as "Lingua" and "Express", while it is often erroneously called "Mathematica", after its main implementation.
