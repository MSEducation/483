[[Texas State Highway 124]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Texas

State Highway 124 or SH 124 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The highway begins along the Gulf Coast near the northeast end of the Bolivar Peninsula at [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|87|in=High Island[/tpl] and extends to the northeast ending at [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|69[/tpl] and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|96|in=Beaumont[/tpl]. In between, the highway has major intersections with [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|65|in=Stowell[/tpl] and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|73|in=Winnie[/tpl]. The highway is located in Galveston, Chambers, and Jefferson counties and also serves the communities of Hamshire, Fannett, and Cheek. A portion of SH 124 is part of a longer coastal hurricane evacuation route.
The route number was originally assigned over a portion of the current [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|16[/tpl] between Fredericksburg and Comanche in Central Texas during the late 1920s. By the early 1930s, the route number was assigned along the current route south of Stowell to High Island and along the current SH 87 to Port Bolivar and eventually Galveston. By the end of the decade, the highway received its current High Island to Beaumont configuration.

SH 124 begins at SH 87 in High Island along the Gulf Coast near the northeastern end of the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|600|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] SH 87 from this point toward Sabine Pass has been closed since 1990 due to coastal erosion.[tpl]cite web|title=Texas 87, High Island to Sabine Pass|publisher=TexasFreeway.com|url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Statewide/Statewide/abandoned/TX87_closed/87_eroded.shtml|accessdate=2011-02-02[/tpl] The highway proceeds to the north climbing up a salt dome[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hlh44|title=High Island, TX|first=A.

The highway leaves the marshland and continues north with [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1985[/tpl] branching to the west and then [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1941[/tpl]. Further north, the highway passes through Stowell where SH 65 branches off to the west. In Stowell and Winnie, the route is known as Gulfway Drive south of SH 73.[tpl]Google maps|title=Route of SH 124|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=TX-124+N&daddr=TX-124+N+to:TX-124+N+to:Gulfway+Dr+to:Gulfway+Dr+to:Gulfway+Dr+to:TX-124+N%2FTX-73+E+to:TX-124+N%2FTX-73+E+to:TX-124+N+to:TX-124+N%2FFannett+Rd+to:Fannett+Rd&geocode=FbzjwgEd9r5f-g%3BFRjRxAEdbvZf-g%3BFT5pxQEdYvNf-g%3BFVyaxgEdNtRf-g%3BFRgGxwEd0NBf-g%3BFXQdxwEd0NBf-g%3BFbQZxwEd7jlg-g%3BFfYYxwEdvEhg-g%3BFXCiyAEd0Nhh-g%3BFebLyQEdQt5i-g%3BFeZrygEdBKhj-g&gl=us&hl=en&mra=mi&mrcr=9&mrsp=10&sz=19&sll=30.043055,-94.132292&sspn=0.00121,0.00327&ie=UTF8&ll=29.807284,-94.217377&spn=0.620822,1.674042&z=10|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] The highway intersects [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1406[/tpl] in Winnie and then turns east along SH 73 meeting the terminus of FM 1406 on the town's eastern edge at the boundary with Jefferson County.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|599|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

SH 124 was originally designated along a route from Fredericksburg to Comanche passing through Llano, San Saba, and Goldthwaite between 1926[tpl]cite map|publisher=Texas State Highway Commission|title=Official Highway Map of Texas|url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/aris/maps/maplookup.php?mapnum=6185|edition=1926|scale=1"=30 mi.|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] and 1928. By 1933, that previous route was reassigned [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|81[/tpl] and is now part of SH 16, while SH 124 was designated over a new route from Port Bolivar along the current SH 87 to High Island, and then over the current SH 124 to Stowell. The route terminated in Stowell at [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|125[/tpl] which then was made up of the present SH 65 between Stowell and Anahuac and the current SH 124 to Beaumont. The state highway department assumed control of the ferry service between Port Bolivar and Galveston in 1930 and resumed operations in 1934[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.galveston.com/galvestonferry/|title=Galveston Island Ferry|work=Galveston Island|publisher=Galveston.com & Company, Inc.|accessdate=2011-02-02[/tpl] after making extensive renovations[tpl]cite web|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/116324|title=Ferry connects two old communities|first=Rhiannon|last=Meyers|publisher=The Galveston County Daily News|accessdate=2011-02-02[/tpl] extending SH 124 to [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|75[/tpl] and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|6[/tpl] in Galveston.
During the 1939 general redescription of the state's highway system, the portion of SH 124 from Galveston to High Island was renamed as an extension of SH 87,[tpl]TxDOT|SH|87|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] while SH 125 between Anahuac and Stowell was renamed as part of SH 73[tpl]TxDOT|SH|73|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] and SH 124 was extended over the remainder of SH 125 including a concurrent portion of SH 73 between Stowell and Winnie to Beaumont terminating at US 90.[tpl]cite map|publisher=Texas State Highway Department|title=General Highway Map, Jefferson County, Texas|url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/aris/maps/maplookup.php?mapnum=4906|edition=1936|date=Partially revised to February 1, 1940|scale=1"=2 mi.|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] SH 124 was shortened within Beaumont in 1953 to its present terminus at the US 69 and US 96 bypass. In 1961, SH 73 was designated as terminating at I-10 in Winnie, and SH 65 was designated over the former portion of SH 73 between Anahuac and Stowell.[tpl]TxDOT|SH|65|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl]
