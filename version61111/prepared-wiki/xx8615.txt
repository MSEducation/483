National anthems are usually written in the most common language of the state, whether de facto or official. For example, India's anthem "Jana Gana Mana" is written in a Sanskritized version of Bengali, which are both official languages of India.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1894028.cms|title=This town cherishes Tagore |publisher="The Times of India"|date=2006-08-15 [/tpl] States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://www.ch.ch/schweiz/01063/01065/index.html?lang=en|title=Facts and figures |publisher=Government of Switzerland [/tpl] The New Zealand national anthem is traditionally sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand").
