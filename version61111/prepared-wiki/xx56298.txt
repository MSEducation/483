Nondestructive testing or Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.[tpl]cite book|last=Cartz|first=Louis|title=Nondestructive Testing|publisher= A S M International|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87170-517-4[/tpl]
The terms Nondestructive examination (NDE), Nondestructive inspection (NDI), and Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.
Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. Common NDT methods include ultrasonic, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, remote visual inspection (RVI), eddy-current testing, and low coherence interferometry.[tpl]cite doi|10.1784/insi.47.4.216.63149[/tpl]
NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.

==Methods==

NDT methods may rely upon use of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and inherent properties of materials to examine samples.  This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness.  The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays or neutrons. Sound waves are utilized in the case of ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks.  One method (liquid penetrant testing) involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals.  Another commonly used method for magnetic materials involves using a liquid suspension of fine iron particles applied to a part while it is in an externally applied magnetic field (magnetic-particle testing).
Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical spot test method, utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.
Analyzing and documenting a non-destructive failure mode can also be accomplished using a high-speed camera recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplish using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera.  These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture some non-destructive failures.[tpl]cite web|last= Bridges |first= Andrew |title=High Speed Cameras for Non-Destructive Testing |url=http://www.techbriefs.com/subscribe-footer-67/23-ntb/features/feature-articles38/17720-high-speed-cameras-for-non-destructive-testing?showall=1&limitstart=|accessdate= 1 November 2013|publisher=NASA TechBriefs[/tpl]  After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording.  The capture images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happen before, during and after the non-destructive event, image by image.

==Applications==

===Weld verification===

In manufacturing, welds are commonly used to join two or more metal parts. Because these connections may encounter loads and fatigue during product lifetime, there is a chance that they may fail if not created to proper specification.  For example, the base metal must reach a certain temperature during the welding process, must cool at a specific rate, and must be welded with compatible materials or the joint may not be strong enough to hold the parts together, or cracks may form in the weld causing it to fail.  The typical welding defects (lack of fusion of the weld to the base metal, cracks or porosity inside the weld, and variations in weld density) could cause a structure to break or a pipeline to rupture.
Welds may be tested using NDT techniques such as industrial radiography or industrial CT scanning using X-rays or gamma rays, ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing, magnetic particle inspection or via eddy current. In a proper weld, these tests would indicate a lack of cracks in the radiograph, show clear passage of sound through the weld and back, or indicate a clear surface without penetrant captured in cracks.
Welding techniques may also be actively monitored with acoustic emission techniques before production to design the best set of parameters to use to properly join two materials.[tpl]cite book|last=Blitz|first=Jack|coauthor=G. Simpson|title=Ultrasonic Methods of Non-Destructive Testing|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|year=1991|isbn=978-0-412-60470-6[/tpl] In the case of high stress or safety critical welds, weld monitoring will be employed to confirm the specified welding parameters (arc current,arc voltage, travel speed, heat input etc.) are being adhered to those stated in the welding procedure. This verifies the weld as correct to procedure prior to nondestructive evaluation and metallurgy tests.

===Structural mechanics===

Structure can be complex systems that undergo different loads during their lifetime. Some complex structures, such as the turbo machinery in a liquid-fuel rocket, can also cost millions of dollars. Engineers will commonly model these structures as coupled second-order systems, approximating dynamic structure components with springs, masses, and dampers. The resulting sets of differential equations are then used to derive a transfer function that models the behavior of the system.
In NDT, the structure undergoes a dynamic input, such as the tap of a hammer or a controlled impulse. Key properties, such as displacement or acceleration at different points of the structure, are measured as the corresponding output. This output is recorded and compared to the corresponding output given by the transfer function and the known input. Differences may indicate an inappropriate model (which may alert engineers to unpredicted instabilities or performance outside of tolerances), failed components, or an inadequate control system.

===Radiography in medicine===

As a system, the human body is difficult to model as a complete transfer function. Elements of the body, however, such as bones or molecules, have a known response to certain radiographic inputs, such as x-rays or magnetic resonance. Coupled with the controlled introduction of a known element, such as digested barium, radiography can be used to image parts or functions of the body by measuring and interpreting the response to the radiographic input. In this manner, many bone fractures and diseases may be detected and localized in preparation for treatment. X-rays may also be used to examine the interior of mechanical systems in manufacturing using NDT techniques, as well.

==Notable events in early industrial NDT==

(Basic Source for above: Hellier, 2001) Note the number of advancements made during the WWII era, a time when industrial quality control was growing in importance.

==Applications==

NDT is used in a variety of settings that covers a wide range of industrial activity, with new NDT methods and applications, being continuously developed. NDT services  SGS S.A, Non-Destructive Testing are not only integrated with Asset Integrity Management (AIM) solutions, but also with Material Testing laboratories and seamlessly fit into Supply Chain services.

==Methods and techniques==

NDT is divided into various methods of nondestructive testing, each based on a particular scientific principle. These methods may be further subdivided into various techniques. The various methods and techniques, due to their particular natures, may lend themselves especially well to certain applications and be of little or no value at all in other applications. Therefore choosing the right method and technique is an important part of the performance of NDT.

==Personnel training, qualification and certification==

Successful and consistent application of nondestructive testing techniques depends heavily on personnel training, experience and integrity. Personnel involved in application of industrial NDT methods and interpretation of results should be certified, and in some industrial sectors certification is enforced by law or by the applied codes and standards.

===Definitions===

The following definitions for qualification and certification are given in ISO 9712:
In US standards and codes, while a very similar definition of qualification is included in ASNT SNT-TC-1A, certification is simply defined as: "Written testimony of qualification".
In the aerospace sector, EN 4179:2009 contains the following definitions:EN 4179: "Aerospace series. Qualification and approval of personnel for non-destructive testing" (2009)

===Training===

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) training is provided for people working in many industries. It is generally necessary that the candidate successfully completes a theoretical and practical training program, as well as have performed several hundred hours of practical application of the particular method they wish to be trained in. At this point, they may pass a certification examination.  While online training has become more popular, many certifying bodys will require additional practical training.

===Certification schemes===

There are two approaches in personnel certification:[tpl]cite conference|author=John Thompson|title=Global review of qualification and certification of personnel for NDT and condition monitoring|conference=12th A-PCNDT 2006 – Asia-Pacific Conference on NDT|date=November 2006|location=Auckland, New Zealand[/tpl]
In the United States employer based schemes are the norm, however central certification schemes exist as well. The most notable is ASNT Level III (established in 1976-1977), which is organized by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing for Level 3 NDT personnel.[tpl]cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.25[/tpl] NAVSEA 250-1500 is another US central certification scheme, specifically developed for use in the naval nuclear program.[tpl]cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.26[/tpl]
Central certification is more widely used in the European Union, where certifications are issued by accredited bodies (independent organizations conforming to ISO 17024 and accredited by a national accreditation authority like UKAS). The Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC) actually enforces central personnel certification for the initial testing of steam boilers and some categories of pressure vessels and piping.Directive 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment, Annex I, paragraph 3.1.3 European Standards harmonized with this directive specify personnel certification to EN 473. Certifications issued by a national NDT society which is a member of the European Federation of NDT (EFNDT) are mutually acceptable by the other member societies EFNDT/SEC/P/05-006: Agreement for EFNDT multilateral recognition of NDT personnel certification schemes (2005) under a multilateral recognition agreement.
Canada also implements an ISO 9712 central certification scheme, which is administered by Natural Resources Canada, a government department.http://www.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/smm-mms/ndt-end/index-eng.htm : The NDT Certifying Agency (CANMET-MTL)The relevant national standard for Canada is CAN/CGSB-48.9712-2006 "Qualification and Certification of Non-Destructive Testing Personnel.", which complies with the requirements of ISO 9712:2005 and EN 473:2000.[tpl]cite book |author=Charles Hellier |title=Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-028121-1|pages=1.27[/tpl]
The aerospace sector worldwide sticks to employer based schemes.R. Marini and P. Ranos: "Current Issues in Qualification and Certification of Non-Destructive Testing Personnel in the Aerospace Industry", ECNDT 2006 - Th.3.6.5 In America it is based mostly on AIA-NAS-410 AIA-NAS-410: "Aerospace Industries Association, National Aerospace Standard, NAS Certification and Qualification of Nondestructive Test Personnel" and in the European Union on the equivalent and very similar standard EN 4179.  However EN 4179:2009 includes an option for central qualification and certification by a National aerospace NDT board or NANDTB (paragraph 4.5.2).

===Levels of certification===

Most NDT personnel certification schemes listed above specify three "levels" of qualification and/or certification, usually designated as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 (although some codes specify Roman numerals, like Level II). The roles and responsibilities of personnel in each level are generally as follows (there are slight differences or variations between different codes and standards):

==Terminology==

The standard US terminology for Nondestructive testing is defined in standard ASTM E-1316.ASTM E-1316: "Standard Terminology for Nondestructive Examinations", The American Society for Testing and Materials, in Volume 03.03 NDT, 1997 Some definitions may be different in European standard EN 1330.

==Reliability and statistics==

Probability of detection (POD) tests are a standard way to evaluate a nondestructive testing technique in a given set of circumstances, for example "What is the POD of lack of fusion flaws in pipe welds using manual ultrasonic testing?" The POD will usually increase with flaw size. A common error in POD tests is to assume that the percentage of flaws detected is the POD, whereas the percentage of flaws detected is merely the first step in the analysis. Since the number of flaws tested is necessarily a limited number (non-infinite), statistical methods must be used to determine the POD for all possible defects, beyond the limited number tested. Another common error in POD tests is to define the statistical sampling units (test items) as flaws, whereas a true sampling unit is an item that may or may not contain a flaw.[tpl]cite journal|author=T.
