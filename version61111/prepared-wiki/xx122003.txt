</ref> As the area grew, traffic congestion became a major problem, particularly on Olentangy River Road as residents commuted to jobs at Ohio State campus and Downtown Columbus. A new freeway called the Olentangy Freeway - later designated [[Ohio State Route 315|State Route 315]] - was proposed by city and state officials in the early 1960s.
Many problems were encountered during the process to determine the route. Officials at the Ohio State University objected to the new road running through parts of campus and causing disruption to the students and faculty.[ref]
</ref> This resulted in the route being shifted west to run adjacent to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad tracks where it approaches the campus from the south.<ref>
</ref> The reconfigured route required highway officials to purchase and remove a commercial building, part of the University City subdivision, and an undeveloped part of Union Cemetery. However, the owners of the Cemetery strongly objected to having their property taken for the realignment to bypass OSU.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> The Cemetery obtained a permanent injunction in 1967 to prevent construction through its land and suggested a tunnel under the property be built instead.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> The Ohio legislature then passed a bill to amend a statue and allow the right of way to be purchased for the freeway to pass through the cemetery property.<ref>
</ref> Many homeowners further north also objected to having the freeway run near the river and ruining the scenic nature of the area, as well as expressing concern about safety problems from heavy fog that sometimes forms in the valley.<ref>
</ref> As a compromise, state officials proposed purchasing and developing land in the area for parks.<ref>

</ref> The section between Kinnear Road and Ackerman road was opened on August 7, 1972 after more than a decade of wrangling.<ref>
</ref> The impasse with Union Cemetery was resolved in 1975. However, due to the years of delays, construction costs for the section through the cemetery came in higher than the original projections for the entire freeway from downtown to Worthington.<ref>
