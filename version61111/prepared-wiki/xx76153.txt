==Career==

Glover originally worked in city administration working on community development[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] before transitioning to theater. He has said:
"I didn't think it was a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a conveyer for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given not only my learning disability (dyslexia) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6'3" or 6'4" feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be and would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/glover_interview.html|work=Ability Magazine | title=Actor and Activist, Danny Glover|accessdate=April 6, 2012[/tpl]
His first theater involvement was with Conservatory Theater, a regional training program in San Francisco."Danny Glover: Dean of African American Character Actors, Global Humanitarian" by Jon C.

Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the Robey Theatre Company with actor Ben Guillory in honor of the actor and concert singer Paul Robeson in Los Angeles in 1994.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Glover has had a variety of film, stage, and television roles, and is best known for playing Los Angeles police Sergeant Roger Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon series of action films.

In 1994 he made his directorial debut with the Showtime channel short film Override. Also in 1994, Glover and actor Ben Guillory formed the Robey Theatre Company in Los Angeles, focusing on theatre by and about Black people.

Coleman-Adebayo was terminated shortly after she revealed the environmental and human disaster taking place in the Brits, South Africa, vanadium mines.
