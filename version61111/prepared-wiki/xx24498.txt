Jack St. Clair Kilby (November 8, 1923 – June 20, 2005) was an American electrical engineer who took part (along with Robert Noyce) in the realization of the first integrated circuit while working at Texas Instruments (TI) in 1958. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2000.The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2013-11-21.
He is also the inventor of the handheld calculator and the thermal printer.

==Life and career==

Born in Jefferson City, Missouri, Jack Kilby grew up and attended school in Great Bend, Kansas, graduating from Great Bend High School. (Road signs at the entrances to the town commemorate his time there, and the Commons Area at Great Bend High School has been named The Jack Kilby Commons Area.)
Kilby received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is an honorary member of Acacia Fraternity. In 1947, he received a degree in Electrical Engineering. He obtained his master of science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Extension in Milwaukee (which later became the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee) in 1950, while simultaneously working at Centralab in Milwaukee.
In mid-1958, Kilby, as a newly employed engineer at Texas Instruments (TI), did not yet have the right to a summer vacation. He spent the summer working on the problem in circuit design that was commonly called the "tyranny of numbers" and finally came to the conclusion that manufacturing the circuit components en masse in a single piece of semiconductor material could provide a solution. On September 12 he presented his findings to management, which included Mark Shepherd. He showed them a piece of germanium with an oscilloscope attached, pressed a switch, and the oscilloscope showed a continuous sine wave, proving that his integrated circuit worked and thus that he had solved the problem. U.S. Patent 3,138,743 for "Miniaturized Electronic Circuits", the first integrated circuit, was filed on February 6, 1959.[tpl]cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/index.html|accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl] Along with Robert Noyce (who independently made a similar circuit a few months later), Kilby is generally credited[tpl]by whom|date=March 2014[/tpl] as co-inventor of the integrated circuit.
Jack Kilby went on to pioneer military, industrial, and commercial applications of microchip technology. He headed teams that built both the first military system and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. He later co-invented both the hand-held calculator and the thermal printer that was used in portable data terminals.
In 1970, he took a leave of absence from TI to work as an independent inventor. He explored, among other subjects, the use of silicon technology for generating electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984 he held the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University.
In 1983, Kilby retired from Texas Instruments.
Kilby died June 20, 2005 at the age of 81, in Dallas, Texas, following a brief battle with cancer.
On December 14, 2005, Texas Instruments created the Historic TI Archives. The Jack Kilby family donated his personal manuscripts and his personal photograph collection to Southern Methodist University (SMU). The collection will be cataloged and stored at DeGolyer Library, SMU.
In 2008, the SMU School of Engineering, with the DeGolyer Library and the Library of Congress, hosted a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the digital age with Jack Kilby’s Nobel Prize-winning invention of the integrated circuit. Symposia and exhibits examined the many ways in which technology and engineers shaped the modern world. Jack Kilby held an honorary Doctorate of Science from SMU and was a longtime associate of SMU through the Kilby Foundation.

==Awards and honors==

Recognition of Kilby’s outstanding achievements have been made by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), including the election to IEEE Fellow in 1966, the IEEE David Sarnoff Award in 1966,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/sarnoff_rl.pdf |title=IEEE David Sarnoff Award Recipients |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2011|12|6[/tpl][/tpl] co-recipient of the first IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award in 1978,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/brunetti_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award Recipients |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2011|12|6[/tpl][/tpl] the IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984 and the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1986.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Medal of Honor Recipients |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2011|12|6[/tpl][/tpl] He was co-recipient of the Franklin Institute’s Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1966.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&ln=&fn=&keyword=&subject=&award=BAL++&sy=1965&ey=1967&name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database - Stuart Ballantine Medal 1966 Laureates |publisher=Franklin Institute |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2011|12|6[/tpl][/tpl] In 1982 and 1989, he received the Holley Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/holley-medal |title=Holley Medal |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2011|12|6[/tpl][/tpl] He was elected to member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1967,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/MembersSection/Directory20412/29087.aspx |title=NAE Members Directory - Mr. Jack S.

He is also the recipient of the nation’s most prestigious honors in science and engineering:  the National Medal of Science in 1969 and the National Medal of Technology in 1990. In 1982, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
In 1993 he was awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize by the Inamori Foundation. He was awarded both the Washington Award, administered by the Western Society of Engineers and the Eta Kappa Nu Vladimir Karapetoff Award in 1999. In 2000, Kilby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his breakthrough discovery, and delivered his personal view of the industry and its history in his acceptance speech.
Kilby was awarded nine honorary doctorate degrees from Universities including Southern Methodist University, the University of Miami, University of Illinois, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Texas A&M University, Yale and Rochester Institute of Technology. The National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan awarded Kilby with a certificate of Honorary Professorship in 1998.
The Kilby Center, TI's research center for silicon manufacturing, is named after him.
The Jack Kilby Computer Centre at the Merchiston Campus of Edinburgh Napier University in Edinburgh is also named in his honor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.napier.ac.uk/soc/studying/Pages/facilities.aspx |title=School of Computing - Facilities & Resources |publisher=Edinburgh Napier University |accessdate=[tpl]Format date|2012|7|24[/tpl][/tpl]
