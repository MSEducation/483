CATEGORIES: Wine regions of South Australia, Barossa Valley

The Barossa Valley is a major wine-producing region and tourist destination of South Australia, located 60 km northeast of Adelaide. It is the valley formed by the North Para River, and the Barossa Valley Way is the main road through the valley, connecting the main towns on the valley floor of Nuriootpa, Tanunda, Rowland Flat and Lyndoch.

==History==

The Barossa Valley derives its name from the Barossa Ranges, which were named by Colonel William Light in 1837. Light chose the name in memory of the British victory over the French in the Battle of Barrosa'''', in which he fought in 1811. The name "Barossa" was registered in error, due to a clerical error in transcribing the name "Barrosa". The area is approximately 13 km long by 14 km wide.
The three major towns of the Barossa each have a distinctive personality. Tanunda is generally recognised as the most German of the three with long-standing traditions dating back to the 1840s when the first German settlers arrived in the area. Because many of them came from Prussian Silesia, they called the Barossa Neu-Schlesien, or "New Silesia".LeRoy R. Hafen. Broken Hand. U of Nebraska Press, 1981. ISBN 0-8032-7208-1 The German influence survives to this day (see Barossa German). Angaston, in contrast, is considered the English town as it was settled predominantly by Cornish miners and others from Britain. The third (and largest) town, Nuriootpa, was influenced by both the German and British settlers, and today is the commercial hub of the Barossa where most of the larger stores are located. Tanunda and Angaston are considered 'tourist towns' in comparison to Nuriootpa because they have many more facilities to cater for tourists. However Nuriootpa does have many attractions too.

==People==

Currently, the Barossa Valley has a population of about 20,000, most of whom live in Tanunda, Nuriootpa, Angaston, Williamstown and Lyndoch, each having over 1000 people, with a few smaller towns such as Moculta and Springton. All of these towns are part of the Barossa local government. Many facilities not available in these towns are usually supplemented in nearby Gawler. In recent years, increased development in the area has seen opposition from the local communities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]

===Religion===

The region has a strong German Lutheran history, and many residents identify themselves as Lutherans.  Some towns have more than one Lutheran church.  Tanunda, for example, has Langmeil, Tabor, St. Paul's and St. Johns. Nuriootpa has St. Petri and Holy Trinity.  Angaston has Zion and Salem (Penrice).
Each major town also has a Lutheran primary school.  Tanunda has Tanunda Lutheran School, Nuriootpa has Redeemer, and Angaston has Good Shepherd.  St. Jakobi, the Lutheran primary school at Lyndoch, hosts the Barossa Airshow annually as its fundraiser.

==Wine industry==

The wine industry plays a major role in the Barossa, being the main source of employment for many residents.  The many hectares of vineyard are the most distinctive feature of the area, especially when viewed from the Mengler Hill lookout positioned on the range of hills that form one side of the valley itself.   The success of the wine industry has historically been celebrated every two years with a week-long Barossa Valley Vintage Festival.  The festival draws visitors from all over the world and has entertainment for all tastes including a huge street parade, concerts and gourmet dining.
The Barossa Valley is primarily known for its red wine, in particular Shiraz. NormallyWhite, Robert E. Soils for Fine Wines.

==Food production==

Although it is overshadowed by the wine industry, significant food production occurs in the Barossa Valley,http://www.foodbarossa.com/ including:
Barossa foods have a reputation for their quality and local production is increasing. Barossa food products are sold in local markets and shops, and served in local cafés and restaurants. Many are exported internationally, and to other parts of Australia for sale through retailers or for restaurant use.
