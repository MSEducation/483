"La Marseillaise" ([tpl]IPA-fr|la maʁsɛjɛz[/tpl]) is the national anthem of France.
The song was written and composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle during the French Revolutionary Wars, and was originally titled "Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin". The French National Convention adopted it as the Republic's anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital.
The song is the first example of the "European march" anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music (see below: Musical quotations).  Cerulo says, "the design of "La Marseillaise" is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said
to have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'"Karen A. Cerulo, "Symbols and the world system: national anthems and flags." Sociological Forum (1993) 8#2 pp. 243-271.

==History==

As the French Revolution continued, the monarchies of Europe became concerned that revolutionary fervor would spread to their countries. The War of the First Coalition was an effort to stop the revolution, or at least contain it to France. Initially, the French army did not distinguish itself, and Coalition armies invaded France.  On 25 April 1792, the mayor of Strasbourg requested his guest Rouget de Lisle compose a song "that will rally our soldiers from all over to defend their homeland that is under threat".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/la_marseillaise.asp|title=La Marseillaise|publisher=National Assembly of France|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] That evening, Rouget de Lisle wrote Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin[tpl]cite book|last=Weber|first=Eugen|title=Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870–1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4KnC4ROsiwwC&pg=PA439|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=1 June 1976|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1013-8|page=439[/tpl] (English: "War Song for the Army of the Rhine"), and dedicated the song to Marshal Nicolas Luckner, a Bavarian in French service from Cham.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Benjamin F.|date=January 1896|title=Story of La Marseillaise|journal=The Musical Record|publisher=Oliver Ditson Company|location=Boston, Massachusetts|issue=408|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qWYPAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA7-PA2|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] The melody soon became the rallying call to the French Revolution and was adopted as La Marseillaise after the melody was first sung on the streets by volunteers (fédérés in French) from Marseille by the end of May. These fédérés were making their entrance into the city of Paris on 30 July 1792 after a young volunteer from Montpellier called François Mireur had sung it at a patriotic gathering in Marseille, and the troops adopted it as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. A newly graduated medical doctor, Mireur later became a general under Napoléon Bonaparte and died in Egypt at age 28.[tpl]citation needed|date = April 2014[/tpl]
The song's lyrics reflect the invasion of France by foreign armies (from Prussia and Austria) that were underway when it was written. Strasbourg itself was attacked just a few days later. The invading forces were repulsed from France following their defeat in the Battle of Valmy. As the vast majority of Alsatians did not speak French, a German version (Auf, Brüder, auf dem Tag entgegen) was published in October 1792 in Colmar.Wochenblatt, dem Unterricht des Landvolks gewidmet, Colmar 1792 http://mfa.allegronet.de/page.php?urG=SER&urS=wochenblatt,%20dem%20unterricht%20des%20landvolks%20gewidmet.
The Convention accepted it as the French national anthem in a decree passed on 14 July 1795, making it France's first anthem.[tpl]Cite book|last=Mould |first=Michael |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-82573-6 |page=147 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&pg=PA147 |accessdate=23 November 2011[/tpl] It later lost this status under Napoleon I, and the song was banned outright by Louis XVIII and Charles X, only being re-instated briefly after the July Revolution of 1830.Modern History Sourcebook: La Marseillaise, 1792. During Napoleon I's reign, Veillons au Salut de l'Empire was the unofficial anthem of the regime, and in Napoleon III's reign, it was Partant pour la Syrie. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, "La Marseillaise" was recognised as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement; as such, it was adopted by the Paris Commune in 1871. Eight years later, in 1879, it was restored as France's national anthem, and has remained so ever since.[tpl]citation needed|date = April 2014[/tpl]

==Arrangements==

"La Marseillaise" was arranged for soprano, chorus and orchestra by Hector Berlioz in about 1830.

During World War I, bandleader James Reese Europe played a jazz version of "La Marseillaise", which can be heard on Part 2 of the Ken Burns TV documentary "Jazz".
Serge Gainsbourg recorded a reggae version in 1978, titled "Aux Armes, Et Caetera".
Henrik Wergeland wrote a Norwegian version of the song in 1831, called "The Norwegian Marseillaise".
In Peru and Chile, both the Partido Aprista Peruano and the Socialist Party of Chile wrote their own versions of "La Marseillaise" to be their anthems.

Only the first verse (and sometimes the fifth and sixth) and the first chorus are sung today in France. There are some slight historical variations in the lyrics of the song; the following is the version listed at the official website of the French Presidency.La Marseillaise, l’Elysée.

==Historical use in Russia==

In Russia, La Marseillaise was used as a republican revolutionary anthem by those who knew French starting in the 18th century, almost simultaneously with its adoption in France. In 1875 Peter Lavrov, a narodist revolutionary and theorist, wrote a Russian-language text (not a translation of the French one) to the same melody. This "Worker's Marseillaise" became one of the most popular revolutionary songs in Russia and was used in the Revolution of 1905. After the February Revolution of 1917, it was used as the semi-official national anthem of the new Russian republic. Even after the October Revolution, it remained in use for a while alongside The Internationale.Соболева, Н.А. 2005. Из истории  отечественных государственных гимнов.
