[[Tua railway station]]

CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Portugal

Tua Station is located in northern Portugal, close to the confluence between the Douro and the Tua River. The station opened in 1883, being the eastern terminus of the Douro line until extended as far as the Spanish border in 1887.
Although the station is still served by Comboios de Portugal (CP) main line trains on the Douro line to/from Oporto, it was formerly the junction for the scenic, narrow-gauge Tua line to Mirandela and Bragan√ßa. The Tua line closed in 2008.
