Acetophenone is the organic compound with the formula C6H5C(O)CH3. It is the simplest aromatic ketone. This colourless, viscous liquid is a precursor to useful resins and fragrances.Hardo Siegel, Manfred Eggersdorfer “Ketones” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2002, Wienheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_077[/tpl]

==Production==

Acetophenone can be obtained by  a variety of methods. In industry, acetophenone is recovered as a by-product of the oxidation of ethylbenzene, which mainly gives ethylbenzene hydroperoxide for use in the production of propylene oxide.

==Uses==

===Precursor to resins===

Commercially significant resins are produced from treatment of acetophenone with formaldehyde and base.  The resulting polymers are conventionally described with the formula C6H5C(O)CHx(CH2)x]n, resulting from aldol condensation.  These substances are components of coatings and inks.  Modified acetophenone-formaldehyde resins are produced by the hydrogenation of the aforementioned ketone-containing resins.  The resulting polyol can be further crosslinked with diisocyanates.  These modified resins are again found in coatings, inks, as well as adhesives.

===Use in pharmaceutical and related areas===

Acetophenone is a raw material for the synthesis of some pharmaceuticals, examples include dextropropoxyphene and phenylpropanolamine.
 

===Niche uses===

Acetophenone is an ingredient in fragrances that resemble almond, cherry, honeysuckle, jasmine, and strawberry. It is used in chewing gum.[ref]

It is also listed as an approved excipient by the U.S. FDA.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/iig/index.cfm In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies in the U.S., acetophenone was listed as one of the 599 additives to cigarettes.

===Laboratory reagent===

In instructional laboratories,[tpl]cn|date=August 2013[/tpl] acetophenone is converted to styrene in a two step process that illustrates the reduction of carbonyls and the dehydration of alcohols:[tpl]huh|date=August 2013[/tpl]
A similar process is used industrially but the hydrogenation step to 1-phenylethanol is done over a copper catalyst.
Being prochiral, acetophenone is also a popular test substrate for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation experiments.

==Natural occurrence==

Acetophenone occurs naturally in many foods including apple, cheese, apricot, banana, beef, and cauliflower. It is also a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature beaver.Pheromonal activity of single castoreum constituents in beaver,Castor canadensis., Müller-Schwarze, D and Houlihan, P.W., Journal of Chemical Ecology, April 1991, Volume 17, Number 4, Springer Netherlands, [tpl]doi|10.1007/BF00994195[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, acetophenone was used in medicine.The Merck Index, 12th Edition It was marketed as a hypnotic and anticonvulsant under brand name Hypnone. The typical dosage was 0.12 to 0.3 milliliters.Bartholow, Roberts. "A Practical Treatise On Materia Medica And Therapeutics." Appleton & Co, 1908. It was considered to have superior sedative effects to both paraldehyde and chloral hydrate.Norman, Conolly "Cases illustrating the sedative effects of aceto-phenone." Journal of Mental Science, Vol 32, p 519. 1887. In humans, acetophenone is metabolized to benzoic acid, carbonic acid, and acetone.[ref]"Hypnone - The new hypnotic."

==Toxicity==

The LD50 is 815 mg/kg (oral, rats). Acetophenone is currently listed as a Group D carcinogen (Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity), indicating that it does not produce carcinogenic effects in humans, although no studies on humans have ever been conducted on acetophenones' carcinogenic potential. Studies have shown that acetophenone causes chromosomal damage in hamsters.
