===Inter-Korean relations===

In the decades following the Korean War, relations between North and South Korea have gone through ups and downs. As the South's economy grew to gain "Asian Tiger" status, it took steps to reconcile with the North. The South sent food and other aid to the North, and also softened its stance on the North's nuclear weapons program.Huntington, Samuel. Clash of Civilizations.
In October 2008, however, the North responded very harshly to what it described as a southern "smear campaign." The North's military warned the South to end its policy of confrontation and threatened to turn the South into "debris" if it continued. A North Korean military spokesperson said that "the puppet authorities had better bear in mind that the advanced preemptive strike of our own style will reduce everything opposed to the nation and reunification to debris, not just setting them on fire."
This turn of events came just one day after a rare face-to-face meeting between the two countries' military officials at the behest of the North, to discuss ways of improving communications between military commanders on both sides. No progress was made on the issue, however.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2008/10/2008102854049888618.html

===European Union===

France and Estonia are the only EU countries that do not maintain official diplomatic relations with the DPRK.Source: DPRK Diplomatic Relations - The National Committee on North Korea  After 1989, the DPRK retained most of its diplomatic relations with the former Warsaw Pact countries. In 1993 and 1995 it made outreach efforts into Western Europe, as well as implementing a joint venture law in 1984 which was unsuccessful. The DPRK held its first working-level meetings with the EU in Brussels in 1998. Between 2000 and 2001, it established diplomatic relations with Italy, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg.
North Korean's main reason for establishing relationship with EU is clearly to augment its economy. In March 2002, North Korean trade minister went on a trip to Belgium, Italy, United Kingdom, Sweden and other countries to figure out what capitalistic countries are like and try to figure out ways to adopt it into North Korea. Furthermore, North Korea is constantly sending short-term trainees to certain EU countries to learn their new technique. One of the interesting features in this relationship is that both parties started to conduct workshops regarding North Korean economic reform. The workshops first started in 2004 and many EU diplomats and economists have participated.[tpl]cite book|last=Park|first=Youngho|title=21st century NEA relations and human rights in North Korea|year=2006|isbn=8988435834|pages=245[/tpl] 
The EU has been continuously trying to help halt human rights violations committed by the North Korean authorities, but has not successfully helped to implement any major longlasting changes. However, North Korea is being pressured by these efforts because it gives the UN reason to constantly bring out the issue into the table. Currently, North Korea-EU relations are not as good because of the DPRK's Long-range missile practice and the Nuclear crisis in 2009.

===Australia===

In 2007, North Korean imports from Australia were valued between A$6 and $11 million and were made up of chemical elements for use in electronics, copper, civil engineering equipment, household equipment, hydrocarbons and derivatives, textile yarns and fabrics, iron, steel, and chemicals. North Korea ranked 125th in the order of Australia's trading partners.
Australia and North Korea maintain diplomatic relations."N Korea to close its lonely embassy", The Australian, 26 January 2008
As of January 2013, neither Australia nor North Korea has a physical diplomatic presence in the other country. Instead, diplomatic relations between the two are handled by non-resident embassies. The Australian embassy in Seoul manages relations with North Korea, whilst the DPRK embassy in Jakarta has been responsible for their relations with Australia, since North Korea closed its embassy in Canberra in January 2008 due to budget constraints. Generally the relations are stressed, due to disputes such as over the North Korean nuclear program. In 2013 the Australian Government agreed to a request from North Korea for permission to re-establish an embassy in Canberra.[tpl]cite web|title=Democratic People's Republic of Korea|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/dprk/|publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=27 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=North Korean embassy trip put on hold|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/north-korean-embassy-trip-put-on-hold-20130214-2eetq.html|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=14 February 2013|location=Melbourne[/tpl]
In a 2003 event dubbed the "Pong Su incident", a North Korean cargo ship allegedly attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia was seized by Australian officials, strengthening Australia's and the United States's suspicions that Pyongyang engages in international drug smuggling. The North Korean government denied any involvement.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4837484.stm |title=N Korean heroin ship sunk by jet |accessdate=2007-08-02 |date=2006-03-23 |work=BBC News [/tpl]

===Brazil===

Brazil did not maintain diplomatic relations with North Korea from the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea until 2001. Then, in 2001, during the administration of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, diplomatic relations were quietly established between North Korea and Brazil.
Before the establishment of diplomatic relations, Brazil adhered to its policy of not maintaining bilateral relations with Stalinist-like states.
After relations were established in 2001, several years passed before the actual opening of the embassies. North Korea's embassy in Brasilia was inaugurated in 2005, and the Brazilian embassy in Pyongyang was only opened when the first Brazilian ambassador to North Korea was appointed in 2009.http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u592223.shtml
The arrival of Ambassador Arnaldo Carrilho, the first Brazilian ambassador to North Korea, was delayed from May to July 2009 due to a North Korean missile test that took the international community by surprise. The Brazilian government made a formal protest against the missile test, and Ambassador Carrilho was briefly retained in China for consultations with the Brazilian government before assuming his post in July 2009.

===Bulgaria===

Bulgaria and North Korea generally have good relations. Diplomatic relations between the countries were established on 29 November 1948, and a bilateral agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation was signed in 1970. Kim Il-Sung visited the People's Republic of Bulgaria for the first time in the 1950s, and again in 1975. Bulgarian volunteers provided basic aid to North Korea during the Korean war by providing items such as clothing and foodstuffs.Дума - Деветдесет и две годишната Василка Никифорова е превърнала дома си в библиотека, посветена на Ким Ир Сен - Duma.bg Even after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the countries retained active diplomatic relations. The foreign language institute in Pyongyang maintains a Bulgarian language department. In the past, the two countries also cooperated closely in the sphere of sports, and still maintain such cooperation albeit to a lesser degree.

===Canada===

Canada and North Korea share very little trade due to the destabilizing element North Korea has caused in the Asia Pacific region.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on February 2001. However there are no official embassies between the two nations. Canada is represented by the Canadian Ambassador resident in Seoul, and North Korea is represented through their position in the United Nations. On 25 May 2010, Canada suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea.http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/breakingnews/canada-suspends-diplomatic-relations-with-north-korea-over-warship-sinking-94869569.html[tpl]dead link|date = January 2013[/tpl]

===People's Republic of China===

The two countries are generally perceived to be on friendly terms, however in recent years there has been growing concern in the PRC over issues such as North Korea's nuclear weapons program, their sinking of the ROKS Cheonan and their bombardment of Yeonpyeong. After North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, the Chinese government stated that they were "resolutely opposed to it" and voted for United Nations sanctions against North Korea.[tpl]cite web|title=China resolutely opposes DPRK's nuclear test|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/09/content_5180203.htm|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=1 December 2010[/tpl]
The Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the PRC's main priority in its bilateral relations with the DPRK is to prevent the collapse of Kim Jong-Un's government, concerned that such an event would provoke a surge of North Korean refugees into China. It also suggests, however, that Chinese-DPRK relations may be soured due to China's concerns about Japan's remilitarization in response to North Korea's military behaviour."The China-North Korea Relationship", Council for Foreign Relations, June 18, 2008

====History====

North Korea is ruled by the faction which had its roots in an anti-Japanese Korean nationalist movement based in Manchuria and China. Kim Il Sung participated in this movement, and ensured the triumph of his faction over the others. In 1950, the PRC entered the Korean War in support of North Korea."Q&A: China-North Korea Relationship", New York Times, July 13, 2006 Later after the war, in an attempt to consolidate power, Kim Il Sung crushed the Russian Communist, Chinese Communist and domestic factions to promote the dominance of his guerilla group faction.
In 1961, the two countries signed the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty, whereby Communist China pledged to immediately render military and other assistance by all means to its ally against any outside attack.Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Democrati People's Republic of Korea, 11 July 1967: Article II: In the event of one of the Contracting Parties being subjected to the armed attack by any state or several states jointly and thus being involved in a state of war, the other Contracting Party shall immediately render military and other assistance by all means at its disposal. (一旦缔约一方受到任何一个国家的或者几个国家联合的武装进攻，因而处于战争状态时，缔约另一方应立即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。) This treaty was prolonged twice, in 1981 and 2001, with a validity till 2021.
Since 2003, the PRC has been a participant in six-party talks aimed at resolving the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
In 2006, when the DPRK test-fired a series of ballistic missiles, after PRC officials had advised North Korean authorities not to do so, Chinese authorities publicly rebuked what the west perceives as Mainland China's closest ally, and supported the UN Security Council Resolution 1718, which imposed sanctions on North Korea. At other times however, China has blocked United Nations resolutions threatening sanctions against North Korea.
In January, 2009, PRC President Hu Jintao and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il exchanged greetings and declared 2009 as the “year of China-DPRK friendship”, marking 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.[ref]Xinhua, "Chinese, DPRK leaders exchange congratulatory messages on the launch of friendship year,"
1 January 2009.[/ref]
On 28 November 2010, as part of the United States diplomatic cables leak, WikiLeaks and media partners such as The Guardian published details of communications in which PRC officials referred to North Korea as a "spoiled child" and its nuclear program as "a threat to the whole world's security". Two anonymous PRC officials also allegedly told of growing support in Beijing for Korean reunification under the South's government.[tpl]cite news|last=Tisdall|first=Simon|title=Wikileaks cables reveal China 'ready to abandon North Korea'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-china-reunified-korea|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 December 2010|location=London|date=29 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=US embassy cables: China 'would accept' Korean reunification|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/249870|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 December 2010|location=London|date=29 November 2010[/tpl] A 2013 article by Deng Yuwen, deputy editor of Study Times, the journal of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China also promoted reunification of North and South Korea.Yuwen, Dang (27 February 2013) China should abandon North Korea The Financial Times, Retrieved 2 March 2013

====Border====

China and North Korea share a 1,416-kilometre long border (890 miles) that corresponds broadly speaking to the course of the Yalu and Tumen rivers. The countries have six border crossings between them. In November 2003, China reportedly transferred responsibility for securing its border with North Korea from the police to its army.Foley, James. "China Steps Up Security on North Korean Border," Jane’s Intelligence Review, 1 November 2003.
In 2006, The PRC built a 20-kilometre (12.4 miles) long fence along its border with North Korea. It is located primarily along areas where the Yalu River dividing the two countries is narrow and the river banks low.[ref]"China Erects Massive Fence on N. Korean Border After Test," World Tribune.com, October 25, 2006. Schafer,

"China’s Trade with N.K. Via Dandong Exceeds US $200 million." KOTRA, 21 February 2003
In February 1997, the access to foreigners and PRC-nationals travelling as tourists of the Tumen River bridge at Wonjong-Quanhe on the DPRK-PRC border was allowed. This led to a phenomenal increase in cross-border traffic and business within one year; from less than 1,000 passengers in 1996, to over 100,000 in 1997.Regional CO-Operation in Northeast Asia The Tumen River Area Development Program, 1990-2000: In Search of a model for regional economic co-operation in Northeast Asia

=====Border disputes=====

Secret negotiations between Beijing and Pyongyang in 1963 resulted in an agreement that seems to be no longer valid today. At the time, at the height of the Sino-Soviet standoff, The PRC adopted a flexible position in order to break out of its isolation in the Communist bloc and to win Kim Il-Sung’s regime over to its cause. In spite of the CPC’s tough stance after 1949 in the face of the territorial claims made by its neighbouring countries, Premier Zhou Enlai advised the Chinese delegation to be receptive to North Korea’s demands. The PRC concessions were so significant that the local authorities in the border provinces of Jilin and Liaoning protested.Chae-Jin Lee, China and Korea: Dynamic Relations, Stanford, The Hoover Institution for War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford University, 1996, pp. 99-100 In 1965, in the midst of the Sino-Soviet Split, in order to punish the North Korean regime for its lack of support, The CPC is thought to have demanded that the 160 square kilometers (99.4 sq. miles) around Paektusan be conceded to it as compensation for the economic and military aid provided by Peking during the Korean War (1950–53)Chin O. Chung, Pyongyang Between Peking and Moscow: North Korea’s Involvement in the Sino-Soviet Dispute, 1958-1975, The University of Alabama Press, 1978, p. 120 Between March 1968 and March 1969, various military skirmishes took place in the Paektusan region between the North Korean and PRC armed forces. These were consequences of the tensions caused by the cultural revolution and the savage criticisms made of Kim Il-Sung by the Red Guards. During these years of unrest, Peking closed its border with its neighbor. The PRC abandoned its claim in November 1970, in order to improve relations with Pyongyang. The abandonment of the PRC's claim was preceded by a rapprochement between Peking and Pyongyang from the start of the 1970s. In January, both governments signed a navigation agreement on the Yalu and Tumen rivers.
Finally, in October 2000, both countries reached an agreement on the border ports and their joint managementMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, Peking, 18 November 2000

====Economic relations====

The PRC permitted the Yanbian Korean Ethnic Group Autonomous Prefecture to conduct border trade with the DPRK in August 1954. A barter contract between China and the DPRK was officially signed the same year. The contract stipulates the following:
In the 1950s, border trade between China and DPRK reached as high as 7.56 million Chinese renminbi. The DPRK received grain, textiles, clothing, paper, soap and other goods in exchange for seafood and apples. In the 1960s, the two sides continued to trade but accounts were settled in Soviet rubles rather than Chinese renminbi. Trade volume from 1960 to 1961 was 2.61 million rubles and from 1962 to 1969, 8.23 million rubles. Then trade was suspended due to the cultural revolution until a new contract was signed in 1982 between China and the DPRK, which set the Swiss franc as the exchange currency. Since then, PRC-DPRK border trade has increased rapidly with the trade between Jilin Province and the DPRK alone reaching 1.03 million Swiss francs (510K USD)."Foreign Currency Units Per 1 U.S. Dollar, 1948-2007", Werner Antweiler, University of British Columbia, 2007 Trade volume amounted to 11.99 million Swiss francs (CHF) in 1983 (5.71M USD), CHF 100 million in 1985 (40.70M USD), CHF 160 million in 1988 (109.34M USD), and CHF 150 million (88.2M USD) in 1990. The PRC expanded the former three border trade areas to 13 and the DPRK from 3 to 6 areas.Economic and Social Implications Of China-DPRK Border trade for China's Northeast The PRC’s economic assistance to North Korea accounts for about half of all foreign aid given by the PRC. Beijing provides the aid directly to Pyongyang, thereby enabling it to bypass the United Nations.

=====Trade=====

The PRC is North Korea's largest trade partner, while North Korea ranked 82nd (in 2009) in trade partners.China-North Korea Relations China provides about half of all North Korean imports and received a quarter of its exports. The PRC’s major imports from North Korea includes mineral fuels (coal), ores, woven apparel, iron and steel, fish and seafood, and stone. North Korea's imports from Mainland China include mineral fuels and oil, machinery, electrical machinery, vehicles, plastic, and iron and steel. The PRC is a major source for North Korean imports of petroleum. In 2009, exports to the DPRK of mineral fuel oil totaled $327 million and accounted for 17% of all Chinese exports to the DPRK.

====Military relations====

During the Korean War from 1950–53, China assisted North Korea, sending as many as 500,000 soldiers to support North Korean forces. In 1975, Kim Il Sung visited Beijing in a failed attempt to solicit support from China for a military invasion of South Korea."East German Documents on Kim Il Sung’s April 1975 Trip to Beijing", NKIDP e-Dossier No. 7, May 2012 On November 23, 2009, PRC Defence Minister Liang Guanglie visited Pyongyang, the first defense chief to visit since 2006.Associated Press, "China’s Defense Minister Travels to North Korea," The China Post, 23 November 2009

===France===

Relations between the French Republic and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are officially non-existent. France is one of only two European Union members not to maintain diplomatic relations with North Korea, the other being Estonia. There is no French embassy, nor any other type of French diplomatic representation, in Pyongyang, and no DPRK embassy in Paris, although a North Korean diplomatic office is located in nearby Neuilly sur Seine.Official website of the French National AssemblyAddress of the North Korean diplomatic representation in France
France's official position is that it will consider establishing diplomatic relations with DPRK if and when the latter abandons its nuclear weapons program and improves its human rights record.

===Hungary===

Relations between the two countries have existed since the Korean War, however conflicts beginning in the late 1980s have strained relations.

===India===

India and North Korea have growing trade and diplomatic relations. India maintains a fully functioning embassy in Pyongyang and North Korea has an embassy in New Delhi. India has said that it wants the "reunification" of Koreahttp://mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=50049826 Many North Korean nationals receive training in India including in the fields of IT and science and technology. India has a bilateral trade of around half a billion dollars with North Korea.

====History====

India voted in favour of  Security Council resolutions 82 and 83 relating to the Korean War. However, India did not support resolution 84 for military assistance to South Korea. As a nonaligned country, India refused to fight against North Korea. Instead, India decided to send a medical unit to Korea as a humanitarian gesture. The 60th Indian Field Ambulance Unit, a unit of the Indian Airborne Division, was selected to be dispatched to Korea. The unit consisted of 346-men including

=====Trade=====

Trade between India and North Korea has seen a large increase in recent years. From an average total trade of barely $100 million in the middle of the 2000s, it shot up to over $ 1 billion in 2009. The trade is overwhelmingly in India's favour, with its exports accounting for roughly $1 billion while North Korean exports to India were worth $57 million.

North Korea and Iran are the remaining two members of what former U.S. President George W. Bush labelled as being so-called "Axis of evil," a designation which has influenced such cross-inspired Iranian-North Korean relations.

===Indonesia===

Indonesia is one of the very few countries that still maintain cordial relations with North Korea, despite international sanctions and isolation applied upon North Korea concerning its human rights abuses and nuclear missile program. Both nations share a relationship that dates back to the Sukarno and Kim Il-sung era in the 60s. Indonesia has an embassy in Pyongyang, while North Korea has an embassy in Jakarta. Both nations are members of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Indonesia still continues to engage North Korea as it believe in dialog and there is no point in isolation. Indonesia encouraging North Korea to open up and do what is right ― as Indonesia did in the case of Myanmar.

===Japan===

A legacy of bitterness exists in Japan's relations with North Korea, stemming from Japanese colonial rule over Korea from 1910 to 1945. Currently, North Korea is not recognized by Japan, and neither country has any diplomatic relations.
Bilaterally and through the Six-Party Talks, North Korea and Japan continue to discuss issues surrounding the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.
Even despite a cloudy mutual history, North Korea was expected to start seedlings of a positive relationship with Japan as the Democratic Party of Japan has won recent presidential elections. However, then-Prime Minister Hatoyama Yukio maintained the original adverse position towards the DPRK. The Bombardment of Yeonpyeong in November, 2010, and the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan in 2011 have also contributed to the continuing deterioration of the relationship.

===Malaysia===

North Korea maintains friendly diplomatic ties with Malaysia. In an effort to boost tourism between the two countries, North Korea announced that Malaysians will not require a visa to visit North Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=%2F2009%2F3%2F9%2Fcentral%2F3434899|title=Only Malaysians can visit North Korea without a visa|publisher=The Star|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=24 January 2014|author=Fazleena Aziz|archiveurl=http://archive.is/vRwZg|archivedate=23 January 2014|deadurl=yes[/tpl] North Korea's flag carrier, Air Koryo has regular flights to Kuala Lumpur.

===Mongolia===

North Korea–Mongolia relations date back to 1948, when the Mongolian People's Republic recognized Kim Il-sung's Soviet-backed government in the North.

The two countries nullified their earlier friendship and cooperation treaty in 1995, and in 1999, North Korea closed its embassy in Ulan Bator during an official visit by Kim Dae-jung, the first-ever such visit by a South Korean president.
