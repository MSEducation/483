The 45 islands and islets of the archipelago form a total land area of [tpl]convert|50|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2[/tpl].The Philippine Island world: a physical, cultural, and regional geography by Frederick L. Wernstedt, Joseph Earle Spencer p.24 Cuyo is divided into two island groups. Up north is the Quiniluban group. To the south is the Cuyo group, where the centers of the three municipalities namely Cuyo, Agutaya, and Magsaysay are located.
Geologically, the islands are related to the main island of Palawan. They are positioned on the western edge of the Luzon Arc. Cuyo island is volcanic. The northern islands of Quiniluban seem to be uplifted coral atolls, although the heights of some of the peaks strongly suggest volvanic uplift. Many other islands of the group are purely corallian.
Cuyo is divided in three municipalities, namely Cuyo, Agutaya, and Magsaysay:
Altogether, 45,718 people inhabit the Cuyo group of islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/pressrelease/MIMAROPA.pdf |title=Total Population by Province, City, Municipality and Barangay: as of May 1, 2010 |work=2010 Census of Population and Housing |publisher=National Statistics Office |accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl]
