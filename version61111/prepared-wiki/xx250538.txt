"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet" is a song by the Blues Magoos from their album Psychedelic Lollipop released in November 1966. It was a chart hit in the United States in February 1967. It was written by Ron Gilbert, Ralph Scala and Mike Esposito. The Vox Continental organ riff was closely based on guitarist James Burton's riff to Ricky Nelson's 1962 rock recording of the old George Gershwin standard "Summertime". The Blues Magoos' psychedelic song had also inspired Deep Purple's 1970 hit song "Black Night".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/pcp2 |title=Deep Purple In Rock Review |work=BBC Music |first=Sid |last=Smith |date=2007-04-18[/tpl]
