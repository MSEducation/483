World Affairs is a bimonthly magazine covering international relations. It is an official publication of the American Peace Society. The magazine has been published since 1837 and was re-launched in January 2008 as a new publication. Each issue contains articles offering diverse perspectives on global issues and United States foreign policy. World Affairs is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Prior to 1932, the magazine was published monthly and under a variety of names, including The Advocate of Peace. Those articles have since been digitized by JSTOR and are freely viewable up to 1923.
