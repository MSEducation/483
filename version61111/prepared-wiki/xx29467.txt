</ref> The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]], written in 333 CE, suggests that it was probably to the [[Foundation Stone|perforated stone]] or the Rock of Moriah, "to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart". This was because an Imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and by [[Jerome]] in his commentary to [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av.<ref name=UJT/> In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress [[Aelia Eudocia]] seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple. Permission was granted and they were officially permitted to resettle in Jerusalem.<ref>

Several Jewish authors of the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes.David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson "Pilgrimage and the Jews" (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006)42-. Ahimaaz relates that Rabbi Samuel ben Paltiel (980-1010) gave money for oil at "the sanctuary at the Western Wall."[tpl]cite book|author=Jacob Mann|title=Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature: Ḳaraitica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6muQAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2013|year=1972|publisher=Ktav Pub. House|page=20|quote=An improvement evidently took place after the Fatimid conquest in 970 when permission was granted to pray not at a gate but at the Western Wall (כותל מערבי). This permission may have been due to the intervention of Paltiel, the first Egyptian Nagid. Paltiel's son, Samuel, on the occasion of the transference' of his parents' remains to Jerusalem, donated among other gifts money for "oil for the sanctuary at the Western Wall, for the altar that is inside" (ושמן למקדש בכותל מערבי למזבח שבפנים).[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=R.

The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy.[tpl]cite book|author=Simon Goldhill|title=Jerusalem: City of Longing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PoLEULaZHzAC&pg=PA74|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03468-6|pages=74–75|quote=Perhaps the earliest evidence for the Western Wall being used for prayer is found in the Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, who visited Jerusalem at some point between 1169 and 1171 on his long trip around the east from Spain, when the city was ruled by the Crusaders. … This is a confused account: the Gate of Mercy is in the Eastern Wall.

The fact that this confusion seems to have existed only with Jewish travellers would tend to corroborate this hypothesis.[/tpl]  While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site,[tpl]cite book|author1=Fred Skolnik|author2=Michael Berenbaum|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VkAOAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865949-7|page=25|quote= In the 12th century Benjamin of Tudela mentions Jews coming to the Western Wall for prayers and to the "Mercy Gate," but it is possible that the other walls to the south and east also served a similar purpose. Later visiting rabbis (12th-15th centuries) also refer to the walls of the Temple Mount, but they too, are not specific in terms of a gathering spot for Jewish worship along the Western Wall. The Western Wall is not mentioned at all by Nahmanides (13th century) in his detailed account of the Temple site in 1267 nor in the report of Estori ha-Parhi (14th century). It does not figure even in descriptions of Jerusalem in Jewish sources of the 15th century (e.g., Meshullam of Volterra, Obadiah of Bertinoro, etc.). The name Western Wall, used by Obadiah, refers - as can be inferred from the context - to the southwestern corner of the wall, and there is no hint that there was a place of Jewish worship there. It is only from the 16th century that Jews began praying at the present location and this is clear from the available sources. Thenceforth all literary sources describe it as a place of assembly and prayer for Jews. transmitted by Moses Hagiz, it was the sultan Selim, the conqueror of Jerusalem, who recovered the Wall from underneath the dungheap which was hiding it and granted permission to the Jews to hold prayers there.[/tpl] shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site.[ref]
