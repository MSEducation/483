==History==

What is now United Airlines originated from the Varney Air Lines air mail service of Walter Varney, who also founded Varney Speed Lines, from which Continental Airlines had originated. Founded in Boise, Idaho in 1926, the carrier flew the first Contract Air Mail flight in the U.S. on April 6, 1926, marking the first scheduled airline service in the country's history.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.united.com/page/middlepage/0,6823,2281,00.html |title=Era 1: 1910–1925 |year=2007 |work=united.com |publisher=United Airlines, Inc |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061130083901/www.united.com/page/middlepage/0,6823,2281,00.html |archivedate=May 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |quote=...Walter T Varney, who launched air mail service over a desolate stretch of terrain between Pasco, Wash., and Elko, Nev., on April 6, 1926.

After the war, United gained from a boom in customer demand for air travel, with its revenue passenger-miles jumping five-fold in the 1950s, and continued growth occurring through the next two decades.Handbook of Airline Statistics (biannual CAB publication)
In 1954 United Airlines became the first airline to purchase modern flight simulators which had visual, sound and motion cues for training pilots. Purchased for [tpl]US$|link=yes[/tpl]3 million (1954) from Curtiss-Wright, these were the first of today's modern flight simulators for training of commercial passenger aircraft pilots."Airline Pilots Fly Anywhere in the world – Without Leaving the Ground." Popular Mechanics, August 1954, p. 87.
United merged with Capital Airlines in 1961 and regained its position as the United States' largest airline. In 1968, the company reorganized, creating UAL Corporation, with United Airlines as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1970, the UAL Corporation acquired Western International Hotels, and its name was later changed to Westin Hotel Company.  The 1970s also saw economic turmoil, resulting in "stagflation" and labor unrest. The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, resulting in industry shakeups, further added to the carrier's difficulties in a loss-making period.
In 1982, United became the first carrier to operate the Boeing 767, taking its first delivery of 767-200s on August 19.[tpl]cite web|title=Boeing 767 Milestones|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/pf/pf_milestones.html|publisher=Boeing Commercial Airplanes|accessdate=19 December 2012[/tpl]  In May 1985, the airline underwent a 29-day pilot strike over management's proposed "B-scale" pilot pay rates.[tpl]cite news|last=Warren|first=James|title=Accord In United Strike|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-06-13/news/8502070372_1_back-to-work-issues-pilots-union-air-line-pilots-association|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=13 June 1985|author2=Jouzaitis, Carol[/tpl]  Then-company CEO Richard Ferris changed United's parent company's name from UAL Corporation to Allegis in February 1987, but following his termination, the company reverted to the name UAL Corp. in May 1988, and divested non-airline properties."United's Parent Is Again UAL." The New York Times."United Once More." TIME. 2
In 1985, United expanded dramatically by purchasing Pan Am's entire Pacific Division, giving it an Asian hub at Tokyo's Narita International Airport, and in 1991 purchased routes to London Heathrow Airport from ailing Pan Am, making it one of two US carriers permitted exclusive access to Heathrow under Bermuda II until "open skies" took effect in 2008 (American Airlines being the other, after it purchased TWA's Heathrow landing slots). The aftermath of the Gulf War and increased competition from low-cost carriers led to losses in 1991 and 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.united.com/page/article/0,,2543,00.html |title=United Airlines – Timeline|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050208145820/https://www.united.com/page/article/0,,2543,00.html |publisher=United.com |archivedate=8 February 2005|accessdate=13 December 2012[/tpl] In 1994, United's pilots, machinists, bag handlers and non-contract employees agreed to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), acquiring 55% of company stock in exchange for 15–25% salary concessions, making the carrier the largest employee-owned corporation in the world.[tpl]cite news|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|title=United's ESOP fable|url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/12/esop/|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=12 December 2002[/tpl]  The carrier also launched a low-cost subsidiary in 1994, Shuttle by United a high frequency, west coast-based operation, in an attempt to compete with low-cost carriers; the subsidiary remained in operation until 2001.

During the September 11, 2001 attacks, two of the four airplanes hijacked and crashed by al-Qaeda members were United Airlines aircraft (United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the south World Trade Center tower; United Airlines Flight 93 was crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers fought back against the hijackers). An airline industry downturn resulted, and coupled with economic difficulties, skyrocketing oil prices, and higher labor costs, the company lost [tpl]US$|2.14[/tpl] billion in 2001. In the same year United applied for a [tpl]US$|1.5[/tpl] billion loan guarantee from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board established in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[tpl]cite news|last=Donnelly|first=Sally|title=Air Support|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,549004,00.html|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=24 November 2003[/tpl] After attempts to secure additional capital failed, UAL Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2002 and the ESOP was terminated.[tpl]cite news|title=Timeline of United Airlines' bankruptcy|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-02-01-united-timeline_x.htm|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=1 February 2006[/tpl]
United's bankruptcy operations resulted in furloughing thousands of workers, closing all U.S. city ticket offices, cancelling several existing and planned routes, downsizing its Miami operations, closing maintenance bases, and fleet reductions. The carrier also negotiated cost cuts with employees, suppliers, and contractors, and terminated feeder contracts with United Express carriers Atlantic Coast Airlines and Air Wisconsin. The carrier launched a new, all coach, low-cost carrier named Ted in 2003, and a luxury "p.s." (for "premium service") coast-to-coast service on re-configured 757s in 2004. In 2005, United cancelled its pension plan in the largest such default in U.S. corporate history.
In 2005, United announced it had raised [tpl]US$|3[/tpl] billion in financing to exit bankruptcy and filed its Plan of Reorganization, as announced, on September 7, 2005.

===Predecessors===

United Airlines is a combination of a number of air carriers that merged with each other starting in the 1930s with the most recent merger concerning Continental Airlines (which had previously merged with or acquired several airlines during its history) thus reflecting changes in focus of both United and the U.S. air transport market."Corporate And Legal History Of United Airlines And Its Predecessors And Subsidiaries 1925-1955" Chicago: United Airlines. 1965Davies, R.E.G.

Predecessor air carriers that form the present United Airlines include:
Many of these acquisitions and mergers were completed by Continental Airlines when this carrier was under the ownership and control of Texas Air Corporation from 1982 to 1987. During that time period, New York Air and Texas International Airlines (which were already owned by Texas Air Corporation before this company acquired Continental) were merged into Continental.[tpl]cite web|author=ERIC WEINER |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ERTpvhGLJ_MJ:www.nytimes.com/1990/08/10/business/lorenzo-head-of-continental-air-quits-industry-in-30-million-deal.html |title=Lorenzo, Head of Continental Air, Quits Industry in $30 Million Deal |publisher=New York Times  - Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=1990-08-10 |accessdate=2012-12-25[/tpl] Texas Air Corporation subsequently acquired PEOPLExpress Airlines (which had previously acquired Frontier Airlines) and then folded these air carriers into Continental as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fabulair.com/2011/11/30/continental-airlines-1934-30nov2011/ |title=Continental Airlines – 1934 |publisher=Fabulair |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-12-25[/tpl]  As for United, before merging with Continental it had acquired Capital Airlines in the 1960s and had also purchased Pan Am's Pacific Division as well as Pan Am's transatlantic route rights into London Heathrow Airport during the 1980s.

==Corporate identity==

===Brand image===

The pre-merger United logo, commonly nicknamed the "tulip", was first developed in the early seventies after the airline commissioned designer Saul Bass to develop a new brand image. The logo skillfully represented the airline's monogram as well as a modernized version of the airline's shield logo[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.pentagram.com/2011/03/fifteen-years-of-flying-united-1|title=Fifteen Years of Flying United[/tpl] which had been adopted in the 1930s, but fell out of use by the late 1960s. The ribbon-like rendering has also been said to symbolize the motion of flight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech-Culture/2013/0508/How-Saul-Bass-changed-design|title=How Saul Bass changed design[/tpl]  The Saul Bass livery was updated in 1988 to feature larger lettering on the fuselage, with the rainbow stripes on the side moved down to accommodate the new space. This livery was in use until the beginning of 1993, and the last planes to feature this paint scheme were repainted by 1999.
The next livery update came in the early 1990s: the CKS Group-designed "Battleship," a grey and dark blue fuselage with blue stripes on the tail and a smaller "tulip" on the tail. A smaller, more refined version of the rainbow stripes from the previous livery were incorporated as well. This livery debuted on January 11, 1993, and the last mainline plane to wear this livery, N229UA, was repainted on February 20, 2012. Finally, a decade later, the 2004 Pentagram-developed "Rising Blue" featured a white and lighter blue fuselage, along with a cropped version of the tulip on the tail. As of April 2014, some "rising blue" planes remain a part of the merged United's fleet.
In 2011, the newly merged United adopted a livery more consistent with the 1991 livery of Continental Airlines. United has promoted its post-merger logo as reflecting its efforts to attract corporate clients and the airline's worldwide network, but many marketing experts and graphic designers have criticized the logo change, stating that the previous "tulip" logo has stronger brand recognition and is a stronger mark than the Continental globe, while faulting CEO Jeff Smisek and former United CEO Glenn Tilton for devising the "new" brand and livery between the two of them with no outside input.[tpl]cite web|last=Walker |first=Alissa |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1638794/new-united-continental-logo-flying-little-too-close-together |title=The New United-Continental Logo: Flying a Little Too Close Together |publisher=Fast Company |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2013-01-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_united_and_continental_airline_mashup.php |title=Brand New: The United and Continental Airline Mashup |publisher=Underconsideration.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26[/tpl][tpl]additional citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

===Marketing themes===

United resurrected its popular "Fly the Friendly Skies" slogan in September 2013.United Plans Return to the "Friendly Skies"  Until September, 2013, the slogan, adopted after the merger of United and Continental in October 2010, was "Let's fly together". This replaced the slogan "It's time to fly" created in 2004. United's earliest slogan, "The Main Line Airway," emphasized its signature New York-Chicago-San Francisco route, and was replaced in 1965 with "Fly the Friendly Skies". The "friendly skies" tagline was in use until 1996 in its first iteration.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
On September 20, 2013 United announced a return of the "Fly the Friendly Skies" slogan in an ad campaign to start the following day.

===Environmental strategy===

On August 23, 2011, United announced a conversion to paperless flight decks and deployed 11,000 iPads to all United pilots. Each iPad, which weighs less than 1.5 pounds, replaced approximately 38 pounds of paper operating manuals, navigation charts, reference handbooks, flight checklists, logbooks and weather information in a pilot's flight bag. The electronic flight bags (EFBs) replaced conventional flight bags full of paper materials that contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot, and as a first for major network carriers, provide pilots with paperless aeronautical navigational charts through an iPad app. The green benefits of moving to EFBs include reductions in, paper use, printing, and fuel consumption. Distribution of the iPads began in early August 2011, and all pilots were using them by the years end.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83680&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1599253&highlight= |title=United Airlines Launches Paperless Flight Deck With iPad|publisher=ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl]

On January 15, 2013, Aviation Partners Boeing (APB) announced that United had placed an order to retrofit its existing Boeing Next Generation 737's Blended Winglets with APB's new Split Scimitar Winglet. The program will consist of retrofitting 737NG's winglets by replacing the aluminum winglet tip cap with a new aerodynamically shaped "Scimitar" winglet tip cap and by adding a new Scimitar tipped Ventral Strake. This modification demonstrated significant aircraft drag reduction over the basic Blended Winglet configuration.

==Cabin==

United claims to be the only mainline legacy carrier to offer in-flight entertainment on all mainline aircraft. Audio programming is provided by Zune.[tpl]cite web|title=United Airlines offers up 'Zune inflight audio,' no actual Zunes|author=Donald Melanson|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/03/united-airlines-offers-up-zune-inflight-audio-no-actual-zunes/|publisher=Engadget|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010[/tpl] The entire pre=merger United fleet features a program that allows passengers to listen to live radio communications between the cockpit and Air Traffic Control, which can be enabled at the pilot's discretion. United also partners with various television networks who provide programming for video-equipped aircraft. The most prominent of these programming partners was NBC, which provided branded "NBC on United" programming. This long-standing partnership ended in early 2009, when NBC signed a two-year deal with American Airlines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/pressReleases/2009_01/26_nbc.jhtml |title=American Airlines Selects NBC Universal as Inflight Broadcast Provider |publisher=American Airlines |date=January 26, 2009|accessdate=February 28, 2009 [/tpl] Despite the loss of this partnership, United's television entertainment continues to include several prime time NBC programs.

The longest domestic routes (such as flights between East Coast and Hawaii) utilize BusinessFirst equipped aircraft, however these flights are sold as United First but do not allow for complimentary premier upgrades.
Depending on the aircraft model, BusinessFirst seats have differently configured seating arrangements. Narrowbody aircraft, including transatlantic and United p.s. Boeing 757-200s have the seats arranged four-across, all facing-forward. On two-class Boeing 767-300 and Boeing 767-400ER aircraft, the seats are all forward facing in a 2-1-2 across configuration. On Boeing 787s, the seats are configured 2-2-2 with the outside seats angled away from the aisles. On the 747s, as well as all 767s and 777s equipped with United GlobalFirst, BusinessFirst is configured with rows of seats that alternate between forward facing seats and backward facing seats. In this configuration, middle seats face backwards in rows with forward-facing seats on the outside of the aisles, and vice-versa.
Other domestic routes, especially hub-to-hub service and certain non "United p.s." transcontinental flights regularly see internationally configured aircraft with BusinessFirst (and sometimes GlobalFirst) for operational reasons. While the physical seats and entertainment are the same as on international flights, the service, catering and other amenities are the same as in domestic first class.
