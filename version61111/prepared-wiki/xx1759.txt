Globally, as of 2010, sexually transmitted chlamydia affects approximately 215 million people (3.1% of the population). It is more common in women (3.8%) than men (2.5%).[tpl]cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2[/tpl] In that year it resulted in about 1,200 deaths down from 1,500 in 1990.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0[/tpl]

Chlamydia causes more than 250,000 cases of epididymitis in the U.S. each year. Chlamydia causes 250,000 to 500,000 cases of PID every year in the United States. Women infected with chlamydia are up to five times more likely to become infected with HIV, if exposed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm#complications |title=STD Facts - Chlamydia |accessdate=2007-10-26 |format= |work=[/tpl]

==Evolution==

Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed that Chlamydia likely shares a common ancestor with cyanobacteria, the group containing the endosymbiont ancestor to the chloroplasts of modern plants, hence, Chlamydia retains unusual plant-like traits, both genetically and physiologically. In particular, the enzyme L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase, which is related to lysine production in plants, is also linked with the construction of chlamydia's cell wall. The genetic encoding for the enzymes is remarkably similar in plants, cyanobacteria, and Chlamydia, demonstrating a close common ancestry.[tpl]cite journal |author=McCoy AJ, Adams NE, Hudson AO, Gilvarg C, Leustek T, Maurelli AT |title=L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase, a trans-kingdom enzyme shared by Chlamydia and plants for synthesis of diaminopimelate/lysine |journal=Proc.
