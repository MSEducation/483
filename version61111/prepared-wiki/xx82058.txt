The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11-M) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercanías commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004 – three days before Spain's general elections and two and a half years after the September 11 attacks in the United States. The explosions killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. The official investigation by the Spanish judiciary found that the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/documentos/2006/04/11/autohtml/index.html?cual=1412 |title=Spanish Indictment on the investigation of 11 March |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |location=Spain| accessdate=16 February 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1391123.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=15 February 2007 |title=Spain furious as US blocks access to Madrid bombing 'chief' |quote=The al-Qaeda leader who created, trained and directed the terrorist cell that carried out the Madrid train bombings has been held in a CIA "ghost prison" for more than a year | first=Sean | last=Oneill| accessdate=16 February 2010 [/tpl] although no direct al-Qaeda participation has been established.The Independent article:"While the bombers may have been inspired by bin Laden, a two-year investigation into the attacks has found no evidence that al-Qa'ida helped plan, finance or carry out the bombings, or even knew about them in advance.""Trial Opens in Madrid for Train Bombings That Killed 191", The Associated Press, 15 February 2007: "The cell was inspired by al-Qaida but had no direct links to it, nor did it receive financing from Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, Spanish investigators say"Al Qaeda, Madrid bombs not linked: Spanish probe, listed at borrull.org [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Though they had no role in the planning or implementation, the Spanish miners who sold the explosives to the terrorists were also arrested.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/conferences/counter-terrorism-series/islam-and-terrorism |title=Islam and terrorism |publisher=International Institute for Strategic Studies |accessdate=5 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604210506/http://www.iiss.org/conferences/counter-terrorism-series/islam-and-terrorism| archivedate= 4 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]The Jamestown Foundation[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2369921|date =20090222005727[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040316/ai_n12773616 | title=Madrid: The Aftermath: Spain admits bombs were the work of Islamists |work=The Independent |location=London |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090501052959/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040316/ai_n12773616 |archivedate = 1 May 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Controversy regarding the handling and representation of the bombings by the government arose, with Spain's two main political parties (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Partido Popular (PP)), accusing each other of concealing or distorting evidence for electoral reasons. The bombings occurred three days before general elections in which incumbent José María Aznar's PP was defeated.http://www.sigmados.com/esp/analisis.pdf Immediately after the bombing, leaders of the PP claimed evidence indicating the Basque separatist organization, ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) was responsible for the bombings, [tpl]Verify source|date=January 2010[/tpl]Lago, I.

==Description of the bombings==

During the peak of Madrid rush hour on the morning of Thursday, 11 March 2004, ten explosions occurred aboard four commuter trains (cercanías).Sound of the second wave of bombs recorded in a cellular phone conversation [tpl]es icon[/tpl] The date led to the popular abbreviation of the incident as "11-M". All the affected trains were traveling on the same line and in the same direction between Alcalá de Henares and the Atocha station in Madrid. It was later reported that thirteen improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had been placed on the trains. Bomb disposal teams (TEDAX) arriving at the scenes of the explosions detonated two of the remaining three IEDs in controlled explosions, but the third was not found until later in the evening, having been stored inadvertently with luggage taken from one of the trains. The following time-line of events comes from the judicial investigation.Judicial Indictment – Downloadable in Spanish [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
All four trains had departed the Alcalá de Henares station between 07:01 and 07:14. The explosions took place between 07:37 and 07:40, as described below (all timings given are in local time CET, UTC +1):
At 08:00, emergency relief workers began arriving at the scenes of the bombings. The police reported numerous victims and spoke of 50 wounded and several dead. By 08:30 the emergency ambulance service, SAMUR (Servicio de Asistencia Municipal de Urgencia y Rescate), had set up a field hospital at the Daoiz y Velarde sports facility. Bystanders and local residents helped relief workers, as hospitals were told to expect the arrival of many casualties. At 08:43, firefighters reported 15 dead at El Pozo. By 09:00, the police had confirmed the death of at least 30 people – 20 at El Pozo and about 10 in Santa Eugenia and Atocha.
The total number of deaths was 191. There were victims from 17 countries: 142 Spanish, 16 Romanians, 6 Ecuadorians, 4 Poles, 4 Bulgarians, 3 Peruvians, 2 Dominicans, 2 Colombians, 2 Moroccans, 2 Ukrainians, 2 Hondurans, 1 Senegalese, 1 Cuban, 1 Chilean, 1 Brazilian, 1 French, and 1 Filipino.
The total number of victims was higher than in any other terrorist attack in Spain, far surpassing the 21 killed and 40 wounded from a 1987 bombing at a Hipercor chain supermarket in Barcelona. On that occasion, responsibility was claimed by ETA. It was the worst incident of this kind in Europe since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.

==Further bombings spur investigation==

A device composed of 12 kilograms of Goma-2 ECO with a detonator and 136 meters of wire (connected to nothing) was found on the track of a high-speed train (AVE) on 2 April.The Terror Web (The NewYorker) [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040802fa_fact|date =20090604081737[/tpl] The Spanish judiciary chose not to investigate that incident and the perpetrators remain unknown. The device used in the AVE incident was unable to explode because it lacked an initiation system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libertaddigital.com/noticias/kw/11-m/11m/kw/noticia_1276326899.html |title=',Archivan las investigaciones sobre el intento de atentado contra el AVE', |publisher=Libertaddigital.com |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]
Shortly after the AVE incident, police identified an apartment in Leganés, south of Madrid, as the base of operations for the individuals suspected of being the perpetrators of the Madrid and AVE attacks. The suspected militants, headed by Jamal Zougam, Sarhane Abdelmaji "the Tunisian" and Jamal Ahmidan "the Chinese", were trapped inside the apartment by a police raid on the evening of Saturday 3 April. At 9:03 pm, when the police started to assault the premises, the militants committed suicide by setting off explosives, killing themselves and one of the police officers.Suspected Madrid bombing ringleader killed (CNN) 
Investigators subsequently found that the explosives used in the Leganés explosion were of the same type as those used in the 11 March attacks (though it had not been possible to identify a brand of dynamite from samples taken from the trains) and in the thwarted bombing of the AVE line.
Based on the assumption that the militants killed at Leganés were indeed the individuals responsible for the train bombings, the ensuing investigation focused on how they obtained their estimated 200 kg of explosives. The investigation revealed that they had been bought from a retired miner who still had access to blasting equipment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/3626235.stm |title=Madrid bomb cell neutralised (BBC Europe) |publisher=BBC News |date=14 April 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]
Five to eight suspects believed to be involved in the 11 March attacks managed to escape.
In December 2006, the newspaper ABC reported that ETA reminded Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero about 11 March 2004 as an example of what could happen unless the Government considered their petitions (in reference to the 2004 electoral swing), although the source also makes it clear that ETA 'had nothing to do' with the attack itself.ABC.es [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
