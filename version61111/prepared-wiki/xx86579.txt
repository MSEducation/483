London Heliport [tpl]Airport codes||EGLW[/tpl], previously called Battersea Heliport and currently officially known as the Barclays London Heliport for sponsorship reasons, is London's only licensed heliport. The facility, which opened in 1959, is located in Battersea on the south bank of the River Thames, [tpl]Convert|3|NM|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] southwest of Westminster Bridge and between Wandsworth Bridge and Battersea Railway Bridge.[tpl]cite web | publisher = NATS (Services) Limited | url = http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=173&Itemid=64.html | title = London Heliport - EGLW | accessdate = 2011-05-13[/tpl]
The heliport, once owned by Westland and then Harrods, is a very small site, making use of a jetty to provide a helipad for take-off and landing, and onshore parking for three to four aircraft, depending upon their size. The heliport provides landing, parking and refuelling services between 08:00 and 21:00 (flights are permitted between 07:00 and 23:00), albeit parking is normally restricted to smaller helicopter categories.
Flight conditions and procedures at the heliport prescribe a circuit height [tpl]Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] above the Thames, in an extended figure-of-eight over the water, to seek to minimise noise pollution for residents in the area and to constrain flight operations to over the river, away from the built-up area. Ground running of rotors is restricted to a maximum of five minutes for the same reason.
In December 2003, London Heliport was acquired by Weston Homes. Landing fees effective July 2012 ranged from £280 to £1,650 depending upon the helicopter type; additional costs accrue for parking, early or late flights, and flights in evening peak times.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Since May 2011, the heliport is known as the Barclays London Heliport, after Barclays bank signed a branding deal with the owner. In February 2012 the heliport was acquired by Reuben Brothers, which owns London Oxford Airport,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17149767 | work=BBC News | title=Reuben Brothers buy London Heliport in Battersea | date=23 February 2012[/tpl] for £35 million.
