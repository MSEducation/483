Star Wars Episode I.I: The Phantom Edit is a fan edit of the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, removing many elements of the original film. The purpose of the edit, according to creator Mike J. Nichols, was to make a much stronger version of The Phantom Menace based on the previous execution and philosophies of film storytelling and editing of George Lucas."This project began as a personal endeavor when I watched 'The Phantom Menace' as an audience, analyzed it with the care and attention of a Lucas team member, and carefully re-edited it, concentrating on creating the storytelling style that Lucas originally made famous. ... Although I definitely appreciate all the unexpected attention and support, I also respect and understand the discontent of Lucasfilm Ltd." The Phantom Editor, as quoted in the Salon article The Phantom Edit was the first unauthorized re-edit of The Phantom Menace to receive major publicity and acclaim.[ref]
"The general consensus of fans on the Internet seems to be that the new edit is an improvement on the original version...."If you haven't watched original, you don't know," said Jercan. "Whoever did the job did a hell of a job. It's like there's no break. So it had to be a professional. Because two kids can't do this."" Zap2it. "The Phantom Editor had apparently used new, cheap computing power to assemble an alternative, professional-quality movie -- exactly the same kind of new, cheap computing power that had allowed Lucas to make the original film, with its digitally created characters and special effects."

She said the company did not pursue fans 'as long as nobody crosses that lineâ€”either in bad taste or in profiting from the use of our characters'." As quoted in BBC article of June 7, 2001.
