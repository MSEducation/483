The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632 – 1723). He observed a "Lumen", the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon.Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros.

Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still possess nuclei.
The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804[tpl]cite book | last =Harris | first =H | title =The Birth of the Cell | edition = | year =1999 | publisher =Yale University Press | location =New Haven | isbn =0-300-07384-4 [/tpl] and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower's outer layer.[tpl]cite journal | last =  Brown | first = Robert | title = On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea | journal = Miscellaneous Botanical Works I | volume =  | pages = 511–514 | year = 1866[/tpl]
He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name "Cytoblast" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around "cytoblasts". Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the "cytoblast" or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells ("Omnis cellula e cellula"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.[tpl]cite book | last =Cremer| first =Thomas | title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie | edition = | year =1985 | publisher =Springer Verlag | location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo | isbn = 3-540-13987-7[/tpl] Online Version here
Between 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a "Monerula", a structureless mass of primordial mucus ("Urschleim"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g., amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants (1884). This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed.

==Structures==

The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animals.[tpl]cite book  | last = Lodish   | first = H  | coauthors = Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J.   | title = Molecular Cell Biology  | publisher = WH Freeman  | edition = 5th  | year = 2004  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-7167-2672-6[/tpl]
In mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometers (μm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.[tpl]cite book | year = 2002 | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 4, pages 191–234 | editor = Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter | publisher = Garland Science | edition = 4th[/tpl] The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Clegg JS |title=Properties and metabolism of the aqueous cytoplasm and its boundaries |journal=Am. J. Physiol. |volume=246 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=R133–51 |date=February 1984 |pmid=6364846 |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=6364846[/tpl] It appears as a dense, roughly spherical organelle.

===Nuclear envelope and pores===

The nuclear envelope, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Paine P, Moore L, Horowitz S | title = Nuclear envelope permeability | journal = Nature | volume = 254 | issue = 5496 | pages = 109–114 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1117994 | doi = 10.1038/254109a0  [/tpl] The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.
Nuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope,[tpl]cite book | year = 1996| title = Human Physiology | editor = Rodney Rhoades, Richard Pflanzer | publisher = Saunders College Publishing | chapter = Ch3 | edition = 3rd[/tpl] each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Shulga N, Mosammaparast N, Wozniak R, Goldfarb D | title = Yeast nucleoporins involved in passive nuclear envelope permeability | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 149 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–1038 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10831607 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.149.5.1027  [/tpl] Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.
Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Pemberton L, Paschal B | title = Mechanisms of receptor-mediated nuclear import and nuclear export | journal = Traffic | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–198 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15702987 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00270.x  [/tpl] Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.

===Nuclear lamina===

In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.
The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Stuurman N, Heins S, Aebi U | title = Nuclear lamins: their structure, assembly, and interactions | journal = J Struct Biol | volume = 122 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 42–66 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9724605 | doi = 10.1006/jsbi.1998.3987  [/tpl][tpl]cite  journal  | author = Goldman A, Moir R, Montag-Lowy M, Stewart M, Goldman R | title = Pathway of incorporation of microinjected lamin A into the nuclear envelope | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 119 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–735 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1429833 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.119.4.725  [/tpl] Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil,[tpl]cite journal | author = Goldman R, Gruenbaum Y, Moir R, Shumaker D, Spann T | title = Nuclear lamins: building blocks of nuclear architecture  | doi = 10.1101/gad.960502| url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/16/5/533 | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 533–547 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11877373[/tpl] that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase.[tpl]cite  journal | author = Moir RD, Yoona M, Khuona S, Goldman RD. | title = Nuclear Lamins A and B1: Different Pathways of Assembly during Nuclear Envelope Formation in Living Cells | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | year = 2000 | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages =  1155–1168 | pmid = 11121432 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.151.6.1155  [/tpl] Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.[tpl]cite  journal  | authors = Spann TP, Goldman AE, Wang C, Huang S, Goldman RD. | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | title = Alteration of nuclear lamin organization inhibits RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription | year = 2002 | volume = 156 | issue = 4 | pages = 603–608 | pmid = 11854306 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200112047  [/tpl]
Like the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.
Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.[tpl]cite  journal |author=Mounkes LC, Stewart CL| title = Aging and nuclear organization: lamins and progeria | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | year = 2004 | volume = 16 | pages = 322–327 | pmid = 15145358 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2004.03.009 | issue=3[/tpl]

===Chromosomes===

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.
There are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Ehrenhofer-Murray A | title = Chromatin dynamics at DNA replication, transcription and repair | journal = Eur J Biochem | volume = 271 | issue = 12 | pages = 2335–2349 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15182349 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04162.x  [/tpl] The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Grigoryev S, Bulynko Y, Popova E | title = The end adjusts the means: heterochromatin remodelling during terminal cell differentiation | journal = Chromosome Res | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–69 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16506096 | doi = 10.1007/s10577-005-1021-6  [/tpl] During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches,[tpl]cite journal | last = Schardin | first = Margit | authorlink =  | title = Specific staining of human chromosomes in Chinese hamster x man hybrid cell lines demonstrates interphase chromosome territories | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 281–287 | publisher = Springer Berlin / Heidelberg |date=December 1985  | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/lv101t8w17306071/ | doi = 10.1007/BF00388452 | pmid = 2416668 | last2 = Cremer | first2 = T | last3 = Hager | first3 = HD | last4 = Lang | first4 = M[/tpl] called chromosome territories.[tpl]cite  journal   | last = Lamond | first = Angus I. |author2=William C.

Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.[tpl]cite journal | author = NF Rothfield, BD Stollar | title = The Relation of Immunoglobulin Class, Pattern of Antinuclear Antibody, and Complement-Fixing Antibodies to DNA in Sera from Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus | journal = J Clin Invest | year = 1967 | volume = 46 | issue = 11 | pages = 1785–1794 | pmid = 4168731 | doi = 10.1172/JCI105669 | pmc = 292929 [/tpl] These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.[tpl]cite journal | author = S Barned, AD Goodman, DH Mattson | title = Frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies in multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurology | year = 1995 | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages =  384–385 | pmid = 7854544 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.45.2.384[/tpl] As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.

===Nucleolus===

The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.[ref]
</ref>
In the first step of ribosome assembly,  a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA.[ref]
