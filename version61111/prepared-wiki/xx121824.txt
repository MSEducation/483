The BBC reports the village name as Umm al-Nasser  
Ali Muamar, father of the two men detained, Osama Muamar and Mustafa Muamar, stated "They blindfolded and handcuffed me and started beating me up with the butts of their rifles and kicking me." He stated that a computer was taken and that the whole incident lasted for about an hour. 
An Israeli spokesman confirmed the detentions, said that both men were members of the militant group Hamas intending to carry out imminent attacks on Israel and stated "These Palestinians were transferred to Israel where they will be questioned".[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | pages= | title=Israeli troops arrest two in Gaza raid | date=24 June 2006 | publisher=Al Jazeera | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2006/06/200849134420867131.html |accessdate=2009-04-12[/tpl] A spokesman for Hamas confirmed that the brothers were sons of a member but denied that the men detained were involved in Hamas.
This event was followed by capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit on June 25, 2006 and further incidents in the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict. 
This is claimed by Noam Chomsky[tpl]cite news | first=Noam | last=Chomsky | pages= | title=Confrontation with Hamas and Hezbollah | date=July 29, 2006 | publisher=ZNet | url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=107&ItemID=10663 |accessdate=2006-08-01[/tpl] to be the first incident in the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict and the following 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Chomsky has asserted that the arrest of the Muamar brothers was virtually ignored in the major media, in contrast to the capture of Gilad Shalit.[tpl]cite news | first=Noam | last=Chomsky | pages= | title="Exterminate all the Brutes": Gaza 2009 * | date=January 19, 2009 | publisher=chomsky.info | url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20090119.htm[/tpl]
