==Political career==

In 2000, Tanaka was elected governor of Nagano Prefecture, a rural prefecture in Japan, standing as an independent without the support of any major Japanese political party. Soon after, Tanaka became a focus of public attention in Japan for policies that represented a radical departure from the priorities of the Japan's bureaucratic establishment.People Power, Time magazine, 9 September 2002, retrieved 10 September 2007 These included his policy of halting dam building, campaigning for environmental issues and abolishing the Nagano Press Club.No more dams, Nagano Prefecture website, 13 November 2001, from Internet Archive: Wayback Machine, retrieved 10 September 2007
These policies were designed to address ruinous public development projects that had left Nagano and many other prefectures burdened by debts. Japan is one of the most heavily dammed countries in the world with more than 3,000 dams and virtually no unobstructed rivers.No more dam illusions: The growing success of dam opponents in Japan, International Rivers Network, 2003, retrieved 10 September 2007
In 2002, conservative assemblymen who were upset by Tanaka's challenge to decades of pork-barrel politics forced him from office by passing a vote of no-confidence. But in the ensuing election, Tanaka made a successful comeback, thanks to overwhelming popular vote.Nagano's Champion of Change, The Japan Times, 4 September 2005, retrieved 10 September 2007
In August 2005, Tanaka formed the New Party Nippon with a handful of other reform-minded members of the House of Representatives.
