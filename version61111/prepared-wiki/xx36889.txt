Stomp 442 is the only Anthrax album not featuring the traditional Anthrax logo. The album's cover gained controversy when retailer Walmart refused to stock it in its stores.
Stomp 442 is also Anthrax's first album without Dan Spitz on lead guitar. Though not yet credited as a member of the band, Paul Crook took over lead guitar duties.

==Reception==

Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a negative review, describing it as "a generic collection of speed metal bombast". He finished his review by saying that the record is a "disappointing experience." Reviewer Jimmy Neeson had a more positive view, noting, "A savage Anthrax album; and a worthy addition to any metal collection."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/stomp-442--review.aspx?id=252592 | title=ANTHRAX Stomp 442 | publisher=Metal Music Archives | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=March 7, 2013 | last=Neeson | first=Jimmy[/tpl] As of 2006, Stomp 442 had sold about 122,000 copies in the U.S.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/anthrax/222300-latest-sales-number-anthrax.html | title = Latest sales numbers for Anthrax | accessdate = 2013-11-19 | date = 4 January 2006 | work = Forum | publisher = Ultimate Metal.com[/tpl]
