[[Low Lusatian German]]

Low Lusatian German (in German: Niederlausitzer Mundart (also English: Low Lusatian Dialect)) is a variety of Central German spoken in northern Saxony and southern Brandenburg within the regions of Lower Lusatia (Cottbus) and the northern part of Upper Lusatia (Hoyerswerda). It is well-defined from the Low German dialects around and north of Berlin as well as the Saxon dialect group of present day Saxony and the Slavic language of the Sorbs.
Both regions were strongly influenced by different dialects, especially after World War II. Refugees from East Prussia and Silesia settled there after their dispossession from former German areas. After the foundation of the German Democratic Republic and an economical development because of a stronger extraction of lignite people from Mecklenburg, Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt moved to the Lusatia region to benefit from the development. Due to this influence of other German dialects Low Lusatian never formed a too strong variation from standard German. For people moving now into this area the dialect is easy to learn and influences their spoken language quite fast.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

==Language==

Low Lusatian German lacks regional specific words. It contains syncopes and apocopes which are used in nearly every German dialect. The only clearly remarkable articulation is the guttural [tpl]angle bracket|r[/tpl], where Standard German's [tpl]angle bracket|er[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|ɐ[/tpl] ending is instead [tpl]angle bracket|a[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|a[/tpl]:
At the beginning of a word the [tpl]angle bracket|r[/tpl] is always spoken, but it is nearly inaudible within a word. The same effect can be seen on the letter [tpl]angle bracket|e[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|ɛ[/tpl] which also mostly vanishes in the endings, the changing of [tpl]angle bracket|au[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|aʊ[/tpl] to [tpl]angle bracket|o(h)[/tpl]/[tpl]angle bracket|oo[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|oː[/tpl], and the stretching of [tpl]angle bracket|ei[/tpl]/[tpl]angle bracket|ai[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|aɪ[/tpl] to [tpl]angle bracket|ee[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|eː[/tpl]:
The short [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|ɪ[/tpl] is spoken similarly to the standard German [tpl]angle bracket|ü[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA|y[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|ʏ[/tpl]):
Another sign is a different form of the perfect:
