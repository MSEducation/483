 He represents the electorate of [[Brindabella electorate|Brindabella]].
Smyth was born in Sydney, but moved to Canberra in May 1969. He worked at the National Library of Australia until 25 March 1995, when he ran for the Liberal Party in a by-election for the federal House of Representatives seat of Canberra. Normally a safe Labor seat, its previous member Ros Kelly had left under a cloud, having been forced to resign her ministry a year earlier over the sports rorts affair, and Smyth received a 16.1% swing to claim the seat. At the Australian federal election on 2 March 1996, Smyth contested the new federal House of Representatives seat of Namadgi, even though it had been drawn with a notional Labor majority of 10.9 percent.http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1996/1996repsact.txt He was defeated by Annette Ellis in what proved to be the only gain by Labor in that election.[tpl]cite web  | last =  Green| first = Antony|  year = 2007 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/guide/canb.htm  | title = Canberra (electorate) | work = Australia Votes 2007: Electorate profiles | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 2007-11-14[/tpl]
