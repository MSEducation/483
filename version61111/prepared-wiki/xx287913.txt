Al Quds Al Arabi ([tpl]lang-ar|القدس العربي[/tpl]), (English: "Arab Jerusalem") is an independent pan-Arab daily newspaper, published in London since 1989 and owned by Palestinian expatriates. The paper's motto is ([tpl]lang-ar|يومية سياسية مستقلة[/tpl] "daily, political, independent").[tpl]cite news|url=http://alquds.co.uk/pdf.htm|accessdate=26 April 2011|title=Al Quds Al Arabi|date=26 April 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110520065317/http://alquds.co.uk/pdf.htm| archivedate=20 May 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl] Its circulation is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000. From the start until July 2013, its editor-in-chief was Abdel Bari Atwan, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza Strip in 1950.[tpl]cite web|title=Abdel Bari Atwan bio|url=http://www.abdelbariatwan.com/BIOGRAPHY.htm|accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] 
The paper has a reputation for being more populist and aggressive in its defense of the Palestinian cause and by extension more confrontational toward Israel, particularly when compared to the other prominent off-shore pan-Arab dailies, like Asharq al-Awsat or Al-Hayat, which are owned by members of the Saudi royal family. As indicated by its motto, the paper stresses this distinction by emphasizing its independent ownership and viewpoint relative to the other prominent pan-Arab dailies.

==History==

Al Quds Al Arabi was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in London.[tpl]cite journal|title=Statistics on Arab Media|journal=Arab Reform Bulletin|date=December 2004|volume=2|issue=11|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/New_Chart.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl] The paper first came to global attention after Atwan traveled to Afghanistan in 1996 to interview Osama bin Laden. Like Al-Jazeera, contacts with terrorist groups such as Al-Qa'ida have consistently stirred attention and controversy in the West toward Atwan and the paper, particularly in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.[tpl]cite news|last=Atwan|first=Abdel Bari|title=Inside Osama's mountain lair|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/nov/12/afghanistan.terrorism1|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 November 2001[/tpl]
The fatāwā of Osama bin Laden in 1996 was first published in the paper.[tpl]cite web|title=Bin Laden's Fatwa|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|work=PBS|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=August 1996[/tpl] Several statements from the person or people who sign themselves the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades were also published in the paper.London Editor Prays for Nuke Attack on Israel by Rick Moran, The American Thinker,  29 August 2007 On the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Atwan wrote: "The events of 11 September will be remembered as the end of the US empire. This is because all empires collapse when they pursue the arrogance of power." Press blasts US foreign policy, BBC News website, 11 September  2006 However, it should also be noted that Atwan explicitly condemned terrorist attacks on innocent Western civilians, as he wrote in one of his two books, The Secret History of al Qa'ida: "I do not endorse or in any way support al-Qa'ida's agenda" and "I utterly condemn the attacks on innocent citizens in the West".The Secret History of Al-Qa'ida, Abdel Bari Atwan, Abacus (2006), ISBN 978-0-349-12035-5 
Atwan unexpectedly left the paper as its chairman and editor-in-chief on 10 July 2013 and Sana Aloul became the editor-in-chief.[tpl]cite web|title=I Bid Farewell to Al-Quds Al-Arabi|url=http://www.bariatwan.com/english/?p=1833|work=Bari Atwan Website|accessdate=21 September 2013|date=10 July 2013[/tpl] The exact reason for Atwan's sudden departure isn't publicly known, but according to himself, "We had on-going and never-ending financial problems whose resolution, ultimately, required political compromises that I was not able to make. Sacrificing professional integrity, our independent editorial line and the space we allowed for free comment were red lines I could not cross."Gulf News, 11 July 2013: Al Quds ex-editor: ‘Uncompromising integrity is what made us stand apart’  Linked 2013-11-09

==Organization==

The paper is owned and published by [tpl]lang-ar|مؤسسة القدس العربي للنشر والاعلان[/tpl] "The Al Quds Al Arabi Foundation for Publishing and Media". The only editor listed on the masthead was editor-in-chief Abd al-Bari Atwan. The newspaper is printed in London, New York, and Frankfurt, and then circulated in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and North America. In addition to London, the paper has offices in Cairo, Rabat, and Amman.

===Content===

The paper is currently 20 pages in length. The first half or so of the paper is devoted to political news from around the world, with a focus on what it terms Arab affairs. The paper has also sections devoted to cultural news and other miscellaneous items, as well as business (2 pages) and sports sections (1 page). The paper devotes three pages to op-ed writing, divided into what it calls [tpl]lang-ar|منبر القدس[/tpl] "The Al Quds Pulpit" (a forum for reader submission), [tpl]lang-ar|مدارات[/tpl] "Orbits" (or trends), and [tpl]lang-ar|رأي[/tpl] "Opinion". The paper devotes more space to opinion and less space to business news and sports, as compared with competitors like Al-Hayat or Asharq Al-Awsat. Additionally, Abd al-Bari Atwan wrote a well-known opinion column, featured prominently on the front page until his leave on 10 July 2013.

===Circulation===

Circulation data for Arab media is based on estimates, which vary widely for Al Quds Al Arabi. Former American diplomat and media scholar William Rugh estimated the paper's circulation around 15,000 in 2004 which is also stated by Arab Reform Bulletin. More recent estimates cite significantly higher circulation numbers of around 50,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Advertise on Al Quds al Arabi|url=http://www.allied-media.com/Arab-American/al_quds_al_arabi.htm|publisher=Allied Media|accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] By point of comparison, rival London-based Arabic press such as Al-Hayat and Asharq Al-Awsat are generally estimated in the 200,000 to 300,000 range.[tpl]cite news|url=http://alquds.co.uk/pdf.htm|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=Al-Quds Al-Arabi|date=26 April 2011|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110520065317/http://alquds.co.uk/pdf.htm|archivedate= 20 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Reputation==

Marc Lynch of Foreign Policy called Al Quds Al Arabi "the most populist/'rejection camp' of the major Arab papers".[tpl]cite web|url=http://lynch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/02/10/arabs_watching_the_israeli_elections |title=Arabs watching the Israeli elections|author=Marc Lynch|date=10 February 2009|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=30 June 2012[/tpl] It is often paired with Asharq Al Awsat to represent the polar extremes in the pan-Arab press.
