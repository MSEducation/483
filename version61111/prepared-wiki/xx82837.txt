The Libertarian Society of Iceland ([tpl]lang-is|Frjálshyggjufélagið[/tpl]) was founded in Reykjavík, Iceland, on August 10, 2002. As the name suggests it is established on the ideals of libertarianism. It is currently the only active propertarian libertarian organization in Iceland.
The society aims at promoting the values of a free-market economy and individual liberty to the Icelandic public. It does not intend to run for parliamentary elections. As a result, many of its members are active in political parties in Iceland, nearly exclusively in the Independence Party.
