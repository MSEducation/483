CATEGORIES: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill research centers

The Center for the Study of the American South (CSAS) is an academic organization dedicated to the study of "southern history, literature, and culture as well as ongoing social, political, and economic issues" at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/csas/index.html |title=Center for the Study of the American South |publisher=UNC Center for the Study of the American South |accessdate=2008-05-14[/tpl]

==History==

The CSAS was the brainchild of a working group of faculty at UNC's Institute for Research in Social Science, a group that included IRSS director John Shelton Reed (William Rand Kenan, Jr. Professor of Sociology at UNC), anthropologist James Peacock, and David Moltke-Hansen (curator of the Southern Historical Collection at UNC's Wilson Library).  This group recognized the value of an umbrella organization that could help faculty and students studying the South to communicate, collaborate, and combine resources.  They presented their idea to the UNC Board of Governors, which established the CSAS in 1992 with Reed as acting director, until he was succeeded by Moltke-Hansen.  Harry Watson, professor of history at UNC, has been the director of the CSAS since 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://giving.unc.edu/factfinders/centerforthestudyoftheamericansouth.pdf |title=Center for the Study of the American South Factfinder |publisher=UNC Office of University Development |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-14[/tpl]
