</ref> The 140,000 [[Orang Asli]] comprise a number of different ethnic communities. Many tribes, both on the peninsula and in Borneo, were traditionally nomadic or semi-nomadic hunterâ€”gatherers, including the [[Punan]], [[Penan]] and [[Senoi]]. However, their ancestral land and hunting grounds are commonly reclaimed by the state, shifting them to inferior land and sometimes pushing them out of their traditional way of life.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/Jones/malaysia.htm |title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Displacement of Indigenous People in Sarawak, Malaysia |publisher=Umich.edu |date=27 September 1994 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]</ref> The most numerous of the Orang Asli are called [[Negritos]] and are related to native Papuans in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and possibly even to aborigines in Australia. Other bumiputra minorities include [[Malaysian Siam]]ese, Khmers, Chams, and Burmese.

===Non-Bumiputras===

Minorities who lack Bumiputra status have established themselves in Malaysia. Those who are not considered to be Bumiputras make up a considerable portion of the Malaysian population. While some Chinese and Indian families, known as Peranakan ("straits-born"), have resided in Malaysia since as far back as 15th century Melaka, the majority of Malaysia's Chinese and Indian populations are descended from migrants who arrived during the colonial period.

====Chinese====

The second largest ethnic group is Chinese who make up 24.6% of the population.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/29/nation/20110729203217&sec=nation They have been dominant in trade and business since the early 20th century. Malaysian Chinese businesses developed as part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.[tpl]cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=4-8[/tpl] Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur are Chinese-majority cities, while Penang is the only Non-Bumiputra-majority state in Malaysia. The Chinese have been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, as seen in the emergence of the Peranakan culture, but the exodus peaked during the nineteenth century through trading and tin-mining. When they first arrived, the Chinese often worked the most grueling jobs like tin mining and railway construction. Later, some of them owned businesses that become large conglomerates in today's Malaysia. Most Chinese are Tao Buddhist and retain strong ties to their ancestral homeland. 
The first Chinese to settle in the Straits Settlements, primarily in and around Malacca, gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called babas (male) and nyonyas (female) emerged. Babas and nyonyas as a group are known as Peranakan. They produced a syncretic set of practices, beliefs, and arts, combining Malay and Chinese traditions in such a way as to create a new culture.
The Chinese community in Malaysia speak a variety of Chinese dialects including Mandarin, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew. A large majority of Chinese in Malaysia, especially those from the larger cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Ipoh, Klang and Penang speak decent English as well. There has also been an increasing number of the present generation Malaysian Chinese who consider English as their first language.

====Indian====

The Indian community in Malaysia is the smallest of the three main ethnic groups, comprising 7.1% of the population. Tamils make up the largest subgroup,[ref]
