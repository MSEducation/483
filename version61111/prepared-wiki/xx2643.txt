Daleks have been referred to or associated in many musical compositions.
Dalek is also mentioned and pictured in the Doc Brown vs Doctor Who. Epic Rap Battles of History Season 2, being summoned by Brown to exterminate the Tenth Doctor.
Samples of Dalek voices uttering the phrases "the prisoners have escaped" and "exterminate them" appear in the song "Shakespeare's Tacklebox" by the Australian band Spiderbait on their 1993 debut LP "ShaShaVaGlava".

===Politics===

At the 1966 Conservative Party conference in Blackpool, delegate Hugh Dykes publicly compared the Labour government's Defence Secretary Denis Healey to the creatures.

In a British Government Parliamentary Debate in the House of Commons on 12 February 1968, the then Minister of Technology Tony Benn mentioned the Daleks during a reply to a question from the Labour MP Hugh Jenkins concerning the Concorde aircraft project.

It is not like this at all."[tpl]cite news |title=The Commons: cost of Concorde: market for Beagles |work=The Times |location=UK |date=13 February 1968 |page=5[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1968/feb/12/concorde-aircraft#S5CV0758P0_19680212_HOC_81|title=Concorde Aircraft|work=House of Commons Hansard|date=12 February 1968|accessdate=7 November 2011[/tpl]

===Magazine covers===

Daleks have appeared on magazine covers promoting Doctor Who since the "Dalekmania" fad of the 1960s.  Radio Times has featured the Daleks on its cover several times, beginning with the 21–27 November 1964 issue which promoted The Dalek Invasion of Earth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/doctorwhocovers/02/ |title=Doctor Who covers: The Dalek Invasion of Earth |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=Radio Times |publisher=BBC Magazines[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]  Other magazines also used Daleks to attract readers' attention, including Girl Illustrated.Howe (1996), pp. 60–61, 66
In April 2005, Radio Times created a special cover to commemorate both the return of the Daleks to the screen in "Dalek" and the forthcoming general election.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/shows/doctor-who/gallery/gallery-twenty/001/ |title=Doctor Who – The greatest magazine cover of all time |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=Radio Times |publisher=BBC Magazines [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]  This cover recreated a scene from The Dalek Invasion of Earth in which the Daleks were seen crossing Westminster Bridge, with the Houses of Parliament in the background.

===Parodies===

Daleks have been the subject of many parodies, including Spike Milligan's "Pakistani Dalek" sketch in his comedy series Q,[tpl]cite news |title=Q6 – BBC2 |work=The Times |location=UK |first=Alan |last=Coren |authorlink=Alan Coren |date=12 December 1975 |page=14[/tpl]Newman, p. 35[tpl]cite journal |last=Lyons |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Lyons (writer) |coauthors=Chris Howarth |date=10 February 1999 |title=But Doctor, I haven't got the Ming-Mongs! |journal=Doctor Who Magazine |issue=274 |pages=29–30 |publisher=Marvel Comics |location=Tunbridge Wells, Kent |issn=0957-9818[/tpl] and Victor Lewis-Smith's "Gay Daleks".[tpl]cite news |title=Doctor stuck in a time warp |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/newsfeatures/2005/0312/1110452198946.html |newspaper=The Irish Times |location=Dublin |date=12 March 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2010 |first=Shane |last=Hegarty[/tpl] Occasionally the BBC has used the Daleks to parody other subjects: in 2002, BBC Worldwide published the Dalek Survival Guide, a parody of The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbooks.[tpl]cite book |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |coauthors=Nicholas Briggs, Stephen Cole, Jacqueline Rayner and Mike Tucker |editor=Ben Dunn (editor)|title=Dalek Survival Guide |year=2002 |publisher=BBC Worldwide |location=London |isbn=0-563-48600-7 [/tpl] Comedian Eddie Izzard has an extended stand-up routine about Daleks, which was included in his 1993 stand-up show "Live at the Ambassadors".[tpl]cite news |title=Eddie Izzard: The tough transvestite who can take care of himself |first=Rampton |last=James |newspaper=The Independent |date=23 May 2004 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/eddie-izzard-the-tough-transvestite-who-can-take-care-of-himself-564108.html |accessdate=3 February 2010 |location=London[/tpl] The Daleks made two brief appearances in a pantomime version of Aladdin at the Birmingham Hippodrome which starred Torchwood star John Barrowman in the lead role.[tpl]cite news |title=Aladdin @ Hippodrome |first=Holly |last=Beaumont-Wilkes |publisher=BBC News  |date=28 December 2007 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/12/28/aladdin_review_feature.shtml |accessdate=3 February 2010 [/tpl] A joke telling robot, possessing a Dalek-like boom, and loosely modelled after the Dalek also appeared in the South Park episode "Funnybot" even spouting out "exterminate".[tpl]cite web|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/1166181 |title=South Park: "Funnybot" Review – IGN A similar homage is in the popular USA children's MMO "Roblox" as the basic model for a morph, or skin changer, is named "Dalek". after a few re-writes, this was cut out. however, a similar parody exists, as when loading a world one of the enigma's random phrases is "TARDS".|publisher=M.ign.com |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011[/tpl] A Dalek can also be seen in the background at timepoints 1:13 and 1:17 in the Sam and Max animated series episode The Trouble With Gary.
