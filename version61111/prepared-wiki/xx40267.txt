Lauryn Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer–songwriter, rapper, producer, and actress. She is best known for being a member of the Fugees and for her solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
Raised in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin Wyclef Jean soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released two studio albums, Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996), which sold six million copies in the United States. In the latter record, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and a rendition of the hit "Killing Me Softly". Hill's tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997 to focus on solo projects.
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill's only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and finding a contemporary feminist voice with the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles "Doo Wop (That Thing)" (also a number one), "Ex-Factor", and "Everything Is Everything". At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. She won numerous additional awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines.
Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, suffering from the pressures of fame and dissatisfied with the music industry. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2001), sharply divided critics and did not sell nearly as well. Hill's subsequent activity has been sporadic; she has occasionally released songs and performed at music festivals. Her appearances in concert have been erratic and sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Although The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill focused primarily on love, Hill's work with the Fugees and recent repertoire has been heavily focused on social injustice.[tpl]cite news|last=Miller|first=Monica|title=Commentary: It's Time to Be Honest With Lauryn Hill|url=http://www.bet.com/news/national/2013/05/21/commentary-it-s-time-to-be-honest-with-lauryn-hill.html|publisher=Black Entertainment Television|accessdate=June 12, 2013|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl] It is also concerned with racism and female empowerment,[tpl]cite book|last=Perry|first=Imani|title=Prophets of the Hood: Politics and Poetics in Hip Hop|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|page=178|isbn=0-8223-8615-1[/tpl] and she has issued a series of public statements critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley.  In 2012, she pled guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.

==Life and career==

===1975–93: early life and early career===

Lauryn Hill was born on May 26, 1975, in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the younger of two children of English teacher Valerie Hill and computer and management consultant Mal Hill; her brother Malaney is three years older.  Her Baptist family moved to New York and Newark for short periods, until settling in South Orange, New Jersey. She had a middle-class upbringing, knowing both many white, Jewish families and many black ones.  Future actor Zach Braff lived in the neighborhood, and she attended his Bar Mitzvah.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/best/stars-who-went-to-high-school-together-654244-7#slide-7 | title=Stars Who Went to High School Together | first=Michael | last=Solomon | magazine=Elle | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=July 9, 2013[/tpl]
Hill has said of her musically-oriented family: "there were so many records, so much music constantly being played. My mother played piano, my father sang, and we were always surrounded in music."[tpl]cite web|title=Interview: Lauryn Hill, Singer, Songwriter & Record Producer|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/hil1int-1|publisher=Academy of Achievement|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] Her father did indeed sing in local nightclubs and at weddings.  Whilst growing up, Hill listened to a lot of Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight; years later she recalled playing Marvin Gaye's What's Going On repeatedly until she fell asleep to it.
In middle school, Hill performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before a basketball game. Due to its popularity, subsequent games featured a recording of her rendition. In 1988, Hill appeared as an Amateur Night contestant on It's Showtime at the Apollo. She sang her own version of the Smokey Robinson track "Who's Lovin' You?", garnering an initially harsh reaction from the crowd; she persevered and later applauded, although cried off-stage.
Hill attended Columbia High School, where she was a member of the track team, a cheerleader and was a classmate of Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/pop-superstar-s-vote-for-her-town-lauryn-hill-5-grammys-are-firmly-south-orange.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title=Pop Superstar's Vote for Her Town: Lauryn Hill and 5 Grammys Are Firmly in South Orange | first=Andrew | last=Jacobs | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 26, 1999 | accessdate=July 7, 2013[/tpl] Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, "I had a love for – I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, I was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment."
While a freshman in high school, through mutual friends, Prakazrel "Pras" Michel approached Hill about a music group he was creating.[tpl]cite web|title=Lauryn Hill In Pictures - The Story So Far|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/lauryn-hill-in-pictures---the-story-so-far/307177/3/1|publisher=NME|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] Hill and Pras began under the name Tranzlator Crew, chosen because they wanted to rhyme in different languages.  Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean.  The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows.  Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like  Salt-n-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers like Ice Cube and developed her flow from listening to them.  Hill later said, "I remember doing my homework in the bathroom stalls of hip-hop clubs."
Hill took acting lessons in Manhattan while growing up. She began her acting career in 1991, appearing with Jean in Club XII, MC Lyte's Off-Broadway hip-hop rendering of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.  While the play was not a success, an agent noticed her. Later that year, Hill began appearing on the soap opera As the World Turns in a recurring role as troubled teenager Kira Johnson.[tpl]cite web|title=Lauryn Hill |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005012/|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=June 16, 2013[/tpl]  She subsequently co-starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1993 release Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, playing Rita Louise Watson, a Catholic school teenager with a surly, rebellious attitude. In it, she performed the songs "His Eye Is on the Sparrow" (a duet with Tanya Blount) and "Joyful, Joyful".[tpl]cite web|title=Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit - Original Soundtrack|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sister-act-2-back-in-the-habit-mw0000107580|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] Director Bill Duke credited Hill with improvising a rap in a scene: "None of that was scripted. That was all Lauryn. She was amazing." Critic Roger Ebert called her "the girl with the big joyful voice", although he thought her talent was wasted,[tpl]cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sister-act-2-back-in-the-habit-1993|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=June 29, 2013[/tpl] while Rolling Stone said she "performed marvelously against type ... in the otherwise perfunctory film."  Hill also appeared in Steven Soderbergh's 1993 motion picture King of the Hill, in a minor but pivotal role as a 1930s gum-popping elevator operator. Soderbergh biographer Jason Wood described her as supplying one of the warmest scenes in the film.[tpl]cite book|last=Wood|first=Jason|title=Steven Soderbergh|year=2002|publisher=Pocket Essentials|location=Harpenden, Hertfordshire|isbn=1-903047-82-X|page=35[/tpl] Hill graduated from Columbia High School in 1993.

===1994–96: the Fugees===

Pras, Hill and Jean renamed their group to the Fugees, a derivative of the word "refugee", which was a derogatory term for Haitian-Americans.[tpl]cite news | last=Foege | first=Alec | authorlink=Alec Foege | title=Fugees: Leaders of the New Cool story | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=September 5, 1996 | pages=40–47[/tpl]   Hill began a romantic relationship with Jean. The Fugees, who signed a contract with Columbia/Ruffhouse Records in 1993, became known for their genre blending, particularly of reggae, rock and soul, which was first experimented on their debut album, Blunted on Reality, released in 1994.  It reached number 62 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart[tpl]cite web|title=Fugees - Chart History (Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart)|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=fugees|chart=R&B/Hip-Hop Albums B[/tpl]|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] but overall sold poorly and was met by poor critical notices due to being a (management-forced) attempt at gangsta rap attitudes.  Although the album made little impact, Hill's rapping  on "Some Seek Stardom" was seen as a highlight.[tpl]cite web|title=Fugees Biography|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/fugees/433278|publisher=Artistdirect|accessdate=June 17, 2013[/tpl] Within the group, she was frequently referred to by the nickname "L. Boogie".  Hill's image and artistry, as well as her full, rich, raspy alto voice, placed her at the forefront of the band, with some fans urging her to begin a solo career.
The Fugees' second album, The Score (1996), peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200[tpl]cite web|title=Fugees - Chart History (Hot 200)|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=fugees|chart=Billboard 200[/tpl]|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] and stayed in the top ten of that chart for over half a year. It sold about six million copies in the United States[tpl]cite web | url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database | title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database | publisher=Recording Industry Association of America | accessdate=July 7, 2013[/tpl] and more than 17 million copies worldwide. In the 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, The Score came second in the list of best albums and three of its tracks placed within the top twenty best singles.[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Pazz & Jop 1996 Critics Poll|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=July 13, 2013[/tpl] It won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album,[tpl]cite web|title=The Score - Fugees: Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-score-mw0000646570/awards|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] and was later included on Rolling Stone[tpl]'s[/tpl] list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[tpl]cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time - The Fugees, 'The Score'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-fugees-the-score-20120525|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl] Almost all of the writing and producing for it was done by Jean. The Score garnered praise for being a strong alternative to the gangsta idiom, and Hill stated, "We're trying to do something positive with the music because it seems like only the negative is rising to the top these days. It only takes a drop of purity to clean a cesspool."
Singles from The Score included "Fu-Gee-La" and "Ready or Not", which highlighted Hill's singing and rapping abilities, and "No Woman, No Cry". Her rendition of "Killing Me Softly" became her breakout hit.[tpl]cite news|title=Killing Me Softly by the Fugees|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/killing-me-softly-fugees|accessdate=June 18, 2013|newspaper=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Buttressed by what Rolling Stone publications later called Hill's "evocative" vocal line and her "amazing pipes", the track became pervasive on pop, R&B, hip-hop, and adult contemporary radio formats.[tpl]cite book|editor1-last=George-Warren|editor1-first=Holly|editor2-last=Ramanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|year=2001|publisher=Fireside Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7432-0120-5|pages=358–359|edition=3rd[/tpl] The Fugees entry online It won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[tpl]cite web|title=The Score - Fugees|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-score-mw0000646570|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl] On the album, Hill combined African-American music and Caribbean music influences with socially-conscious lyrics. Newsweek mentioned Hill's "irresistibly cute looks" and proclaimed her "the most powerful new voice in rap."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.questia.com/read/1G1-18177710/here-s-what-s-going-on-fugees-are-the-new-conscience | title=Fugees Are the New Conscience of Rap | last=Samuels | first=Allison | magazine=Newsweek | date=April 15, 1996 | accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]
At 21 years old, the now-famous Hill was still living at home with her parents.  She had been enrolled at Columbia University during this period, and considered majoring in history as she became a sophomore, but left after about a year of total studies once sales of The Score went into the millions.[tpl]cite news|last=Farley|first=Christopher John|authorlink=Christopher John Farley|title=Hip-Hop Nation: Lauryn Hill|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990180,00.html|accessdate=June 18, 2013|magazine=Time|date=February 8, 1999[/tpl]  In 1996, Hill responded to a false rumor on The Howard Stern Show that she had made a racist comment on MTV, saying "How can I possibly be a racist? My music is universal music. And I believe in God. If I believe in God, then I have to love all of God's creations. There can be no segregation."
In 1996, Hill founded the Refugee Project, a non-profit outreach organization that sought to transform the attitudes and behavior of at-risk urban youth.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/nyregion/jersey-footlights-on-the-cover-and-not-just-for-looks.html | title=On the Cover, and Not Just for Looks | first=Matt | last=Muro | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 12, 1999 | accessdate=July 6, 2013[/tpl]  Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange.  Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported of clean well water building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration.  A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429253/fugees-lauryn-get-help-from-puffy-mariah-busta-on-project.jhtml | title=Fugees' Lauryn To Get Help From Puffy, Mariah, Busta On Project | publisher=MTV News | date=October 27, 1997 | accessdate=July 5, 2013[/tpl]

===1997–99: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill===

Hill recorded her solo record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill from late 1997 through June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica.[tpl]cite book|last=Nickson|first=Chris|title=Lauryn Hill: She's Got That Thing|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-97210-5|pages=13, 148[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Furman|first=Leah|title=Heart of Soul: The Lauryn Hill Story|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-43588-5|coauthors=Furman, Elina[/tpl] The title was inspired by The Mis-Education of the Negro book by Carter G. Woodson and The Education of Sonny Carson, a film and autobiographical novel.[tpl]cite news|last=Checkoway |first=Laura |title=Inside 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-20080826?print=true |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=June 25, 2013[/tpl] The album featured contributions from D'Angelo, Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige and the then-unknown John Legend.[tpl]cite web|title=The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (Credits)|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-mw0000034642/credits|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 8, 2013[/tpl]  Wyclef Jean initially did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill turned him down. Several songs on the album concerned her frustration with The Fugees; "I Used to Love Him" dealt with the breakdown of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. Other songs such as "To Zion" spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to have an abortion so to not interfere with her blossoming career. Indeed, Hill's pregnancy revived her from a period of writer's block.
In terms of production, Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark, consisting of Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold Newton, and Johari Newton. Hill later said that she wanted to "write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul" and that the production on the album was intended to make the music sound raw and not computer-aided.  Hill spoke of pressure from her label to emulate Prince, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. She also wanted to be appreciated as an auteur as much as Jean had within the Fugees.  (She also saw a feminist cause: "But step out and try and control things and there are doubts. This is a very sexist industry. They'll never throw the 'genius' title to a sister.") While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, "We all love each other. This ain't about documents. This is blessed."
In the late 1990s, successful female artists in hip-hop were rare, with women mostly seen as scantily-clad dancers at best.[tpl]cite book | last=Change | first=Jeff | authorlink=Jeff Chang (journalist) | title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation | publisher=St. Martin's Press | location=New York | year=2005 | isbn=0-312-30143-X | pages=445–446[/tpl] Released on August 25, 1998, the album received rave reviews from contemporary music critics,[tpl]cite news|last=Strauss|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Strauss|date=February 25, 1999|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/25/us/5-grammys-to-lauryn-hill-3-to-madonna.html|title=5 Grammys to Lauryn Hill; 3 to Madonna|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] and was the most acclaimed album of 1998.[tpl]cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|date=December 19, 1998|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/19/entertainment/ca-55439|title=The Legal Tangle of 'Miseducation'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] Critics lauded the album's
blending of the R&B, doo-wop, pop, hip-hop, and reggae genres and its honest representation of a female's life and relationships. David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, called it "an album of often-astonishing power, strength, and feeling", and praised Hill for "easily flowing from singing to rapping, evoking the past while forging a future of her own".[tpl]cite web|last=Browne|first=David|title=Music Review: 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284625,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 4, 1988|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl] Robert Christgau quipped, "PC record of the year—songs soft, singing ordinary, rapping skilled, rhymes up and down, skits de trop, production subtle and terrific".[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Consumer Guide|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv1098-98.php|publisher=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl] It sold over 423,000 copies in its first week and topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks and the Billboard R&B Album chart for six weeks.

Hill, along with Blige, Missy Elliott, Meshell Ndegeocello, Erykah Badu, and others, found a feminist voice with the neo soul genre.
The first single released from the album was "Lost Ones" which reached number 27 in Spring 1998.[tpl]cite web|title=Lauryn Hill - Chart History (Hot 100)|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=lauryn hill|chart=all[/tpl]|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 8, 2013[/tpl]  The second was "Doo Wop (That Thing)", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. This song exemplified Hill's appeal, combining feelings of self-empowerment with self-defense. Other charted singles from the album were "Ex-Factor", "Everything Is Everything" and "To Zion". In the 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, Miseducation came second in the list of best albums and "Doo Wop (That Thing)" second in best singles.[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Pazz & Jop 1998 Critics Poll|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl]
In November 1998, Marley and Hill's second child, Selah Louise, was born.  Of being a young mother of two, Hill said, "It's not an easy situation at all. You have to really pray and be honest with yourself."
In the run-up to the 1999 Grammy Awards, Hill became the first woman to be nominated in ten categories in a single year. In addition to Miseducation works, the nominations included her rendition of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" for the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory, which had appeared on Billboard charts,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lauryn-hill-mn0000113753/awards | title=Lauryn Hill: Awards | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] and Hill's writing and producing of "A Rose Is Still a Rose", which became a late-in-career hit for Aretha Franklin.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Music-Review-Aretha-Franklin-Knew-You-Were-2835462.php | title=Music Review: Aretha Franklin - Knew You Were Waiting: The Best of Aretha Franklin 1980-1998 | first=Wesley | last=Britton | newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date= January 30, 2012 | accessdate=July 14, 2013[/tpl] She appeared on several magazine covers, including Time, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Teen People and The New York Times Fashion Magazine.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Missed+Message+of+Lauryn+Hill.-a054246116 | title=The Missed Message of Lauryn Hill | first=Andrea | last=Lewis | magazine=The Progressive | date=April 1999 | accessdate=July 6, 2013[/tpl] During the ceremony, Hill broke another record by becoming the first woman to win five times in one night, taking home the awards for Album of the Year, Best R&B Album, Best R&B Song, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22lauryn+hill%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All | title=Past Winners Search: 'Lauryn Hill' | publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] During an acceptance speech, she said, "This is crazy.

In February 1999, Hill received four awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards.[tpl]cite news|title=Lauryn Hill Wins Four NAACP Awards|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/512202/lauryn-hill-wins-four-naacp-awards.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=February 17, 1999[/tpl] In May 1999, she became the youngest female ever named to Ebony magazine's 100+ Most Influential Black Americans list;[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54527667.html | title=100+ Most Influential Black Americans | magazine=Ebony | date=May 1999 | accessdate=July 9, 2013[/tpl] in November of that year, the same publication named her as one of "10 For Tomorrow" in the "Ebony 2000: Special Millennium Issue".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-57800072.html | title=Jesse Jackson Jr., Lauryn Hill, Serena, Puff Daddy Are Among The Super Leaders Of The Future | magazine=Jet | date=November 15, 1999 | accessdate=July 9, 2013[/tpl] In May 1999, she made People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People list.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20128144,00.html | title=Most Beautiful: Lauryn Hill: Musician | magazine=People | date=May 10, 1999 | accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl]  The publication, which has called her "model-gorgeous", praised the [tpl]convert|5|ft|4|in|m|adj=on[/tpl] Hill for her idiosyncratic sense of personal style. In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where she said there was no contradiction in religious love and servitude and "being who you are, as fly and as hot and as whatever,"[tpl]cite news|title=Lauryn Hill Gets Emotional At "Essence" Awards|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429191/lauryn-hill-gets-emotional-at-essence-awards.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=March 27, 1999[/tpl] drew reaction from those in the public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/22/hill/ | title=Lauryn Hill: Hoochie or hero? | first=Debra | last=Dickerson | authorlink=Debra Dickerson | magazine=Salon | date=June 22, 1999 | accessdate=July 5, 2013[/tpl]  This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and she had said that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of many artists and producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Santana's 1999 multi-million selling Supernatural, which she had written, produced, and rapped on the track "Do You Like the Way" for (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of Cee Lo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana). She was also nominated for Best R&B Song for "All That I Can Say", which she had written and produced for Mary J. Blige. Also, her concocted duet with Bob Marley on "Turn Your Lights Down Low" for the 1999 remix tribute album Chant Down Babylon additionally appeared in the 1999 film "The Best Man" and later received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.
In November 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page lawsuit against Hill, her management, also her record label, claiming that Hill "used their songs and production skills, but failed to properly credit them for the work" on Miseducation.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/2000/05/10/pop_song/ | title=The reeducation of Lauryn Hill | magazine=Salon | date=May 10, 2000 | accessdate=August 11, 2013 | first=Rod | last=McLeod[/tpl] The musicians claimed to be the primary songwriters on two tracks, and major contributors on several others, though Gordon Williams, a prominent recorder, engineer, and mixer on Miseducation, described the album as a "powerfully personal effort by Hill" and said "It was definitely her vision." Hill responded that New Ark had been appropriately credited and now were seeking to take advantage of her success. New Ark requested partial writing credits on most of the tracks on the album as well as monetary reimbursement.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lauryn-hills-courtroom-saga-continues-20001031 | title=Lauryn Hill's Courtroom Saga Continues | first=Claudia | last=Perry | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=October 31, 2000 | accessdate=June 29, 2013[/tpl] After many delays, depositions took place during the latter part of 2000.  In part, the case illustrated the difficult boundaries between songwriting and all other aspects that went into contemporary arranging, sampling, and recording. The suit would eventually be settled out of court in February 2001, with Hill paying New Ark a reported $5 million.  A friend of Hill's later said of the suit, "That was the beginning of a chain effect that would turn everything a little crazy."

===2000–03: self-imposed exile and MTV Unplugged No. 2.0===

Hill began writing a screenplay about the life of Bob Marley, in which she planned to act as his wife Rita. She also began producing a romantic comedy about soul food with a working title of Sauce, and accepted a starring role in the film adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel Beloved; she later dropped out of both projects due to pregnancy. She also reportedly turned down roles in Charlie's Angels (the part that went to Lucy Liu), The Bourne Identity, The Mexican, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.
During 2000, Hill dropped out of the public eye. The pressures of fame began to overwhelm her. She disliked not being able to go out of her house to do simple errands without having to worry about her physical appearance. She fired her management team and began attending Bible study classes five days a week; she also stopped doing interviews, watching television and listening to music. She started associating with a "spiritual advisor" named Brother Anthony. Some familiar with Hill believe Anthony more resembled a cult leader than a spiritual advisor,[tpl]cite news | publisher=MSNBC | url=http://www.today.com/id/3731101#.UgeMZG007xk | title=Was Hill influenced to attack Catholic Church? | first=Jeannette |last=Walls |authorlink=Jeannette Walls |first2= Ashley |last2=Pearson | date=December 17, 2003 | accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] and thought his guidance probably inspired much of Hill's more controversial public behavior.
She later described this period of her life to Essence saying "People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that for the sake of the machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them."[tpl]cite news|last=Morgan|first=Joan|title=They Call Me Ms. Hill|url=http://www.essence.com/2006/01/16/they-call-me-ms-hill/|magazine=Essence|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=December 16, 2009[/tpl] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that."
On July 21, 2001, while pregnant with her third child, Hill unveiled her new material to a small crowd, for a taping of an MTV Unplugged special.  An album of the concert, titled MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, was released in May 2002 and featured only her singing and playing an acoustic guitar.[tpl]cite news|last=Needham|first=Alex|title=Hill, Lauryn : MTV Unplugged No. 2.0|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/lauryn-hill/6324|magazine=NME|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=April 21, 2002[/tpl]  Unlike the near-unanimous praise of Miseducation, 2.0 sharply divided critics. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the recording "is the unfinished, unflinching presentation of ideas and of a person. It may not be a proper follow-up to her first album, but it is fascinating."[tpl]cite web|title=MTV Unplugged No. 2.0|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mtv-unplugged-no-20-mw0000221606|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl] Rolling Stone called the album "a public breakdown" and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album's title opened Hill up for jokes that she had become unhinged. NME wrote that "Unplugged 2.0 is a sparse and often gruelling listen, but there is enough genius shading these rough sketches to suggest that all might not yet be lost." With the mixed reviews and no significant radio airplay, 2.0 debuted at number three on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite news|title=Musiq, Lauryn Hill Storm The Charts|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75754/musiq-lauryn-hill-storm-the-charts|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=July 11, 2013[/tpl] but then quickly fell down the charts[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/15/entertainment/et-hilburn15|accessdate=July 10, 2013|title=Hill Continues Her Lofty Course|date=July 15, 2002|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Hilburn|newspaper=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] and ended up selling less than 500,000 copies in the U.S.  Neither the album nor its songs placed in the 2002 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Pazz & Jop 2002 Critics Poll|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres02.php|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=July 13, 2013[/tpl] Her song "Mystery of Iniquity" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance[tpl]cite web|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=The 45th Annual Grammy Awards: Winner Predictions|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/the-45th-annual-grammy-awards-winner-predictions/160|work=Slant|accessdate=June 10, 2013|date=January 21, 2003[/tpl] and used as an interpolation by hip-hop producer/song-writer Kanye West for his single "All Falls Down" (eventually recorded by Syleena Johnson).[tpl]Cite news |last=Hall |first=Rashaun |title= Kanye West Collaborating With Lauryn Hill On New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496152/20050121/west_kanye.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=January 21, 2005|accessdate=June 8, 2013| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090114154501/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496152/20050121/west_kanye.jhtml| archivedate= January 14, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Around 2001, Marley and Hill's third child, Joshua Omaru, was born.  He was followed a year later by their fourth, John Nesta.[tpl]cite news|title=Keeping it in the family!

Furthermore, according to a 2003 Rolling Stone report, he had never secured a divorce; but Marley later disputed this and made public to a blog a 1996 divorce document from Haiti.[tpl]cite web | url=http://avahtaylor.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/a-conversation-with-rohan-marley-pt-1/ | title=Exclusive: Rohan Marley Sets the Record Straight | publisher=The Avah Taylor Company | date=June 9, 2011 | accessdate=February 23, 2014[/tpl]  The two had been living in a high-end Miami hotel, but around 2003 she moved out into her own place in that city.  Hill later said that she and Marley "have had long periods of separation over the years". Hill slowly worked on a new album and it was reported that by 2003, Columbia Records had spent more than $2.5 million funding it, including installing a recording studio in the singer's Miami apartment and flying different musicians around the country.
By 2002, Hill had shut down her non-profit Refugee Project.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/06/11/lauryn-hill-brainwashed/ | title=Lauryn Hill: Brainwashed? | first=Roger | last=Friedman | publisher=Fox News | date=June 11, 2002 | accessdate=July 5, 2013[/tpl]  She said, "I had a nonprofit organization and I had to shut all that down. You know, smiling with big checks, obligatory things, not having things come from a place of passion. That's slavery. Everything we do should be a result of our gratitude for what God has done for us. It should be passionate."
On December 13, 2003, Hill, during a performance in Vatican City, spoke of the "corruption, exploitation, and abuses" in reference to the molestation of boys by Catholic priests in the United States and the cover-up of offenses by Catholic Church officials.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Lauryn Hill Attacks Catholic Church At Vatican Concert|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1481109/20031215/hill_lauryn.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=December 15, 2003[/tpl] High-ranking church officials were in attendance, but Pope John Paul II was not present.  The Catholic League called Hill "pathologically miserable" and claimed her career was "in decline".[tpl]cite news|last=Shaw |first=Kathy |url=http://www.poynter.org/archived/abuse-tracker/19438/catholic-league-calls-lauryn-hill-pathologically-miserable/ |title=Catholic League Calls Lauryn Hill 'Pathologically Miserable' |publisher=Poynter Institute |date=December 16, 2003 |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] The following day, several reporters suggested that Hill's comments at the Vatican may have been influenced by her spiritual advisor, Brother Anthony.

===2004–09: sporadic touring and recording===

In 2004, Hill contributed a new song, "The Passion", to The Passion of the Christ: Songs. A remix version with John Legend of his "So High" ended up receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Around this time, Hill began selling a pay-per-view music video of the song "Social Drugs" through her website.[tpl]cite news|last=Patel |first=Joseph |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484249/20040109/hill_lauryn.jhtml?headlines=true |title=The Misvaluation of Lauryn Hill: $15 Music Video Posted Online |publisher=MTV News|date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Those who purchase the $15 video would only be able to view it three times before it expired. In addition to the video, Hill began selling autographed posters and Polaroids through her website, with some items listed at upwards of $500.
For the first time since 1997, the Fugees performed in September 2004 at Dave Chappelle's Block Party in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill's nearly a cappella rendition of "Killing Me Softly". The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim.[tpl]cite web|title=Block Party|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/block-party|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 8, 2013[/tpl] The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 on June 28, 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an internet single on September 27, 2005. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R&B Chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Fugees - Chart History (Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles)|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=fugees|chart=R&B/Hip-Hop Songs[/tpl]|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 8, 2013[/tpl] In 2005, she told USA Today, "If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children.

The music was about how I was feeling at the time, even though I was documenting my distress as well as my bursts of joy."
The Fugees embarked on a European tour in late 2005.[tpl]cite news|title=Reunited Fugees Plan Euro Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61243/reunited-fugees-plan-euro-tour|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl] Old tensions between Hill and the other members of the group soon resurfaced, and the reunion ended before an album could be recorded; Jean and Michel both blamed Hill for the split. Hill reportedly demanded to be addressed by everyone, including her bandmates, as "Ms. Hill"; she also considered changing her moniker to "Empress". Hill's tardiness was also cited as a contributing factor.
Hill began touring on her own, although to mixed reviews; often arriving late to concerts (sometimes by over two hours), performing unpopular reconfigurations of her songs and sporting an exaggerated appearance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1566531/20070807/hill_lauryn.jhtml?rsspartner=unknown |title=Lauryn Hill Plays Bizarre Show in NYC|publisher=MTV News|date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] On some occasions, fans have booed her and left early.[tpl]cite news|title=Label Source Says Lauryn Hill 'On Hiatus', Rohan Marley Says 'She's Always Working'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2008/08/label-source-says-lauryn-hill-on-hiatus-rohan-marley-says-shes-always-working/ |magazine=XXL Magazine|accessdate=August 11, 2013|date=August 5, 2008[/tpl] In June 2007, Sony Records said Hill had been recording through the past decade, had accumulated considerable unreleased material and had re-entered the studio with the goal of making a new album.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1563151/20070621/hill_lauryn.jhtml?rsspartner=rssFeedBurner |title=Lauryn Hill Suits Up For Second LP After Breaking The Ice With Penguin Song |publisher=MTV News|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Later that same year, an album titled Ms. Hill, which featured cuts from Miseducation, various soundtracks contributions and other "unreleased" songs, was released.

In early 2008, Marley and Hill's fifth child, Sarah, was born. The couple was not living together, although Marley considered them "spiritually together" even while listing himself as single on social media. Hill later said that she and Marley "have had a long and complex history about which many inaccuracies have been reported since the beginning" and that they both valued their privacy. By August 2008, Hill was living with her mother and children in her hometown of South Orange, New Jersey.[tpl]cite news|last=McGee|first=Tiffany|title=Whatever Happened to ...

Reports in mid-2008 claimed that Columbia Records then believed Hill to be on hiatus. Marley disputed these claims, telling an interviewer that Hill has enough material for several albums: "She writes music in the bathroom, on toilet paper, on the wall. She writes it in the mirror if the mirror smokes up. She writes constantly. This woman does not sleep". One of the few public appearances Hill made in 2008 was at a Martha Stewart book-signing in New Jersey, perplexing some in the press.[tpl]cite news|title=Lauryn Hill to Return to the Stage at Montreux Jazz Festival|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lauryn-hill-to-return-to-the-stage-at-montreux-jazz-festival-20090403|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=April 3, 2009[/tpl] In April 2009, it was reported that Hill would engage in a 10-day tour of European summer festivals during mid-July of that year. She performed two shows for the tour and passed out on stage during the start of her second performance and left the stage. She refused to give refunds to angry consumers for the show.[tpl]cite news|first=Daniel |last=Kreps |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lauryn-hill-cancels-european-tour-cites-health-reasons-20090610 |title=Lauryn Hill Cancels European Tour, Cites Health Reasons |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] On June 10, Hill's management informed the promoters of the Stockholm Jazz Festival, which she was scheduled to headline, that she would not be performing due to unspecified "health reasons." Shortly afterward, the rest of the tour was canceled as well.

===2010–present: further activities and imprisonment===

In January 2010, Hill returned to the live stage and performed in stops across New Zealand and Australia on the Raggamuffin Music Festival.[tpl]cite news|last=McKnight|first=Connor|title=Lauryn Hill Surfaces At Raggamuffin Music Festival In New Zealand|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959617/lauryn-hill-surfaces-at-raggamuffin-music-festival-in-new-zealand|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 9, 2013|date=January 25, 2010[/tpl]  Many of the songs that Hill had performed and recorded over the past six years were included on an April 2010 unofficial compilation album titled Khulami Phase.[tpl]cite web|title=Khulami Phase|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/khulami-phase-mw0002074322|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=May 25, 2013[/tpl]  The album also features a range of other material found on the Ms. Hill compilation.

In June 2012, Hill was charged with three counts of tax evasion for not paying federal taxes on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/29/lauryn-hill-tax-charges-pleads-guilty_n_1638204.html | title=Lauryn Hill Tax Charges: Singer Pleads Guilty In NJ, Faces Jail Time | first=David | last=Porter | agency=Associated Press | work=The Huffington Post | date=June 29, 2012 | accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl]  In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone "underground" and had rejected pop culture's "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism."  She added that, "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/22/lauryn-hill-faces-sentencing-in-nj-for-tax-evasion_n_3132379.html | title=Lauryn Hill Responds to Tax-Evasion Charges, Says She'll Rectify Situation | first=Natalie | last=Finn | publisher=E!

By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes."  Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business, that being holding recording sessions, out of a home without a zoning permit.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2013/04/lauryn_hill_eviction.html | title=Lauryn Hill reportedly faces eviction; tax evasion sentencing Monday | first=Vicki | last=Hyman | newspaper=The Star-Ledger | location=Newark | date=April 19, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2003[/tpl]
On May 4, 2013, Hill released her first official single in over a decade, "Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)". She later published a message on her Tumblr describing how she was "required to release it immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline."[tpl]cite news|title='Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix),' Lauryn Hill's New Track, Released By Singer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/05/neurotic-society-compulsory-mix-lauryn-hill-track_n_3219013.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=May 5, 2013|first=Madeline|last=Boardman[/tpl] The release received some criticism for lyrics that appeared to tie societal decay to certain LGBT social movements.  Following a deal with Sony Music, which involves Hill creating a new record label within the company, Hill was scheduled to release her first album in fifteen years during 2013.
On May 6, 2013, Hill was sentenced by Judge Arleo to serve in prison for three months for tax evasion and will face three months house arrest afterwards as part of a year of supervised probation.[tpl]cite news|title=Lauryn Hill jailed for tax evasion|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22429181|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=May 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=The tax education of Lauryn Hill: Prison|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/06/showbiz/lauryn-hill-prison|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 30, 2013|date=May 7, 2013[/tpl] She had faced a possible sentence of as long as 36 months, and the sentence given took into account her lack of a prior criminal record and her six minor-aged children. By this point Hill had fully paid back $970,000 in back taxes and penalties she owed, which also took into account an additional $500,000 that Hill had in unreported income for 2008 and 2009.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/100715823 | title=Is Lauryn Hill Being Singled Out Among Tax Evaders? | first=Robert | last=Frank | publisher=CNBC | date=May 7, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl]  In the courtroom, Hill said that she had lived "very modestly" considering how much money she had made for others, and that "I am a child of former slaves who had a system imposed on them. I had an economic system imposed on me." Hill reported to the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury on July 8, 2013, to begin serving her sentence.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/07/08/lauryn-hill-starts-prison-sentence/2499315/ | title=Lauryn Hill starts prison sentence | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=USA Today | date=July 8, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013[/tpl]
