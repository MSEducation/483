After a three-year cycle, the current Formula Renault 3.5 chassis was replaced by a brand new car built by Italian racecar constructor Dallara. The new car featured flex-fuel technology and could be powered by either premium unleaded petrol or E85 bioethanol, which was a first for this level of motorsport in Europe. The Renault V6 engine, prepared by French company Solution F, will also saw its power increased from [tpl]convert|425|hp[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|500|hp[/tpl].
The car also featured a new carbon bodyshell, as well as a new shaped front wing, hollowed sidepods and multiple side deflectors designed to improve aerodynamic performance. However, several areas of the car, including the gearbox, rear suspension and carbon brakes, remained the same in order to keep costs under control.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.renault-sport.com/en/world_series/formulaV6/news.php?news=55275.html | title = New Formula Renault 3.5 in 2008 | publisher = renault-sport.com | date = 2007-07-12 | accessdate = 2007-11-08|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928085758/http://www.renault-sport.com/en/world_series/formulaV6/news.php?news=55275.html |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
