Giuseppe Rovani (1818 - 1874) was an Italian novelist.
Rovani was born in Milan. He was known for criticism of historical novels of the Romantic style, which were popular in Italy at the time and whose stereotypes and old fashioned plots he pointed out. He wrote Lamberto Malatesta (1843), Valenzia Candiano (1843) and Manfredo Pallavicino (1845-1846).
He took part in the Italian Risorgimento and was a forerunner of the Milanese Scapigliatura.
His masterwork is the novel Cento Anni (1859-1864) which, together with Ippolito Nievo's Confessioni di un italiano, had an important impact on the evolution of Italian novel.
Rovani died in Milan in 1874. Before burial, his body was embalmed by Paolo Gorini.
