==In the United States==

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security a foreign national is defined simply as "an individual who is a citizen of any country other than the United States."http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/8%20Glossary.pdf The Brookhaven National Laboratory, under direction from the U.S. Department of Energy, further explains that, from the perspective of the United States, a foreign national is, "A person who was born outside the jurisdiction of the United States, is a citizen of a foreign country, and has not become a naturalized U.S. citizen under U.S. law. This includes Legal Permanent Residents (also known as Permanent Resident Aliens)."https://sbms.bnl.gov/sbmsearch/subjarea/185/185_SA.cfm  This definition presumably also applies to anyone who has successfully renounced his or her U.S. citizenship.
The term "foreign national" came into usage when the previously used term "foreigner" developed negative connotations.  They are synonyms.
