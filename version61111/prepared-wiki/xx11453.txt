[[Foreign relations of Venezuela]]

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of Venezuela

The foreign relations of Venezuela have since the early twentieth century been particularly strong with the United States. However with the election of Hugo Chávez as President of Venezuela in 1998, the foreign policy of the Hugo Chávez government differed substantially from that of previous Venezuelan governments.

==Latin America & The Caribbean==

Venezuela worked closely with its neighbors following the 1997 Summit of the Americas in many areas—particularly energy integration—and championed the OAS decision to adopt the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, also being among the first to ratify it (in 1997).

===Antigua and Barbuda===

In June 2009 Antigua and Barbuda became a formal member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) international cooperation organization and the Caribbean oil alliance Petrocaribe. In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda received US$50 million from Venezuela because of the country's membership in this alliance. After American billionaire Allen Stanford's banks failed, Hugo Chávez sent urgent financial assistance to Antigua and Barbuda, which was heavily dependent on Stanford's investment when his business empire collapsed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guardian.co.tt/business/business/2009/08/18/chavez-aids-antigua-barbuda-after-stanford-fraud-scandal |title=Business | The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper |work=The Trinidad Guardian |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Argentina===

US$1.4 billion was traded between Argentina and Venezuela during 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1154262320090811|title=Venezuela shops in Argentina after Colombia spat|date=11 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|publisher=Reuters[/tpl] Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez met Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Caracas on 11 August 2009. Kirchner called it a "bilateral meeting ... aimed at deepening our vital integration". The two presidents signed deals intended to see Venezuela import leather, machinery and poultry from Argentina, whilst a rice importation agreement was described by the Argentine President as "the biggest ever in Argentina's history". The deals were said to be worth $1.1 billion. The meeting coincided with visits to Venezuela by dozens of Argentine businessmen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2009/08/12/chavez-and-cristina-sign-a-billion-usd-trade-agreement|title=Chavez and Cristina sign a billion USD trade agreement|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|publisher=MercoPress[/tpl]

===Brazil===

In 2001 Venezuela and Brazil opened a high-voltage power line between the two countries to supply electricity from Venezuela to energy-starved northern Brazil. The line provides cheap hydro-electric power to Brazil and also earns Venezuela tens of millions of dollars every year.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1492788.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Brazilian economy slows | date=15 August 2001 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
In 2007 Brazil and Venezuela pledged closer trade and energy ties, including building a new oil refinery in Brazil. The $4.5bn refinery scheme to be completed in 2010 will be 40%-owned by Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA, while Brazil's national oil firm Petrobras will hold the rest.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7143728.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Brazil and Venezuela link trade | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
Venezuela purchased 1,500 tonnes of coffee beans from Brazil on 10 August 2009 after falling out with Colombia over its decision to allow an increased United States presence in its military bases.

===Colombia===

In the 20th century the relationship with Colombia evolved with ups and downs, mostly regarding the Colombia-Venezuela maritime territory dispute over the Gulf of Venezuela. The lowest point in the relationship occurred on 19 August 1987 after the Colombian Corvette ARC Caldas (FM-52) trespassed into disputed waters and then President of Venezuela, Jaime Lusinchi ordered the Venezuelan Air Force to the area and coerced the Colombians. The standoff was resolved through diplomatic channels but the dispute remained.[tpl]cite web |last=Tessieri |first=Enrique |title=Latin America's unresolved border disputes |url=http://www.tessieri.net/texts/latam.html |publisher=Enrique Tessieri|accessdate=26 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009153254/http://www.tessieri.net/texts/latam.html  |archivedate = 9 October 2007[/tpl]  Published in Power in Latin America (Issue 129/2004)
One of the main issues has been the large wave of Colombians that migrated to Venezuela in the 1970s and 1980s, working primarily in low-end jobs. Many Colombian immigrants were imprisoned in Venezuela under deplorable conditions, faced discrimination and endured human rights violations.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |last=Penalosa Pinzon |first=Arturo|title=Santa Ana, infierno de presos en Venezuela|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/2007-12-17/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3862781.html |publisher=El Tiempo|accessdate=17 December 2007 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Colombian armed conflict has also provoked impasses between the two countries. Military illegal incursions by the two countries' military forces into each other's territory have been frequent since the conflict in Colombia escalated in the 1980s, which subsequently triggered forced displacements in Colombia and into Venezuela. Illegally armed groups also trespassed into Venezuela to commit crimes. Contraband flows from one territory to another depending on supply and demand along the shared porous border of [tpl]convert|1375|mi|km|-1[/tpl].  Illegal products range from gasoline, drugs and weapons to stolen cars. Since 2002, the relationship between Colombia and Venezuela has fluctuated due to the ideological differences that separate Hugo Chávez and Álvaro Uribe. The relationship between the two countries once again reached a low point in November 2007 after a failed effort to achieve a humanitarian exchange, causing the relations to freeze.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |last=Ramirez |first=Socorro |title=Colombia - Venezuela: construir canales de comunicación para prevenir el conflicto |url=http://www.analitica.com/va/hispanica/colombia_paz/1417173.asp |publisher=Analitica.com|date=19 December 2000|accessdate=26 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215085321/http://www.analitica.com/va/hispanica/colombia_paz/1417173.asp  |archivedate = 15 December 2007[/tpl]
Following the revelation in 2009 that Colombia wanted to allow the United States to use it military bases, relations between Colombia and Venezuela soured, with Venezuela opting to shop in countries such as Argentina and Brazil. Trade between the two countries was worth $7 billion in 2008. In August 2009 Venezuela recalled an envoy from Bogotá over accusations Venezuela had provided arms to Colombian rebels, halted the import of Colombian cars and banned a Colombian energy firm from Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco region.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8186767.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Chavez turns up heat on Colombia | date=6 August 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
In 2010 the 2010 Colombia-Venezuela diplomatic crisis saw Colombia and Venezuela recall their ambassadors amid allegations by Colombia that Venezuela was actively permitting and supporting FARC/ELN camps on its side of the border. Assisted by UNASUR mediation, the crisis was resolved shortly after the inauguration of new Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. Santos made efforts to repair his relationship with Chavez in the months following taking office.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/11/16/colombia.extradition/ | publisher=CNN | title=Colombia: Suspected drug lord will be sent to Venezuela, not U.S | date=16 November 2010|accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]

===Cuba===

Relations between Cuba and Venezuela have significantly improved during the Presidency of Hugo Chávez. Chávez has formed a major alliance with Cuba's leadership and significant trade relationship with Cuba since his election in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9403289/Cuba|title=Cuba|author=Erikson, Daniel P.|accessdate=10 June 2008|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online[/tpl]  Hugo Chávez described Cuban President Fidel Castro as his mentor and has called Cuba "a revolutionary democracy".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4179050.stm|title=Venezuela ends upbeat Cuba visit|date=24 August 2005|accessdate=9 June 2008|publisher=BBC News | first=Stephen | last=Gibbs[/tpl]
The bilateral relation includes development aid, joint business ventures, large financial transactions, exchange of energy resources (for example discounted Venezuelan oil in exchange for Cuban doctors) and information technology, and cooperation in the fields of intelligence service and military. Both nations are delivering assets which are inexpensive for the sending country but of high significance for the receiving country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coverthistory.com/2012/04/02/the-logic-of-extremism-how-chavez-gains-by-giving-cuba-so-much/|title=The Logic of Extremism: How Chávez Gains by Giving Cuba So Much|author=Javier Corrales, Amherst College|format=PDF|accessdate=8 June 2008|publisher=Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, University of Connecticut[/tpl]

===Ecuador===

Diplomatic ties trace back to the Spanish colonization of the Americas.  With the independence both countries united under the Gran Colombia along with New Granada (then Colombia and Panama). After the dissolution of the Gran Colombia, Ecuador named Don Pedro Gual as plenipotentiary minister with the main task of resolving the debt acquired while part of the Gran Colombia union as well as to establish diplomatic relations with the New Granada and Venezuela.  On 4 August 1852 Venezuela sent a diplomatic delegation in Quito and named José Julián Ponce as finance administrator.
The relations remained cordial and entered into a second period between 1910 and 1963 with two diplomatic incidents occurring in 1928 and 1955. Ecuador and Venezuela strengthened ties in politics, diplomacy and military.

===Guyana===

There is a long-standing territorial dispute between the two countries over the area of Orinoco basin.
Venezuela claimed more than half of the territory of the British colony of Guyana at the time of the Latin American wars of independence, a dispute that was settled by arbitration in 1899. In 1962 Venezuela declared that it would no longer abide by the arbitration decision, which ceded mineral-rich territory in the Orinoco basin to Guyana. The area is called Guayana Esequiba by Venezuela. A border commission was set up in 1966 with representatives from Guyana, Venezuela and Great Britain, but failed to reach agreement. Venezuela vetoed Guyana's bid to become a member of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1967. In 1969 Venezuela backed an abortive uprising in the disputed area.
Under intense diplomatic pressure, Venezuela agreed in 1970 to a 12-year moratorium on the dispute with the Protocol of Port-of-Spain. In 1981, Venezuela refused to renew the protocol. However, with changes to the governments of both countries relations improved, to the extent that in 1990 Venezuela sponsored Guyana's bid for OAS membership.[ref]

===Mexico===

Historically the two countries have had good diplomatic relations. Ever since both countries became important players in the oil industry, some competitive tensions arose, eventually leading to disputes after Mexico signed an agreement to join NAFTA. During President Vicente Fox's term in the early 2000s, ties between the two countries became critically strained to the point of recalling one another's ambassadors. It has been clear that diplomatic relations between both countries are not indefinitely severed, in recent years numerous groups and organizations, both in holistic and in ambarsnowqueen land are working to restore the diplomatic relationship between the two countries, as they are of strategic economic and cultural importance within the region. In August 2007, after two years of diplomatic absence in either country, normal relations were re-established with the appointment of former foreign minister Roy Chaderton as Venezuela's envoy in Mexico City and the transfer of Jesús Mario Chacón Carrillo, formerly Mexican ambassador to Colombia, to Caracas.[tpl]cite news |title=transfer of Jesús Mario Chacón Carrillo to Caracas |url=http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/iht/search/?iht |work=The New York Times |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Paraguay===

Relations between Paraguay and Venezuela have improved since Paraguay's new leftist President Fernando Lugo was inaugurated, a change from 61 unbroken years of Colorado party rule. President Lugo supported Venezuela's entry into Mercosur; however, the Colorado Party's influence in Paraguay's Congress and Senate did not support the move.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
Paraguay and Venezuela have restarted negotiations on an unpaid debt of $250 million owed by Paraguayan oil company Petropar to its counterpart Petróleos de Venezuela after the Presidents of Paraguay and Venezuela met to deal with the financing.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In September 2009 Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo revoked plans for US troops to hold joint military exercises and development projects. President Lugo referenced strong regional opposition from countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador to the expansion of US military bases in Colombia in his decision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/20099181720730677.html |title=Paraguay cancels US troops deal|publisher=Al Jazeera |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]
On 17 October 2012, Venezuela's government expelled Paraguay's remaining diplomats from the country. Charge d'affaires Victor Casartelli said that he and three other Paraguayan diplomats in Caracas were told leave within three days. This follows a dispute between the countries that began in June 2012 with the congressional impeachment and ouster of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo.

==North America==

===Canada===

Venezuela and Canada have had diplomatic relations since January 1953. The relations between the two countries have been based on mutual commercial interests; especially in technology, oil and gas industry, telecommunications and others.
Venezuela is Canada's second largest export market in South America for goods as well as for services.The Canadian Embassy in Venezuela –The Canadian Trade Commissioner Service in Caracas http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/Office.jsp?oid=56 Accessed 18 December 2007 In 2006, goods exports from Canada increased by 14% and the cumulative stock of Canadian investments in Venezuela amounted to $574 million.The Canadian Embassy in Venezuela –The Canadian Trade Commissioner Service http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/Office.jsp?oid=56 Accessed 18 December 2007

===United States===

United States-Venezuela relations have traditionally been close, characterized by an important trade and investment relationship and cooperation in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs. Recently, there has been tension between the two countries since the election of Presidents Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and George W. Bush of the United States and strong criticism of US politics and military activity; Fifth Republic Movement/United Socialist Party was the only group which condemned the killing of Osama Bin Laden.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/2/venezuela-vp-slams-bin-laden-murder/ |title=Venezuela VP slams bin Laden 'murder' |author=Ben Birnbaum |date=2 May 2011 |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] "It surprises me to no end how natural crime and murder has become, how it is celebrated. At least before, imperialist governments were more subtle. Now the death of anyone, based on what they are accused of, but not only those working outside of the law like bin Laden, but also presidents, the families of presidents, are openly celebrated by the leaders of the nations that bomb them."

====The Roosevelt Corollary and Dollar Diplomacy====

The Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903 saw a naval blockade of several months imposed against Venezuela by Britain, Germany and Italy over President Cipriano Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in a recent Venezuelan civil war. Castro assumed that the United States' Monroe Doctrine would see the US prevent European military intervention, but at the time the US saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. Though United States Secretary of State Elihu Root characterized Castro as a "a crazy brute", President Roosevelt was concerned with the prospects of penetration into the region by the German Empire. With Castro failing to back down, US pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reaction to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This incident was a major stimulus behind the Roosevelt Corollary and the subsequent U.S. policy of Dollar Diplomacy in Latin America.
During the presidency of Juan Vicente Gómez, petroleum was discovered under Lake Maracaibo.  Gómez managed to deflate Venezuela's staggering debt by granting concessions to foreign oil companies, which won him the support of the United States and the European powers.  The growth of the domestic oil industry strengthened the economic ties between the U.S. and Venezuela.

====Hugo Chávez government====

After Hugo Chávez was elected President of Venezuela, the long-standing and close diplomatic relationship between Venezuela and the United States deteriorated. Chávez's stance as an OPEC price hawk raised the price of oil for the United States. His public friendship and significant trade relationship with Cuba conflicted with the U.S. foreign policy of isolating Cuba. Long-running ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were severed.  Chávez was intensely critical of U.S. economic and foreign policy: in Iraq, Haiti, Kosovo, Free Trade Area of the Americas and in numerous other areas. Chavez accused the United States of acting like an empire.[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/20/chavez.un/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Chavez: Bush 'devil'; U.S. 'on the way down' |date=21 September 2006 | accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]
Chávez also accused the US of involvement in, or at least foreknowledge of, the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
At the 2005 meeting of the Organization of American States, a United States resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature of democracies was widely seen as a move to isolate Venezuela.  The failure of the resolution was seen as politically significant, expressing Latin American support for Chávez.

==Other countries==

===People's Republic of China===

In 2008 the governments of Venezuela and the People's Republic of China launched their first joint space satellite, named Venesat-1. Venezuela's leader Hugo Chávez said the satellite would be a tool of integration for Latin America and the Caribbean regions by saying "This satellite is not for us but for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is a further step towards independence", he said, adding that the project would break the mold of "technological illiteracy."[tpl]cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxki0JZy9g4ZvLf1CyQ0Yogp8qzQ |title=Venezuela launches first satellite with Chinese technology  |date=30 October 2008 |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=Google News |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] In 2009, China entered into a partnership with Venezuela to launch a railway company in Venezuela which will be 40% controlled by the China Railways Engineering Corporation (CREC) and the remainder by Venezuela.

In February 2009 Venezuela and China agreed to double their joint investment fund to $12 billion and signed agreements to boost co-operation which include increasing oil exports from Venezuela, China's fourth biggest oil provider. An oil refinery is planned be built in China to handle Venezuelan heavy crude from the Orinoco basin. "It is part of a strategic alliance" Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said, after meeting the visiting Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping who stated that "our co-operation is highly beneficial".[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7898809.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=China and Venezuela boost links | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] In September 2009 Venezuela announced a new $16bn deal with China to drill for oil in a joint venture with PDVSA to produce [tpl]convert|450000|oilbbl/d[/tpl] of extra heavy crude.

When Hugo Chávez came to power, trade with China had peaked under $200mn but since then it has jumped to nearly $10bn. Chinese officials say that Venezuela has now become the biggest recipient of its investments in Latin America. Venezuela has also embarked on a programme of cultural and scientific exchange with China.[tpl]cite web|author=Dima Khatib |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/chinabuystheworld/2009/08/20098125223767930.html |title=Chavez's 'historic' China strategy  |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]

===Republic of China===

Relations have almost been nonexistent since Venezuela recognized the People's Republic of China in 1974, although unofficial relations have been preserved through a Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Caracas. In the 2000s, increasing partnership between the government of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and People's Republic of China has led to a more overt rejection of the Republic of China's legitimacy by Venezuela.

===France===

France has an embassy in Caracas and Venezuela has an embassy in Paris. During the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts, the French Government "immediately signalled its refusal to accept a breakdown in institutional legitimacy.

===Iran===

The presidents of Venezuela and Iran in 2009, President Hugo Chávez and President Ahmadinejad, respectively, both described themselves on the world stage as opposed to US imperialism. Citing this commonality of opinion, they regarded each other as allies, and they embarked on a number of initiatives together. For example, on 6 January 2007, the two announced that they would use some money from a previously-announced $2bn joint fund to invest in other countries that were "attempting to liberate themselves from the imperialist yoke", in Chávez's words.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-14-iran-venezuela_x.htm |title=Iran and Venezuela plan anti-U.S. fund |author=Pearson, Natalie Obiko |agency=Associated Press |date=14 January 2007 |work=USA Today |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]

===Israel===

Israel-Venezuela relations were historically strong.  Relations soured in 2006,  relating to President Hugo Chávez's convictions regarding the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, and partly due to Hugo Chávez's foreign policy relating to Iran and Israel's political opposition to it. Chavez also positioned himself on the world stage as opposed to American foreign policy — the USA and Israel are partners in defense and international relations, specifically relating to the Middle East. Currently, in the wake of the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Venezuela has broken all diplomatic ties with the state of Israel, condemning its actions.

===The Netherlands===

Diplomatic relations between the governments of the Netherlands and Venezuela were established in 1921 following a treaty to that effect concluded at Caracas on 11 May 1920.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 7, pp. 86-95. Relations between the two governments were strained, since the Venezuelan navy seized some Dutch ships during the First World War - even though the Dutch government remained neutral - and in that treaty, the Venezuelan government agreed to pay the Dutch government 20,000 Bolivars as indemnity for seizure of those ships.
The ABC Islands, all dependencies of the Kingdom of the Netherlands lie less than [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] off Venezuela's shores. Chávez described himself as a fierce opponent of "colonialism" and as such, was opposed to a large Western power having what he perceived as undue influence in Latin America and the Caribbean. The most populous of these territories are the island is Curaçao, whose demographics are not like that of Venezuela and much of South America.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Chávez called for "revolutionary independence" for these Islands, a proposition that has disturbed many islanders and high-ranking Dutch military officials in The Hague. This, combined with Chávez's recent alliances with nations hostile to the Western world, has prompted the Dutch government to position Dutch naval equipment on several unpopulated islands near Venezuela.
In January 2010, the Dutch PM Balkenende dismissed the allegations of Chávez that US war planes were being deployed as part of a planned attack. During a television interview Chávez had said "We accuse the American and the Dutch governments of provoking Venezuela and planning aggression". He showed a photograph of a US P3 warplane as proof. According to Balkenende the planes were being used to combat drug trafficking and the picture had been "taken from Wikipedia" and was dated from 2002 .[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/stop-talking-nonsense-dutch-pm-tells-chavez |title=Stop talking nonsense, Dutch PM tells Chávez |author=Mock, Vanessa |date=22 January 2010 |publisher=Radio Netherlands |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]
