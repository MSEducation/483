Henry Lee Giclas (December 9, 1910 â€“ April 2, 2007) was an American astronomer.
He worked at Lowell Observatory using the blink comparator, and hired Robert Burnham, Jr. to work there.
He discovered a number of comets, including periodic comet 84P/Giclas.
He also discovered a number of asteroids, including the Apollo asteroid 2201 Oljato and the Amor asteroid 2061 Anza. Some have tentatively identified Oljato as the parent body of the Chi Orionids meteor shower. The asteroid 1741 Giclas, discovered January 26, 1960 by the Indiana Asteroid Program, is named for him.
H.L. Giclas also worked on a notable proper motion survey with several relatively nearby stars bearing the Giclas name as a result e.g. Giclas 99-49.
