Morris Barry (9 February 1918 – 5 November 2000) was born in Northampton, England. He was a notable figure on the production side of the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s.
He made his name as a producer and director on productions such as Angels, Compact and Z-Cars; but his most impressive credit was perhaps as producer of the highly popular dramatisation of Poldark by Winston Graham.
Morris Barry had a strong connection with Doctor Who as well. He directed three stories during the Patrick Troughton years: The Moonbase (1966), The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967) and The Dominators (1968).
He also appeared as an actor in the Doctor Who story The Creature from the Pit in 1979, playing the scientist Tollund. His other acting credits include episodes of Are You Being Served?, Blake's 7, The Day of the Triffids, Tales of the Unexpected, All Creatures Great and Small, and Hi-de-Hi!.
Morris Barry died in 2000.
