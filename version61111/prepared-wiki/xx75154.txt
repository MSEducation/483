William Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789 – 6 December 1855), was a British ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist.

==Life==

Swainson was born in Dover Place, St Mary Newington, London, the eldest son of John Timothy Swainson, an original fellow of the Linnean Society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmbl.gu.se/libdb/taxon/personetymol/petymol.l.html |title=Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names. L |publisher=Tmbl.gu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] He was cousin of the amateur botanist Isaac Swainson.Etymologisches Worterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen by H. Genaust. Review by Paul A. Fryxell Taxon, Vol. 38(2), 245-246 (1989). [tpl]doi|10.2307/1220844[/tpl] His father's family originated in Lancashire, and both grandfather and father held high posts in Her Majesty's Customs, the father becoming Collector at Liverpool.
William, whose formal education was curtailed because of an impediment in his speech, joined the Liverpool Customs as a junior clerk at the age of 14."William Swainson F.R.S, F.L.S., Naturalist and Artist: Diaries 1808-1838: Sicily, Malta, Greece, Italy and Brazil."

William followed in his father's footsteps to become a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1815.
In 1806 he accompanied the British explorer Henry Koster to Brazil. Koster had lived in Brazil for some years and had became famous for his book Travels in Brazil, recently published.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/SWAI1789.htm |title=Some Biogeographers, Evolutionists and Ecologists; Chrono-Biographical Sketches: Swainson, William (UK-New Zealand 1789-1855) |publisher=Wku.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] There he met Dr Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff, also an explorer of Brazil, and Russian Consul General. They did not spend a long time on shore because of a revolution, but Swainson returned to the UK in 1818 in his words "a bee loaded with honey", with a collection of over 20,000 insects, 1,200 species of plants, drawings of 120 species of fish, and about 760 bird skins.
As with many Victorian scientists, Swainson was also a member of many learned societies, including the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society after his return from Brazil on 14 December 1820,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqSearch=(PersonCode=='NA1746') |title=Election of William Swainson as a Fellow of the Royal Society |publisher=Royalsoc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] and married his first wife Mary Parkes in 1823, with whom he had four sons ( William John, George Frederick, Henry Gabriel and Edwin Newcombe) and a daughter (Mary Frederica). His wife Mary died in 1835.
Swainson re-married in 1840 to Ann Grasby, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1841. Their daughter, Edith Stanway Swainson, married Arthur Halcombe in 1863.[tpl]DNZB|Ormsby|Mary Louise|2h3|Edith Stanway Halcombe|December 2011[/tpl] Swainson was involved in property management and natural history-related publications from 1841 to 1855, and forestry-related investigations in Tasmania, New South Wales, and Victoria from 1851 to 1853. Swainson died at Fern Grove, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, on 6 December 1855.

==Works on natural history==

Swainson was at times quite critical of the works of others and, later in life, others in turn became quite critical of him.
Apart from the common and scientific names of many species, it is the quality of his illustrations that he is best remembered for. His friend William Elford Leach, head of zoology at the British Museum, encouraged him to experiment with lithography for his book Zoological Illustrations (1820–23). Swainson became the first illustrator and naturalist to use lithography, which was a relatively cheap means of production and did not require an engraver. He began publishing many illustrated works, mostly serially. Subscribers received and paid for small sections of the books as they came out, so that the cash flow was constant and could be reinvested in the preparation of subsequent parts. As book orders arrived, the monochrome lithography prints were hand-coloured, according to colour reference images, known as ‘pattern plates’, which were produced by Swainson himself. It was his early adoption of this new technology and his natural skill of illustration that in large part led to his fame.William Swainson: Naturalist, author and illustrator by David M Knight. Archives of Natural History (1986) 13:275-290
When Leach was forced to resign from the British Museum due to ill health, Swainson applied to replace him, but the post was given to John George Children. Swainson continued with his writing, the most influential of which was the second volume of Fauna Boreali-Americana (1831), which he wrote with John Richardson. This series (1829–1837) was the first illustrated zoological study to be in-part funded by the British government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/audubon/audubon9.html |title=Contemporaries and rivals of Audubon |publisher=Sc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] He also produced a second series of Zoological Illustrations (1832–33), three volumes of Jardine's Naturalist's Library, and eleven volumes of Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia; he had signed a contract with Longman to produce fourteen illustrated volumes of 300 pages in this series, one to be produced quarterly.

===Classification of natural history===

In 1819 William Sharp MacLeay had published his ideas of the Quinarian system of biological classification, and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent.[tpl]cite web|author=—Darwin (1859: 413) |url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1991-bp |title=Representations of the Natural System in the Nineteenth Century .

Baigrie, ed.) |publisher=University of Toronto Press|date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] The Quinarian System later fell out of favour, giving way to the popularity of the mapmaking theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Lardner,[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.ed.uiuc.edu/westbury/Paradigm/HIGH_CHU.PDF |title=High Church Science: William Swainson and William Kirby, by DM Knight |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] and both Swainson and MacLeay became derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and MacLeay to Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://microecos.wordpress.com/2006/05/23/decimating-birds-episode-ii-namesakes |title=Decimating Birds: Episode II - Namesakes |publisher=Microecos.wordpress.com |date=2006-05-23 |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both MacLeay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes  'for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which has thrown so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Environment/NHR/swainson.html |title=Swainson's What? |publisher=Chebucto.ns.ca |date=2003-06-19 |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl]D.

==New Zealand estate==

In 1839 he became a member of the committee of the New Zealand Company and of the Church of England committee for the appointment of a bishop to New Zealand, bought land in Wellington, and gave up scientific literary work. He married his second wife, Anne Grasby, in 1840.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoonomen.net/bio/bios.html |title=Biographies of Zoologists |publisher=Zoonomen.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] He was apparently the first Fellow of the Royal Society to move to New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsnz.org/publish/nzjb/1980/45.pdf |title=See note on correspondence from Cockayne to Halcombe Mrs Blanche Stuart Halcombe, granddaughter of William Swainson |publisher=Rsnz.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]  He was later made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Tasmania.R.M.

Together with most of his children from his first marriage, they sailed for New Zealand in the Jane,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myers.orcon.net.nz/swainson.html |title=Life and descendants of William Swainson |publisher=Myers.orcon.net.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] reaching Wellington, in the summer of 1841. The trip was not without incident, as the boat suffered damage en route and was in such a poor state that there was legal action on arrival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/nzgenweb/passJKL.html |title=Passenger Lists into Wellington (Port Nicholson) |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~ourstuff/Jane.htm |title=Jane 1841 Passenger List |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] He purchased [tpl]convert|1100|acre|km2|0[/tpl] in the Hutt Valley from the New Zealand Company, and established his estate of "Hawkshead". Not coincidentally, this name was shared by an ancestral home in Hawkshead, Lancashire, of the Swainson family, which was the birthplace of Isaac Swainson. After a few months, this estate was claimed by a Māori chief, Taringakuri, which led to years of uncertainty and threat. He was an officer in a militia against in the Māoris in 1846. During these times he was largely dependent on his half pay.

==Botanical studies in Australia==

In 1851 Swainson sailed to Sydney and he took the post of Botanical Surveyor in 1852 with the Victoria Government, after being invited by the Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe to study local trees. He finished his report in 1853 in which he claimed a grand total of 1520 species and varieties of Eucalyptidae. He identified so many species of Casuarina that he ran out of names for them.
While having quite some expertise in zoology, his untrained foray into botany was not well received. William Jackson Hooker wrote to Ferdinand von Mueller:   In my life I think I never read such a series of trash and nonsense. There is a man who left this country with the character of a first rate naturalist (though with many eccentricities) and of a very first-rate Natural History artist and he goes to Australia and takes up the subject of Botany, of which he is as ignorant as a goose.
