==Career==

After running in the Republican primary as the Non-Partisan League candidate, Frazier was elected Governor in 1916 with 79% of the vote. Frazier was extremely popular and implemented several reforms such as the establishment of the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator. He was re-elected twice, in 1918 and 1920, but an economic depression hit the agricultural sector during his third term and resulted in a private-business-led grassroots movement to press for his recall. The movement succeeded, and in 1921 the governor was the first to be successfully removed from office.[tpl]cite web|title=Lynn Frazier|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/137/000208510/|publisher=Soylent Communications|accessdate=5 September 2012[/tpl]  Independent Voters Association member Ragnvald A. Nestos was elected in his place.
After the recall, Frazier was elected in 1922 to the United States Senate, again as the NPL candidate on the Republican ticket. He served until losing a bid for re-election in 1940, being unseated in the Republican primary by William Langer.
During the 1919 national coal strike Governor Frazier took a unique approach to the strike. He declared martial law, took over the mines with United Mine Workers of America contracts and ran them in cooperation with the union.Perlman, Selig and Philip Taft.
