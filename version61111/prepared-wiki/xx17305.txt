===Climate===

Chennai has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: Aw). The city lies on the thermal equator[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/data/comp/latest_cmoll.gif|title=latest cmoll.gif|publisher=Space Science and Engineering Centre, University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=About Chennai|url=http://www.cmdachennai.gov.in/pdfs/SMP/_A_About%20Chennai.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2012|publisher=Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority[/tpl] and is also on the coast, which prevents extreme variation in seasonal temperature. The hottest part of the year is late May to early June, known regionally as Agni Nakshatram ("fire star") or as Kathiri Veyyil, with maximum temperatures around [tpl]convert|35|–|40|C|F[/tpl]. The coolest part of the year is January, with minimum temperatures around [tpl]convert|15|–|22|C|F[/tpl]. The lowest temperature recorded is [tpl]convert|13.8|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] and the highest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] The average annual rainfall is about [tpl]convert|140|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].
The city gets most of its seasonal rainfall from the north–east monsoon winds, from mid–October to mid–December. Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal sometimes hit the city. The highest annual rainfall recorded is [tpl]convert|257|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2005. Prevailing winds in Chennai are usually southwesterly between April and October[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es2402/es2402page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualization|title=NASA climate data visualized|publisher=Classzone.com|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl] and northeasterly during the rest of the year. Historically, Chennai has relied on annual monsoon rains to replenish water reservoirs, as no major rivers flow through the area. Chennai has a water table at 2 metres for 60 percent of the year.

===Politics===

Being the capital of the Madras Province that covered a vast area of the Deccan region, Chennai remained the centre of politics in the southern region of India during the British era. After Independence, it remained the centre of political activities of the state of Tamil Nadu. Chennai is the birthplace of the idea of the Indian National Congress, commonly known as the Congress Party. Founded by Indian and British members of the Theosophical Society movement, most notably A.O. Hume,Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress, Bevir, Mark, University of California, Berkeley, Publication Date: 1 January 2003 s. 14–18. Original Citation: Mark Bevir, "Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress", International Journal of Hindu Studies 7 (2003), 99–115. E.g., "Theosophical Society provided the framework for action within which some of its Indian and British members worked to form the Indian National Congress.10", "1884 annual convention of the Theosophical Society. At this convention, Rao argued that the Society should start formally to discuss the political situation in India as well as more strictly religious matters. Although Rao did not get his way, he did arrange a meeting of sympathetic theosophists to be held at his home. Those who attended this meeting with Rao included Aiyar, Ananda Charlu, and M. Viraraghavachariar. They formed the Madras Mahajana Sabha," "meeting to coincide with the next annual convention of the Theosophical Society. This meeting would promote their idea of an all-India body." "Hume was probably the single most important individual for the formation of the Indian National Congress." the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in the city in December 1884.Sitaramayya, B. Pattabhi. 1935. The History of the Indian National Congress. Working Committee of the Congress. Scanned version During the first 50 years of the Indian National Congress, the city played host to its conferences seven times in 1887, 1894, 1898, 1903, 1908, 1914 and 1927, becoming one of the strong bases for the Indian independence movement. After independence, the city hosted the Congress in 1955 in its suburb of Avadi.
Chennai is also the birthplace of several regional political movements since the British era. South Indian Welfare Association, one of the earliest regional parties, was founded in 1916, which later came to be known as the Justice Party, which was the main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state.[tpl]Harvnb|Rajaraman|1988| loc=ch. 4 (Ideology, Organisation and Programme of the Justice Party)[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Irschick|1969| pp=172–178[/tpl] In 1944, the party was renamed Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) by E. V. Ramasami (popularly known as 'Periyar'). The party was a non-political party that demanded the establishment of an independent state called Dravida Nadu.[tpl]Cite book|last = Taylor |first = Richard Warren |title = Religion and Society: The First Twenty-five Years, 1953–1978 |publisher = Christian Literature Society (for the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, Bangalore) |year = 1982 |oclc = 9007066 |page = 242[/tpl] However, due to the differences between its two leaders Periyar and C. N. Annadurai, the party was split. Annadurai left the party to form the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK decided to enter into politics in 1956.
Since the 19th century, when Western scholars proposed that Dravidian languages, which dominated the southern region of India, formed a different linguistic group to that of the Indo-Aryan languages that are predominant in the north of the subcontinent, the aspects of Tamil nationalism gained prominence. This resulted in the Anti-Hindi agitations in the city and across the state. However, the post-Independence re-organisation of Indian states according to linguistic and ethnic basis has moderated Tamil nationalism, especially the demand for separation from the Indian Union. The Anti-Hindi agitations in mid-1960s made the DMK more popular and more powerful political force in the state. The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics.

==Architecture==

With the history of many neighbourhoods of the city such as Mylapore and Triplicane antedating that of the city itself, the architecture of Chennai ranges in a wide chronology. The oldest buildings in the city dates back to 7th and 8th centuries CE, which include the Kapaleeshwarar Temple in Mylapore and the Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane built in the Dravidian architecture. This architecture style includes various styles such as those of the Pallavas, the Cholas, and the Vijayanagara empires. The associated Agraharam architecture, which consists of traditional row houses surrounding a temple, can still be seen in these areas.[ref]
