==History==

John Dickson, a Baltimore native, arrived in Erie in 1808. During the War of 1812, Dickson became a prisoner-of-war. After the war, Dickson opened a hotel on French Street between 3rd and 4th Streets. He bought a plot of land on the corner of 2nd and French Streets where, a year later, William Himrod built a tavern.[tpl]sfn|Claridge|1989|loc=§ 8, p. 1[/tpl] The tavern itself was named by Dickson the "Exchange Coffee House" to appeal to the higher class.[tpl]sfn|Claridge|1989|loc=§ 8, p. 2[/tpl] Dickson was known for hosting outdoor banquets during the summer months. One such banquet, on June 9, 1825, was attended by the Marquis de Lafayette, who visited Erie on his return to the United States.[tpl]sfn|Claridge|1989|loc=§ 8, p. 2[/tpl] Dickson moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1829 and opened another establishment. He moved, again, to Pittsburgh two years later and sold the tavern in Erie for $1,800.
The tavern continued to be used as an eating establishment by various owners, until it was sold 1841.[tpl]sfn|Claridge|1989|loc=§ 8, p. 3[/tpl] In 1841, an addition was made to the building and it was used as a residence until 1924.
