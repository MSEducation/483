"Here Comes Summer" was a 1959 song, which was written and performed by Jerry Keller. The song was produced for Keller by Richard Wolf and released on London Records. It reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 for one week in the UK Singles Chart. The song uses the opening quote from the Stephen Foster song "My Old Kentucky Home" ("The Sun Shines Bright"). It was Keller's only hit either side of the Atlantic.
It was also recorded by The Dave Clark Five in 1970, but was not as commercially successful. The pop band Child released the song as a single in 1979, but it also failed to enter the UK Chart.
