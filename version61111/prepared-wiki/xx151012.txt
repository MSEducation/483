==History==

Thaksin University began with deciding to establish a branch campus in the regions of the country of the College of Education. It was established as College of Education, Songkhla on October 1, 1968. On June 29, 1974 the status of College of Education, Songkhla was upgraded to become a regional campus of Srinakharinwirot University called Srinakharinwirot University, Songkhla Campus and commenced a four-year degree program; over time they steadily expanded the programmes offered.
In 1989, the university laid out a project to expand to a new campus in Phattalung with the purpose of following a development plan and so new faculties could be established in the future because the original areas have only 142 rai (approximately 56 acres). It was not enough to set up the new faculties and develop in the future. Thaksin University was donated a plot of land totaling 3,500 rai from Phattalung Province at Tambon Ban Plao, Pa Payom District, Phattalung Province, which was a new area to be a new campus. Eventually, Srinakharinwirot University, Songkhla Campus was renamed as Srinakharinwirot University, Southern Campus this year.[tpl]when?|date=December 2012[/tpl]
To continue the natural development and effective management of the university, the parliament passed the Thaksin University Act, which became effective on September 1, 1996 and became as the independent Thaksin University. The name means the University of the South.
In 2011, Thaksin University changed the establishment day from September 1 to October 1 because it was the establishment day of College of Education, Songkhla.
The International Graduate Program had its first two Ph.D. graduates in 2013 - some details are presented in a short video Princess Sirindorn awards degrees.
