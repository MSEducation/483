Methylchloroisothiazolinone (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), also referred to as MCI, is a preservative with antibacterial and antifungal effects within the group of isothiazolinones. It is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and fungi.
Methylchloroisothiazolinone is found in many water-based personal care products and cosmetics.[tpl]cite journal | author = Reinhard et al. | title = Preservation of products with MCI/MI in Switzerland | journal = Contact Dermatitis | year = 2001 | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 257-264 | pmid = 11722483 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.450501.x[/tpl] Methylchloroisothiazolinone was first used in cosmetics in the 1970s. It is also used in glue production, detergents, paints, fuels, and other industrial processes. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is known by the registered tradename Kathon CG when used in combination with methylisothiazolinone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Knudsen BB, Menne T | title = Kathon CG--a new contact sensitizing preservative | journal = Ugeskr Laeger | year = 1990 | volume = 152 | issue = 10 | pages = 656-657 | pmid = 2321281[/tpl]
Methylchloroisothiazolinone may be used in combination with other preservatives including ethylparaben, benzalkonium chloride, or 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol.

==Safety==

In pure form or in high concentrations, methylchloroisothiazolinone is a skin and membrane irritant and causes chemical burns. In the United States, accepted concentrations are 15 ppm in rinse-offs and 8 ppm in other cosmetics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), does not currently list methylchloroisothiazolinone as a known, probable, or possible human carcinogen,[tpl]cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/index.php|title=International Agency for Research on Cancer|work=IARC (updated November 2007)|accessdate=7 January 2008[/tpl] nor have in vivo tests found evidence of carcinogenic activity.

===Allergic contact dermatitis===

Methylchloroisothiazolinone is an allergen for a small but growing portion of individuals.  The first publication of the preservative as a contact allergen was in 1988.[tpl]Cite pmid|3279090[/tpl]   In 2013, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named methylchloroisothiazolinone as the Contact Allergen of the Year.[tpl]Cite pmid|23340392[/tpl]  A common indication of an allergic reaction is eczema-like symptoms including redness and itching, and upon longer exposure also burning sensations and blisters on the part of the skin that is exposed to the allergen.  Continued exposure can lead to high sensitization which will be triggered each time the individual comes in contact with the allergen due to the memory T-cells that will remain in the local skin area.
