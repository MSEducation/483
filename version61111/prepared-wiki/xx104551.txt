[[Lander (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Lander is a lunar crater that is located just to the north-northeast of the prominent Tsiolkovskiy, on the far side of the Moon. 
Attached to the northeastern rim of Lander is Volkov J, which is joined with Volkov to the north. Just to the southeast of Lander is Patsaev. Lander cannot be seen directly from the Earth, and must be observed from orbit.This is a worn and eroded crater formation, with features that have become poorly defined and softened due to subsequent impacts and possibly some overlap of ejecta from Tsiolkovskiy and other sources. The inner rim is wider and has a gentler slope along the eastern side. The interior floor is relatively level, but contains some low rises. Only a few tiny craterlets dot the rim and interior of this formation.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lander.
