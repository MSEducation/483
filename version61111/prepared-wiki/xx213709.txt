Archedictyon (from Greek Arche meaning first, original, ancient, primitive, or most basic http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/179/3/?spage=12&letter=A Word Info: "arche-" and dictyo- meaning net or netlike,http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/645 Word Info: dictyo- plural "archedictya") is a name given to a hypothetical scheme of wing venation proposed for the common ancestor of all winged insects.http://psyche.entclub.org/77/77-001.html Jarmila Kukalová.

==Description==

The nature of the archedictyon is an important consideration in the taxonomic classification of the large, primitive Palaeozoic insects known as Palaeodictyoptera and was used by Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart for this purpose as early as 1854.http://psyche.entclub.org/77/77-001.html Jarmila Kukalová. "Revisional Study of the Order Palaeodictyoptera in the Upper Carboniferous Shales of Commentry, France" Part III. Psyche 77:1-44, 1970. A National Museum of Natural History database for the study of ants, wasps, bees and termites describes the archedictyon as:
 ...the primitive original vein network characterizing the wings of many of the most ancient insect fossils (T-B, after Needham; Mackerras, in CSIRO); in Mastotermitidae and Hodotermitidae (Isoptera), the complex network or reticulum of irregular veinlets between the veins in the apical 3 quarters of both wings, including the anal lobe (Emerson).http://antbase.org/databases/glossary_files/glossary_A.htm Museum of Natural History 
According to a 1999 scientific paper about the evolution of flght in Palaeozoic Palaeoptera, although the archedictyon of some Palaeodictyoptera have long been believed to be generalized plesiomorphic reticulation from which true cross veins developed through evolution, these may actually be an adaptive feature.http://www.famu.org/mayfly/pubs/pub_w/pubwoottonr2000p129.pdf Cambridge Philosophical Society: Flight adaptations in Palaeozoic Palaeoptera (Insecta)

==Structure==

The archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal veins, but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of fossil data and speculation.http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/645 Archedictyon
The "Comstock-Needham system" designed by entomologists John Henry Comstock and George Needham describes these veins and their branches:
Crossveins are named based on their relative position to the more prominent longitudinal veins:

==Extant species==

The hypothetical primitive wing venation pattern is often used as a basis for describing the pattern in modern insects.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In extant insects, the term implies a retention of primitive characteristics but not necessarily a simplicity of design in comparison to the veinous network of other modern insect wings.  Contemporary insects with wings to which the term archedictyon has been applied include the termite Mastotermes darwiniensis from Australia (illustration)[tpl]copyvio-inline[/tpl] and the praying mantis Orthodera novaezealandiaehttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Orthodera_novaezealandiae.html Purkayastha, M. 1999, Orthodera novaezealandiae, University of Michigan Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 27, 2008 from New Zealand.
The term is also used in the discussion of phasmids and in such case refers to:
 A network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in the elytron. It is these veins which make the elytron and costal region of the hindwing thicker and stiffer than the anal region of the hindwing.http://phasmid-study-group.org/glossary Glossary of terms used to describe phasmids
