==Football career==

Díaz started his career with Club Atlético Independiente in 1995. In his first season as a professional he helped El Diablo Rojo win the South American Supercup, in an eventual 2–1 aggregate win against Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, and appeared in more than 150 official games with the team during his five-year spell.
In 2000 Díaz moved to Italy and joined Udinese Calcio, only missing three Serie A matches as the club finished in 12th position. In the following four years he played in Spain, representing RCD Mallorca, Levante UD, Albacete Balompié, Ciudad de Murcia and UD Almería, having little overall impact and only totalling 14 La Liga games with the first and the third clubs combined.
Díaz returned to his country in 2005, successively representing Olimpo de Bahía Blanca, Club Atlético Huracán and Arsenal de Sarandí, winning two major titles with the latter side, namely the 2007 Copa Sudamericana. He retired from football in 2009 at the age of 33.
