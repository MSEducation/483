Oman has one expressway grade highway running along the Batinah Coast of the Gulf of Oman. It forks near Shinas, with one leading inland to Wadi Hatta and another to Fujairah. The speed limit is generally 120 km/h. In the Muscat area, this highway is known as Sultan Qaboos Street, and it is the trunk road running through the city. Outside the Muscat area, the interchanges take the form of roundabouts spaced approximately 7 km apart. Each roundabout contains unique features to enliven the streetscape. The roundabouts are named for driver navigation.
Other roads are two lane highways in very good condition. There is ample desert scenery. The road between Diba and Al Khasab is gravel, despite what some maps may say.
