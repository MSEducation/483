==Reception==

Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised Chaplin and Rey; "The main reasons to see the film are the two leading performances. Mr. Rey is always an interesting presence, and Miss. Chaplin as in all of her Saura films, reveals qualities of feeling, control and beauty that no other directors have ever found."
Saura was nominated for the Palme d'Or for the film, and won Best Director at Spain's Cinema Writers Circle Awards.Awards for Elisa, vida mia Retrieved on 30 July
