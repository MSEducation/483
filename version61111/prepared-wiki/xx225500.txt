==Post-debate poll==

CBS News interviewed a nationally representative sample of 178 uncommitted debate-watchers. The sample was of voters who were either undecided about whom to vote for or who had a weak preference that could be changed. Of the group, 41 percent said Edwards won the debate, 28 said Cheney won, and 31 percent thought it was a tie. Both uncommitted men and uncommitted women preferred Edwards.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/05/opinion/polls/main647648.shtml
According to telephone interviews conducted by SurveyUSA in Florida, 44 percent of people thought that Cheney had "clearly won" the debate, while 40 percent of people said the same of Edwards. A separate poll found of 1000 likely voters found that 43 percent believed Cheney won while 37 percent felt Edwards did better. Moreover, after the debate 47 percent said that Cheney was "very qualified" to assume the responsibilities of president (a 7 percent rise), while only 25% said the same of Edwards (no change).http://www.rasmussenreports.com/VP%20Debate.htm
