"You Played Yourself" is a 1990 rap single by Ice-T, from his third album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say.
The song tells the story of a would-be rapper who goes uneducated thinking he is a gangster when really he is nothing. He offends his fans because he thinks he is above them but they turn on him - he is left unemployed with no one because he has offended them all. He becomes a drug addict, he is paranoid and doesn't eat. He rips off his family for drug money and they disown him. He then tries to do an armed robbery to get money but accidentally kills someone and ends up on death row.  The track heavily samples "The Boss" by James Brown from the Black Caesar (film) soundtrack.
