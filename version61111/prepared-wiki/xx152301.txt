Emperor Gaozu of (Later) Han ((後)漢高祖) (March 4, 895–March 10, 948), personal name Liu Zhiyuan (劉知遠), later changed to Liu Gao (劉暠), was the ethnically-Shatuo founder of the Later Han, the fourth of the Five Dynasties in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of Chinese history.  It, if the subsequent Northern Han is not considered part of its history, was also one of the shortest-lived states in Chinese history, lasting only three years.

==Founder of a dynasty==

Liu Zhiyuan was the military governor of Bingzhou, an area around modern-day Taiyuan in Shanxi, long a stronghold of the Shatuo Turks, for the Later Jin.  The Later Jin had been little more than a puppet of the powerful Khitan empire to the north.  When, in 946, the emperor of the Later Jin decided to defy the Khitan under growing pressure from not only subjects among the Shatuo Turks, but also Han Chinese at their subservient status, the Khitans led a military attack that shattered the Later Jin.  On the return to their southern capital at present-day Beijing, the Khitan emperor died, providing just enough of a vacuum of power for Liu Zhiyuan to move in and declare the establishment of the Later Han. He named his government "Han" as a consequence of claiming to be a descendant of Liu Bang, the first Emperor of the Western Han Dynasty, thus relinquishing his Shatuo Turk originality.

==Brief rule==

Liu Zhiyuan was able to take control over the same territories that the Later Jin had reigned over.  Declaring himself emperor of the Later Han, he was able to enjoy his new status for only a brief period of time as he died the following year.  Liu was succeeded by his teenage son.  The dynasty would fall two years later in a military coup that resulted in the founding of the Later Zhou.
