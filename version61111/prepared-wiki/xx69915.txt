The Givati Brigade ([tpl]lang-he-n|חֲטִיבַת גִּבְעָתִי[/tpl], literally "Hill Brigade" or "Highland Brigade" in English) is an infantry brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, and serves as its amphibious force. Givati soldiers are designated by purple berets. The Brigade's symbol is the fox, alluding to Shualei Shimshon (שועלי שמשון, lit. Samson's Foxes), a unit in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

==History==

Givati was formed in December 1947 and placed under the command of Shimon Avidan. At the start of the 1948 War of Independence, the brigade was charged with operations in the central region of Israel, participating in operations Hametz, Barak and Pleshet. As the war entered its second stage, Givati became the 5th Brigade, was moved to the south, and concentrated mainly around Gedera, Gan Yavne and Be'er Tuvia. One battalion fought on the Jerusalem front, participating in Operation Nachshon and the Battles of Latrun.
When Israel declared independence, Givati consisted of 5 battalions, with notable commanders such as Jehuda Wallach (51st Battalion), Ya'akov Pri (52nd Battalion), Yitzhak Pundak (53rd Battalion), Tzvi Tzur (54th Battalion) and Eitan Livni (55th Battalion). A sixth battalion (the 57th) was founded on May 30, 1948 from Irgun veterans, in preparation for Operation Pleshet. The brigade or parts thereof subsequently participated in the Battle of Nitzanim, Operation An-Far, Operation Yoav, etc. It was converted into a reserve brigade in 1956.

===1980s===

The Givati was reestablished as a mechanized infantry brigade and then proceeded on to amphibious warfare in 1983. In 1986 the brigade's purple beret was officially approved.[tpl]cite book|last=Aviram|first=Itu|title=With Me to Givaati|year=1999|publisher=Israel Ministry of Defense|isbn=965-05-1007-9|accessdate=24 November 2011|page=134|language=Hebrew|quote=חלפו עוד שנתיים, עד פברואר 1986, עד שהכומתה אושרה סופית ומפקדי החטיבה וחייליה יכלו לחבוש אותה בגאווה.[/tpl] Since 1999 it serves under Israel's Southern Command.

===2002-2003===

The Givati Brigade served under the Southern Command and was deployed in the Gaza Strip. The Brigade was awarded a medal of honor for its service in the Gaza Strip during the last two years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, when under the command of Imad Fares. Under Fares' command, the Givati Brigade carried out thousands of operations in the Gaza Strip.

===2004===

The brigade continued its operations in the Gaza Strip under the command of Eyal Eisenberg and the new head of Southern Command, Dan Harel. Givati's Recon Battalion, the Dolev combat engineering platoon and the Bedouin scouts battalion, won a recommendation of honor, mainly for their activities against Rafah's smuggling tunnels. Givati forces, combined with a special combat engineering tunnels unit, and IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers, managed to suppress most of Rafah's tunnels.
On May 11 and May 12, 2004, two armored personnel carriers of Givati's Dolev engineering battalion were destroyed by Palestinian militants. The two separate attacks, in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood and the Philadelphi Route near Rafah and the Egyptian border, claimed the lives of 11 soldiers. Islamic Jihad militants captured some of the remains, causing outrage in Israel.[ref]

In the Zeitoun incident, UNRWA ambulances were used as transport by healthy Palestinian fighters.http://canadiancoalition.com/unrwa/Reuters-UNAmblulance-110504.wmv[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] In an interview with Haaretz, Israel's Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz also said that UNRWA's ambulances were used by Palestinian militants in order to smuggle some of the remains of IDF soldiers killed in Zaitoun neighbourhood in Gaza on May 11, 2004.http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/427679.html[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] UNRWA has described the May 11 incident as a hijacking.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] 
After two more soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israel launched Operation Rainbow. This involved Givati forces reinforced by Golani Brigade soldiers with IDF Achzarit HAPCs, a battalion of officers from the class-commanders school and several IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers. The stated aim of Operation Rainbow was to destroy the terror infrastructure of Rafah, destroy smuggling tunnels and stop illegal missile shipment.
The brigade's Shaked battalion, under the command of a Lt. Col. "Ofer" (surname not publicized) was rocked by scandals in the second half of 2004 while stationed in the southern Gaza Strip.
Two of the battalion's four company commanders were removed, although one was later exonerated. Captain "R", a Druze officer was tried for killing Iman al-Hams, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl, in Rafah in October 2004.[ref]
