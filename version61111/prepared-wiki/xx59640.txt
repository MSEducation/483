==Song==

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: "Fight", the University of Saskatchewan fight song, which was composed by Russell Hopkins: "Fight, fight, fight for the dear old Green and White, Saskatchewan, our University. And it's shout, shout, shout and let your voice ring out, For Saskatchewan, our University. We'll rise to a man, be it win or lose or draw, And cheer old Alma Mater with a rah-rah-rah! For Deo Patrie our mother strong and free - Saskatchewan our University – Rah!"[ref]
