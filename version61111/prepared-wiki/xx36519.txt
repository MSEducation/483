==Career==

===Late 1980s–1994: Underground beginnings and album debut===

As a teenager, Nas enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willy "Ill Will" Graham as his DJ. Nas initially went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. In the late 1980s, he met up with the producer Large Professor and went to the studio where Rakim and Kool G Rap were recording their albums. When they were not in the studio, Nas would go into the booth and record his own material. However, none of it was released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realraptalk.com/f16/nas-fans-good-long-read-nas-biography-67275/ |title=Nas Fans- Good long read.

In mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year. Nas made his solo debut under the name of "Nasty Nas" on the single "Halftime" from Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. Called the new Rakim,[tpl]cite web|title=The Greatest MCs of All Time – 5.

In 1994, Nas's debut album, Illmatic, was finally released. It was awarded Five Mics from The Source.[tpl]harvnb|Hess|2007|p=345[/tpl] It also featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S. and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas's friend AZ and his father Olu Dara. The album spawned several singles, including "The World Is Yours", "It Ain't Hard to Tell", and "One Love". Shaheem Reid of MTV News called Illmatic "the first classic LP" of 1994.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/1994/news_feature_010504/|title=The Year Hip-Hop Was Reborn: A Look Back at 1994|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=January 5, 2004|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=March 6, 2009[/tpl] In 1994, Nas also recorded the song "One on One" for the soundtrack to the film Street Fighter.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r210651|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Street Fighter > Overview|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=March 6, 2009[/tpl] In his book To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic, William Jelani Cobb writes of Nas's impact at the time:
Steve Huey of Allmusic described Nas' lyrics on Illmatic as "highly literate" and his raps "superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary", adding that Nas is "able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times".[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r203123|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Illmatic: Overview|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=January 17, 2010[/tpl] Reviewing Nas's second album It Was Written, Leo Stanley of allmusic believed the rhymes to be not as complex as those in Illmatic but still "not only flow, but manage to tell coherent stories as well".[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r237850|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=It Was Written: Overview|last=Stanley|first=Leo|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=January 17, 2010[/tpl] About.com ranked Illmatic as the greatest hip hop album of all time,[tpl]cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top100RapAlbums_10.htm|title=100 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums|last=Adaso|first=Henry|publisher=About.com|accessdate=January 17, 2010[/tpl] and Prefix magazine praised it as "the best hip-hop record ever made".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/nas/a-look-at-a-hip-hop-masterpiece-ten-years-removed/12483/|title=A look at a hip-hop masterpiece, ten years removed|date=January 1, 2001|work=Prefix|accessdate=January 17, 2010[/tpl]

===1995–97: Mainstream direction and The Firm===

Columbia Records began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics, such as that of The Notorious B.I.G., who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal. In 1995, Nas did guest performances on the albums Doe or Die by AZ, The Infamous by Mobb Deep, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx by Raekwon and 4,5,6 by Kool G Rap. Nas also parted ways with manager MC Serch, enlisted Steve Stoute, and began preparation for his second LP, It Was Written, consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound. It Was Written, chiefly produced by Tone and Poke of Trackmasters, was released during the summer of 1996. Two singles, "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)" (featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and "Street Dreams", including a remix with R. Kelly were instant hits. These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop. It Was Written featured the debut of The Firm, a super group consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega. The album also expanded on Nas's Escobar persona, who lived more of a Scarface/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, Illmatic, which, while having numerous references to Scarface protagonist Tony Montana, was more about his life growing up in the projects.
Signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label, The Firm began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album, Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega subsequently became one of Nas's most vocal opponents and released a number of underground hip hop singles "dissing" Nas, Stoute, and Nature, who replaced Cormega as the fourth member of The Firm.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=TheRecording Album With Damian Marley|last=Concepcion|first=Mariel|date=February 10, 2009|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=February 10, 2009[/tpl] Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews. The album failed to live up to its expected sales, despite being certified platinum, and the members of the group disbanded to go their separate ways.
During this period, Nas was one of four rappers (the others being B-Real, KRS-One and RBX) in the hip hop super-group Group Therapy, who appeared on the song "East Coast/West Coast Killas" from Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath.[tpl]cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath > Overview|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r243986|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=September 13, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=East Coast/West Coast Killas|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t3084200|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=September 13, 2008[/tpl]

===1997–2000: Inconsistent output===

In late 1997, Nas began work on a double album, to be entitled I Am... The Autobiography; he intended it as the middle ground between Illmatic and It Was Written, with each track detailing a part of his life. In 1998, Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams's 1998 feature film Belly. I Am... The Autobiography was completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, "Nas Is Like". It was produced by DJ Premier and contained vocal samples from "It Ain't Hard to Tell". Music critic M.F. DiBella noticed that Nas also covered "politics, the state of hip-hop, Y2K, race, and religion with his own unique perspective" in the album besides autobiographical lyrics.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r400739|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=I Am...The Autobiography > Overview|last=DiBella|first=M.F.|date=April 6, 1999|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=March 6, 2009[/tpl] Much of the LP was leaked into MP3 format onto the Internet and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.[tpl]harvnb|Hess|2007|p=347[/tpl]
The second single on I Am... was "Hate Me Now", featuring Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, which was used as an example by Nas's critics of him moving towards commercial themes. The video featured Nas and Combs being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus; after the video was completed, Combs requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the "Hate Me Now" video made its way to MTV. Within minutes of the broadcast, Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute's office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June. Columbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am... under the title Nastradamus during the later half of 1999, but, at the last minute, Nas decided to record an entire new album for the 1999 release of Nastradamus. Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critics were not kind to the album, it did result in a minor hit, "You Owe Me".
In 2000, Nas & Ill Will Records Presents QB's Finest, which is popularly known as simply QB's Finest, was released on Nas's Ill Will Records. QB's Finest is a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge projects, including Mobb Deep, Nature, Capone, the Bravehearts, Tragedy Khadafi, Millennium Thug and Cormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shanté, MC Shan, and Marley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single "Da Bridge 2001," which was based on Shan & Marl's 1986 recording "The Bridge."[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r507398|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=QB Finest > Overview|last=Conaway|first=Matt|date=November 21, 2000|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=March 6, 2009[/tpl] Fans and critics feared that Nas' career was declining, artistically and commercially, as both I Am... and Nastradamus were criticized as inconsistent.Cowie, Del.

===2001–03: Feud with Jay-Z and artistic comeback===

After trading subliminal criticisms on various songs, freestyles and mixtape appearances, the highly publicized feud between Nas and Jay-Z became widely known to the public in 2001. Jay-Z, in his song "Takeover", criticized Nas by calling him "fake" and his career "lame".[tpl]cite news|last=Century|first=Douglas|title=Two of Rap's Hottest Return to the Dis |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7D91E30F935A35752C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2002|accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl] Nas responded with "Ether", in which he compared Jay-Z to such characters as J.J.

The song was included on Nas's fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December 2001.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Nas Disses Jay-Z, Endless List of Others on New LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451188/20011126/jay_z.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=November 26, 2001|accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl] Stillmatic peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and featured the singles "Got Ur Self A..." and "One Mic".
In response to "Ether", Jay-Z released the song "Supa Ugly", which Hot 97 radio host Angie Martinez premiered on December 11, 2001. In the song, Jay-Z explicitly boasts about having an affair with Nas's girlfriend, Carmen Bryan.Ashare, Matt. Nas On His Battle With Jay-Z And Its Effects. Yahoo! Music: January 26, 2002.

In December 2002, Nas released the God's Son album including its lead single, "Made You Look" which utilized a pitched down sample of the Incredible Bongo Band's "Apache". The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts despite widespread internet bootlegging.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p44732|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=((( Nas > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=September 14, 1973 |accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl] Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe gave it four stars and The Source gave it four mics. The second single, "I Can", which reworked elements from Beethoven's "Für Elise", became Nas's biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God's Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas's mother, who died of cancer in April 2002, including "Dance". In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song "Play Me", from Korn's Take a Look in the Mirror LP. Also in 2003, a live performance in New York City, featuring Ludacris, Jadakiss, and Darryl McDaniels (of Run-D.M.C. fame), was released on DVD as Made You Look: God's Son Live.
God's Son was critical in the power struggle between Nas and Jay-Z in hip hop at the time. In an article at the time, Joseph Jones of PopMatters stated, "Whether you like it or not, 'Ether' did this. With God's Son, Nas has the opportunity to cement his status as the King of N.Y., at least for another 3–4-year term, or he could prove that he is not the savior that hip-hop fans should be pinning their hopes on."Jones, Joseph. Review: God's Son. PopMatters. Retrieved on 2009-10-28. After the album's release, he began helping The Bravehearts, made up of his younger brother Jungle and friend Wiz (Wizard), put together their debut album, Bravehearted. The album features guest appearances from Nas, Nashawn (Millennium Thug), Lil Jon, and Jully Black.

===2004–06: Double album and Def Jam===

Nas released his seventh studio album Street's Disciple, a sprawling double album, on November 30, 2004. It addressed subject matter both political and personal, including his impending marriage to recording artist Kelis. The double-sided single "Thief's Theme"/"You Know My Style" was released months before the album's release, followed by the single "Bridging the Gap" upon the album's release. Although Street's Disciple went platinum, it served as a dropoff from Nas' previous commercial successes.
In 2005, New York-based rapper 50 Cent dissed Nas on the song "Piggy Bank", which brought his reputation into question in hip hop circles. In October, Nas made a surprise appearance at Jay-Z's highly publicized I Declare War concert, where they reconciled their beef. At the show, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, "It's bigger than 'I Declare War'. Let's go, Esco!". Nas then joined him onstage,Sanneh, Kelefah. A Show of Solidarity, With a Few Surprises.

The reconciliation created the opportunity for Nas to sign a deal with Def Jam Recordings, of which Jay-Z was president at the time. He signed Nas in January 2006.

====Bill O'Reilly/Virginia Tech controversy====

On September 6, 2007, Nas performed at a free concert for the Virginia Tech student body and faculty, following the school shooting there. He was joined by John Mayer, Alan Jackson, Phil Vassar, and Dave Matthews Band.A Concert For Virginia Tech. The Virginia Tech massacre; the bloodiest school massacre in U.S. history, had taken place earlier that year, on April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho, killed 32 and wounded more, before committing suicide. Vt.edu. Retrieved August 1, 2007. When announced that Nas was to perform, political commentator Bill O'Reilly and Fox News Channel denounced the concert and called for Nas' removal, citing "violent" lyrics on songs such as "Shoot 'Em Up", "Got Urself a Gun", and "Made You Look". During his Talking Points Memo segment for August 15, 2007, an argument erupted in which O'Reilly claimed that it was not only Nas's lyrical content that made him inappropriate for the event, citing the gun conviction on Nas's criminal record. In the midst of his debate with author Bakari Kitwana (The Hip Hop Generation), who defended Nas, claiming that Fox News had "cherry picked" select fragments of the songs to make their case, O'Reilly shouted, "Even in his personal life, man, he's got a conviction for weapons, all right? He's got a weapons conviction, sir! On his sheet! This is a school that had a mass murderer with a shotgun gunning down people—this guy has got a conviction for weapons, and you say he's appropriate? Come on!" O'Reilly repeated the claim another five times before cutting the segment short.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
On September 6, 2007, during his set at "A Concert for Virginia Tech," Nas twice referred to Bill O'Reilly as "a chump," prompting loud cheers by members of the crowd. About two weeks later, Nas was interviewed by Shaheem Reid of MTV News, where he criticized O'Reilly, calling him uncivilized and willing to go to extremes for publicity.Reid, Shaheem; Rodriguez, Jayson; Dukes, Rahman; Kash, Tim.

On July 23, 2008, Nas appeared on The Colbert Report to discuss his opinion of O'Reilly and Fox News, which he accused of bias against the African-American community and re-challenged O'Reilly to a debate. During the appearance, Nas sat on boxes of more than 625,000 signatures gathered by online advocacy organization Color of Change in support of a petition accusing Fox of race-baiting and fear-mongering.[tpl]cite episode|title=Episode #04093|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/176358/july-23-2008/nas-pt--1|series=The Colbert Report|serieslink=The Colbert Report|network=Comedy Central|airdate=July 23, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===2009–present: Collaboration and Life Is Good===

At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas confirmed he was collaborating on an album with reggae musician Damian Marley which was expected to be released in Fall 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect".[tpl]cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=136&csid2=946&fid1=40691 |title=Exclaim!

==Artistry==

Nas has been praised for his ability to create a "devastating match between lyrics and production" by journalist Peter Shapiro, as well as creating a "potent evocation of life on the street", and he has even been compared to Rakim for his lyrical technique. In his book Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop (2009), writer Adam Bradley states, "Nas is perhaps contemporary rap's greatest innovator in storytelling. His catalog includes songs narrated before birth ('Fetus') and after death ('Amongst Kings'), biographies ('UBR Biography of Rakim') and autobiographies ('Doo Rags'), allegorical tales ('Money Is My Bitch') and epistolary ones ('One Love'), he's rapped in the voice of a woman ('Sekou Story') and even of a gun ('I Gave You Power')."[tpl]harvnb|Bradley|2009|p=173[/tpl] Robert Christgau writes that "Nas has been transfiguring gangsta rap since Illmatic".[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=August 2008|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg2008-08.php|title=Consumer Guide|publisher=MSN Music|accessdate=March 3, 2013[/tpl] Kool Moe Dee notes that Nas has an "off-beat conversational flow" in his book There's a God on the Mic – he says: "before Nas, every MC focused on rhyming with a cadence that ultimately put the words that rhymed on beat with the snare drum. Nas created a style of rapping that was more conversational than ever before".[tpl]harvnb|Dee|2003|p=248[/tpl]
O.C. of D.I.T.C. comments in the book How to Rap: "Nas did the song backwards 'Rewind'... that was a brilliant idea".[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=30[/tpl] Also in How to Rap, 2Mex of The Visionaries describes Nas's flow as "effervescent",[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=73[/tpl] Rah Digga says Nas's lyrics have "intricacy",[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=81[/tpl] Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde explains that Nas does not always have to make words rhyme as he is "charismatic",[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=94[/tpl] and Nas is also described as having a "densely packed"[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|pp=74–75[/tpl] flow, with compound rhymes that "run over from one beat into the next or even into another bar".[tpl]harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=108[/tpl]
