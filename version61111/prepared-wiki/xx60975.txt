The Love of The Last Tycoon is an unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, compiled and published posthumously.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/24/specials/fitzgerald-tycoon.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=Scott Fitzgerald's Last Novel|date=1941-11-09|accessdate=2012-03-12|author=J. Donald Adams[/tpl]

==Publication history==

The novel was unfinished and in rough form at the time of Fitzgerald's death at age 44. The notes for the novel were initially collected and edited by the literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was a close friend of Fitzgerald, and the unfinished novel was published in 1941 as The Last Tycoon, though there is now critical agreement that Fitzgerald intended The Love of the Last Tycoon to be the book's title. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] It was not until the 1993 publication, as part of the Cambridge edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, that the work first appeared as The Love of the Last Tycoon. The extant seventeen chapters of the thirty-one planned chapters were reassembled in 1993 by Bruccoli according to the author's notes.

==Plot summary==

According to Publishers Weekly's 1993 review of the edition reconstructed by Fitzgerald scholar Matthew J. Bruccoli, The Love of the Last Tycoon is "generally considered a roman a clef", inspired by the life of film producer Irving Thalberg, on whom protagonist Monroe Stahr is based. The story follows Stahr's rise to power in Hollywood, and his conflicts with rival Pat Brady, a character based on studio head Louis B. Mayer.

==Main characters==

==Point of view==

Fitzgerald wrote the novel in a blend of first person and third-person omniscient narrative. While the story is ostensibly told by Cecelia, many scenes are narrated in which she is not present. Occasionally a scene will be presented twice, once through Cecelia and once through a third party.

==Awards==

The revised edition of The Love of The Last Tycoon won the Choice Outstanding Academic Books award of 1995.

==Adaptations==

In 1957 John Frankenheimer directed a TV version for Playhouse 90, with Jack Palance as Monroe Stahr.
A 1976 film version was adapted for the screen by Nobel Prize winning playwright Harold Pinter, directed by Elia Kazan (his last film), produced by Sam Spiegel, and released as The Last Tycoon.  It starred Robert De Niro as Monroe Stahr and Theresa Russell as Cecelia Brady, and featured appearances by Robert Mitchum and Jack Nicholson.
A stage adaptation, authorized by the Fitzgerald Estate, by Simon Levy opened at The Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles in 1998  to rave reviews and was the recipient of numerous awards.http://www.fountaintheatre.com/admin/html
