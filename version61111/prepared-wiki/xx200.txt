Thirteen males, seven of whom were teenagers, died immediately or soon after, while the death of another man four-and-a-half months later was attributed to the injuries he received on that day. Two protesters were also injured when they were run down by army vehicles.'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30 January 1972 – Names of the Dead and Injured CAIN Web Service, 23 March 2006.

The incident occurred during a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march; the soldiers involved were members of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment (1 Para).
Two investigations have been held by the British government. The Widgery Tribunal, held in the immediate aftermath of the event, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame—Widgery described the soldiers' shooting as "bordering on the reckless"—but was widely criticised as a "whitewash".[tpl]cite web | title = More 'butcher' than 'grocer' | author = David Granville | url = http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/features/more-butcher-than-grocer/ | publisher = The Morning Star | date = 28 July 2005 | accessdate =18 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Schooled in scandal | author = Nick Cohen | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/kelly/comment/0,,1136486,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 1 February 2004 | accessdate =18 May 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 19 April 1972| accessdate =18 May 2007[/tpl] The Saville Inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the events.

Provisional IRA activity also increased across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being killed in the remaining months of 1971, in contrast to the ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year. Both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA had established "no-go" areas for the British Army and RUC in Derry through the use of barricades.Brits, p. 82. By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as Free Derry, 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as "aggro corner". Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by incendiary devices, an estimated total of [tpl]Nowrap|£4 million[/tpl] worth of damage had been done to local businesses.
In January 1972 NICRA intended, despite the ban, to organise a march in Derry to protest against internment. The authorities who knew of the proposed march decided to allow it to proceed in the Catholic areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching Guildhall Square, as planned by the organisers. Major General Robert Ford, then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters during the march.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002 |title = Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |year=2010 |volume = 2.15–2.16 |accessdate=22 April 2011[/tpl] 1 PARA arrived in Derry on the morning of Sunday 30 January 1972 and took up positions in the city.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |title = Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |year=2010 |volume = 3.1 |accessdate=22 April 2011[/tpl]

==Narrative of events==

The people planned on marching to the Guildhall, but because of army barricades designed to reroute the march, the protesters redirected it to Free Derry Corner. A group of teenagers broke off from the march and persisted in pushing the barricade and marching on the Guildhall. They attacked the British army barricade with stones. At this point, a water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets were used to disperse the rioters. Such confrontations between soldiers and youths were common, and observers reported that the rioting was not intense.[tpl]cite book | author=Peter Pringle & Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8[/tpl] P. 100: "…the level of rioting was no greater than usual – and no petrol bombs or nail bombs were being thrown." Two civilians, Damien Donaghy and John Johnston, were shot and wounded  on William Street by soldiers, who claimed that the former was carrying a black cylindrical object.[tpl]cite book | author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8[/tpl]P 116: "Seconds after the corporal fired, he would say that he spotted the same man with a black cylindrical object in one hand strike what appeared to be a match against the wall. Johnston was standing a few feet from Donaghy. One of the bullets sliced through his right thigh."
At a certain point, reports of an IRA sniper operating in the area were allegedly given to the Army command centre. At [tpl]Nowrap|4:07 pm[/tpl] Brigade gave the British Parachute Regiment permission to go into the Bogside. The order to fire live rounds was given,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] and one young man was shot and killed when he ran down Chamberlain Street away from the advancing troops. This first fatality, Jackie Duddy, was among a crowd who were running away. He was running alongside a priest, Father Edward Daly, when he was shot in the back.[tpl]cite web | title = 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30 January 1972 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/circum.htm | publisher = CAIN | accessdate =16 May 2007[/tpl]  Eventually the order was given to mobilise the troops in an arrest operation, chasing the tail of the main group of marchers to the edge of the field by Free Derry Corner.
Despite a cease-fire order from the army HQ, over 100 rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds by troops under the command of Major Ted Loden. Twelve more were killed,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/bs.htm |title=CAIN: Events: Bloody Sunday: Menu Page |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |accessdate=17 June 2010[/tpl] many of them as they attempted to aid the fallen. Fourteen others were wounded, 12 by shots from the soldiers and two knocked down by armoured personnel carriers.

==Perspectives and analyses on the day==

Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds. The official army position, backed by the British Home Secretary the next day in the House of Commons, was that the paratroopers had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members. All eyewitnesses (apart from the soldiers), including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present, maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims.
In the events that followed, irate crowds burned down the British embassy on Merrion Square in Dublin.1972: British embassy in Dublin destroyed BBC News Online. Retrieved 1 February 2009.

Although there were many IRA men—both Official and Provisional—present at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to "draw them out".[tpl]cite news |title=Rumours of plan to clear Bogside are 'nonsense' |author=David Sharrock |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20020627205642/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archivedate= 27 June 2002 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=16 June 2010[/tpl] March organiser and MP Ivan Cooper had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march. One paratrooper who gave evidence at the Tribunal testified that they were told by an officer to expect a gunfight and "We want some kills".The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence, p. 65. In the event, one man was witnessed by Father Edward Daly and others haphazardly firing a revolver in the direction of the paratroopers. Later identified as a member of the Official IRA, this man was also photographed in the act of drawing his weapon, but was apparently not seen or targeted by the soldiers. Various other claims have been made to the Saville Inquiry about gunmen on the day.[tpl]cite web |title = Bloody Sunday Inquiry Transcript – Day 008 |url = http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm |date = 6 April 2000 |accessdate =17 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928040549/http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm  |archivedate = 28 September 2007[/tpl]
The city's coroner, retired British Army Major Hubert O'Neill, issued a statement on 21 August 1973, at the completion of the inquest into the people killed.'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events CAIN Web Service, 23 March 2006. Retrieved 27 August 2006. He declared:
Two days after Bloody Sunday, the Westminster Parliament adopted a resolution for a tribunal into the events of the day, resulting in Prime Minister Edward Heath commissioning the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to boycott the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly produced report—completed within ten weeks (10 April) and published within eleven (19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most Irish people and witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based solder. In fact, in 1992, John Major, writing to John Hume stated:
[tpl]cquote|The Government made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.

Following the events of Bloody Sunday Bernadette Devlin, an Independent Socialist nationalist MP from Northern Ireland, expressed anger at what she perceived as government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the day. Having witnessed the events firsthand, she was later infuriated that she was consistently denied the chance to speak in Parliament about the day, although parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in the House.[tpl]cite news |title = Daughters of Ireland |author = Ros Wynne-Jones |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970309/ai_n14092582/pg_2 |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 9 March 1997 |accessdate =2 June 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

In January 1997, the United Kingdom television station Channel 4 carried a news report that suggested that members of the Royal Anglian Regiment had also opened fire on the protesters and could have been responsible for three of the fourteen deaths.
On 29 May 2007 it was reported that General Sir Mike Jackson, Captain Mike Jackson second-in-command of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: "I have no doubt that innocent people were shot".[ref]
