==Early life and career==

Theroux is the youngest son of the American travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux (who is of French-Canadian and Italian descent).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-louis-theroux-616093.html|title=You ask the questions: Louis Theroux|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2001|accessdate=1 June 2010[/tpl] His elder brother is the writer and television presenter Marcel Theroux. He is the cousin of American actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux. Born in Singapore, he moved to the UK when he was one and was brought up in London thereafter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.bbcamerica.com/program.jsp?id=16134|title=Meet Louis Theroux|publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl] Archived here.
Theroux was educated for a couple of years at Allfarthing Primary School then moved to Westminster School (where he was a friend and contemporary of the comedians Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish). Another of his contemporaries was Liberal Democrat politician and current Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, with whom he travelled to America.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7046587.stm|title=The Nick Clegg story |date=19 December 2007|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl] He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in history and was noted for his film reviews for the Grapevine magazine.
His first employment as a journalist was with Metro Silicon Valley, an alternative free weekly newspaper in San Jose, California. In 1992, he was hired as a writer for Spy magazine. He was also working as a correspondent on Michael Moore's TV Nation series, for which he provided segments on off-beat cultural subjects, including selling Avon to women in the Amazon, the Jerusalem syndrome and the attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to rebrand itself as a civil rights group for white people. When TV Nation ended he was signed to a development deal by the BBC, out of which came Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends. He has guest-written for a number of publications including Hip-Hop Connection and he continues to write for The Idler.

==Documentaries==

===Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends===

In Weird Weekends (1998–2000), Theroux followed marginal, mostly American subcultures like survivalists, black nationalists, white supremacists and porn stars, often by living among or close to the people involved. Often, his documentary method subtly exposed the contradictions or farcical elements of some seriously held beliefs. Theroux himself describes the aim of the series as: "Setting out to discover the genuinely odd in the most ordinary setting. To me, it's almost a privilege to be welcomed into these communities and to shine a light on them and, maybe, through my enthusiasm, to get people to reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them. I don't have to play up that stuff. I'm not a matinee idol disguised as a nerd." Despite calls for a complete DVD set of the Weird Weekends series, only selected episodes have ever been available for purchase.

===When Louis Met...===

In When Louis Met... (2000–02), Theroux accompanied a different British celebrity in each programme as they go about their day-to-day business, interviewing them about their lives and experiences as he did so. His episode about British entertainer Jimmy Savile, When Louis Met Jimmy, was voted one of the top fifty documentaries of all time in a survey by Britain's Channel 4. In When Louis Met the Hamiltons, the disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine were arrested following false allegations of indecent assault during the course of filming.
In When Louis Met Max Clifford, Max Clifford tried to set Louis up. However, it backfired when Clifford was caught lying, as the crew was still recording his live microphone during a conversation. After this series concluded, a retrospective was aired called Life with Louis. He was meant to do a similar programme with Michael Jackson before Martin Bashir completed his documentary for ITV, but it was cancelled.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] Theroux went on to make a documentary called Louis, Martin & Michael about his quest to get an interview with Michael Jackson. Selected episodes of When Louis Met... were included as bonus content on a Best-Of collection of Weird Weekends.  The entire series has never been released on DVD.

===BBC Two specials===

In these special programmes, beginning in 2003, Theroux returned to American themes, working at feature-length, this time with a more natural tone. In March 2006, he signed a new deal with the BBC to make 10 films over the course of three years.Theroux promises to raise stakes By Kevin Young, 20 April 2006, BBC Subjects for the specials include criminal gangs in Lagos, Neo-Nazis in America, ultra-Zionists in Israel, child psychiatry and the prison system in California and Florida. A 2007 special, The Most Hated Family in America, received strong critical praise from the international media.
A new three part series based in Los Angeles was announced by the BBC in February 2014. The first part, In the City of Dogs, was aired on the 23rd March.http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/12/louis-theroux-la-stories-city-of-dogs.html The three programmes covered three wildly disparate aspects of life in Los Angeles.
