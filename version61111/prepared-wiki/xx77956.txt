The District of Has ([tpl]lang-sq|Rrethi i Hasit[/tpl]) is one of the thirty-six districts of Albania and one of the smallest. It has a population of 17,419[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/graphics/doc/tabelat/Treguesit%20Sociale/Popullsia/POP%202009/t2.xls|title=POPULLSIA SIPAS RRETHEVE, 2001-2010|publisher=Albanian Institute of Statistics|accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl] (2010 estimate), and an area of [tpl]convert|393|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is in the north-east of the country, part of Kukës County, and its capital and only municipality is Krumë.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/graphics/doc/downloads/publikime/Tregues%20sipas%20qarqeve2006.pdf|title=Administrative Divisions of Albania|year=2007|publisher=INSTAT|accessdate=12 January 2011[/tpl] The district consists of the following communes:
Has District, besides the town of Krumë, comprises a number of villages which are well known for their help in 1999 in the Kosovo War[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] against the Serbian Army, for the unprecedented hospitality given to the thousands of refugees from Kosovo (there were about 78,000 refugees staying in the homes of Has inhabitants,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] or more than threefold the population of the Has District at that time). Hasi is located in the border of Albania and Kosovo[tpl]ref label|status|a|[/tpl]. The ethnographic region of Has is much wider than the District of Has, because about half of this region is located in the territory of Kosovo,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] from the Albania-Kosovo border to the gates of the cities of Prizren and Gjakova.Hasi was the trade center of north Albania.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Year-by-year the population of Has has been falling dramatically. European studies show[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] that the decline in the Has population is falling due to the lack of economy so there is a huge number of people from this area migrating to countries like the United Kingdom and the United States but mostly to Tirana, the capital of Albania.
