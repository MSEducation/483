[[Onward (song)]]

CATEGORIES: Yes (band) songs, 1978 songs, Songs written by Chris Squire

"Onward" is a song performed by the British band Yes. It is the seventh track on their ninth studio album, Tormato. The writing credit goes to bassist Chris Squire, and it is the only song on the album for which singer Jon Anderson gets no writing credit.
It was covered by Mark Kozelek on his 2013 covers album Like Rats.

==On the album==

The song is vastly different in style than the rest of the album, being heavily padded by an orchestra and containing much lower-pitch instrumentation from the band members. The lyrics are also atypical of most progressive rock music; it is a very direct love song from Chris Squire to his then wife, Nikki Squire. The orchestral arrangement was by Andrew Pryce Jackman, who also worked on "Madrigal" on the same album. Jackman had recently worked with Squire on his Fish Out of Water solo album and had been in The Syn with Squire many years before.

==In the live setting==

The song was performed live on the album Keys to Ascension. The live version contained an introduction written and performed by guitarist Steve Howe. It was performed again, apparently on Beno√Æt David's request, when the Canadian singer joined and toured with Yes in 2008.Forgotten Yesterdays Yes tour log, retrieved December 28, 2006
