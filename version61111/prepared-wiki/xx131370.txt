Rabbit Software was an English company which produced home computer games for machines such as the Commodore VIC-20, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64 in the early to mid-1980s. Rabbit's later software packaging was slightly different from that of the other software houses of the time, as the cassettes were encased within an outer red box which made them more distinctive on the shop shelves.
Rabbit went into liquidation around the same time Imagine had problems. Eventually, Rabbit was acquired by Virgin Interactive.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=PersonalComputerGames/Issue11/Pages/PersonalComputerGames1100014.jpg |title= Rabbit Software (Out of the Hat Article World of Spectrum)| accessdate=2008-09-01[/tpl]
