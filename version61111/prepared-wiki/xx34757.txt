==History==

The Cahaba River falls near Centreville, which made the town a strategic location for transportation through the region. The first post office in Bibb County was established in Centreville in 1821. Sarah Willis Chotard obtained a patent for land in this area in 1823 and began moving squatters off the land and laid out a plot for the new town of Centreville.[tpl]Cite book | last = Ellison | first = Rhonda C. | title = Bibb County, Alabama: The First Hundred Years | publisher = University of Alabama Press | year = 1999| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JIAwwhPbpeYC&dq=centreville+alabama| isbn =0-8173-0987-X [/tpl]
In 1829, Centreville became the permanent seat for Bibb County after several years of debate and different locations of the county courthouse, and the town was incorporated in 1832. Centreville's historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]NRISref|2009a[/tpl]

===1910 lynching===

In 1910, a white woman by the name of Mrs. Crow gave birth to a child of "doubtful color", who was thought by many to be the product of a relationship between Crow and an African American, and she was accused of having such a relationship. At first she vigorously denied it, but then – under intense peer pressure – she confessed to the baby's origin but claimed that she had been raped. When asked if she knew who raped her, Crow gave them the name of Grant Richardson, an African American who lived near the Braehead Slope Mine Camp, northeast of Centreville.
The miners and other local residents were so incensed at the affair that they decided to apply "summary vengeance" to Richardson as soon as they knew that the sheriff had apprehended him.
Deputy Sheriff Cam Riley apprehended Richardson on October 12, 1910, and was returning him to the jail at Centreville for processing and trial, but was waylaid by a lynch mob. The mob took Richardson from Riley and shot the suspect.
Chief Deputy Sheriff Charles Oakley investigated the scene as soon as word of the incident reached him, but other than the body, the shells, and the blood, there was little usable evidence to be found, much less witnesses. A coroner's inquest was held as soon as a special coroner was appointed, but there is no known result of that inquest. This was the first recorded lynching to take place in Bibb County.
It is unknown whether charges of either filing false charges resulting in a murder or miscegenation were filed against Crow, but it is known by those aware of Richardson that he had lived in the area for a number of years with a fair reputation prior to the incident.[tpl]Cite news| title=Angry Miners Lynch Negro| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0km_frJZALIC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=Angry+Miners+Lynch+Negro#v=onepage&q=Angry%20Miners%20Lynch%20Negro&f=false| newspaper=Montgomery Advertiser | date = October 13, 1910|accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title=Lynch Negro for Assaulting Woman| newspaper=The New York Times| date=October 13, 1910| url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A05E5DA1F39E333A25750C1A9669D946196D6CF| accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl]
