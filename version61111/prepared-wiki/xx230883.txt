==Employment==

Unlike many other overseas Filipino communities, Filipinos in Indonesia consist largely of skilled professionals, especially in the advertising industries and as teachers in international schools where their English skills are most needed. 20% also work in finance, especially as accountants.

==Inter-ethnic relations==

Filipinos in Indonesia generally maintain good interethnic relations with their Indonesian neighbours, with whom they feel culturally closer than Europeans or Americans; Indonesians stereotype Filipinos as being gregarious and cheerful.[tpl]citation|title=Good Neighbors|periodical=The Jakarta Post|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/28/good-neighbors.html|date=2008-03-28|accessdate=2008-10-07|last=Supit|first=Harumi[/tpl] However, there are fears that Filipinos in Indonesia may become the targets of kidnappings by local militant groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah in an attempt to secure the release of JI members imprisoned in Philippine jails.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25976963_ITM|periodical=Financial Times; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|last=Jacinto|first=Al|title=Filipinos in Indonesia at risk of being abducted|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=2002-08-09[/tpl]

==Community==

Filipinos in Indonesia have formed eight different community associations, including three sports teams, one teachers' association, and two Christian groups. The annual Philippine Independence Day celebrations attract numerous participants, unlike many other functions held by other foreign embassies.[tpl]citation|periodical=The Jakarta Post|title=Fiesta of Filipino food at the Shangri-La|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/06/11/fiesta-filipino-food-shangrila.html|date=2006-06-11|accessdate=2008-10-07|last=Endah Hulupi|first=Maria[/tpl]
