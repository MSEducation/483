ABC@Home is an educational and non-profit network computing project finding abc-triples related to the abc conjecture in number theory. 
Using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed computing platform. [tpl]As of|2011|03[/tpl], there are more than 7,300 active participants from 114 countries with a total BOINC credit of more than 2.9 billion, reporting about 10 teraflops (10 trillion operations per second) of processing power.[tpl]citation |url=http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=abc_main |title=Detailed user, host, team and country statistics with graphs for BOINC |accessdate=2011-03-11 |format= |work=boincstats.com [/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2014|04|30[/tpl] the Data Collected page for the project lists 23.8 million triples which have been found.[tpl]cite web |url=http://abcathome.com/data/ |title=Data Collected So Far |publisher=ABC@Home |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
