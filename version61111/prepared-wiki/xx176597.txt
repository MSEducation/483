These will eventually replace the ageing 485 series sets.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jrniigata.co.jp/press/20130626e653.pdf|title= 特急「いなほ」の車両を一新します！|trans_title= New "Inaho" limited express trains|date= 26 June 2013|work= News release|publisher= East Japan Railway Company - Niigata Division|location= Japan|language= Japanese|format= pdf|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 26 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jrniigata.co.jp/press/20130705daiyakaisei0928.pdf|title= ２０１３年９月ダイヤ改正について|trans_title= September 2013 timetable revision details|date= 5 July 2013|work= News release|publisher= East Japan Railway Company - Niigata Division|location= Japan|language= Japanese|format= pdf|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 9 July 2013[/tpl] The E653 series trains are modified with the addition of a Green (first class) car and a new livery evoking images of the sunset, rice plants, and the sea.

==History==

The Inaho was first introduced from 1 October 1969 as a limited express service operating between [tpl]ja-stalink|Ueno[/tpl] in Tokyo and Akita via Niigata.[tpl]cite book | title = [tpl]noitalic|列車名鑑1995[/tpl] |trans_title= Train Name Directory 1995| publisher = Railway Journal| date = August 1995 | location = Japan| page = | isbn = [/tpl] Trains were formed of 7-car KiHa 80 series DMUs, with one service in each direction daily.[tpl]cite book| last = Teramoto | first = Mitsuteru | title = [tpl]noitalic|国鉄・ＪＲ列車名大辞典[/tpl] |trans_title= JNR & JR Train Name Encyclopedia| publisher = Chuoshoin Publishing Co., Ltd. | date = July 2001 | location = Tokyo, Japan | page = 106-107| isbn = 4-88732-093-0[/tpl]
The original schedule was as follows.
From March 1972, train formations were extended to 9 cars to cope with popularity. From October of the same year, the original DMUs were replaced by 485 series EMUs following electrification of the entire route. At the same time, service frequency was increased to two return workings daily, with one service extended to [tpl]Ja-stalink|Aomori[/tpl]. Electrification enabled journey times between Ueno and Akita to be reduced to approximately 7 hours 30 minutes, and increasing popularity resulted in formations being lengthened to 12 cars, with non-reserved seating cars added from October 1978, and a third daily return service added from July 1979. 
The typical 12-car formation was as follows, with car 1 at the Ueno end.[tpl]cite journal| last = Kuribayashi|first = Nobuyuki |title = 全盛期の国鉄特急を撮る ！ その22|trans_title= Photographing JNR limited expresses in their heyday - Part 22| journal = Japan Railfan Magazine | volume = 52| issue = 620| page = p.125| publisher = Koyusha Co., Ltd.| location = Japan | date = December 2012[/tpl]
From 15 November 1982, following the opening of the Jōetsu Shinkansen, two of the return Inaho services were cut, and the third return service remaining between Ueno and Akita via Niitsu was renamed [tpl]Nihongo|Chōkai|鳥海[/tpl]. From this date, Inaho train services were reorganized to run as five return workings daily between Niigata and Akita (with one service extended to/from Aomori) using 9-car 485 series EMUs with no restaurant car facilities.
From March 1985, train formations were reduced to 6-car monoclass sets, although from November 1986, service frequency was increased from five to seven return workings daily.
Green (first class) car accommodation was added to half of one car following privatization of JNR to become JR East.
From the start of the 4 December 2010 timetable revision, services were further truncated to operate between Niigata and Akita, with some trains terminating at Sakata. Former operations between Akita and Aomori were covered instead by extended Tsugaru services.JR Timetable, December 2010 issue, p.100
From 28 September 2013, refurbished E653-1000 series 7-car sets formerly used on Fresh Hitachi services were phased in on Inaho services, initially on just one return working a day.
From the start of the revised timetable on 15 March 2014, a further four return workings daily were operated by refurbished E653-1000 series EMUs, leaving 485 series sets on two return services between Niigata and Sakata.[tpl]cite journal|title = 3月15日ダイヤ改正と各地の話題　|trans_title= 15 March timetable revision and topics from around the regions|journal = Tetsudō Daiya Jōhō Magazine |volume = 43|issue = 361|page = p.15|publisher = Kōtsū Shimbun |location = Japan |language= Japanese|date = May 2014[/tpl]
