George Washington Glick (July 4, 1827 – April 13, 1911) was the ninth Governor of Kansas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kslib.info/legislators/membg2.html |title=Kansas Legislators Past & Present – Gis through Gref, State Library of Kansas |publisher=Kslib.info |accessdate=2010-08-09[/tpl]
George Washington Glick was raised on his father's farm near Greencastle, Ohio.  He enlisted for service in the Mexican–American War, but saw no action. At age 21 he entered the law offices of Buckland and Hayes (later President Rutherford B. Hayes); he was admitted to the bar two years later and established a moderate law practice, earning a reputation as a hard-working lawyer. Glick moved to Atchison, Kansas, in 1859 and formed a partnership with Alfred P. Otis. He served as a Union soldier in the 2nd Kansas Infantry during the Civil War. Elected to the Kansas State Legislature in 1862, he served for 14 of the next 18 years and was Speaker pro tempore in 1876. He served in both houses of the state legislature. Glick was well respected and considered "just and expert" by his colleagues.[tpl]cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://www.politicalgraveyard.com/bio/glenni-glotzbach.html |title=Index to Politicians: Glennda to Glotzbach |publisher=The Political Graveyard |accessdate=2010-08-09[/tpl]
He was elected Governor in 1882 and served until 1885. Legislation enacted during his tenure included the creation of a railroad commission, a "good roads" law, reassessment of tax laws, and the establishment of a livestock sanitary commission. He was later appointed pension agent in Topeka by President Grover Cleveland.
After 15 years of civic service, George Glick was forced to abandon his political career because of a throat infection that nearly destroyed his ability to speak. He continued, however, as an attorney for various railroads. He also managed his farm and served as a charter member and first vice president of the Kansas Historical Society.
Glick died in 1911 in Atchison, Kansas.http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/atchison/GWGlickbio.html

==Statue replacement==

In 1914, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Glick to the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection as one of its two allowed entries.  The statue was sculpted by Charles Niehaus, who sculpted seven other statues for the collection, including Kansas's other entry, Senator John J. Ingalls in 1905.  In 2003, Kansas became the first state to replace a statue when it replaced Glick with a bronze of former president Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Kansas remained the only state to do so until August 31, 2006, when the California State Legislature voted to replace its statue of Thomas Starr King with one of former president Ronald Reagan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/glick.cfm |title=George Washington Glick |publisher=Aoc.gov |date=1911-04-13 |accessdate=2010-08-09[/tpl]
