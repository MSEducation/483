Barrio Bellavista (Bellavista Neighborhood) is an area that lies between the Mapocho River and San Cristóbal Hill in Santiago, Chile. It is known as Santiago's bohemian quarter, with new hip restaurants, boutiques, and avant-garde galleries occupying loft spaces and lordly mansions that punctuate tree-lined streets awash with colorful antique homes. Many of the city's esteemed intellectuals and artists live in Bellavista, following in the footsteps of its most famous denizen, Pablo Neruda. In the evening, Bellavista pulses to the beat of music pouring from its many discos and bars. On weekends, there is an evening handicrafts market that runs the length of Pío Nono. The area is served by the Baquedano Metro subway station, located just across the river.http://www.frommers.com/destinations/santiago/2320026512.html
In addition, it is a popular place to purchase craftwork made from lapis lazuli, a semiprecious stone found principally in Chile and Afghanistan. 
Pablo Neruda's famous house in Santiago, La Chascona, is also in this quarter.
Another attraction is the Santa Filomena Parish also known as the Parroquia de Santa Filomena.
