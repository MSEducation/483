==Social sciences==

Classical social evolution, before Darwin's work on the Origin of Species, some models incorporated the Enlightenment ideas of social progress and thus, according to philosopher of science Michael Ruse, were pseudoscientific by current standards and may have been viewed as such during the 18th century as well as into the start of the 19th century (though the word pseudoscience may not have been used in reference to these early proposals). This pseudoscientific and often political incorporation of social progress with evolutionary thought continued for some one hundred years following the publication the Origin of Species.[tpl]cite book|last=Ruse|first=Michael|title=Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem|year=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=022605182X|pages=239–243|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pc4OAAAAQBAJ|editor=Massimo Pigliucci, Maarten Boudry|chapter=Evolution|quote=For the first one hundred and fifty years evolution was -- and was seen to be -- a pseudoscience.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Pigliucci|first=Massimo|title=Evolution as pseudoscience?|url=http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/04/evolution-as-pseudoscience.html|date=April 2011|quote=Ruse’s somewhat surprising yet intriguing claim is that “before Charles Darwin, evolution was an epiphenomenon of the ideology of social progress, a pseudoscience and seen as such..."[/tpl]

==Religious and spiritual beliefs==

Spiritual and religious practices and beliefs, according to astronomer Carl Sagan, are normally not classified as pseudoscience.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Carl |last=Sagan |url=http://www.godslasteraar.org/assets/ebooks/Sagan_Carl_Does_truth_matter_-_Science_pseudoscience_and_civilization_-_includes_related_articles.pdf |title=Does Truth Matter? Science, Pseudoscience, and Civilization|publisher= Skeptical Inquirer|year=1996|ref=harv[/tpl] However, religion can sometimes nurture pseudoscience, and "at the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid, doctrinaire religion", and some religions might be confused with pseudoscience, such as Traditional Meditation. The following religious/spiritual items have been related to or classified as pseudoscience in some way:

===Creation science===

|quote=When Narconon opened its Chilocco facility in 1991, the Oklahoma Board of Mental Health issued a blistering assessment in denying its application for certification.  "There is no credible evidence establishing the effectiveness of the Narconon program to its patients," the board concluded. It attacked the program as medically unsafe; dismissed the sauna program as unproven; and criticized Narconon for inappropriately taking some patients off prescribed psychiatric medication.}}[/ref] "quackery" and "medical fraud", while academic and medical experts have dismissed Narconon's educational programme as containing "factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling". In turn, Narconon has claimed that mainstream medicine is "biased" against it, and that "people who endorse so-called controlled drug use cannot be trusted to review a program advocating totally drug-free living."  Narconon has said that criticism of its programmes is "bigoted",[ref]
