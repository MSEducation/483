A related value is the quarter rest (or crotchet rest). It denotes a silence of the same duration as a quarter note. It typically  appears as the symbol [[File:crotchet rest alt plain-svg.svg|
x20px]] and occasionally as the older symbol x14px.Examples of the older symbol are found in English music up to the early 20th century, e.g. W. A. Mozart Requiem Mass, vocal score ed. W. T. Best, pub. London: Novello & Co. Ltd. 1879
The note derives from the semiminima of mensural notation. The word crotchet comes from Old French crochet, meaning 'little hook', diminutive of croc, 'hook', because of the hook used on the note in black notation. However, because the hook appeared on the eighth note (or quaver) in the later white notation, the modern French term croche refers to an eighth note. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
It is played for half the length of a minim (or "half note") and twice that of a quaver (an "eighth note"). It is one beat in a bar of 4/4.
The term quarter note is a calque (loan translation) of the German term Viertelnote. The names of this note (and rest) in most languages are calqued from the same source:
The Galician, Catalan, French and Spanish names for the note (all of them meaning "black") derive from the fact that the semiminima was the longest note to be colored in mensural white notation, which is true as well of the modern form.
The Greek, Chinese, Japanese and Korean names mean "quarter" (for the note) and "quarter's pause" (for the rest).
