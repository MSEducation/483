Tōshūsai Sharaku ([tpl]lang-ja|東洲斎 写楽[/tpl]; active 1794–1795) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print artist, known for his portraits of kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers.  Little is known of him besides the prints he designed; neither his true name nor the dates of his birth or death are known.  His active career as a woodblock artist spanned ten months; his prolific work met disapproval, and his output came to an end as suddenly and mysteriously as it had begun.  His work has since been recognized as some of the greatest in the ukiyo-e genre.
Primarily portraits of kabuki actors, Sharaku's compositions emphasize poses of dynamism and energy, and display a realism unusual for prints of the time—conptemporaries such as Utamaro represented their subjects with an idealized beauty, while Sharaku did not shy from showing unflattering details.  This was not to the tastes of the public, and the enigmatic artist's production ceased in the first month of 1795.  His mastery of the medium with no apparent apprenticeship has drawn much speculation, and researchers have long attempted to discover his true identity—some suggesting he was an obscure poet, others a Noh actor, or even the ukiyo-e master Hokusai.

==Works==

Over 140 prints have been established as the work of Sharaku; the majority are portraits of kabuki actors or scenes from kabuki theatre, and the rest are of sumo wrestlers or warriors.[tpl]sfn|Narazaki|1994|p=89[/tpl]  Energy and dynamism are the primary features of Sharaku's portraits, and not idealized beauty[tpl]sfn|Narazaki|1994|p=74[/tpl]—unflattering features such as large noses or the wrinkles of aging actors are prominent.[tpl]sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=165[/tpl]  Certain portraits such as Otani Oniji  III are particularly well known.[tpl]sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=174[/tpl]
In his actor prints Sharaku usually depicted a single figure, and the focus is on the actor's expression.[tpl]sfn|Kondō|1955[/tpl]  To [tpl]ill|ja|Muneshige Narazaki|楢崎宗重[/tpl] Sharaku was able "to depict, within a single print, two or three levels of character revealed in the single moment of action forming the climax to a scene or performance".[tpl]sfn|Narazaki|1994|p=75[/tpl]  Occasionally two figures appear, revealing a contrast of types, as of different facial shapes, or a beautiful face contrasted with one more plain.[tpl]sfn|Kondō|1955[/tpl]
Sharaku shows the skill of a master, despite scant evidence that he had prior experience designing prints.  To Jack Ronald Hillier, there are occasional signs of Sharaku struggling with his medium, compares Sharaku to French painter Paul Cézanne, who he believes "has to struggle to express himself, hampered and angered by the limitations of his draughtsmanship".[tpl]sfn|Hillier|1954|p=23[/tpl]
The prints appeared in the common print sizes aiban, hosoban, and ōban.
