</ref> While this decline continued over the following decades, the language did not die out. By the start of the twenty-first century, numbers had begun to increase again. The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed 21.7% of the population of Wales to be Welsh speakers,<ref name="2004Survey">[tpl]cite web|url=http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20&%20Report%2004.pdf |title=2004 Welsh Language Use Survey: the report|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012[/tpl]</ref> compared with 20.8% in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], and 18.5% in 1991. The [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19% of the population.<ref>

The census also showed a "big drop" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50% in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time.[ref]

The number of Welsh speakers in the rest of Britain has not yet been compiled for statistical purposes. In 1993, the Welsh-language television channel S4C published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh, which estimated that there were around 133,000 Welsh-speakers living in England, about 50,000 of them in the Greater London area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/archives/welsh-l/welsh-l/1993/Mar/More-Welsh-Speakers |title=Nigel Callaghan (1993).

Welsh-speaking communities persisted well on into the modern period across the border with England. Archenfield was still Welsh enough in the time of Elizabeth for the bishop of Hereford to be made responsible, together with the four Welsh bishops, for the translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh. Welsh was still commonly spoken here in the first half of the nineteenth century, and churchwardens’ notices were put up in both Welsh and English until about 1860.Transactions Woolhope Naturalists’ Field Club, 1887, page 173
Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh.Janet Davies, University of Wales Press, Bath (1993). The Welsh Language, page 34 Over the course of the twentieth century this monolingual population "all but disappeared", but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census.[ref][tpl]Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&source=bl&ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gpt9T53DDqiPiAfZu4mbCQ&sqi=2&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&f=false | pages = 38–41 | url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&lpg=PA38&ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
[/ref] Most Welsh speakers in Wales also speak English (while in Chubut Province, Argentina, most speakers can speak Spanish – see Y Wladfa). However, many Welsh speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context, even within a single discourse (known in linguistics as code-switching).
Welsh as a first language is largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales, principally Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire (Sir Ddinbych), Anglesey (Ynys Môn), Carmarthenshire (Sir Gâr), north Pembrokeshire (Sir Benfro), Ceredigion, parts of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), and north-west and extreme south-west Powys, although first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales.

==Official status==

Although Welsh is a minority language, support for it grew during the second half of the 20th century, along with the rise of organisations such as the nationalist political party Plaid Cymru from 1925 and Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society) from 1962.
The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector, as far as is reasonable and practicable. Each public body is required to prepare for approval a Welsh Language Scheme, which indicates its commitment to the equality of treatment principle. This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three-month period, whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version. It requires the final approval of the now defunct Welsh Language Board ([tpl]lang|cy|Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg[/tpl]). Thereafter, the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme. The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales, from 1993–1997, by way of Statutory Instrument. Subsequent to the forming of the National Assembly for Wales in 1997, the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed Statutory Instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes. Neither 1993 Act nor secondary legislation made under it cover the private sector, although some organisations, notably banks and some railway companies, provide some of their literature through the medium of Welsh.

On 7 December 2010, the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales. [tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]'Historic' assembly vote for new Welsh language law, BBC News Online, 7 December 2010 On 9 February 2011, this measure received Royal Approval and was passed, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales.Proposed Welsh Language (Wales) Measure Accessed: 13 February 2011] The Measure:
With the passing of this measure, public bodies and some private companies will be required to provide services in it, though it remains to be seen which companies will have to comply. The Minister for Heritage, Alun Ffred Jones, said, "The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales, whether they speak it or not, and I am delighted that this Measure has now become law. I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language; which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh. I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so, and that is what this government has worked towards. This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language, its speakers and for the nation." The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters; Bethan Williams, chairperson of language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, gave a mixed response to the move, saying, "Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed. But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas. It doesn't give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives. Despite that, an amendment to that effect was supported by 18 Assembly Members from three different parties, and that was a significant step forward."Royal Assent for official status of Welsh language - Wales News - News - WalesOnline Accessed: 13 February 2011]
On 5 October 2011, Meri Huws, Chair of the Welsh Language Board was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner.BBC News - Language board chief Meri Huws is Welsh commissioner (accessed 5 October 2011) In a statement released by her, she said that she was "delighted" to have been appointed to the "hugely important role", adding, "I look forward to working with the Welsh Government and organisations in Wales in developing the new system of standards. I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive." First Minister Carwyn Jones said that Meri will act as a champion for the Welsh language, though some had concerns over her appointment; Plaid Cymru spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said, "I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws's role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner, and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed. We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest, and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role." She started her role as the Welsh Language Commissioner on 1 April 2012.
Local councils and the National Assembly for Wales use Welsh, to varying degrees, issuing their literature and publicity in Welsh versions (e.g. letters to parents from schools, library information, and council information) and most road signs in Wales are in English and Welsh, including the Welsh placenames. However, some references to destinations in England are still given in English only, even where there are long-established Welsh names (e.g. London: Llundain; The English Midlands: Canolbarth Lloegr).
Since 2000, the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16, and that has had a major effect in stabilising and to some extent reversing the decline in the language. It means, for example, that even the children of non-Welsh-speaking parents from elsewhere in the UK grow up with a knowledge of or complete fluency in the language.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Although most road signs throughout Wales are bilingual, the wording on currency is in English only. The one exception is the legend on Welsh pound coins dated 1985, 1990 and 1995 (which are legal tender in all parts of the UK): Pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad, which means "True am I to my country") and derives from the national anthem of Wales, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. The new British coinage from 2008 will not bear any Welsh language at all, despite being designed by a resident of North Wales and being minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales. Although many shops employ bilingual signage, Welsh still rarely appears on product packaging or instructions. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

==Vocabulary==

Welsh vocabulary draws mainly from original Brittonic words ([tpl]lang|cy|wy[/tpl] "egg", [tpl]lang|cy|carreg[/tpl] "stone"), with some loans from Latin ([tpl]lang|cy|ffenestr[/tpl] "window" 
==Orthography==

Welsh is written in a Latin alphabet traditionally consisting of 28 letters, of which eight are digraphs treated as single letters for collation:
In contrast to English practice, "w" and "y" are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u".
The letter "j" is used in many everyday words borrowed from English, like jam, jôc "joke" and garej "garage". The letters "k", "q", "v", "x", and "z" are used in some technical terms, like kilogram, volt and zero, but in all cases can be, and often are, replaced by Welsh letters: cilogram, folt and sero.Thomas, Peter Wynn (1996) Gramadeg y Gymraeg. Cardiff: University of Wales Press: 757. The letter "k" was in common use until the sixteenth century, but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh, as William Salesbury explained: "C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth". This change was not popular at the time.English and Welsh, an essay by J. R. R. Tolkien
The most common diacritic is the circumflex, which disambiguates long vowels, most often in the case of homographs, where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other: e.g. man "place" vs mân "fine", "small".

==Grammar==

===Phonology===

The phonology of Welsh is characterised by a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are typologically rare in European languages, specifically the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative [tpl]IPA|ɬ[/tpl], voiceless nasal stops [tpl]IPA|m̥[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|n̥[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|ŋ̊[/tpl], and voiceless rhotic [tpl]IPA|r̥[/tpl]. Stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words, while the word-final unstressed syllable receives a higher pitch than the stressed syllable.

===Morphology===

Welsh morphology has much in common with that of the other modern Insular Celtic languages, such as the use of initial consonant mutations, and the use of so-called "conjugated prepositions" (prepositions that fuse with the personal pronouns that are their object). Welsh nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case. Welsh has a variety of different endings to indicate the plural, and two endings to indicate the singular of some nouns. In spoken Welsh, verb inflection is indicated primarily by the use of auxiliary verbs, rather than by the inflection of the main verb. In literary Welsh, on the other hand, inflection of the main verb is usual.

===Syntax===

The canonical word order in Welsh is verb–subject–object.
Colloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs. The present tense is constructed with [tpl]lang|cy|bod[/tpl] ("to be") as an auxiliary verb, with the main verb appearing as a verbnoun (loosely equivalent to an infinitive) after the particle yn:
Here mae is the third-person present form of bod, and mynd is the verb meaning "go". The imperfect is constructed in a similar manner, as are the periphrastic forms of the future and conditional tenses.
In the preterite, future, and conditional tenses, there are inflected forms of all verbs (which are invariably used in the written language). However, it is more common nowadays in speech to use the verbnoun together with the inflected form of [tpl]lang|cy|gwneud[/tpl] ("to do"), so "I went" can be [tpl]lang|cy|Mi es i[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|cy|Mi wnes i fynd[/tpl]. Mi is an example of a preverbal particle; such particles are common in Welsh.
Welsh lacks pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses; instead, preverbal particles and special verb forms are used.

===Other features of Welsh grammar===

====Possessives as direct objects of verbnouns====

The Welsh for "I like Rhodri" is [tpl]lang|cy|Dw i'n hoffi Rhodri[/tpl] (word for word, "am I in the liking of Rhodri"), where Rhodri is in a possessive relationship with hoffi. With personal pronouns, the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used, as in "I like him" : [tpl]lang|cy|Dw i'n ei hoffi[/tpl] – literally, "am I in his liking" – "I like you" is [tpl]lang|cy|Dw i'n dy hoffi[/tpl] ("am I in your liking").

====Pronoun doubling====

In colloquial Welsh, possessive pronouns - whether used to mean "my", "your", etc., or to indicate the direct object of a verbnoun - are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbnoun: [tpl]lang|cy|ei dŷ e[/tpl] "his house" (literally "his house of him"), [tpl]lang|cy|Dw i'n dy hoffi di[/tpl] "I like you" ("I am in the action of your liking of you"), etc. It should be noted that this "reinforcement" (or, simply, "redoubling") adds no emphasis in the colloquial register. While the possessive pronoun alone may be used (as is especially common in more formal registers, as shown above), it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun; such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech, mainly among young speakers: [tpl]lang|cy|Ble 'dyn ni'n mynd? Tŷ ti neu dŷ fi?[/tpl] ("Where are we going? Your house or my house?").

==Counting system==

The traditional counting system used by the Welsh language is vigesimal, which is to say it is based on twenties, as in standard French numbers 70 (soixante-dix, literally "sixty-ten") to 99 (quatre-vingt-dix-neuf, literally "four twenties nineteen"). Welsh numbers from 11 to 14 are "x on ten", 16 to 19 are "x on fifteen" (though 18 is deunaw, "two nines"); numbers from 21 to 39 are "1–19 on twenty", 40 is "two twenties", 60 is "three twenties", etc. This form continues to be used, especially by older people, and it is obligatory in certain circumstances (such as telling the time).King, G. Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar, published by Routledge, ISBN 0-415-09269-8 p. 114
There is also a decimal counting system, which has become relatively widely used, though less so in giving the time, ages, and dates (it features no ordinal numbers). This system is in especially common use in schools due to its simplicity, and in Patagonian Welsh. Whereas 39 in the vigesimal system would be [tpl]lang|cy|pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain[/tpl] ("four on fifteen on twenty"), in the decimal system it would be [tpl]lang|cy|tri deg naw[/tpl] ("three tens nine").
While there is only one word for "one" ([tpl]lang|cy|un[/tpl]), it triggers the soft mutation (treiglad meddal) of feminine nouns, other than those beginning with "ll" and "rh". There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers "two" ([tpl]lang|cy|dau[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|cy|dwy[/tpl]), "three" ([tpl]lang|cy|tri[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|cy|tair[/tpl]) and "four" ([tpl]lang|cy|pedwar[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|cy|pedair[/tpl]), which must agree with the grammatical gender of the objects being counted.

==Dialects==

There is no standard or definitive Welsh language. Although Northern (known as [tpl]lang|cy|Gog[/tpl] from the word North, [tpl]lang|cy|gogledd[/tpl]) and Southern (known as [tpl]lang|cy|Hwntw[/tpl] from Hwynthwy which means 'They Themselves' or 'Them') Welsh are the two main versions, additional variations exist between counties. In the 1970s, moves to  standardise the language was tried by  teaching of 'Cymraeg Byw' - a colloquially-based form of Welsh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.madog.org/dysgwyr/adolygiadau/adolygu1.html|title=Teach Yourself Welsh|publisher=Cymdeithas Madog|date=15 March 2000|accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl] But the attempt largely failed because it did encompass the regional differences used by native Welsh speakers.
The differences in dialect are marked in pronunciation and vocabulary but also in minor points of grammar. For example: consider the question "Do you want a cuppa?" In the north this would typically be [tpl]lang|cy|Dach chi isio panad?[/tpl] while in the south it would be more likely [tpl]lang|cy|Ych chi'n moyn dishgled?[/tpl] (though in the South one would not be surprised to hear  [tpl]lang|cy|Ych chi isie paned?[/tpl] among other possibilities). An example of a pronunciation difference between Northern and Southern Welsh is the tendency in southern dialects to palatalise the letter "s", e.g. [tpl]lang|cy|mis[/tpl] (month), would tend to be pronounced [tpl]IPA|miːs[/tpl] in the north, and [tpl]IPA|miːʃ[/tpl] in the south. This normally occurs next to a high front vowel like /i/, although exceptions include the pronunciation of [tpl]lang|cy|sut[/tpl] "how" as [tpl]IPA|ʃʊd[/tpl] in the south (compared with northern [tpl]IPA|sɨt[/tpl]).
Much more fine-grained classifications exist beyond north and south: the book [tpl]lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: cyflwyno'r tafodieithoedd[/tpl] ("Welsh, Welsh, Welsh: introduction to dialects")Thomas, B. and Thomas, P. W. [tpl]lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: cyflwyno'r tafodieithoedd[/tpl], published by Gwasg Taf, ISBN 0-948469-14-5. Out of print about Welsh dialects was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different dialects. The book refers to the earlier Linguistic Geography of WalesThomas, A. R. 1973 Linguistic Geography of Wales as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions.  An alternative traditional classification was of four dialects - Y Wyndodeg, the language of Gwynedd; Y Bowyseg, the language of Powys; Y Ddyfedeg, the language of Dyfed; and Y Wenhwyseg, the language of Gwent and Morgannwg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kimkat.org/amryw/1_cymraeg/cymraeg_tafodieitheg_gymraeg_mynegai_1385e.htm |title=Index to Welsh dialects |publisher=Kimkat.org |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl]
Another dialect is Patagonian Welsh, which has developed since the start of the Welsh settlement in Argentina in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut valley and in the Andes.

==Registers==

Modern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main styles—Colloquial Welsh (Cymraeg llafar) and Literary Welsh (Cymraeg llenyddol). The grammar described on this page is that of Colloquial Welsh, which is used in most speech and informal writing. Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers, including much literature. As a standardised form, literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh. Some differences include:
Amongst the characteristics of the literary, as against the spoken, language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms, different usage of some of the tenses, less frequent use of pronouns (since the information is usually conveyed in the verb/preposition inflections) and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words. In addition, more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh.

===Examples of sentences in literary and colloquial Welsh===

In fact, the differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary. The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible, amongst other things (although the [tpl]lang|cy|Beibl Cymraeg Newydd[/tpl] – New Welsh Bible – is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible). Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes that "The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English".King, G. Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar, published by Routledge, ISBN 0-415-09269-8 p3 A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in A Grammar of Welsh (1980) by Stephen J. Williams, or more completely in Gramadeg y Gymraeg (1998) by Peter Wynn Thomas. (No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English.)
The labels colloquial and literary are in fact convenient approximations: literary constructions occur in formal writing and speech while the majority of Welsh writing found on the Internet or in magazines, is closer to colloquial usage. This has also become more common in artistic literature, as in English.

==Welsh Bible==

The Bible translations into Welsh helped to maintain the use of Welsh in daily life. The New Testament was translated by William Salesbury in 1567 followed by the complete Bible by William Morgan in 1588.

==Welsh in education==

The decade around 1840 was a period of great social upheaval in Wales, manifested in the Chartist movement, which culminated in 20,000 people marching on Newport in 1839 resulting in a riot when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel and the Rebecca Riots when tollbooths on turnpikes were systematically destroyed.
This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment since social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills. The Times newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems.
In July 1846, three commissioners, R.R.W. Lingen, Jellynger C. Symons and H.R. Vaughan Johnson, were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all Anglicans and were presumed[tpl]By whom|date=January 2009[/tpl] to be unsympathetic to the non-conformist majority in Wales.
The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as [tpl]lang|cy|Brad y Llyfrau Gleision[/tpl] (The Treachery of the Blue Books)'Treacherous' Blue Books online since, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor Kenneth O. Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as "the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history".John Davies, Hanes Cymru (1993) (also in English translation as A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, ISBN 0-14-014581-8)
In the later 19th century virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English, even in areas where the pupils barely understood English. Some schools used the Welsh Not, a piece of wood, often bearing the letters "WN", which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh. The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh, with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating. One of the most famous Welsh born pioneers of higher education in Wales was Sir Hugh Owen. He made great progress in the cause of education and more especially, the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, of which he was chief founder. He has been credited [tpl]By whom|date=November 2009[/tpl] with the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889, following which several new Welsh schools were built. The first was completed in 1894 and named Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen.
Towards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change, partly owing to the efforts of Owen Morgan Edwards when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in 1907.
The Aberystwyth Welsh School ([tpl]lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth[/tpl]) was founded in 1939 by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards, the son of O.M. Edwards, as the first Welsh Primary School. The headteacher was Norah Isaac. [tpl]lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg[/tpl] is still a very successful school, and now there are Welsh language primary schools all over the country. Ysgol Glan Clwyd was established in Rhyl in 1955 as the first Welsh language school to teach at the secondary level.
Welsh is now widely used in education, with 20% of all pupils in Wales being taught at Welsh-medium schools."Local UK languages 'taking off'", BBC News Online
Under the National Curriculum, it is compulsory that all students should study Welsh up to the age of 16, either as a first language or a second language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_world/communications_index_ew/the_welsh_language.htm |title=Citizens Advice Bureau Adevice Guide |publisher=Adviceguide.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] Some students choose to continue with their studies through the medium of Welsh for the completion of their A-levels as well as during their college years.

Specialist teachers of Welsh called [tpl]lang|cy|Athrawon Bro[/tpl] support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum. Welsh is also taught in adult education classes. The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults, with centres in North Wales (learncymraeg.org), Mid Wales, South West, Glamorgan, Gwent. and Cardiff. The ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is desirable for certain career choices in Wales, such as teaching or customer service.More information can be found at Welsh for Adults.org All universities in Wales teach courses in Welsh. Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Bangor, and Swansea have all had chairs in Welsh since their virtual establishment, and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature, offering a BA in Welsh as well as post-graduate courses. Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh Language National College) was established. The purpose of the federal structured college, spread out between all the universities of Wales, is to provide and also advance Welsh medium courses and Welsh medium scholarship and research in Welsh universities. Over the next few years, it is expected that there will be at least 100 lecturers who teach through the medium of Welsh in subjects ranging from law, modern languages, social sciences, and also other sciences such as biological sciences. There is also a Welsh-medium academic journal called Gwerddon, which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly.

==Welsh in warfare==

Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime.  Cryptography can be used to protect messages, but codes can be broken. Therefore, lesser-known languages are sometimes encoded, so that even if the code is broken, the message is still in a language few people know. For example, Navajo code talkers were used by the United States military during World War II. Similarly, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, a Welsh regiment serving in Bosnia, used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure.[tpl]Cite news| last = Heath | first = Tony | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/welsh-speak-up-for-their-ancient-tongue-1311562.html| title = Welsh speak up for their ancient tongue|work = The Independent | page = 6 | date = 1996-08-26[/tpl]  Welsh was not used in the Falklands War because of the Welsh-speaking Argentine population in Patagonia.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==Use of Welsh at the European Union==

In November 2008, the Welsh language was used at a meeting of the European Union's Council of Ministers for the first time. The Heritage Minister Alun Ffred Jones addressed his audience in Welsh and his words were interpreted into the EU’s 23 official languages. The official use of the language followed years of campaigning.  Jones said "In the UK we have one of the world’s major languages, English, as the mother tongue of many. But there is a diversity of languages within our islands. I am proud to be speaking to you in one of the oldest of these, Welsh, the language of Wales." He described the breakthrough as "more than merely symbolic" saying "Welsh might be one of the oldest languages to be used in the UK, but it remains one of the most vibrant. Our literature, our arts, our festivals, our great tradition of song all find expression through our language. And this is a powerful demonstration of how our culture, the very essence of who we are, is expressed through language."[tpl]cite web|author=David Williamson |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/11/21/breakthrough-as-minister-uses-welsh-at-eu-council-91466-22307749/ |title=Walesonline.co.uk |publisher=Walesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl]
