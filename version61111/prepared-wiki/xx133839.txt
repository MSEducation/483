[[Kalasatama metro station]]

Kalasatama (Finnish) or Fiskehamnen (Swedish) is a station on the Helsinki Metro, in the capital city of Finland. The station was opened on 1 January 2007, and it serves the eastern part of the central Helsinki district of Sörnäinen. The area is now mainly composed of offices, but new residential and commercial developments will be constructed in the area after the port facilities there moved to the new Port of Vuosaari in 2008.
Unlike most other stations on the Helsinki Metro, Kalasatama was built on existing metro track, which made construction more difficult. However, normal metro traffic was not greatly affected by the construction work. Because the new platforms were built on either side of the existing metro track, Kalasatama station is one of only two stations on the Helsinki Metro to have separate platforms for both directions of travel (the other one is Itäkeskus metro station).
It is the only station on the Helsinki Metro system to have exclusively side platforms, rather than having been designed around an island platform.  It is located 1.1 kilometres from Sörnäinen metro station, and 1.8 kilometres from Kulosaari metro station.
