A selection of his tracks were featured in commercial bumps on Toonami and in the 2005 anime IGPX, and he produced the musical scores to critically acclaimed video games Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory by Ubisoft in 2005, and Sucker Punch's Infamous in 2009.

==Biography==

===Early career (1995–1997)===

Tobin was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the age of 2, he and his family left Brazil to live in Morocco, the Netherlands, London, Portugal and Madeira. Tobin settled in Brighton, England as a teenager which remained his permanent residence until 2002.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=1#biography | title=Ninjatune Artists – Amon Tobin Biography | accessdate=2008-09-27 | publisher=Ninja Tune | year= 2008[/tpl] There he began producing electronic music in his bedroom with samplers and other audio equipment such as an Amstrad Studio 100 4-track,[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject)|title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:14:05[/tpl] although he was "not really involved in the music scene" at that time.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject)|title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:07:20[/tpl] While taking an editorial photography class at a university in Brighton, he responded to a magazine promotion for the London-based Ninebar record label asking artists to send in demos of their songs. Ninebar signed Tobin to the label in 1996 after hearing his early work, and he traveled between his home in Brighton and the studios in London to produce his first official works. He also spent some time living in Montreal before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2008.
Under his original moniker Cujo (in Portuguese, the word for whose), he released a series of original compositions on 12-inch vinyl.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject)|title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:05:40[/tpl] Allmusic called them "head-turning" in a review.[tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r248658|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title=Adventures in Foam Review | accessdate=2008-09-27 | publisher=Allmusic |author=Cooper, Sean[/tpl] Many of those tracks were later included on his first full-length album Adventures in Foam, originally released in 1996 by Ninebar to a limited release of 5,000 copies.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject)|title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-12-10 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:07:50| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081218142352/http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3| archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The larger Ninja Tune record label had been growing in the United Kingdom at the time with help from their successful artists such as DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, and Coldcut.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22603-amon-tobin-out-from-out-where | title=Amon Tobin Out From Out Where | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=Pitchfork Media  | date=2002-10-24 | author=Dare, Christopher [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] DJ Food and Funki Porcini noticed Tobin's work on Adventures in Foam and prompted the label to approach him. Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996, this time under his abbreviated name "Amon Tobin".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Apr03/articles/amontobin.asp | title=Amon Tobin | accessdate=2008-10-12 | author=Young, Simon | publisher=SoundOnSound.com| date= 2003-04-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081121084210/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Apr03/articles/amontobin.asp| archivedate= 21 November 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The official Ninja Tune website has said that Adventures in Foam had been re-released without permission by the US-based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version, labeled the "US release", included only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that some tracks were titled incorrectly.[tpl]cite press release  | title = Adventures In Foam  | publisher = Ninja Tune  | url = http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=579 | accessdate = 2008-10-02 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081115183638/http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=579| archivedate= 15 November 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re-released the album themselves. This version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing previously unreleased material. As of 2008, copies of Shadow Record's "US version" are still sold by online retailer Amazon.com.[tpl]cite web  | title = Adventures In Foam  | publisher = Amazon.com  | url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000005E1E | accessdate = 2008-10-13 [/tpl] Over the course of its production, Adventures in Foam has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style "got totally out of hand", but that it "never fails to let the listener know who's in charge." The album was released for a fourth time in 2002, again by Ninja Tune.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/110675 |title=2002 Adventures in Foam re-release entry in Discogs |accessdate= 5 December 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081201110119/http://www.discogs.com/release/110675| archivedate= 1 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Defining albums (1997–2002)===

Over the next several years, Tobin released three albums. Bricolage, released in 1997, was the culmination of two projects Tobin had started after his debut album earlier that year. His third album Permutation was released in 1998. Independent radio stations aired Tobin's pieces during the summer of 1998 to positive listener reaction from conventional jazz aficionados, who identified with the computer-generated drums and composition.[tpl]cite web|last=Park|first=Sang (95.3FM WHRB Harvard Radio Broadcasting)|title=Bop-drum fans' entry into electronica|url=http://www.amazon.com/review/R33U45IBDUFVQ8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title/182-0955879-9735758?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000007OS2&nodeID=5174&store=music|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=30 December 1998[/tpl]   In the late 1990s, sample-based music was becoming more popular with a wide range of emerging and developing genres, but Tobin himself was still largely unknown. Tobin's style of music was not seen as definitively belonging to one genre or another.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject)|title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:18:40[/tpl] The critics that commented on Bricolage and Permutation gave them positive reviews and they are often mentioned, by later reviewers and interviewers, as classic albums of the time. Pitchfork Media acclaimed the use of jazz instrument samples, comparing him to famous composers Quincy Jones and Miles Davis.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22604-amon-tobin-bricolage | title=Amon Tobin:Bricolage | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=Pitchfork Media | date=1999-12-31 | author=Schreiber, Ryan |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212120836/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22604-bricolage | archivedate=2008-02-12 [/tpl] In a 1999 review, they awarded Bricolage a very rare 10/10 and said that it was "one of the most inventive records of the decade."[tpl]cite web | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000816165817/www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/c/cujo/adventures-in-foam.shtml| archivedate=2000-06-20|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16393-cujo-adventures-in-foam | title=Cujo: Adventures in Foam  | accessdate=2008-09-27 | publisher=Pitchfork Media | date=1999-12-31 | author=Schreiber, Ryan[/tpl]

===Montreal (2002–present)===

In 2002, Tobin relocated to Montreal, Canada where he had spent time previously at Ninja Tune's North American Headquarters. Tobin lived in the industrial area of Old Montreal to avoid noise complaints from neighbors after dark.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.exclaim.ca/musicschool/whereiplay.aspx?csid1=112 | title=Where I Play: Amon Tobin | accessdate=2008-10-03 | publisher=Exclaim! | author=Nasrallah, Dimitri [/tpl] There he produced his fifth album Out From Out Where released that same year. This was his first album created primarily in a professional studio.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject) |title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:31:19 [/tpl] He later released a single, Verbal, taken from Out From Out Where.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=614 |title=Verbal at Ninjatune |accessdate=18 December 2008 |work=Ninjatune.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090113141836/http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=614| archivedate= 13 January 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Otis Hart of Dusted Magazine said that Tobin's style of producing had come into its own. He acclaimed Tobin's "refined sense of tempo".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/396 |title=Out From Out Where review at Dusted Magazine |accessdate=9 December 2008 |work=Dusted Magazine |date=14 October 2002   | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090115195801/http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/396| archivedate= 15 January 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In January 2004, Tobin was contracted by video game company Ubisoft Montreal to compose the soundtrack for the third installment of their critically successful Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. To facilitate using the music in a video game, where the level of action or plot can change in real-time, each track was broken down by Tobin into four distinct but similar parts based on their level of intensity. The game's developers could then use each section to provide music based on the actions of the player.[tpl]cite web | url=http://remixmag.com/artists/remix_microscope/| title=UNDER A MICROSCOPE| accessdate=2008-10-01 | publisher=Remix  Magazine| date=2005-04-01 | author=Micallef, Ken [/tpl] Despite not being an official album in Tobin's discography, it was considered a ground breaking work in the world of video game sound tracks described as "an entirely new era of media" by Tiny Mix Tapes[tpl]cite web|last=Mixtapes|first=Tiny|title=ChaosTheory|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/amon-tobin-splinter-cell-chaos-theory|work=Chaos Theory OST|publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes|accessdate=2005-09-20[/tpl]
The album continued the trend Tobin started with Out From Out Where, as he used more field recordings during production. In addition to being included with the game, Ninja Tune released the score as an individual album in 2005, titled Chaos Theory – Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack, several months before the game's release. It was received well, benefiting from a wider audience of reviewers in both the music and gaming industries. Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH.com applauded Tobin's use of melody and texture, adding that he controlled the sounds with the "clarity of a classical orchestrator."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/amon-tobin-2.htm | title=Amon Tobin – Chaos Theory (Ninja Tune)| accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=MusicOMH.com | date=2007-02-07 | author=Hogwood, Ben| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081012022914/http://www.musicomh.com/albums/amon-tobin-2.htm| archivedate= 12 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He later recorded a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound version of the album with audio engineer Bobby Azinsky in a dedicated Solid State Logic studio in Los Angeles.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pixelsurgeon.com/interviews/interview.php?id=168 | title=PIXELSURGEON – Interviews – Music – Amon Tobin | accessdate=2008-10-01 | publisher=Pixelsurgeon | year=2005 | author=Gilbey, Sam[/tpl]
Tobin's sixth studio album, Foley Room, was released in 2007. The title alludes to the "foley rooms" used by recording engineers and foley artists to record sound effects in the movie industry. On this album, Tobin concluded his transition away from prerecorded source material that started with Out From Out Where. All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an omnidirectional microphone.[tpl]cite journal | last = Cooper | first = Sean | title = Amon Tobin Bugs Out| journal = Wired| volume = 15| issue = 04| publisher = Wired| date = March 2007| url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/play.html?pg=9| accessdate = 2008-10-09[/tpl] Recorded primarily in Montreal, San Francisco, and Seattle, the samples came from a wide range of sources including motorbikes, tigers, insects, and water falling from a tap.[tpl]cite press release  | title = Foley Room  | publisher = Ninja Tune  | url =http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=1218  | accessdate = 2008-10-02 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080914060303/http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=1218| archivedate= 14 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet, drummer Stefan Schneider, and harpist Sarah Pagé.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/blog-what-are-the-weirdest-instruments-used-in-modern-music-168757 | title=What are the weirdest instruments used in modern music? | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=MusicRadar | date=2007-09-09 | author=Hitchings, Craig[/tpl] Foley Room's use of field-recordings was used to help promote the album, including two official pre-release trailers posted to YouTube. Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a "smooth, natural progression" from his work on Supermodified.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/11675/amon-tobin-foley-room/ | title=Amon Tobin Foley Room | accessdate=2008-10-03 | publisher=PopMatters | date=2007-03-08 | author=Dorr, Nate [/tpl] The first single, "Bloodstone", was released to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album. Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled Foley Room: Found Footage which documented the recording process.
In 2008, Tobin announced he was working on a new video game soundtrack for an "undisclosed PS3 title".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amontobin.com/field/ |title=Tobin's official site (News obtained through current > news) |accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=Amontobin.com |date=8 December 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081211153730/http://www.amontobin.com/field/| archivedate= 11 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This was later revealed to be the PlayStation 3 exclusive game, inFamous, and in 2010, Tobin announced that he would be working on the music for Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amontobin.com/news/amon-contributes-score-splinter-cell-conviction/ |title=Tobin's official site |accessdate=22 February 2010 |work=Amontobin.com |date=18 January 2010[/tpl] Recent works include "Hey Mr. Tree" as a 'Bonus Joint' to accompany his earlier 'Monthly Joint' collection, a remix of Noisia's "Machine Gun" released alongside remixes by 16 Bit and Spor, and a collaboration with ESKMO dubbed Eskamon. Eskamon has released a single "Fine Objects". A new AT record has also been officially announced via www.amontobin.com, for which he is "researching and developing new production tools and techniques" and using "a whole new array of gadgetry from the past and the future".
Amon Tobin's sounds and samples are frequently used in the British car-based TV show Top Gear, and his song "Four Ton Mantis" has been used in a few of the more recent Nissan Qashqai and Juke advertisements.

==Musical style and influences==

Tobin is best known for his use of audio manipulation techniques, where any given source material is transformed to produce a new sound.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject) |title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3 | publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-12-10 | date=2008-03-21 | time=00:29:10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081218142352/http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3| archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] His use of this technique has changed over the course of his career.

Tobin experimented with various instruments. He does not come from a music family, nor has he had any formal training in music theory.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject) |title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:12:30[/tpl] About his music in general, Tobin says that he sees it as a "genuine" expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were "genuine" expressions of the 1960s.[tpl]cite video |people=Solipsistic Nation (Interviewer), Amon Tobin (Subject) |title=solipsistic NATION No. 82: Amon Tobin | url=http://m.podshow.com/media/9683/episodes/104853/nation-104853-03-20-2008.mp3 | format=Mp3| publisher=SolipsisticNation.com | accessdate=2008-09-29 | date=2008-03-21 |time=00:25:10[/tpl] Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo.[tpl]cite book |last=Rego |first=Luis |title=Let's Go Brazil 1st Edition |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UO61mNDbcVwC&pg=PA34&dq=amon+tobin |accessdate=2008-10-09 |publisher=Published by Macmillan |isbn=0-312-32004-3 |pages=34 |year=2003 [/tpl] Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kindamuzik.net/q_and_a/article.shtml?id=1862 | title=Amon Tobin: interview op KindaMuzik | accessdate=2008-09-27 | publisher=Kindamuzik | date=2002-09-13 | author=Roozendaal, Dave[/tpl]

==Live performances==

Tobin began performing live shows in clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002923/Amon-Tobin.html | title=Amon Tobin Biography | accessdate=2008-10-12 | publisher=MusicianGuide.com  | author=Brennan, Gerald E. [/tpl] His shows generally contained music that he had produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin was not interested in adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.
In 2011 Tobin has developed a live show in support of the album ISAM fitting his criteria for a performance that is both live and purely electronic. He told Wired Magazine “The idea was to integrate myself, quite literally, into an audio and visual presentation of the album,”.[tpl]cite news|last=Thilli|first=Scott|title=Amon Tobin’s ISAM Merges Music, Meat, Machines in 3-D Show, Creepy Hardcover|url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/amon-tobin-isam/|work=ISAM LIVE|publisher=Wired|accessdate=2011-06-06|date=2011-06-06[/tpl] It incorporates the use of new video mapping techniques that are projected onto a large cubic structure from which Tobin performs. The show has been met with international acclaim described by Vice Magazine's Creators Project as "revolutionizing the live music experience".[tpl]cite web|last=Flood|first=Cathleen|title=How Amon Tobin Is Revolutionizing The Live Music Experience|url=https://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/how-amon-tobin-is-revolutionizing-the-live-music-experience-video|work=ISAM Live|publisher=Vice|accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl]
Tobin has performed individual shows in many countries including tours in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the United States. His 2003 live performance in Melbourne, Australia was used for the fourth album in Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series because Tobin was not available to record a studio mix at the time. Many songs from the original recording were omitted because of copyright issues with the original artists, including the R&B group Destiny's Child.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=860 | title=Press Release | accessdate=2008-10-02 | publisher=Ninja Tune | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081115131145/http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=860| archivedate= 15 November 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A second Solid Steel album called Foley Room Recorded Live In Brussels was recorded in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007 and was released for free in November 2008. According to Tobin's official website, "After months of back and forth and despite everyone’s best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers. Rather than release a compromised version commercially, the decision was made to give it away for free instead."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amontobin.com/storeNew/detail.php?item_type=freebie&id=42 |title=Foley Room Recorded Live In Brussels |accessdate=9 December 2008 |work=Amontobin.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081209105247/http://www.amontobin.com/storeNew/detail.php?item_type=freebie&id=42| archivedate= 9 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

In January 2011, his artist page was updated on Ninja Tune's official website, announcing a new album in 2011, called ISAM, as well as a Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory remix album. Later, the official Ping Pong Facebook page suggested that ISAM would be released on May 9, 2011. After being leaked by a journalist with a press copy of the album, ISAM was instead released on April 20, 2011.
