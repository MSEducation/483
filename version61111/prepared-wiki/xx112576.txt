The International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) was organized in 1915 by J. Alex Sloan, and is currently the oldest active auto racing sanctioning body in the United States. IMCA is currently headquartered in Vinton, Iowa, and features several classes and divisions of weekly racing in six geographical regions of the United States. The IMCA championships are held annually at the IMCA Supernationals at Boone Speedway in Boone, Iowa.

==History==

Sloan, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was instrumental in establishing the IMCA and ran more races than all other promoters in the United States combined, all under IMCA sanction. After Sloan's death in 1937 his son, John Sloan, continued to manage the IMCA. Under John Sloanâ€™s leadership, IMCA continued to grow and held its first Late model race on November 9, 1947, in Lubbock, Texas. In the late 1970s, Keith Knaack introduced the IMCA Modified division.  In 1996, Kathy Root bought IMCA from Kathryn and Karolyn Knaack.

The 1963 and 1964 IMCA champion, driver Dick Hutcherson, was not eligible for the 1965 NASCAR Grand National Series Rookie of the Year, which he won nine times and finished second in the standings, it was given to Sam McQuagg.  NASCAR's rookie standards have since changed to being based only on the Sprint Cup Series.
