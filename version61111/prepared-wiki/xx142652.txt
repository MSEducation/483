Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (born 27 April 1941) is a Turkish preacher, former imam,Fethullah Gülen's Official Web Site - Fethullah Gülen in ShortHelen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh, The Gülen Movement: A Sociological Analysis of a Civic Movement Rooted in Moderate Islam, p 26.

"A visit to the Pennsylvania fortress of “The World’s most Dangerous Islamist”"Stakelbeck, Eric "The Gülen Movement: A New Islamic World Order?"Berlinski, Claire "Who Is Fethullah Gülen?"
Gülen teaches an Anatolian (Hanafi) version of Islam, deriving from Sunni Muslim scholar Said Nursî's teachings. Gülen has stated that he believes in science, interfaith dialogue among the People of the Book, and multi-party democracy.[tpl]cite web| title=How far they have travelled|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10808408?story_id=10808408|work=The Economist|accessdate=2 May 2012|date=6 March 2008[/tpl] He has initiated such dialogue with the VaticanHelen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh, The Gülen Movement: A Sociological Analysis of a Civic Movement Rooted in Moderate Islam, p 38.

Gülen is actively involved in the societal debate concerning the future of the Turkish state, and Islam in the modern world. He has been described in the English-language media as "one of the world's most important Muslim figures." However, his Gülen movement has been described as "having the characteristics of a cult" and its secretiveness and influence in Turkish politics likened to "an Islamic Opus Dei".[tpl]cite news|title=Turkey: up from the depths|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/turkey-murky-depths|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 December 2013|accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] In the Turkish context, Gülen appears as a religious conservative.

==Biography==

Gülen was born in the village of Korucuk, near Erzurum.M. Hakan Yavuz, John L. Esposito, Turkish Islam and the Secular State: The Gülen Movement, p. 20 His father, Ramiz Gülen, was an imam. Gülen started primary education at his home village, but did not continue after his family moved. He took part in Islamic education in the mosque of Erzurum where the father of Metin Kaplan was educated, too.German report in Der SpiegelAn interview with Fethullah Gülen's primary school teacher He gave his first sermon when he was 14.http://tr.fgulen.com/a.page/hayati/hayat.kronolojisi/a4443.html He was influenced by the ideas of Said Nursî and Maulana Jalaluddeen Rumi."The Gulen Movement: Communicating Modernization, Tolerance, and Dialogue in the Islamic World." The International Journal of the Humanities, Volume 6, Issue 12, pp. 67–78.
Comparing Gülen to leaders in the Nur movement, Hakan Yavuz said, "Gülen is more Turkish nationalist in his thinking. Also, he is somewhat more state-oriented, and is more concerned with market economics and neo-liberal economic policies."http://religion.info/english/interviews/article_74.shtml
His pro-business stance has led some outsiders[tpl]who|date=February 2012[/tpl] to dub his theology an Islamic version of Calvinism.http://en.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-907/i.html Oxford Analytica says:
 "Gülen put Nursi's ideas into practice when he was transferred to a mosque in Izmir in 1966. Izmir is a city where political Islam never took root. However, the business and professional middle class came to resent the constraints of a state bureaucracy under whose wings it had grown, and supported market-friendly policies, while preserving at least some elements of a conservative lifestyle. Such businessmen were largely pro-Western, because it was Western (mainly U.S.) influence, which had persuaded the government to allow free elections for the first time in 1950 sic and U.S. aid, which had primed the pump of economic growth."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/18/turkey-islam-gulen-cx_0121oxford.html|work=Forbes|title=Gulen Inspires Muslims Worldwide|date=21 January 2008[/tpl] 
Gülen retired from formal preaching duties in 1981. From 1988 to 1991 he gave a series of sermons in popular mosques of major cities. In 1994, he participated in the founding of "Journalists and Writers Foundation"http://www.gyv.org.tr/changelang.asp?lang=2&page2go=http://www.gyv.org.tr/ and was given the title "Honorary President" by the foundation.The Journalists and Writers Foundation Official Web Site He did not make any comment regarding the closures of the Welfare Party in 1998http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/meria/journal/2000/issue4/jv4n4a4.html or the Virtue Party in 2001.Clement M. Henry, Rodney Wilson, The politics of Islamic Finance, Edinburgh University Press (2004), p 236 He has met some politicians like Tansu Çiller and Bülent Ecevit, but he avoids meeting with the leaders of Islamic political parties.
In 1999, Gülen emigrated to the United States, claiming the trip for medical treatment, although arguably it was in anticipation of being tried over remarks (aired after his emigration to U.S.) which seemed to favor an Islamic state.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/374649.stm|work=BBC News|title=Turkish investigation into Islamic sect expanded|date=21 June 1999|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] In June 1999, after Gülen had left Turkey, videotapes were sent to some Turkish television stations with recordings of Gülen saying,
 "The existing system is still in power. Our friends who have positions in legislative and administrative bodies should learn its details and be vigilant all the time so that they can transform it and be more fruitful on behalf of Islam in order to carry out a nationwide restoration. However, they should wait until the conditions become more favorable. In other words, they should not come out too early."Clement M. Henry, Rodney Wilson, The Politics of Islamic Finance, (Edinburgh University Press 2004), p. 236 
Gülen complained that the remarks were taken out of context,Gülen's answers to claims made based on the video tapes taken from some of his recorded speeches and his supporters raised questions about the authenticity of the tape,Dogan Koc, Strategic Defamation of Fethullah Gülen: English Vs. Turkish, p. 24. ISBN 0761859306 which he accused of having been "manipulated". Gülen was tried in absentia in 2000, and acquitted in 2008 under the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.WorldWide Religious News-Gulen acquitted of trying to overthrow secular government
Gülen procured a green card in 2001.

==Theology==

Gülen does not advocate a new theology but refers to classical authorities of theology, taking up their line of argument.Erol Nazim Gulay, The Theological thought of Fethullah Gulen: Reconciling Science and Islam (St. Antony's College Oxford University May 2007). p. 1 His understanding of Islam tends to be conservative and mainstream.Robert W. Hefner, Muhammad Qasim Zaman, Schooling Islam: The Culture and Politics of Modern Muslim Education (Princeton University Press, 2007) p.  162-3.Portrait of Fethullah Gülen, A Modern Turkish-Islamic Reformist Though he has never been a member of a Sufi tarekat and does not see tarekat membership as a necessity for Muslims, he teaches that "Sufism is the inner dimension of Islam" and "the inner and outer dimensions must never be separated."Thomas Michel S.J., Sufism and Modernity in the Thought of Fethullah Gülen, The Muslim World, Vol. 95 No. 3, July 2005,  pp. 345-5
His teachings differ in emphasis from those of other mainstream Islamic scholars in two respects, both based on his interpretations of particular verses of the Quran. He teaches that the Muslim community has a duty of service (Turkish: hizmet)Mehmet Kalyoncu, A Civilian Response to Ethno-Religious Conflict: The Gülen Movement in Southeast Turkey (Tughra Books, 2008), pp. 19–40 to the "common good" of the community and the nationBerna Turam, Between Islam and the State: The Politics of Engagement (Stanford University Press 2006) p. 61 and to Muslims and non-Muslims all over the world;Saritoprak, Z. and Griffith, S. Fethullah Gülen and the 'People of the Book': A Voice from Turkey for Interfaith Dialogue, The Muslim World, Vol. 95 No. 3, July 2005,  p.337-8 and that the Muslim community is obliged to conduct interfaith dialogue with the "People of the Book" (Jews and Christians), although this does not extend to other religions and atheists.Saritoprak, Z. and Griffith, S. Fethullah Gülen and the 'People of the Book': A Voice from Turkey for Interfaith Dialogue, The Muslim World, Vol. 95 No. 3, July 2005, pp. 337–8 Gülen has appeared to be intolerant of atheism, commenting in 2004 that "terrorism was as despicable as atheism".Fethullah Gülen and Atheist-Terrorist Comparison In a follow-up interview, he claimed he did not intend to equate atheists and murderers; rather, he wanted to highlight the fact that according to Islam, both were destined to suffer eternal punishment.http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=219352

==Activities==

The Gülen movement is a transnational Islamic civic society movement inspired by Gülen's teachings. His teachings about hizmet (altruistic service to the "common good") have attracted a large number of supporters in Turkey, Central Asia, and increasingly in other parts of the world.In Lester Kurtz's (of University of Texas, Austin) words, "One of the most striking operationalizations of Gulen's fusion of commitment and tolerance is the nature of the Gulen movement, as it is often called, which has established hundreds of schools in many countries as a consequence of his belief in the importance of knowledge, and example in the building of a better world. The schools are a form of service to humanity designed to promote learning in a broader sense and to avoid explicit Islamic propaganda." Kurtz also cites in the same work the comments of Thomas Michel, General Secretary of the Vatican Secretariat for Inter-religious Dialogue, after a visit to a school in Mindanao, Philippines, where the local people suffered from a civil war, as follows: "In a region where kidnapping is a frequent occurrence, along with guerrilla warfare, summary raids, arrests, disappearances and killings by military and para-military forces, the school is offering Muslim and Christian Filipino children, along with an educational standard of high quality, a more positive way of living and relating to each other." Kurtz adds: "The purpose of the schools movement, therefore, is to lay the foundations for a more humane, tolerant citizenry of the world where people are expected to cultivate their own faith perspectives and also promote the well being of others... It is significant to note that the movement has been so successful in offering high quality education in its schools, which recruit the children of elites and government officials, that it is beginning to lay the groundwork for high-level allies, especially in Central Asia, where they have focused much of their effort." See, Lester R. Kurtz, "Gulen's Paradox: Combining Commitment and Tolerance," Muslim World, Vol. 95, July 2005; 379–381.

===Education===

In his sermons, Gülen has reportedly stated: "Studying physics, mathematics, and chemistry is worshipping Allah." Gülen's followers have built over 1,000 schools around the world.Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh, The Gülen Movement: A Sociological Analysis of a Civic Movement Rooted in Moderate Islam, p 4. ISBN 1402098944 In Turkey, Gülen's schools are considered among the best: expensive modern facilities and English taught from the first grade. However, former teachers from outside the Gülen community have called into question the treatment of women and girls in Gülen schools, reporting that female teachers were excluded from administrative responsibilities, allowed little autonomy, and—along with girls from the sixth grade and up—segregated from male colleagues and pupils during break and lunch periods.[tpl]cite web|last=Spiegelman|first=Margaret|title=What Scares Turkey's Women?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/21/what-scares-turkey-s-women.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl]

===Interfaith and intercultural dialogue===

Gülen movement participants have founded a number of institutions across the world which claim to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue activities.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Gülen's earlier works are (in Bekim Agai's words) "full of anti-missionary and anti-Western passages",http://en.fgulen.com/conference-papers/294-the-fethullah-gulen-movement-i/2132-discursive-and-organizational-strategies-of-the-gulen-movement.html and "vitriolic" diatribes against Jews, Christians, and others.[tpl]cite web|author=Pınar Doğan; Dani Rodrik|date=5 December 2012|title=Fethullah Gülen, the Jews, and hypocrisy|url=http://balyozdavasivegercekler.com/2012/11/05/fethullah-gulen-the-jews-and-hypocrisy/|publisher=balyozdavasivegercekler.com|accessdate=22 December 2013 [/tpl] During the 1990s, he began to advocate interreligious tolerance and dialogue. He has personally met with leaders of other religions, including Pope John Paul II, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomeos, and Israeli Sephardic Head Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron.Advocate of Dialogue: Fethullah Gülen
Gülen has said that he favors cooperation between followers of different religions as well as religious and secular elements within society.[tpl]According to whom|date=February 2012[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

==Views on contemporary issues==

===Secularism===

Gülen has criticized secularism in Turkey as "reductionist materialism". However, he has in the past said that a secular approach that is "not anti-religious" and "allows for freedom of religion and belief, is compatible with Islam."European Muslims, Civility and Public Life Perspectives On and From the Gülen Movement[tpl]Verify credibility|date=February 2012[/tpl]
According to one Gülen press release, in democratic-secular countries, 95% of Islamic principles are permissible and practically feasible, and there is no problem with them. The remaining 5% "are not worth fighting for."http://tr.fgulen.com/content/view/227/141/

===Turkey bid to join the EU===

Gülen has supported Turkey's bid to join the European Union and has said that neither Turkey nor the EU have anything to fear, but have much to gain, from a future of full Turkish membership in the EU.

===Women's roles===

According to Aras and Caha, Gülen's views on women are "progressive" but "modern professional women in Turkey still find his ideas far from acceptable." Gülen says the coming of Islam saved women, who "were absolutely not confined to their home and ... never oppressed" in the early years of the religion. He feels that western-style feminism, however, is "doomed to imbalance like all other reactionary movements" and eventually "being full of hatred towards men."http://en.fgulen.com/recent-articles/2897-women-confined-and-mistreated.html
However, Gülen's views are vulnerable to the charge of misogyny. As noted by Berna Turam, Gülen has argued: "the man is used to more demanding jobs ... but a woman must be excluded during certain days during the month. After giving birth, she sometimes cannot be active for two months. She cannot take part in different segments of the society all the time. She cannot travel without her husband, father, or brother."Berna Turam, Between Islam and the State: The Politics of Engagement (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2007), 125.

===Terrorism===

Gülen has condemned terrorism.Fethullah Gülen: A life dedicated to peace and humanity- True Muslims Cannot Be Terrorists He warns against the phenomenon of arbitrary violence and aggression against civilians and said that it "has no place in Islam". He wrote a condemnation article in the Washington Post on September 12, 2001, one day after the September 11 attacks, and stated that "A Muslim can not be a terrorist, nor can a terrorist be a true Muslim."http://www.fethullah-gulen.org/op-ed/gulen-movement-9-11.htmlMuslims Cannot Be Terrorists  Gülen lamented the "hijacking of Islam" by terrorists.

===Gaza flotilla===

Gülen criticized the Turkish-led Gaza flotilla for trying to deliver aid without Israel's consent. He spoke of watching the news coverage of the deadly confrontation between Israeli commandos and multinational aid group members as its flotilla approached Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. He said, "What I saw was not pretty, it was ugly." He has since continued his criticism, saying later that the organizers' failure to seek accord with Israel before attempting to deliver aid was "a sign of defying authority, and will not lead to fruitful matters."http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284721280274694.html Wall Street Journal, Joe Lauria, "Reclusive Turkish Imam Criticizes Gaza Flotilla", June 4, 2010

===Syrian Civil War===

Gülen is strongly against Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War.http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21578046-turkish-government-under-attack-home-its-assertive-policy-towards-syria-explosive Turkey and Syria: An explosive border

==Influence in Turkish society and politics==

The Gülen movement has millions of followers in Turkey, as well as many more abroad. Beyond the schools established by Gülen's followers, it is believed that many Gülenists hold positions of power in Turkey's police forces and judiciary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13503361|title=Profile: Fethullah Gulen's Hizmet movement|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl] Turkish and foreign analysts believe Gülen also has sympathizers in the Turkish parliament and that his movement controls the widely-read Islamic conservative Zaman newspaper, the private Bank Asya bank, the Samanyolu TV television station, and many other media and business organizations, including the Turkish Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists (TUSKON).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/world/middleeast/turkey-feels-sway-of-fethullah-gulen-a-reclusive-cleric.html|title=Turkey Feels Sway of Reclusive Cleric in the U.S.|authors=Dan Bilefsky and Sebnem Arsu|date=24 April 2012|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl] In March 2011, the Turkish government arrested the investigative journalist Ahmet Şık and seized and banned his book The Imam's Army, the culmination of Şık's investigation into Gülen and the Gülen movement.Hurriyet Daily News, 16 November 2011, Banned book goes on sale in Istanbul book fair
In 2005, a man affiliated with the Gülen movement approached then-U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Eric S. Edelman during a party in Istanbul and handed him an envelope containing a document supposedly detailing plans for an imminent coup against the government by the Turkish military. However, the documents were soon found to be forgeries.[tpl]cite news | title = Turkish Leader Disowns Trials That Helped Him Tame Military | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/turkish-leader-disowns-trials-that-helped-him-tame-military.html?hpw&rref=world | last = Arango | first = Tim | date = 26 February 2014 | accessdate = 27 February 2014 | newspaper = The New York Times | quote = In 2005, years before the trials, a man affiliated with the Gulen movement approached Eric S. Edelman, then the American ambassador, at a party in Istanbul and handed him an envelope containing a handwritten document that supposedly laid out a plan for an imminent coup. But as Mr. Edelman recounted, he gave the documents to his colleagues and they were determined to be forgeries. [/tpl] Gülen affiliates claim the movement is "civic" in nature and that it does not have political aspirations.

===Split with Erdoğan===

Despite Gülen's and his followers' claims that the organization is non-political in nature, analysts believe that a number of corruption-related arrests made against allies of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reflect a growing political power struggle between Gülen and the prime minister.[tpl]cite news | title = Turkish Leader Disowns Trials That Helped Him Tame Military | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/turkish-leader-disowns-trials-that-helped-him-tame-military.html?hpw&rref=world | last = Arango | first = Tim | date = 26 February 2014 | accessdate = 27 February 2014 | newspaper = The New York Times | quote = Whether the corruption charges are justified or not — there has been plenty of leaked evidence, especially wiretapped conversations, that appears incriminating — the corruption probe has laid bare the influence of the Gulen movement within the Turkish state, which had largely been suspected but hard to prove. [/tpl] These arrests led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, which the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP)'s supporters (along with Erdoğan himself) and the opposition parties alike have said was choreographed by Gülen after Erdoğan's government came to the decision early in December 2013 to shut down many of his movement's private Islamic schools in Turkey.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25909139 | title = Turkey's Fethullah Gulen denies corruption probe links | date = 27 January 2014 | accessdate = 4 February 2014 | publisher = BBC News [/tpl]
The Erdoğan government has said that the corruption investigation and comments by Gülen are the long term political agenda of Gülen's movement to infiltrate security, intelligence, and justice institutions of the Turkish state, a charge almost identical to the charges against Gülen by the Chief Prosecutor of the Republic of Turkey in his trial in 2000 before Erdoğan's party had come into power. Gülen had previously been tried in absentia in 2000, and acquitted in 2008 under Erdoğan's AKP government from these charges.WorldWide Religious News-Gulen acquitted of trying to overthrow secular government
In emailed comments to the Wall Street Journal in January 2014, Gülen said that "Turkish people ... are upset that in the last two years democratic progress is now being reversed", but he denied being part of a plot to unseat the government.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304027204579332670740491570|title=From His Refuge in the Poconos, Reclusive Imam Fethullah Gulen Roils Turkey|authors=Joe Parkinson and Ayla Albayrak|date=20 January 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] Later, in January 2014 in an interview with BBC World, Gulen said "If I were to say anything to people I may say people should vote for those who are respectful to democracy, rule of law, who get on well with people. Telling or encouraging people to vote for a party would be an insult to peoples' intellect. Everybody very clearly sees what is going on."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25885817 | title=Fethullah Gulen: Powerful but reclusive Turkish cleric | publisher=BBC | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=5 February 2014 | author=Tim Franks[/tpl]

==Publications==

Gülen's official websiteGulen's publications (Turkish), last visisted 2nd March 2014 lists 43 publications by him; these are, however, more akin to essays and collections of sermons than books on specific subjects with a specific thesis.
