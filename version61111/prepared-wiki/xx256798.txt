The series is set in Ottawa but filmed primarily in Regina. The initial season of 13 episodes premiered January 4, 2011.  It was followed by a second season of 10 episodes before cancellation by CBC on April 19, 2012 due to budget cuts from the 2012 Canadian federal budget.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/television/cbc-cancels-battle-of-the-blades-as-part-of-budget-cuts/article2407570/?from=sec434 |title=CBC puts Battle of the Blades on hold |author=Ryan, Andrew |date=April 19, 2012 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]

The initial pilot focused on the tedium involved in electronic eavesdropping but the decision was made that it would be too "niche". A second pilot was done with a more 24 approach.
