The dinar or denar is a main currency unit in modern circulation in nine mostly-Islamic countries, and has historic use in several more. 
The history of the dinar dates to the gold dinar, an early Islamic coin corresponding to the Byzantine denarius auri.  The modern gold dinar is a modern bullion gold coin.
