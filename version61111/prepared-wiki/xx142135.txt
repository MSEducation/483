[[Non-European royal and noble ranks]]

CATEGORIES: Feudalism, Noble titles

Some titles of nobility outside Europe may be considered as equivalents of Duke.
Like other major Western noble titles, Duke is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. "Duke" is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.

In Goryeo Dynasty, there were two ranks similar to that of duke. The upper was Gukgong(국공, 國公, means “duke of the nation”). Gukgong was the first rank of Goryeo peerage system, and 3,000 families gave their agricultural production and workforce for Gukgong. The lower was Gungong (군공, 郡公, means “duke of county”), which took 2,000 families' production and workforce.
