==Music career==

Lashoff is also a musician. He released his debut album titled "Living on Heart" on May 17, 2011.[tpl]cite web| url = http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=563142 | title = Lashoff Realizes Musical Dream | publisher = Toronto Maple Leafs | date = 2011-05-18 | accessdate = 2011-05-18[/tpl]
“Living on Heart” was recorded over a month in the summer of 2010, at various studios in New Jersey and New York, during Lashoff's off season. Producer Loren Harriet approached Lashoff after seeing a segment about his music career on the New England Sports Network channel. Lashoff was surprised by the opportunity and explains, “I didn't think Harriet was serious at first eventually he was helping me choose my band which was like an all star team of some of the best studio musicians.” Lashoff says his debut album is “bluesy with a pop influence” and cites artists such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King and Kenny Wayne Shepherd as his inspiration.Matt Lashoff Takes A Shot 2011 Interview http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/matt_lashoff_takes_shot
Many people may wonder how Lashoff balances his hockey and music career—he points out that hockey takes a precedent in his life; however, that does not mean his music career has to suffer – he can succeed in both. "A lot of people ask me how do you separate the two, but they've always been a part of my lifestyle. When we were kids is speaking as well of his brother Brian who is also a professional hockey player and plays guitar on the track "Something I Know" we would play hockey before school and then after school till it got too dark and our mom told us to come in, then we would eat, play around on the guitar and write songs,” says Lashoff. He is now planning a second album with a different sound, that will be “more groove based and not so poppy."Matt Lashoff Takes A Shot 2011 Interview http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/matt_lashoff_takes_shot
