Providence Plantations was the first permanent European American settlement in present-day Rhode Island.  It was established at Providence in 1636 by English clergyman Roger Williams and a small band of followers who had left the repressive atmosphere of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to seek freedom of worship. Narragansett sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi granted Williams a sizable tract of land for his new village.Official history from the state of Rhode Island
