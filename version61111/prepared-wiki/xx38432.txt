The memorial is often covered with flowers, candles in glasses, and other belongings left behind by Lennon's fans.  On Lennon's birthday (October 9) and on the anniversary of his death (December 8), people gather to sing songs and pay tribute, staying late into what is often a cold night.
Impromptu memorial gatherings for other musicians, including Jerry Garcia and George Harrison, have occurred at the memorial.  On the anniversaries of birthdays of the other members of The Beatles, gatherings take place at the site.  In the days following the September 11 attacks, candlelight vigils were held at the Imagine Circle to remember those killed.  On the thirtieth anniversary of John Lennon's death, vigils were also held here for him.  On weekends, musicians often play for the enjoyment of thousands of fans from around the world who visit the site.
One of its best-known visitors was Gary dos Santos, a fan of the Beatles who decorated the memorial in circles of different flowers and objects, often in the shape of a peace sign.[ref]
