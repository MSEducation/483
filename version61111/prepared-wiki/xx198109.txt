The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which had financed the hotel, went bankrupt in November 1997, and the management of the hotel was discontinued for lack of funds. In 2000, Tokachi Urban Properties, a local real-estate company, purchased the land and building of the hotel, and extensive renovation of the building was done during the following year.

In the same year, the hotel was acceded to the Leading Hotels of the World, and the Windsor Hospitality Institute, a school for hotel clerks, was established. Secom, a security company, has owned the hotel since 2003, when the company coupled the Tokachi Urban Properties.
