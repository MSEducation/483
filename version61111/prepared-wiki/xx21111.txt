 }}</ref> It was extracted from [[malt]] solution in 1833 by 
Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French 
sugar factory.[ref]Payen & Persoz (1833), page 77.  Payen and 
Persoz found diastase in the seeds of barley, oats, and wheat, as well 
as in potatoes (Payen & Persoz (1833), page 76).[/ref] The 
name "diastase" comes from the Greek word διάστασις (diastasis) (a 
parting, a separation) because when beer mash is heated, the enzyme causes the starch in the barley seed to transform quickly into soluble sugars and hence the husk to separate from the rest of the 
seed.[ref]Payen & Persoz (1833), pages 
75-76.[/ref]Etymology of "diastase" Today, diastase means any α-, β-, 
or γ-amylase (all of them hydrolases) that can break down 
carbohydrates.
The commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from 
the name diastase.[ref]The naming of enzymes using the suffix 
"-ase" has been traced to French scientist Émile Duclaux 
(1840-1904), who intended to honor the discoverers of diastase by 
introducing the practice in his book 
Traité de Microbiologie, vol. 2 (Paris, France:  Masson and Co., 
1899), Chapter 1, especially page 9.[/ref]
When used as a pharmaceutical drug, diastase has the ATC code 
[tpl]ATC|A09|AA01[/tpl].
These days, diastase can be taken out from the barley seed even after 
all the beer ingredients were mixed and heated. This beneficial enzyme 
can also be extracted from various other sources. These include plants, 
saliva and milk. However, for obtaining a natural diastase numerous 
natural sources can be used.
