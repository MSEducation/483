The terms Chicano or Chicana (also spelled Xicano or Xicana) is a chosen identity of Mexican-Americans in the United States. The term "Chicano" is interchangeable with Mexican-American. Both names are chosen identities within the Mexican-American community in the United States.  However, these terms have a wide range of meanings in various parts of the Southwest. The term became widely used during the Chicano Movement, mainly among Mexicans-Americans who wanted to express an identity, of cultural, ethnic and community pride.
The term "Chicano" had negative connotations before the Chicano Movement, and still is viewed negatively by more conservative members of this community, but it is gaining more acceptance as an identity of pride within the Mexican-American community in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] As people from Mexico could be of any ethnic origin or race, including European (mostly Spanish), the pro indigenous/mestizo Chicano identity, movement or ideology is not necessarily supported by and/or representative in many cases, the interest of all people who consider themselves as being of  "Mexican" descent.

==Etymology==

The origin of the word "chicano" is disputed. Some critics claim it is a shorterned form of "Mexicano" (the Nahuatl name for a member of the Mexica pueblo). The word "Mexico" as spoken in its original Nahuatl, and by the Spaniards at the time of the conquest, was pronounced originally with a "sh" sound ("Meh-shee-co") and was transcribed with an "x" during this time period. The difference between the pronunciation and spelling of "chicano" and "mexicano" stems from the fact that the modern-day Spanish language experienced a change in pronunciation regarding a majority of words containing the "x" (for example: México, Ximenez, Xavier, Xarabe). In most cases the "sh" sound has been replaced with the "he" sound ("Meh-he-co") and a change of spelling ("x" to "j"). The word "Chicano" was also affected by this change. Many Chicanos replace the "ch" with the letter "x" as Xicanos, due to the original spelling of the Mexica Empire (pronounced: Meshica).
In Mexico's indigenous regions, ladinos (mestizos)Not to be confused with the language "Ladino" of Spain and Portugal, a Spanish language spoken by Sephardic Jews of Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Israel and the USA. and westernized natives are referred to as "mexichanos," referring to the modern nation, rather than the pueblo identification of the speaker, be it Mayan, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huasteco, or the hundreds of other native pueblos.  Thus, a newly emigrated Nahuatl speaker would have referred to his cultural relatives in this country, different than himself, as "mexicanos," shortened to "chicano."
Derived from "mexhicano," "chicano" thus has its roots in the pueblo identification of Mexica, also known as the Aztecs.  "Mexica" is the name given members of the Aztec pueblo who settled in the Yucatán by the Mayans, and which means "bearded serpents," or "those who follow the Feathered Serpent."
The Chicano poet and writer Tino Villanueva traces the first documented use of the term to 1911, as referenced in a then-unpublished essay by University of Texas anthropologist José Limón.Félix Rodríguez González, ed. Spanish Loanwords in the English Language. A Tendency towards Hegemony Reversal. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996. Villanueva is referring to Limón's essay "The Folk Performance of Chicano and the Cultural Limits of Political Ideology," available via ERIC. Limón refers to use of the word in a 1911 report titled "Hot tamales" in the Spanish language newspaper La Crónica in 1911. Linguists Edward R. Simmen and Richard F. Bauerle report the use of the term in an essay by Mexican American writer, Mario Suárez, published in the Arizona Quarterly in 1947.Edward R. Simmen and Richard F. Bauerle. "Chicano: Origin and Meaning." American Speech 44.3 (Autumn 1969): 225-230.
Mexican Americans were not identified as a racial/ethnic category prior to the 1980 US Census, when the term "Hispanic" was first used in census reports.
In 1857 there was a mention of a sale of the gun boat, “Chicana” being sold to Jose Maria Carvajal to ship arms on the Rio Grande. The King and Kenedy firm submitted a voucher to the Joint Claims Commission of the United States in 1870 to cover the costs to convert the  “Chicana”  from a river steamer to a “gunboat”.[tpl]cite book|last=Chance|first=Joseph|title=Jose Maria de Jesus Carvajal, The Life and Times of a Mexican Revolutionary|year=2006|publisher=Trinity University Press|location=San Antonio, Texas|page=195[/tpl]
Some believe that the word "chicamo" somehow became "chicano", which (unlike "chicamo") reflects the grammatical conventions of Spanish-language ethno- and demonyms, such as "americano" or "castellano" or "peruano". However, Chicanos generally do not agree that "chicamo" was ever a word used within the culture, as its assertion is thus far entirely unsubstantiated. Therefore, most Chicanos do not agree that "Chicano" was ever derived from the word "chicamo". There is ample literary evidence to further substantiate that "Chicano" is a self-declaration, as a large body of Chicano literature exists with publication dates far predating the 1950s. There is also a substantial body of Chicano literature that predates both Raso and the Federal Census Bureau.
As stated in the Handbook of Texas:
Thus far, the origins of the word remain inconclusive, as the term is not used outside Mexican-American communities, further indicating that the term is primarily self-identifying.

==Meanings==

The term's meanings are highly debatable, but self-described Chicanos view the term as a positive self-identifying social construction. Outside of Mexican-American communities, the term has been considered pejorative and takes on subjective view but usually consists of one or more of the following elements.

===Ethnic identity===

From a popular perspective, the term Chicano became widely visible outside of Chicano communities during the American civil rights movement. It was commonly used during the mid-1960s by Mexican-American activists,Moore, J. W., & Cuéllar, A. B. (1970). Mexican Americans. Ethnic groups in American life series. Englewood, Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. p. 149. ISBN 978-0-13-579490-6. who, in attempt to reassert their civil rights, tried to rid the word of its polarizing negative connotation by reasserting a unique ethnic identity and political consciousness, proudly identifying themselves as Chicanos.
The term "chicano" may have came from the word Mexica pronounced (Me-shi-ca) or from the Guanajuato indios the Chichimecas combined with the word Mexicano .
Others believe it was a corrupted term of "Chilango", meaning an inhabitant from Mexico City or Central Mexico (i.e. the highland states of Mexico (state), Sinaloa, Jalisco, Tijuana, Puebla (state) and Michoacán); and even from the term "Chileno" by the Chilean presence in mid 19th-century California, when miners from Chile arrived in the California Gold Rush (1848–51 .

===Political identity===

According to the Handbook of Texas:
[tpl]quote|Inspired by the courage of the farmworkers, by the California strikes led by César Chávez, and by the Anglo-American youth revolt of the period, many Mexican-American university students came to participate in a crusade for social betterment that was known as the Chicano movement. They used Chicano to denote their rediscovered heritage, their youthful assertiveness, and their militant agenda. Though these students and their supporters used Chicano to refer to the entire Mexican-American population, they understood it to have a more direct application to the politically active parts of the Tejano community.[tpl]cite web|last=De León|first=Arnoldo|title=Chicano|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pfc02|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=4 March 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
At certain points in the 1970s, "Chicano" was the preferred term for reference to Mexican-Americans, particularly in the scholarly literature.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] However, as the term became politicized, its use fell out of favor as a means of referring to the entire population. Since then, "Chicano" has tended to refer to politicized Mexican-Americans.
Sabine Ulibarri, an author from Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, once attempted to note that "Chicano" was a politically "loaded" term, although Ulibarri has recanted that assessment. "Chicano" is considered to be a positive term of honor by many.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

===Ambiguous identity===

The identity is seen as uncertain:
For Chicanos, the term usually implies being "neither from here, nor from there" in reference to the US and Mexico. As a mixture of cultures from both countries, being Chicano represents the struggle of being accepted into the Anglo-dominated society of the United States, while maintaining the cultural sense developed as a Latino-cultured, US-born Mexican child[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl].

===Indigenous identity===

The identity is seen as native to the land:

One theory is the origin of such terminology is from the Mayan temple Chichen Itza in the Yucatán Peninsula, a ruin of an ancient MesoAmerican civilization about 1,500 years ago. "Chicano" may be a Hispanized word for "Chichen" or the Mayan descendants, not limited to Aztec descendants or Nahuatl people.
But essentially Chicanos, like some Mexicans, are Mestizo Indians who were influenced by the Spanish/European culture through conquest, while Latino or Hispanic refers to race/genetics. Therefore Latinos are Americans who are descendants of the Latin group (namely Spain and Portugal) and Hispanic refers to the descendants from the Iberian Peninsula (also known as Ibero-American particularly Spain and Portugal).

Reies Tijerina was a vocal claimant to the rights of Hispanics and Mexican Americans, and he remains a major figure of the early Chicano Movement.

===Historic origins===

The earliest known record of "Chicano" was thought to be in the late 19th or turn of the 20th century in Northwest Indiana. Mexican factory workers and railroad crews first arrived in the area and used the term among themselves, probably to mean working man. But in the Spanish language, the words Chico (small) -a-no (man) stands for "the little people".

===Term of derision===

Long a disparaging term in Mexico, the term "Chicano" gradually transformed from a class-based term of derision to one of ethnic pride and general usage within Mexican-American communities, beginning with the rise of the Chicano movement in the 1960s. In their Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia, Vicki Ruíz and Virginia Sánchez report that demographic differences in the adoption of the term existed; because of the prior vulgar connotations, it was more likely to be used by males than females, and as well, less likely to be used among those in a higher socioeconomic status. Usage was also generational, with the more assimilated third-generation members (again, more likely male) likely to adopt the usage. This group was also younger, of more radical persuasion, and less-connected to a Mexican cultural heritage.Vicki L. Ruiz & Virginia Sanchez Korrol, editors. Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. Indiana University Press, 2006.Maria Herrera-Sobek. Chicano folklore; a handbook. Greenwood Press 2006.
In his essay "Chicanismo" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures (2002), Jose Cuellar dates the transition from derisive to positive to the late 1950s, with a usage by young Mexican-American high school students.José B. Cuéllar. CHICANISMO/XICANISM@. In: Davíd Carrasco, Editor-in-Chief. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures: The Civilizations of Mexico and Central America, Oxford University Press, 2002
Outside of Mexican American communities, the term might assume a negative meaning if it is used in a manner that embodies the prejudices and bigotries long directed at Mexican and Mexican-American people in the United States. For example, in one case, a prominent Chicana feminist writer and poet has indicated the following subjective meaning through her creative work.

Ana Castillo has referred to herself as a Chicana, and her literary work reflects that she primarily considers the term to be a positive one of self-determination and political solidarity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Bios/entries/castillo_ana.html |title=VG: Artist Biography: Castillo, Ana |publisher=Voices.cla.umn.edu |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.speakingofstories.org/Author%20Bios/anna_castillo.htm |title=Anna Castillo |publisher=Speakingofstories.org |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl]Ana Castillo[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ769174&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ769174 |title=The Chicana Subject in Ana Castillo's Fiction and the Discursive Zone of Chicana/o Theory |publisher=Eric.ed.gov |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anacastillo.com/a/index.php?page_id=6 |title=anacastillo.com » Bio |publisher=Anacastillo.com |accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl]
The Mexican archeologist and anthropologist Manuel Gamio reported in 1930 that the term "chicamo" (with an "m") was used as a derogatory term used by Hispanic Texans for recently arrived Mexican immigrants displaced during the Mexican revolution in the beginning of the early 20th century. At this time, the term "Chicano" began to reference those who resisted total assimilation, while the term "Pochos" referred (often pejoratively) to those who strongly advocated assimilation.See: Adalberto M. Guerrero, Macario Saldate, IV, and Salomon R. Baldenegro.  "Chicano: the term and its meanings."  A Paper Written for Hispanic Heritage Month. Arizona Association of Chicanos for Higher Education 1999 conference Newsletter.
In Mexico, which by American standards would be considered classist or racist, the term is associated with a Mexican-American person of low importance class and poor morals. The term "Chicano" is widely known and used in Mexico.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]

When it comes to the use of loanwords, pay attention to the fact that unlike e.g. French, Iberian orthographies do not use uppercase for non-name nouns, such as those used for nationalities or ethnic groups, of whatever sort – even the originally English neologism theme for this article is best written with lowercase as [tpl]lang|es|chicano/chicana[/tpl] in formal orthography of Spanish and other languages such as Portuguese and Catalan.
Some of them might be used more commonly in English and others in Spanish: e.g. one says to be a Mexican in a mixed American context, in which English would generally be expected, and to be of the white segment of the ethnic Mexican population in a Mexican and Mexican-American context, in which one can use their own vernacular language, in the case Spanish.
Anyone from the United States is referred in Spanish as [tpl]lang|es|norteamericano[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|es|estadounidense[/tpl], given how in many languages other than English, Romance languages conserved the former standard formerly shared with English of counting the entire New World as a single continent – as was the consensus in the Age of Discovery – and to Spanish- and Portuguese-speakers in the Americas, they are just as American (wider sense) as someone from Belgium would be European (geological validation of the current English norm is bound by controversies and potential inconsistency, so the best explanation for both cases is indeed mere tradition).There are generally three separations of what Romance language speakers regard as the American continent, the terminology in Spanish being [tpl]lang|es|norte[/tpl] (including Mexico), [tpl]lang|es|centro[/tpl] (including the West Indies) and [tpl]lang|es|sur[/tpl], with the middle element not being regarded as particularly bounded to either (plate tectonic border would be more of an evidence for them to be tied to the South one; both the former isthmus that gave rise to the West Indies and the current isthmus are volcanic arcs from plate interactions separate from the North/South dynamic, so their early geological "belonging" to a side are of little relevance).
[tpl]lang|es|Norteño[/tpl] refers to the Mexicans of Northern Mexico as opposed to [tpl]lang|es|sureño[/tpl]. Mexican-Americans do not refer to their shared identity as [tpl]lang|es|norteños[/tpl]. The only people who identify themselves as such are Mexicans from Northern Mexico which represents the whiter and relatively wealthier half of Mexico, compared to [tpl]lang|es|sureños[/tpl] or southern Mexicans, more related in descent to the original Indigenous peoples of the continent and thus being the ones to actually have greater likelihood for an identity a bit closer to the Chicano one. In no way or fashion does any sort of mainstream Spanish language discourse treat the American Southwest as a contemporary part of Mexico (cultural, identitarian or otherwise), and the indigenist Chicano nationalism is hardly related at all to non-American Mexican desire for reconquering, an irredentist narrative of what might be perceived as a colonial state and collective mentality.

==Social aspects==

Chicanos, regardless of their generational status, tend to connect their culture to the indigenous peoples of North America and to a nation of Aztlán. According to the Aztec legend, Aztlán is a region; Chicano nationalists have equated it with the Southwestern United States.
Some historians may place Aztlán in Nayarit or the Caribbean while other historians entirely disagree, and make a distinction between legend and the contemporary socio-political ideology.

==Political aspects==

Many currents came together to produce the revived Chicano political movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Early struggles were against school segregation, but the Mexican-American cause, or "La Causa" as it was called, soon came under the banner of the United Farm Workers and César Chávez. However, Corky Gonzales and Reies Tijerina stirred up old tensions about New Mexican land claims with roots going back to before the Mexican-American War. Simultaneous movements like the Young Lords, to empower youth, question patriarchy, democratize the Church, end police brutality, and end the Vietnam War, all intersected with other ethnic nationalist, peace, countercultural, and feminist movements.
Sim Chicanismo covers a wide array of political, religious and ethnic beliefs, and not everybody agrees with what exactly a Chicano is, most new Latino immigrants see it as a lost cause, as a lost culture, because Chicanos do not identify with Mexico or wherever their parents migrated from as new immigrants do. Chicanoism is an appreciation of a historical movement, but also is used by many to bring a new revived politicized feeling to voters young and old in the defense of Mexican and Mexican-American rights. People descended from Aztlan (both in the contemporary U.S. and in Mexico) use the Chicano ideology to create a platform for fighting for immigration reform and equality for all people.

===Rejection of borders===

For some, Chicano ideals involve a rejection of borders. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo transformed the Rio Grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the United States government. At the end of the Mexican-American War, 80,000 Spanish-Mexican-Indian people were forced into sudden U.S. habitation.[ref]
