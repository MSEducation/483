==Life==

Halsey was born in Yonkers, New York, and attended Skidmore College. In 1933, editor and author Max Eastman hired her as his secretary. With his help, she became an entry-level employee at Simon & Schuster.
She and Henry Simon married in 1935 and soon moved to Devon, England. Her letters to American relatives and friends inspired her brother-in-law, the publisher Richard L. Simon, to ask that she write what would become With Malice Toward Some. Halsey and Henry Simon divorced in 1944. A later marriage to Milton R. Stern ended in divorce in 1969. Their daughter, Deborah, survived both her parents despite brain cancer.
Halsey's struggles with agoraphobia and alcoholism were the focus of her 1977 book, No Laughing Matter: The Autobiography of a WASP.
She died in a nursing home in White Plains, New York.
