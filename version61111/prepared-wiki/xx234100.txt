==Background and writing==

The song was written by Ladyhawke and Pascal Gabriel. Ladyhawke wrote the song when she first went to London and she didn't know anyone. She describes it as a fantasy epic where she has someone and she is trying to coax them over to talk to her, where in reality she felt alone. She also says it is a love song, but also a 'pining' song.NME Video: Ladyhawke - Track by Track
