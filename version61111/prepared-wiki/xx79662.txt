Trapeze is the 1970 debut rock album by the band Trapeze. The album was produced by John Lodge, of Moody Blues fame. The sound on this particular album is a far cry from the blues-based hard rock the band would become well known for. 
The band released another album also named Trapeze in 1976; see Trapeze (1976 album).
