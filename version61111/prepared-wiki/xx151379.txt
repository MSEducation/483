"Squeeze Box" is a song by The Who. It peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart and number 16 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was also a number 1 hit in Australia and Canada and reached number 2 on the Irish charts. "Squeezebox" is a slang term for accordions and related instruments. The song's lyrics consist mostly of sexual innuendo ("She goes in and out and in and out", as an example). Written by Pete Townshend, the song was originally intended for a Who television special planned in 1974.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/ByNumbers.html |title=The Hypertext Who : Liner Notes : The Who By Numbers |publisher=Thewho.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl]

[tpl]cquote| ...Actually, that was Rikki’s idea. When we came into rehearsals...to break the ice for the new record...before we started fightin’ and arguin’ about songs, we went through a list of covers and remakes. ...It was the song that stuck and I think it fits perfectly for our band. It has a great melody and a great vocal, but it's also kinda sparse and undefined...it was kinda like an open palette for us.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
