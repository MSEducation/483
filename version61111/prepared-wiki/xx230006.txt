The Airmount Grave Shelter, also known as the Hope Family Grave Shelter is a brick grave shelter, or grave house, located in the Airmount Cemetery near Thomasville, Alabama.  It is unusual in that it protects six graves instead of the more common one grave.  The brick structure was built in 1853 by John Hope.  It is built in a vernacular Greek Revival style with a gabled roof.  The interior features a wooden vaulted ceiling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500005.pdf|title=Clarke County MPS|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]  The shelter was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 24, 2000 as a part of the Clarke County Multiple Property Submission.
