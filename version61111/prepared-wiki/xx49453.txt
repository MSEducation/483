Rapeseed (Brassica napus), also known as rape, oilseed rape, rapa, rappi, rapaseed (and, in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola), is a bright yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family). The name derives from the Latin for turnip, rāpa or rāpum, and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century. Older writers usually distinguished the turnip and rape by the adjectives round and long (-rooted), respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |title=OED Online |publisher=Dictionary.oed.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl] Rutabagas, Brassica napobrassica are sometimes considered a variety of Brassica napus. Some botanists also include the closely related Brassica campestris within B. napus.
Brassica napus is cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, the third largest source of vegetable oil in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/Current/ |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade | USDA FAS |publisher=Fas.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl]

==Common names==

Brassica napus is known by many common names in the English language. Some names have only been applied to certain subspecies (subsp.), forms (f.), or varieties (var.) of B. napus. Note that Brassica napus = Brassica napus subsp. napus = Brassica napus subsp. napus f. napus; they are equivalents.
The following list is from the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN), which attributes the names to other sources:

==Cultivation and uses==

Rapeseed oil was produced in the 19th century as a source of a lubricant for steam engines.  It was less useful as food for animals or humans because it has a bitter taste due to high levels of glucosinolates. Varieties have now been bred to reduce the content of glucosinolates, yielding a more palatable oil.  This has had the side effect that the oil contains much less erucic acid.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Rapeseed is grown for the production of animal feed, vegetable oil for human consumption, and biodiesel; leading producers include the European Union, Canada, the United States, Australia, China and India. In India, it is grown on 13% of cropped land.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] According to the United States Department of Agriculture, rapeseed was the third leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after soybean and oil palm, and also the world's second leading source of protein meal, although only one-fifth of the production of the leading soybean meal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
World production is growing rapidly, with FAO reporting 36 million tons of rapeseed were produced in the 2003-2004 season, and estimating 58.4 million tons in the 2010-2011 season.http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf In Europe, rapeseed is primarily cultivated for animal feed,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] owing to its very high lipid and medium protein content.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Natural rapeseed oil contains 50% erucic acid. Wild type seeds also contain high levels of glucosinolates (mustard oil glucosindes), chemical compounds that significantly lowered the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed. In North America, the term "canola" — a contraction of Canada and ola, for "oil"[tpl]cite web|last=Canola Council of Canada|title=What is Canola?|url=http://www.canolacouncil.org/oil-and-meal/what-is-canola/|accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] — is widely used to refer to rapeseed, and is now a tradename for "double low" (low erucic acid and low glucosinolate) rapeseed.Canola-quality Brassica juncea, a new oilseed crop for the Canadian prairies. DA Potts, GW Rakow, DR Males — New Horizons for an old crop. Proc 10th Intl Rapeseed Congr, Canberra, Australia, 1999 The rapeseed is the valuable, harvested component of the crop. The crop is also grown as a winter-cover crop. It provides good coverage of the soil in winter, and limits nitrogen run-off. The plant is ploughed back in the soil or used as bedding. On some organic operations, livestock such as sheep or cattle are allowed to graze on the plants.
Processing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soya.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]  The feed is mostly employed for cattle feeding, but also for pigs and chickens (though less valuable for these). The meal has a very low content of the glucosinolates responsible for metabolism disruption in cattle and pigs.Soyatech LLC, http://www.soyatech.com/rapeseed_facts.htm, Soyatech is a company established in 1985 and publisher of the Soya and Oilseeds Blue Book  Neither canola nor soy is recommended as feed for organic animal products, as both are predominantly genetically modified, especially in America (some estimates are now at 90%), which is prohibited by organic standards.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Rapeseed "oil cake" is also used as a fertilizer in China, and may be used for ornamentals, such as bonsai, as well.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Rapeseed leaves and stems are also edible, similar to those of the related bok choy or kale. Some varieties of rapeseed (called 油菜, yóu cài, lit. "oil vegetable" in Chinese; yau choy in Cantonese; cải dầu in Vietnamese; phak kat kan khao ผักกาดก้านขาว in Thai; and nanohana 菜の花/nabana 菜花 in Japanese) are sold as greens, primarily in Asian groceries, including those in California, where it is known as yao choy or tender greens.  They are eaten as sag (spinach) in Indian and Nepalese cuisine, usually stir-fried with salt, garlic and spices.
Rapeseed produces great quantities of nectar, and honeybees produce a light-colored but peppery honey from it.  It must be extracted immediately after processing is finished, as it will otherwise quickly granulate in the honeycomb and will be impossible to extract.  The honey is usually blended with milder honeys, if used for table use or sold as bakery grade.  Rapeseed growers contract with beekeepers for the pollination of the crop.
"Total loss" chain and bar oil for chainsaws have been developed which are typically 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil. These lubricants are claimed to be less harmful to the environment and less hazardous to users than traditional mineral oil products,[tpl]cite web|author=Cristina Gauthier |url=http://www.ehow.co.uk/facts_7516010_chainsaw-chain-oil-substitute.html |title=Homemade Winter Oil for a Chain Saw Bar |publisher=eHow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl] although they are currently typically two to five times more expensive, leading some to use inexpensive cooking oil instead. Some countries, such as Austria, have banned the use of petroleum-based chainsaw oil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/html/98511316/98511316.html |title=Vegetable Oil For Lubricating Chain Saws |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl] These "biolubricants" are generally reported to be functionally comparable to traditional mineral oil products, with some reports claiming one or other is superior, but with no consensus yet evident.
Rapeseed has also been researched as means of containing radionuclides that contaminated the soil after the Chernobyl disaster.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tc.iaea.org/tcweb/news_archive/Chernobyl/ecoreserve/default.asp |title=Ecological reservation in Belarus fosters new approaches to soil remediation |author=Smith, Marilyn |publisher=IAEA |date=2004-01-29 |accessdate=2012-10-2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/Environment/20101112/161299613.html |title=Ukraine mulls growing crops in Chernobyl nuke disaster zone |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/return-to-the-fields-of-chernobyl-2137071.html |title=Return to the fields of Chernobyl |author=Walker, Shaun |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl] It was discovered by researchers at the Belarusian Research Institute for Soil Science and Agrochemistry that rapeseed has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides goes into the parts of the plant that could potentially enter the food chain. As oil repels radionuclides, canola oil free from contaminants being concentrated in other parts of the plant could be produced.  The rest of the plant (straw, roots, seed pods, etc.) could then be recycled by ploughing back into the soil.

==Biodiesel==

Rapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as biodiesel, straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel diesel in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agricommodityprices.com/mustard_seed.php |title=Mustard Seed Rapeseed Canola, Mustard Seed Oil |publisher=Agricommodityprices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl] partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower gel point than most other vegetable oils. 66% of total rapeseed oil supply in the European Union was expected to be used for biodiesel production in the 2010-2011 year.
Rapeseed is currently grown with a high level of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates N2O. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N2O.[tpl]cite web|author=Marlo Lewis |url=http://www.openmarket.org/2007/11/12/biofuel-mandates-cause-global-warming-scientists-say/ |title=Biofuel mandates cause global warming, scientists say |publisher=Openmarket.org |date=2007-11-12 |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl]

==Cultivars==

Canola was originally a trademark, but is now a generic term in North America for edible varieties of rapeseed oil. In Canada, an official definition of canola is codified in Canadian law.
Rapeseed oil had a distinctive taste and a greenish colour due to the presence of chlorophyll. It also contained a high concentration[tpl]specify|date=April 2012[/tpl] of erucic acid. 
A variety of rapeseed developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. This and other recent varieties have been produced by using genetic engineering. In 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were GM (genetically modified), herbicide-tolerant canola varieties.Beckie, Hugh et al (Autumn 2011) GM Canola: The Canadian Experience Farm Policy Journal, Volume 8 Number 8, Autumn Quarter 2011, Retrieved 20 August 2012

==Health effects==

Rapeseed oil is one of the oldest vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to cardiac muscle, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.[tpl]cite book | pages = 37–40 | last = O'Brien | first = R | title = Fats and Oils Formulating and Processing for Applications, Third Edition: Formulating and Processing for Applications | isbn = 1420061666 | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2008 [/tpl] Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.[tpl]cite doi | 10.1007/BF02672436 [/tpl]  Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been generally recognized as safe by the United States Food and Drug Administration.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1555 | title = CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 | date = 2010-04-01 [/tpl]  Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA and 5% in the EU,[tpl]cite journal | author = The Commission of the European Communities | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L0891:EN:HTML | title = Commission Directive 80/891/EEC of 25 July 1980 relating to the Community method of analysis for determining the erucic acid content in oils and fats intended to be used as such for human consumption and foodstuffs containing added oils or fats| journal = EurLex Official Journal | volume = 254 | year = 1980 [/tpl] with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human neonates.
In 1981, a deadly outbreak of disease in Spain, known as toxic oil syndrome,[tpl]DorlandsDict|nine/100019316|Spanish toxic oil syndrome[/tpl] was caused by the consumption of colza oil (a cousin of rapeseed oil procured from a similar species of rapa) for industrial use that was fraudulently sold as olive oil to be consumed in cooking, salads, & other food related uses. Symptoms appeared as a typical pneumonia with interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray, complicated by pulmonary hypertension in a significant number of cases.[tpl]cite pmid | 11590841 [/tpl]
Rapeseed pollen contains known allergens.[tpl]cite doi | 10.1159/000053806[/tpl][tpl]cite doi |10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00094.x[/tpl] Whether rape pollen causes hay fever has not been well established, because rape is an insect-pollinated (entomophilous) crop, whereas hay fever is usually caused by wind-pollinated plants. The inhalation of oilseed rape dust may cause asthma in agricultural workers.[tpl]cite pmid | 9761021 [/tpl]

==Production==

Worldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production is thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10 Every ton of rapeseed yields about 400 kg of oil.

==Genome sequencing and genetics==

Bayer Cropscience (in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen, China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands and the University of Queensland, Australia) announced it had sequenced the entire genome of Brassica napus and its constituent genomes present in Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea in 2009.  The "A" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species B. napus is currently being sequenced by the Multinational Brassica Genome Project.[tpl]Update after|2010|11|16[/tpl]

===GMO (genetically modified organism) controversy===

The Monsanto Company has genetically engineered new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its herbicide, Roundup. They have sought compensation from farmers found to have the Roundup Ready gene in canola in their fields without paying a license fee. These farmers have claimed the Roundup Ready gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claim that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, Roundup Ready volunteers are left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.
In a closely followed legal battle, the Supreme Court of Canada found in favor of Monsanto's patent infringement claim for unlicensed growing of Roundup Ready in its 2004 ruling on Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser.  The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimation for the global patent protection of genetically modified crops. However, Schmeiser was not required to pay damages, as he did not benefit financially from the GMO crop in his field.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
In March 2008, an out-of-court settlement between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of approximately $660.[tpl]cite news | first=Matt | last=Hartley | title=Grain Farmer Claims Moral Victory in Seed Battle Against Monsanto | date=2008-03-20 | publisher= | url =http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/03/20/7784 | work =Globe and Mail | accessdate = 2011-08-30 [/tpl]
