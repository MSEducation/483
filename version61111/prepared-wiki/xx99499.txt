==Album details==

After the release of The Byrds' album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Gram Parsons left The Byrds on the eve of a South African tour. Chris Hillman, the group's bass player, soon left as well and eventually joined Parsons in a new band, The Flying Burrito Brothers, as guitarist.
Their first album as The Flying Burrito Brothers was The Gilded Palace of Sin. Most of the songs were written by Parsons and Hillman at a house in the San Fernando Valley dubbed "Burrito Manor." The two R&B standards covered on the album, "Dark End of the Street" and "Do Right Woman", are examples of a country-soul fusion that Parsons would often refer to as "cosmic American music."
"My Uncle" and "Hippie Boy" address then-contemporary countercultural concerns: the draft and the 1968 Democratic National Convention riots. Rather than playing in an orthodox fashion, pedal steel guitarist "Sneaky" Pete Kleinow often utilized a fuzzbox and/or played the instrument through a rotating Hammond Leslie amplifier, adding a psychedelic touch to several songs.
"Sin City", co-written by Hillman and Parsons, called a "loping lament" and a "cautionary dirge", mentions The Byrds's manager Larry Spector ("a gold plated door") and Robert F. Kennedy ("tried to clean up this town").Boucher, Geoff (2007). "'Sin City' The Flying Burrito Brothers - 1969", LATimes.com.

==Influence==

Like Sweetheart of the Rodeo, The Gilded Palace of Sin was not a commercial success. To date, the RIAA has not certified it gold. However, its impact on popular music has grown over the years, influencing, for example, the Eagles. During the 1980s, the New Traditionalist movement in mainstream country music was influenced by The Gilded Palace of Sin, with artists such as Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and Randy Travis.
Today, The Gilded Palace of Sin continues to influence the alternative-country movement, often referred to as "alt-country." Bands like Wilco, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, and the Jayhawks, as well as such musicians as Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris (Parsons' one-time singing partner), and Steve Earle all have recorded music that bears traces of The Gilded Palace of Sin. Non-country artists like Elvis Costello have cited the album as a particular favorite, with Costello covering several cuts during his career.
For many years, the album was never reissued in its entirety on compact disc in the United States. However, in 2000 the complete album was reissued as part of a two-disc set, Hot Burritos! The Flying Burrito Brothers Anthology 1969â€“1972. In 2002, a new mastering was issued on a single-disc release Sin City: The Very Best of the Flying Burrito Brothers, which packaged The Gilded Palace of Sin with its successor, Burrito Deluxe, as well as a few outtakes from the same period. 
In 2003 the album was ranked number 192 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
