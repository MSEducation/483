CoolWebSearch (also known as CoolWWWSearch or abbreviated as CWS) is a spyware or virus program that installs itself on Microsoft Windows based computers. It first appeared in May 2003.

==Effects==

CoolWebSearch has numerous effects when it is successfully installed on a user's computer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Spyware%3AWin32%2FCoolwebsearch.H |title=Encyclopedia entry: Spyware:Win32/Coolwebsearch.H |publisher=Microsoft Malware Protection Center[/tpl] The program can change an infected computer's web browser homepage to coolwebsearch.com, and although originally thought to only work on Internet Explorer, recent variants affect Mozilla Firefox as well as others like Google Chrome. It can also create pop-up ads that redirect to other websites including pornography sites, collect private information about users and slow the speed of infected computers. 
CoolWebSearch uses various techniques to evade detection and removal, and as such many common spyware removal programs fail to properly remove the software.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/expert/russel_infectedpc.mspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100927110809/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/expert/russel_infectedpc.mspx |archivedate=September 27, 2010 |title=Dealing with an infected PC |first=Charlie |last=Russel |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 13, 2005 |quote=...many of the Cool Web Search variants can prevent the other anti-spyware programs from doing their job correctly...[/tpl] Since it's bundled with many other potentially unwanted software or add-ons, users need to uninstall those unwanted programs first, or else CoolWebSearch can come back even after they have changed their home page and search engine provider.
Some versions of CoolWebSearch are installed through drive-by installation, in which browsing an infected webpage can automatically install CoolWebSearch without the user's knowledge. CoolWebSearch attempts to evade detection by not labelling its ads, not providing an EULA, not providing any data about itself and not having a website. Certain variants insert links on random text, leading to advertiser websites.  Other attempts to access websites are redirected to pay-per-click search engines that may install more malware display ads. Some variants of CoolWebSearch also add links to pornography and gambling sites to the user's Desktop, Internet Explorer's bookmarks and history.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spywareloop.com/infections/c/coolwebsearch|title=CoolWebSearch in SpyWareLoop.com|author=  Vincentas |newspaper=Spyware Loop |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl] Certain versions attempt to edit users' trusted sites and modify security settings as well as to hide from removal programs.  Variants are often named for the effects they have such as msconfig, Msoffice, Mupdate, Msinfo and Svchost32.
