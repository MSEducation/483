===National Information Points===

Neither Albania nor Bosnia and Herzegovina are full members of EUREKA; however, R&D companies from those countries can address a National Information Point to receive funding through EUREKA. Several research projects put forward by participants from Albania and from Bosnia and Herzegovina have already been completed or are ongoing.

===Associated Countries===

Countries that are not within the geographical borders of Europe can join EUREKA as associated countries. The only associated countries are [tpl]nowrap|South-Korea,[/tpl] which joined in 2009, and Canada, which joined in 2012.

==Selected projects==

EUREKA Projects are numbered, preceded by 'E! '.

===Awards===

This was the EUREKA Environmental Award established in 1994 by the then Norwegian Chair, in the town whose name it bears. With this award, Eureka recognised the contribution made by a project to improving Europe's environment, developing sustainable solutions to the problems of waste and pollution.
The Lynx Award was established in 2001 during the Spanish Chairmanship to highlight fast-growing, high-tech SMEs which offer good prospects for private investors. Companies eligible for the Award indicated additional turnover (approx. 25%) resulting from participation in a EUREKA project or EUREKA Cluster sub-project. The winner receives €10,000 and the "EUSY" trophy (the EUREKA symbol embodying the spirit and challenge of innovation, introduced by the Hellenic chairmanship).

===Clusters===

EUREKA ‘Clusters’ are long-term, strategically significant industrial initiatives. They usually have a large number of participants, and aim to develop inclusive technologies of key importance for European competitiveness mainly in ICT, energy and more recently in the biotechnology and automation sectors. EUREKA Clusters are known to have had a particular impact on the ability of the European microelectronics sector to compete with other continents.

===Umbrellas===

Umbrellas are thematic networks within the EUREKA framework which focus on a specific technology area or business sector. The main goal of an umbrella is to facilitate the generation of EUREKA projects in its own target area.

===Eurostars===

EUREKA's Eurostars Programme is the first European funding and support programme to be specifically dedicated to research-performing SMEs. Eurostars has the goal of stimulating them to lead international collaborative research and innovation projects by easing access to support and funding.
A Eurostars project is any European R&D project addressing a civilian purposed technological area aimed at the development of a new product, process, or service.
Eurostars projects are collaborative efforts which must involve at least two separate participants from different Eurostars participating countries, and the main participant must be a research-performing SME from the list of member countries to join before mid-2002.
The programme also requires that the SME participants have a significant role, contributing at least 50% of the project's core activity (with some allowance for minor contracting); and that it be a well balanced collaboration with no single participant or country being expected to contribute more than 75% of the total investment.
Eurostars projects are also limited to a maximum duration of three years, with the funded research's market launch occurring within two years of project completion; or, in the case of biomedical or medical projects, starting clinical trials within two years of project completion.
