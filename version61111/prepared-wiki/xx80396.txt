A Cuban sandwich is a variation of a ham and cheese originally created in cafes catering to Cuban workers in the early Cuban immigrant communities of Florida: Key West"Sink teeth into quest for best Cuban sandwich" - The Miami Herald, 15 August 2010 and Ybor City, Tampa.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cigarcitymagazine.com/articles/food/item/welcome-to-cuban-sandwich-city |title= Welcome to Cuban Sandwich City |author= Andrew Huse |work= Cigar City Magazine, Volume 1, Issue 2 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://icuban.com/food/cuban_sandwich.html |title= Sandwich Cubano / Cuban Sandwich |author= Three Guys From Miami |work= iCuban website |date= undated [/tpl] Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami[tpl]cite web |url= http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/CubanSandwich.htm |title= History of Cuban Sandwich, Cubano Sandwich |author= Linda Stradley |work= What's Cooking America website |date= © 2004 [/tpl] where it is also still very popular.

==History==

As with Cuban bread, the origin of the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a "Cuban mix", a "mixto", a "Cuban pressed sandwich", or a "Cubano"Cuban Sandwich Wars Inflame Passions In Tampa And Miami | Florida Vacation, Tourism, Travel & Entertainment Information - VISITFLORIDA.com) is murky and somewhat controversial.[tpl]cite web |url= http://savannahnow.com/node/721683 |title= Love at first bite: A great sandwich |author= Damon Lee Fowler |work= Savannah Morning News[/tpl]Tampa claims the Cuban sandwich as its own, but Miami begs to differ - Tampa Bay Times In the late 1800s and early 1900s, travel between Cuba and Florida was easy, especially from Key West and Tampa, and Cubans frequently sailed back and forth for employment, pleasure, and family visits. Because of this constant and largely undocumented movement of people and culture and ideas, it's impossible to say exactly when or where the Cuban sandwich originated.
It is believed by some that the sandwich was a common lunch food for workers in both the cigar factories and sugar mills of Cuba (especially in big cities such as Havana or Santiago de Cuba) and the cigar factories of Key West by the 1860s. Historian Loy Glenn Westfall states that the sandwich was "born in Cuba and educated in Key West".
The cigar industry in Florida shifted to Tampa in the 1880s and the sandwich quickly appeared in workers' cafés in Ybor City and (later) West Tampa, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Cuban-Bread.htm |title= Cuban Bread: A History |work= Bread-Maker website [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A1907 |title= Viva El Cubano |author= Sara Kennedy |work= Creative Loafing Tampa |date= 14 August 2002 [/tpl]"Tampa history is traced in its sandwich" - The Tampa Tribune Historian Andrew Huse states that "the old 'mixtos' coalesced into something more distinct – the Cuban sandwiches we know and love – an original Tampa creation."
By the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami cafeteria and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after Fidel Castro's 1959 rise to power in their native land.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.landlmarketbistro.com/i/events/Herald_Tropical_Life_08-2007_article.pdf |title= Our search for a good Cuban sandwich takes a surprising turn |author= Enrique Fernandez |work= The Miami Herald |date= 9 August 2007 [/tpl]
The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them. Cuban sandwiches and variations thereof are now served in various Cuban exile communities in places such as New York, New Jersey, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, among others.

==Ingredients==

While there is some debate as to the contents of a "true" Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8-12 inches (20–30 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, and thinly-sliced dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted.
The main regional disagreement about the sandwich’s recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, Genoa salami  is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/18/TampaBay/To_each__his_own_sand.shtml |title= To each, his own sandwich |author= Thomas C.

When assembled, the sandwich can be toasted in a sandwich press called a plancha, which is similar to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The plancha both heats and compresses the sandwich, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the cheese is melted. It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving.

A very similar and popular sandwich is the medianoche or "midnight" sandwich, so named because of the sandwich's popularity as a staple served in Havana's night clubs right around or after midnight. It contains the same ingredients as a Cuban sandwich but is smaller and is made on soft bread made from a sweet yellow egg dough, similar to challah.Cuban Medianoche Sandwich recipe | Sweet Midnight Sandwich
The Mexican sandwich-like torta has a variation called "torta cubana" (Cuban torta), which includes a collection of different meats, usually all the ones available at the place where the torta is prepared.
