Zheng He (1371{–}1433), formerly romanized as Cheng Ho, was a Hui court eunuch, mariner, explorer, diplomat, and fleet admiral during China's early Ming Dynasty. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433.
As a favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whose usurpation he assisted, he rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing (the capital was later moved to Beijing by Yongle). These voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qihao's Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng HeLiang Qihao. "Zuguo Da Hanghaijia Zheng He Zhuan". 1904. [tpl]zh-icon[/tpl] in 1904.Hui Chun Hing. "Huangming Zuxun and Zheng He’s Voyages to the Western Oceans". Journal of Chinese Studies, No. 51 (July, 2010). Accessed 17 October 2012. A trilingual stele left by the navigator was discovered on the island of Sri Lanka shortly thereafter.

==Family==

Zheng He was the second son of a family from Kunyang,[tpl]refn|group=lower-alpha|It is located south of Kunming (Levathes 1996, 61).[/tpl] Yunnan.Levathes 1996, 61. He was originally born with the name Ma He. His family were Hui people. He had four sistersMills 1970, 5. and one older brother.
Zheng He was born into a Muslim family. However, his religious beliefs became all-embracing and eclectic in his adulthood.Ray 1987, 66.Dreyer 2007, 148. The Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that Zheng He's devotion to Tianfei (Mazu) (the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers) was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess' central role to the treasure fleet.Dreyer 2007, 148 & 150. "... The inscriptions ... devotion to Tianfei, the goddess of seafarers, had become the dominant strand in his eclectic religious heritage."
He was the great-great-great-grandson of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, a Persian who served in the administration of the Mongol Empire and was the Governor of Yunnan during the early Yuan Dynasty.Shih-Shan Henry Tsai: Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle. University of Washington Press 2002, ISBN 978-0-295-98124-6, p. 38 ([tpl]Google books|aU5hBMxNgWQC|restricted online copy|page=38[/tpl])Chunjiang Fu, Choo Yen Foo, Yaw Hoong Siew: The great explorer Cheng Ho.

Asiapac Books Pte Ltd 2005, ISBN 978-981-229-410-4, p. 7-8 ([tpl]Google books|VxJDSA80YcsC|restricted online copy|page=8[/tpl]) His great-grandfather was named Bayan and may have been stationed at a Mongol garrisons in Yunnan. His grandfather carried the title hajji.Dreyer 2007, 11.Levathes 1996, 61–62. His father had the surname Ma and the title hajji. The title suggest that they had made the pilgrimage to Mecca.
In the autumn of 1381, a Ming army invaded and conquered Yunnan, which was then ruled by the Mongol prince Basalawarmi, Prince of Liang. In 1381, Ma Hajji (Zheng He's father) died as a casualty of the hostilities between the Ming armies and Mongol forces. Dreyer (2007) states that Zheng He's father died at age 39 while resisting the Ming conquest. Levathes (1996) states Zheng He's father died at age 37, but it is unclear whether it was due to helping the Mongol army or due to just being caught in the onslaught of battle.Levathes 1996, 62. Wenming, the oldest son, would bury their father outside of Kunming.Levathes 1996, 62. In his capacity, Admiral Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honor of his father, which was composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on the Duanwu Festival of the 3rd year in the Yongle reign (1 June 1405).Levathes 1996, 62–63.

==Life==

===Early life and castration===

After the fall of Kunming in Yunnan, Zheng He, then only eleven years old,[tpl]contradiction-inline |reason=Dreyer (2007, 16) states that he entered Zhu Di's service at age 10; Levathes (1996, 58) states that he was captured at age 10.|date=February 2013[/tpl] was captured by the Ming-allied Muslim troops of Lan Yu and Fu Youde and castrated along with 380 other captives.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=MtPrTYuxL8Tk0QH-iNyrAQ&ct=result&id=CC5tAAAAMAAJ|title=Journal of Asian history, Volume 25|author=|editor=|year=1991|publisher=O. Harrassowitz.|edition=|location=|page=127|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]verifysource|date=October 2012[/tpl] Zheng He was captured by the Ming armies at Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Zheng He on a road and approached him to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Zheng He responded defiantly that he had jumped into a lake.Levathes 1996, 58. Afterwards, the general took him prisoner. The young Zheng He was soon castrated before being placed in servitude of the Prince of Yan. However, Levathes (1996) has stated that he was castrated in 1385.
He was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, Prince of Yan (the future Yongle Emperor).Dreyer 2007, 12 He was 10 years old when he entered into the service of the Prince of Yan. Zhu Di was eleven years older than Zheng He.Dreyer 2007, 18. Since 1380, the prince had been governing Beiping (the future Beijing), which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile Mongol tribes were situated. Zheng He would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier.Dreyer 2007, 16. He often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols.Levathes 1996, 64. On 2 March 1390, Zheng He accompanied Zhu Di when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory as the Mongol leader Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception.Levathes 1996, 64–66.
Eventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince. Zheng He was also known as "Sanbao" during the time of service in the household of the Prince of Yan.Levathes 1996, 63. This name was a reference to the Three Jewels (triratna) in Buddhism.Dreyer 2007, 12. He received a proper education while at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital Nanjing as the Hongwu Emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. Meanwhile, the Hongwu Emperor exterminated many of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north like the Prince of Yan.

===Adulthood and military career===

Zheng He's appearance as an adult was recorded: he was seven chi[tpl]refn|group=lower-alpha|A chi is thought to vary between 10.5 to 12 inches (Dreyer 2007, 19).[/tpl] tall, had a waist that was five chi in circumference, cheeks and a forehead that were high, a small nose, glaring eyes, teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells, and a voice that was as loud as a bell. It is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle.Dreyer 2007, 18–19.
The young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the Jianwen Emperor's hostility to his uncle's feudal bases prompted the 1399{–}1402 Jingnan Campaign which ended with the emperor's apparent death and the ascension of the Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the Yongle Emperor. In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince's son became the new heir apparent. By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor.Dreyer 2007, 19. However, Zhu Di's nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the Jianwen Emperor.Dreyer 2007, 20 In 1398, he issued a policy known as xiaofan, "reducing the feudatories", which entails eliminating all the princes by stripping their power and military forces.Levathes 1996, 67. In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew.Dreyer 2007, 21. In 1399, Zheng He successfully defended Beiping's city reservoir Zhenglunba against the imperial armies.Levathes 1996, 72–73. In January 1402, Zhu Di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital Nanjing.Levathes 1996, 70. Zheng He would be one of his commanders during this campaign.
In 1402, Zhu Di's armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into Nanjing on 13 July 1402. Zhu Di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later. After ascending the throne as the Yongle Emperor, he promoted Zheng He as the Grand Director (Taijian) of the Directorate of Palace Servants.Dreyer 2007, 21–22. During the New Year's day on 11 February 1404, the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname "Zheng" to him (his original name was still Ma He), because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir Zhenglunba against imperial forces in the Siege of Beiping of 1399,Dreyer 2007, 22–23.Levathes 1997, 72–73. Another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital Nanjing. It is believed that his choice to confer the surname "Zheng" was because the eunuch's horse had been killed during the battle at Zhenglunba near Beiping at the onset of his rebellion.Levathes 1996, 72.
He was initially[tpl]when|reason=at what stage of his life?|date=February 2012[/tpl] called Ma Sanbao: either [tpl]lang|zh|三寶[/tpl] (s [tpl]lang|zh|三宝[/tpl], lit. "Three Gifts") or [tpl]lang|zh|三保[/tpl] (lit. "Three Protections", both pronounced sān bǎo).Historical documents have both spelling. See e.g. Xiang Da ([tpl]lang|zh|向达[/tpl]),  《关于三宝太监下西洋的几种资料》("Regarding several kinds of historical materials on the expeditions of Eunuch Grand Director Sanbao to the Western Ocean"), in 《郑和研究百年论文选》(100 Years of Zheng He Studies: Selected Writings, ISBN 7-301-07154-X, p.10).
In the new administration, Zheng He served in the highest posts, as Grand DirectorEncyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture, p. 621. (2000)  Dorothy Perkins. Roundtable Press, New York. ISBN 0-8160-2693-9 (hc); ISBN 0-8160-4374-4 (pbk).Levathes 1996. 61-63. and later as Chief Envoy ([tpl]lang|zh|正使[/tpl], zhèngshǐ) during his sea voyages.
In 1424, Admiral Zheng He traveled to Palembang to confer an official seal[tpl]refn|group=lower-alpha|The Taizong Shilu 27 February 1424 entry reports that Zheng He was sent to deliver the seal, because the old seal was destroyed in a fire. The Xuanzong Shilu 17 September 1425 entry reports that Zhang Funama delivered a seal, because the old seal was destroyed in a fire. The later Mingshi compilers seem to have combined these accounts, remarking that Shi Jisun's succession was approved in 1424 and that a new seal was delivered in 1425, suggesting that only one seal was destroyed by fire. (Dreyer 2007, 96)[/tpl] and letter of appointment upon Shi Jisun, who was placed in the office of Pacification Commissioner.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95 & 136[/tpl]. The Taizong Shilu 27 Februari 1424 entry reports that Shi Jisun had sent Qiu Yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father Shi Jinqing, who was the Pacification Commissioner of Palembang, and was given permission from the Yongle Emperor.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95[/tpl]. On 7 September 1424, Zhu Gaozhi had inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=136–137[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Duyvendak|1938|loc=388[/tpl]. When Zheng He returned from Palembang, he found that the Yongle Emperor had died during his absence.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95 & 136–137[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Duyvendak|1938|loc=387[/tpl].
After the ascension of Zhu Di's son as the Hongxi Emperor, the ocean voyages were discontinued and Zheng He was instead appointed as Defender of Nanjing, the empire's southern capital. In that post, he was largely responsible for the completion of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, an enormous pagoda still described as a wonder of the world as late as the 19th century.
On 15 May 1426, the Xuande Emperor ordered the Directorate of Ceremonial to sent a letter to Zheng He to reprimand him for a transgression.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=141–142[/tpl]. Earlier, an official[tpl]refn|group=lower-alpha|Unnamed official who served as a Department Director under the Ministry of Works, who earlier had departed for Nanjing to supervise the renovation of government buildings and to reward the skilled workers (Dreyer 2007, 141).[/tpl] petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in Nanjing. The Xuande Emperor responded negatively to the official for placing the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves, but he realized that Zheng He and his associates had instigated the official. Dreyer (2007) noted that the nature of the emperor's words indicated that Zheng He's behaviour in this situation was the last straw, but that there's too little information about what had transpired beforehand. Nevertheless, the Xuande Emperor would eventually come to trust Zheng He.
In 1430, the new Xuande Emperor appointed Zheng He to command over a seventh and final expedition into the "Western Ocean" (Indian Ocean).Mills 1970, 6. In 1431, Zheng He was bestowed with the title "Sanbao Taijian".Mills 1970, 7.

==Death==

One theory is that Admiral Zheng He died in 1433. It may have happened during or shortly after the seventh voyage.[tpl]Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=165[/tpl]. Although, another theory is that Zheng He continued being the defender of Nanjing, ultimately dying in 1435.[tpl]Harvnb|Mills|1970|loc=6[/tpl].
In 1985, a Muslim-style tomb was built in Nanjing on the site of an earlier horseshoe-shape grave; it contains his clothes and headgear as his body was buried at sea.[tpl]cite book|first=2005|title=Zheng He's Voyages Down the Western Seas|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|page=45|editor=Lin (Chief Editor).

==Expeditions==

The Yuan Dynasty and expanding Sino-Arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded Chinese knowledge of the world: "universal" maps previously only displaying China and its surrounding seas began to expand further and further into the southwest with much more accurate depictions of the extent of Arabia and Africa. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions. The Yongle Emperor {–} disregarding the Hongwu Emperor's expressed wishes {–} designed them to establish a Chinese presence and impose imperial control over the Indian Ocean trade, impress foreign peoples in the Indian Ocean basin, and extend the empire's tributary system.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] It has also been inferred from passages in the History of Ming that the initial voyages were launched as part of the emperor's attempt to capture his escaped predecessor,Chang, Kuei-Sheng.

Zheng He was placed as the admiral in control of the huge fleet and armed forces that undertook these expeditions. Wang Jinghong was appointed his second in command. Preparations were thorough and wide-ranging, including the use of such numerous linguists that a foreign language institute was established at Nanjing.

While Zheng He's fleet was unprecedented, the routes were not. Zheng He's fleet was following long-established, well-mapped routes of trade between China and the Arabian peninsula employed since at least the Han Dynasty. This fact, along with the use of a more than abundant amount of crew members that were regular military personnel, leads some to speculate that these expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading China's power through expansion.[tpl]cite news |title=Book Review of Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405–1433|first=David A. |last=Graffe |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6e77ebc7-6b4e-4827-bf59-1136f1b39b63%40sessionmgr14&vid=4&hid=10 |work=Journal of Military History |accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl] During the Three Kingdoms Period, the king of Wu sent a diplomatic mission along the coast of Asia, which reached as far as the  Eastern Roman Empire.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  After centuries of disruption, the Song Dynasty restored large-scale maritime trade from China in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, reaching as far as the Arabian peninsula and East Africa.Deng 2005 When his fleet first arrived in Malacca, there was already a sizable Chinese community.

Zheng He generally sought to attain his goals through diplomacy, and his large army awed most would-be enemies into submission. But a contemporary reported that Zheng He "walked like a tiger" and did not shrink from violence when he considered it necessary to impress foreign peoples with China's military might.[tpl]cite book|title=Traditions and Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past |first1=Jerry H. |last1=Bentley |first2=Herbert |last2=Ziegler |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2007 |isbn=0-07-340693-7 |page=586[/tpl] He ruthlessly suppressed pirates who had long plagued Chinese and southeast Asian waters.

In 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor (r. 1424{–}1425), stopped the voyages during his short reign. Zheng He made one more voyage during the reign of Hongxi's son, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1426–1435) but, after that, the voyages of the Chinese treasure ship fleets were ended. Xuande believed his father's decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus "there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfather’s sending Zheng He to the Western Ocean." The voyages "were contrary to the rules stipulated in the Huang Ming Zuxun" ([tpl]lang|zh|皇明祖訓[/tpl]), the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the Hongwu Emperor:
 Some far-off countries pay their tribute to me at much expense and through great difficulties, all of which are by no means my own wish. Messages should be forwarded to them to reduce their tribute so as to avoid high and unnecessary expenses on both sides.Yen Ch'ung-chien. Ch'u-yü chou-chih lu, Vol. III, ch. 8, 25. National Palace Museum (Peiping), 1930. Op. cit. in Chang, 1974. 
They further violated longstanding Confucian principles. They were only made possible by (and therefore continued to represent) a triumph of the Ming's eunuch faction over the administration's scholar-bureaucrats. Upon Zheng He's death and his faction's fall from power, his successors sought to minimize him in official accounts, along with continuing attempts to destroy all records related to the Jianwen Emperor or the manhunt to find him.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hui Chun Hing|year=2010|title=Huangming zuxun and Zheng He’s Voyages to the Western Oceans (A Summary)|journal=Journal of Chinese Studies|volume=51|page=85|publisher=Institute of Chinese Studies|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.library.esc.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=15&sid=687b5ea4-cc23-448c-87df-43a8d06508c6%40sessionmgr15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=54558019|accessdate=11 May 2011[/tpl]
Although unmentioned in the official dynastic histories, Zheng He probably died during the treasure fleet's last voyage.

Zheng He led seven expeditions to the "Western" or Indian Ocean. Zheng He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms – including King Vira Alakeshwara of Ceylon, who came to China as a captive to apologize to the Emperor for offenses against his mission.
Zheng himself wrote of his travels:
 We have traversed more than 100,000 li of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds day and night, continued their course rapidly as a star, traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare...Tablet erected by Zheng He in Changle, Fujian Province, in 1432. Louise Levathes. 

==Sailing charts==

Zheng He's sailing charts were published in a book entitled the Wubei Zhi (A Treatise on Armament Technology) written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to Zheng He's and earlier voyages.[tpl]cite book|title=Chinese Marine Cartography: Sea Charts of Pre-Modern China|author=Mei-Ling Hsu|edition=Imago Mundi |volume=40, pp96-112|year=1988[/tpl] It was originally a strip map 20.5 cm by 560 cm that could be rolled up, but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 miles/inch in the Nanjing area to 215 miles/inch in parts of the African coast.[tpl]cite book| title=Ma Huan Ying Yai Sheng Lan: The overall survey of the ocean shores|author=Mills, J.V.|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl]
There is little attempt to provide an accurate 3-D representation; instead the sailing instructions are given using a 24-point compass system with a Chinese symbol for each point, together with a sailing time or distance, which takes account of the local currents and winds. Sometimes depth soundings are also provided. It also shows bays, estuaries, capes and islands, ports and mountains along the coast, important landmarks such as pagodas and temples, and shoal rocks. Of 300 named places outside China, more than 80% can be confidently located. There are also fifty observations of stellar altitude.

==Size of the ships==

Traditional and popular accounts of Zheng He's voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships, far larger than any other wooden ships in history. Some modern scholars consider these descriptions to be exaggerated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Chinese recordsDreyer (2007): 82–95 state that Zheng He's fleet sailed as far as East Africa. According to medieval Chinese sources, Zheng He commanded seven expeditions. The 1405 expedition consisted of 27,800 men and a fleet of 62 treasure ships supported by approximately 190 smaller ships.Dreyer (2007): 122–124[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_focus/2005-07/05/content_70352.htm |title=Briton charts Zheng He's course across globe |publisher=Chinaculture.org |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] The fleet included:
Six more expeditions took place, from 1407 to 1433, with fleets of comparable size.Dreyer (2007)
If the accounts can be taken as factual Zheng He's treasure ships were mammoth ships with nine masts, four decks, and were capable of accommodating more than 500 passengers, as well as a massive amount of cargo. Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts.Science and Civilization in China, Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Section 3, pp.460-470 Niccolò Da Conti, a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen 5 masted junks weighing about 2,000 tons.Science and Civilization in China, Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Section 3, p.452  There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as 600 feet.Taiwan: A New History, Murray A. Rubinstein, page 49, M. E. Sharp, 1999, ISBN 1-56324-815-8Chinese discoverers dwarfed European travels, Tony Weaver, IOL, 11 November 2002. On the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers along with the translator and diarist Gong Zhen.
The largest ships in the fleet, the Chinese treasure ships described in Chinese chronicles, would have been several times larger than any other wooden ship ever recorded in history, surpassing l'Orient, [tpl]convert|65|m|ft|1[/tpl] long, which was built in the late 18th century. The first ships to attain [tpl]convert|126|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls. Some scholars argue that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He's ship was [tpl]convert|450|ft|m|1[/tpl] in length, some estimating that they were [tpl]convert|390|–|408|ft|m|1[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|160|–|166|ft|m|1[/tpl] wide insteadWhen China Ruled the Seas, Louise Levathes, p.80 while others put them as small as [tpl]convert|200|–|250|ft|m|1[/tpl] in length, which would make them smaller than the equine, supply, and troop ships in the fleet.
One explanation for the seemingly inefficient size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely used by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the Yangtze for court business, including reviewing Zheng He's expedition fleet. The Yangtze river, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable by these treasure ships. Zheng He, a court eunuch, would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships, seaworthy or not. The main ships of Zheng He's fleet were instead 6 masted 2000-liao ships.Xin Yuanou: Guanyu Zheng He baochuan chidu de jishu fenxi (A Technical Analysis of the Size of Zheng He's Ships).

==Legacy==

===Imperial China===

In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors' official annals was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions {–} unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the injunctions of the dynastic founder {–} presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty.
State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen.
However, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the History of Ming records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years.

===Southeast Asia===

Among the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, Zheng He became the object of cult veneration.Geoffery Wade lecture Nov, 2012 Even some of his crew members who happened to stay in this or that port sometimes did as well, such as "Poontaokong" on Sulu.Tan Ta Sen & al. Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2009. ISBN 9812308377, 9789812308375. The temples of this cult {–} called after either of his names, Cheng Hoon or Sam Po {–} are peculiar to overseas Chinese except for a single temple in Hongjian originally constructed by a returned Filipino Chinese in the Ming dynasty and rebuilt by another Filipino Chinese after the original was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. (The same village of Hongjian, in Fujian's Jiaomei township, is also the ancestral home of Corazon Aquino.)
The oldest and most important Chinese temple in Malacca is the 17th-century Cheng Hoon Teng, dedicated to Guanyin. During Dutch colonial rule, the head of the Cheng Hoon Temple was appointed chief over the community's Chinese inhabitants.
Following Zheng He's arrival, the sultan and sultana of Malacca visited China at the head of over 540 of their subjects, bearing ample tribute. Sultan Mansur Shah (r. 1459{–}1477) later dispatched Tun Perpatih Putih as his envoy to China, carrying a letter from the sultan to the Ming emperor. The letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage. Malay (but not Chinese) annals record that, in the year 1459, a princess named Hang Li Po or Hang Liu was sent from China to marry the sultan. The princess came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage. They eventually settled in Bukit Cina. It is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace, creating the descendants now known as the Peranakan.[tpl]cite book|last=Jin|first=Shaoqing|title=Zheng He's Voyages down the Western Seas|editor=Office of the People's Goverernment of Fujian Province|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|location=Fujian, China|year=2005|page=58|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QmpkR6l5MaMC&pg=PA58|accessdate=2 August 2009 | isbn=978-7-5085-0708-8[/tpl] Owing to this supposed lineage, the Peranakan still use special honorifics: Baba for the men and Nyonya for the women.
Indonesian Chinese have established temples to Zheng He in Jakarta, Cirebon, Surabaya, and Semarang.
In 1961, the Indonesian Islamic leader and scholar Hamka credited Zheng He with an important role in the development of Islam in Indonesia.Wang, Rosey Ma. "Chinese Muslims in Malaysia, History and Development".[tpl]unreliablesource-inline|date=October 2012[/tpl] The Brunei Times credits Zheng He with building Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language.[tpl]cite news|last=AQSHA|first=DARUL|title=Zheng He and Islam in Southeast Asia|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/07/13/zheng-he-and-islam-southeast-asia|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=The Brunei Times|date=13 July 2010[/tpl] This Chinese Muslim community was led by Hajji Yan Ying Yu, who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names. The Chinese trader Sun Long even supposedly adopted the son of the king of Majapahit and his Chinese wife, a son who went on to become Raden Patah.Li Tong Cai. Indonesia {–} Legends and Facts. Op. Cit. "Wali Songo: The Nine Walis".[tpl]unreliablesource-inline|date=October 2012[/tpl] Amid this assimilation (and loss of contact with China itself), the Hanafi Islam became absorbed by the local Shafi'i school and the presence of distinctly ethnic Chinese Muslims dwindled to almost nothing.[tpl]cite book | author=Suryadinata Leo| title=Admiral Zheng He & Southeast Asia | publisher=Singapore Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | year=2005 | isbn = 981-230-329-4| nopp=http://www.infobold.com/ChinaBooks/search.cfm?UR=26121&search_stage=details&records_to_display=50&this_book_number=10[/tpl][tpl]verifysource|date=October 2012[/tpl] The Malay Annals also record a number of Hanafi mosques {–} in Semarang and Ancol, for instance {–} were converted directly into temples of the Zheng He cult during the 1460s and '70s.

===Modern scholarship===

In the 1950s, historians such as John Fairbank and Joseph Needham popularized the idea that after Zheng He's voyages China turned away from the seas due to the Haijin edict and was isolated from European technological advancements. Modern historians point out that Chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after Zheng He, that Chinese ships continued to participate in Southeast Asian commerce until the 19th century, and that active Chinese trading with India and East Africa continued long after the time of Zheng. Moreover revisionist historians such as Jack Goldstone argue that the Zheng He voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of China. Although the Ming Dynasty did ban shipping with the Haijin edict, this was a policy of the Hongwu Emperor that long preceded Zheng He and the ban {–} so obviously disregarded by the Yongle Emperor {–} was eventually lifted entirely. However, the ban on maritime shipping did force countless numbers of people into smuggling and piracy. Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He's voyages left the coast highly vulnerable both to Japanese Wokou during the 16th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Richard von Glahn, a UCLA professor of Chinese history, commented that most treatments of Zheng He present him wrongly: they "offer counterfactual arguments" and "emphasize China's missed opportunity." This "narrative emphasizes the failure" instead of the accomplishments, despite his assertion that "Zheng He reshaped Asia." Glahn argues maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the Zheng He story and the effects of his voyages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/china/article.asp?parentid=10387 |title=Zheng He's Voyages of Discovery|UCLA center for Chinese Study| |publisher=International.ucla.edu |date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl]

===Cultural influence===

Despite the official neglect, the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some Chinese and novelizations of the voyages occurred, such as the Romance of the Three-Jeweled Eunuch in 1597.Blacks in Pre-Modern China, p. 121{–}122.
On his travels, Zheng He built mosques[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] while also spreading the worship of Mazu. He apparently never found time for a pilgrimage to Mecca but did send sailors there on his last voyage. He played an important part in developing relations between China and Islamic countries.[tpl]cite book|last=Tan Ta Sen|title=Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia|year=2009|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-9812308375|page=171|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Gunn|first=Geoffrey C.|title=History Without Borders: The Making of an Asian World Region, 1000-1800|year=2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-9888083343|page=117|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E10tnvapZt0C&pg=PA117&dq=%22Zheng+he%22++mosques&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TUFIUtKzBPGv4QTrt4DIDw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Zheng%20he%22%20%20mosques&f=false[/tpl] Zheng He also visited Muslim shrines of Islamic holy men in the Fujian province.
In modern times, interest in Zheng He revived substantially. In Vernor Vinge's 1999 science-fiction novel A Deepness in the Sky, a race of commercial traders in human space are named the Qeng Ho after the admiral. The expeditions featured prominently in Heather Terrell's 2005 novel The Map Thief. For the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages in 2005, the China's CCTV produced a special television series Zheng He Xia Xiyang, starring Gallen Lo as Zheng He. He is also mentioned in part of the main storyline of the first-person shooter game Far Cry 3.
He also has a slot machine named after him, 1421 Voyages of Zheng He, manufactured by Spielo.

===Relics===

Zheng He built the Tianfei Palace  ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|天|妃|宫[/tpl][/tpl], Tiānfēigōng, lit. "Palace of the Celestial Wife"), a temple in honor of the goddess Mazu, in Nanjing after the fleet returned from its first western voyage in 1407.
The "Deed of Foreign Connection and Exchange" ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|通|番|事|跡[/tpl][/tpl]) or "Tongfan Deed Stele" is located in the Tianfei Palace in Taicang, whence the expeditions first departed. The stele was submerged and lost, but has been rebuilt.
In order to thank the Celestial Wife for her blessings, Zheng He and his colleagues rebuilt the Tianfei Palace in Nanshan, Changle County, in Fujian province as well prior to departing on their last voyage. At the renovated temple, they raised a stele entitled "A Record of Tianfei Showing Her Presence and Power" ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|天妃|靈|應|之|記[/tpl][/tpl],  Tiānfēi Líng Yīng zhī Jì), discussing their earlier voyages.Fish, Robert J. "Primary Source: Zheng He Inscription". Univ. of Minnesota. Accessed 23 July 2009.
The Galle Trilingual Inscription in Sri Lanka was discovered in the city of Galle in 1911 and is preserved at the National Museum of Colombo. The three languages used in the inscription were Chinese, Tamil and Persian. The inscription praises Buddha and describes the fleet's donations to the famous Buddhist Tenavarai Nayanar temple of Tondeswaram.Xinhua News Agency. "A Peaceful Mariner and Diplomat". 12 July 2005.Association for Asian Studies. Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368{–}1644, Vol. I. Columbia Univ. Press (New York), 1976.
Zheng He's tomb in Nanjing has been repaired and a small museum built next to it, although his body was buried at sea off the Malabar Coast near Calicut in western India.Levathes, Louise. When China Ruled The Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433, p. 172. Oxford Univ. Press (New York), 1996. However, his sword and other personal possessions were interred in a Muslim tomb inscribed in Arabic.
The tomb of Zheng He's assistant Hong Bao was recently unearthed in Nanjing, as well.

===Commemoration===

In the People's Republic of China, July 11 is Maritime Day ([tpl]lang|zh|中国航海日[/tpl], Zhōngguó Hánghǎi Rì) and is devoted to the memory of Zheng He's first voyage. Initially Kunming Changshui International Airport was to be named Zheng He International Airport.http://archive.is/fauX
