[[Domestic long-haired cat]]

CATEGORIES: Cat landraces

A domestic long-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry – thus not belonging to any particular recognised cat breed – possessing a coat of semi-long to long fur.[tpl]cite video | url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/cats-101/videos/domestic-longhair.htm | title=Domestic Longhair | publisher=Animal Planet | medium=Video | series=Cats 101[/tpl] Says 10% are long-haired. Domestic long-haired cats should not be confused with the British Longhair, American Longhair, or other breeds with "Longhair" names, which are formal breeds recognised by various registries. Domestic long-haireds are the second most popular cat in the United States after the domestic short-haired; one in ten of the ninety million cats in America is a domestic long-hair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.americanhumane.org/assets/pdfs/pets-fact-sheet.pdf |title=U.S. Pet (Dog & Cat) Population Factsheet |year=2012 |publisher=American Humane Association (AHA) |accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl] Gives a figure of 95% short-haired.  Other generic terms are long-haired house cat and, in British English, long-haired moggie.
In the cat fancy, and among veterinarians and animal control agencies, domestic long-haired cats cats may be classified with organisation-specific terminology, such as Domestic Longhair (DLH), House Cat, Longhair (HCL),[tpl]cite web |url= http://fifeweb.org/wp/breeds/breeds_prf_stn.php |title=Breed Standards |author= |year=2013 |work=FIFeWeb.org |publisher=Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) |location=Luxembourg |accessdate=4 March 2013 |archivedate=4 March 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6ErvWYADX [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www1.fifeweb.org/dnld/std/HCL-HCS.pdf |title=House Cat / Hauskatze / Chat de Maison |author= |date=1 January 2013 |format=PDF |publisher=FIFe |accessdate=4 March 2013 |archivedate=4 March 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6ErpzKDwb [/tpl] or Semi-Longhair Household Pet.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.wcf-online.de/WCF-EN/standard/semi-longhair/hauskatze.html |title=Semi-longhair: Household Pet  |author= |date=1 January 2010 |work= WCF-Online.de |publisher=World Cat Federation (WCF) |location=Essen, Germany |accessdate=4 March 2013 |archivedate=4 March 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Erwim513 [/tpl] PDF version: http://www.wcf-online.de/WCF-EN/library/HHP_en_2010-01-01.pdf Such a pseudo-breed is used for registry and shelter/rescue classification purposes. While not bred as show cats, some mixed-breed cats are actually pedigreed and entered into cat shows that have non-purebred "Household Pet" divisions.  Show rules vary, and may permit "any eye colour, all coat colours and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail" (i.e. anything at all, as long as the cat is well-proportioned and healthy) or may be more restrictive, e.g.: "The colours chocolate and cinnamon, as well as their dilution (lilac and fawn) are not recognized in any combinations...the pointed pattern is also not recognized".
Domestic long-haireds come in all genetically possible cat colours including tabby, tortoiseshell, bi-coloured, and smoke. Domestic long-haireds can have fur that is up to six inches long. They can also have a mane similar to a Maine Coon's, as well as toe tufts and ear tufts. Some long-haired cats are not able to maintain their own coat, which must be frequently groomed by a human or may be prone to matting. Because of their wide gene pool, domestic long-haireds are not predisposed to any genetically inherited problems.

==History==

Crusaders returning from the Holy Wars, having already brought back plague and pestilence from the East, also imported the first long-coated cats into Europe.[tpl]when|date=April 2014|reason=There were lots of crusades, and none were in the 17th c.[/tpl] In the mid 17th century, as the plague destroyed much of London's population, the cat made its first strives of recovery from centuries of persecution. Despite being outlawed by the Roman Catholic church, during this time cats were encouraged as protectors from flea-carrying rats.  How they developed in the first place is still a matter of speculation.  The long coat may have been the result of a recessive mutant gene.  When a long-haired cat is mated to one with a short coat, only short-haired kittens can result; however, their offspring when mated to each other, will produce a proportion of long-coated kittens.  Successive litters of early European long-haired cats produced more and more long-coated offspring, which were more likely to survive in the cooler European climates, so the variety became fixed after a few generations.[tpl]when|[tpl]subst:|DATE[/tpl]|reason=In the 1600s? the 1900s?|date=April 2014[/tpl]  Some zoologists[tpl]who|date=April 2014[/tpl] have advanced the hypothesis that the manul (also known as Pallas's cat) might be the ancestor of the long coated domestic cat.[tpl]dubious|date=April 2014|reason=This is really, really unlikely due to the genetic distance between manuls and felis. Our Manul article mentions nothing about them being able to cross-breed with house cats.[/tpl]  The first modern, formal breeds of long-haired cat were the Persian and the Angora (after Ankara, Turkey) and were said to have come from those two areas.[tpl]cite book |title=World Encyclopedia of Cats |first=Angela |last=Sayer |pages=40–41 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Secaucus, New Jersey[/tpl][tpl]rs?|date=April 2014|reason=Quite a lot of that ranges from dubious and speculative to outright nonsense. It seems unlikely that any book by a reputable publisher would have included such material without citing sources for it, and if they didn't we can't really treat this as a reliable source because it contradicts too many other ones.[/tpl]
