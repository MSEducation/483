WRCM, known on-air as New Life 91.9, is a radio station in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It airs contemporary Christian music and identifies itself as "Charlotte's Number One Family Friendly Station".  It is a noncommericial listener supported ministry of Columbia International University in Columbia, South Carolina, broadcasting at 91.9 mHz, as well as 88.3 mHz in Boiling Springs, North Carolina.
The station is licensed to Wingate, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, with studios in another Charlotte suburb, Indian Trail, North Carolina.
Columbia International University, then known as Columbia Bible College, applied to the FCC for the license in 1982. Internally, this was known as The 92 FM Project. Other entities applied on top of CBC including Wingate College (now Wingate University) and a church in Waxhaw, North Carolina area. After 10 years of negotiations with the other groups, WRCM was granted the license and was signed on the air by founding general manager Ken Mayfield at 12 noon on June 14, 1993. Present at sign on were CIU president, Johnny Miller; CIU vice president John Davidson and former CIU president, Robertson C. McQuilken. (The station's call letters -RCM- were in honor of his father, Robertson C. McQuilken, the first president of Columbia Bible College.)
WRCM's first staff consisted of full-timers Ken Mayfield, the station's first general manager and afternoon personality, program director and morning host, Rodney Baucom and Karen Wycoff who served as mid-day announcer and secretary. Mayfield had built and managed another contemporary Christian station, WNOW, and had hosted a very popular Sunday morning Contemporary Christian music program for 7 years on Charlotte's 100,000 watt WBCY (now WLNK). Part-time staff members included Shelly Mitchell and Joe Paulo. Paulo stepped into the role of general manager shortly after Mayfield departed in 1999.
WRCM garnered immediate success with a 2.4 in its first Arbitron ratings. This success was in spite of the lack of advertising. Almost all of the "promotion" for the fledgling station had to come by word of mouth and from the station staff at Christian concerts. 
Original plans were for WRCM to be a satellite station of Columbia Bible College's original station, WMHK.  However, these plans were scrapped, and the station has been largely operated and programmed separately from WMHK.  However, longtime general manager Joe Paulo was recently named director of broadcasting at CIU, with oversight over both stations.  Under his watch, WMHK has begun simulcasting WRCM's "Family Friendly Morning Show," and the two stations both air the syndicated "Scott and Sam" show on weeknights.
Although the station identifies itself as "New Life 91.9, WRCM Wingate/Charlotte" and heavily promotes churches throughout the Charlotte metropolitan area, its signal is not as strong as those of the major FM stations in the Charlotte area.  For most of its history, it operated at only 10,000 watts, resulting in marginal coverage even in some parts of Charlotte.  In many of Charlotte's inner-ring suburbs, it could only be heard on car radios.  It has since increased its power to 30,000 watts.  However, it still operates from a tiny (by modern broadcasting standards) 495-foot tower near its studios in Indian Trail.  This is necessary to protect WSGE in Dallas, which is located on adjacent 91.7 FM.  As a result, it still only provides grade B coverage to large parts of the market.  Most Christian music fans in the western part of the market get a better signal from WMIT in Asheville.
WRCM's music rotation consists of six or seven current songs in heavy rotation and a mix of six or seven new songs and "classics" from the last two to five years in medium rotation played in a tight format, often back to back with only the station jingle separating songs from each other. 
New songs are chosen with the help of the listener advisory panel. 
The station often promotes live concerts by Contemporary Christian (CCM) musicians, and carries out its Christian mission by performing good works such as collecting donations of baby clothes to support mothers in need who might otherwise consider getting abortions. 
WRCM uses the "Charlotte's Number One" Radio Jingle package from RadioScape. 
Starting in 2014, WRCM was simulcast on WRZM in Boiling Springs, North Carolina.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/04/25/4863312/davidson-students-bring-shakespeare.html#.U1vtcFcvD40|title=Davidson students bring Shakespeare drama to the radio|last=Washburn|first=Mark|work=The Charlotte Observer|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.shelbystar.com/news/local/gwu-to-sell-88-3-radio-frequency-1.238786?page=1|title=GWU to sell 88.3 radio frequency|work=The Shelby Star|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=23156&Callsign=WRZM|title=Call Sign History (WRZM)|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl]
