[[Chief of Naval Operations]]

CATEGORIES: Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chiefs of Naval Operations, Navy chiefs of staff

The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is a statutory office ([tpl]UnitedStatesCode|10|5033[/tpl]) held by a four-star admiral in the United States Navy, and is the most senior naval officer assigned to serve in the Department of the Navy. The office is a military adviser and deputy to the Secretary of the Navy. In a separate capacity as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ([tpl]UnitedStatesCode|10|151[/tpl]) the CNO is a military adviser to the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, the Secretary of Defense, and the President. The current Chief of Naval Operations is Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert.
The Chief of Naval Operations is an administrative position based in the Pentagon, and while the CNO does not have operational command authority over Naval forces as the title implies (that is nowadays within the purview of the Combatant Commanders who report to the Secretary of Defense), the CNO does exercise supervision of Navy organizations as the designee of the Secretary of the Navy.

===Department of the Navy===

The CNO reports directly to the Secretary of the Navy for the command, utilization of resources, and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the Secretary.[tpl]cite web|title=The US Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp|accessdate=24 September 2007[/tpl] Under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO also designates naval personnel and naval resources to the commanders of Unified Combatant Commands.http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005013----000-.html#f 10 USC 5013(f).
