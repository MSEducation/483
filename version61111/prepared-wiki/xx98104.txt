Ronald Koeman ([tpl]IPA-nl|ˈroʊ̯.nɑɫt ˈku.mɑn|-|Nl-Ronald Koeman.ogg[/tpl], born 21 March 1963 in Zaandam, North Holland) is a former Dutch footballer, and the current manager of Feyenoord. He is the younger brother of former Feyenoord coach Erwin Koeman and the son of former Dutch international Martin Koeman. One of the best attacking central defenders of all time, Koeman was renowned for his long-range accuracy, especially in free kicks, and is the top scoring defender in world football."The World's most successful Top Division Goal Scorers of all time among defensive players" by the IFFHS. 
At international level, Koeman was one of the stars of the Dutch national team, alongside Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Euro 88 and played at the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups.
After winning the European Cup with PSV in 1988,  Koeman moved to Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team', and helped Barcelona win La Liga four years in a row between 1991 and 1994, and the European Cup where he scored the winner against Sampdoria in 1992.

==Club career==

In 1980 Koeman started his professional career at Groningen. After playing for Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, he finished his career in Feyenoord. During his career he won two European Cup titles, five Dutch championships, three Dutch Cups, four Spanish championships, one Spanish Cup and he was also in the winning Dutch national team at the UEFA Euro 1988.
After winning the European Cup with PSV in 1988, Koemam joined FC Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team', in which, along with players like Hristo Stoichkov, Romário, Josep Guardiola and Michael Laudrup, he helped the club win the La Liga four years in a row from 1991 to 1994. After scoring the winning free kick goal in the 1992 European Cup Final, he became the first player to score a goal in two consecutive Cup Finals of different European competitions, having scored Barcelona's consolation goal against Manchester United in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. 
Besides being a defender at the centreback position, Koeman was also known for his powerful right-footed freekicks and deadball ability where he scored many vital goals for the team.[tpl]Cite news|title=Benfica-coach Koeman hoopt op stunt tegen Barcelona |url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/701183/benfica-coach-koeman-hoopt-op-stunt-tegen-barcelona.html|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 August 2010|work=NU.nl|date=27 March 2006[/tpl] One of his best strikes in La Liga came in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid at the Camp Nou, with his bending free kick making the scoreline 2–0."Strikers' trademark goals: the Thierry Henry control-and-place, the Romario toe-poke and more". The Telegraph. Retrieved 5 December 2013
His nicknames while playing for Barcelona was Tintin, due to his physical similarity with Hergé's fictional character, and Floquet de Neu, after the famous albino gorilla in the Barcelona Zoo."Ronald Koeman: master of all he surveys". World Soccer. 28 July 2012. Retrieved 15 April 2013.

==International career==

He represented his nation in the 1990 World Cup and World Cup 1994 and picked up a total of 78 caps for The Netherlands, scoring 14 goals. During the 1988 European Championship, after the semi-final against Germany 2–1 in Hamburg, he, in front of German supporters, provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of Olaf Thon, an action Koeman did not regret."Zo vierde Koeman de zege op Duitsland". NRC Handelsblad (in Dutch). 8 May 2008. Retrieved 15 April 2013.
Koeman scored 193 league goals in 533 matches (ahead of Daniel Passarella, who netted 182 goals in 556 matches) during his career, more than any other defender in the history of football.

==Managerial career==

===Early years===

Having retired as a player after his stint with Feyenoord, Koeman became a member of the coaching staff of Guus Hiddink during the 1998 World Cup along with Johan Neeskens and Frank Rijkaard. After the tournament Koeman was appointed the assistant coach of Barcelona. In 2000, he was handed his first managerial job as the head coach of Vitesse where he led the team to a UEFA Cup spot on a relatively limited budget.

===Ajax===

Koeman was appointed the manager of Ajax in 2001. Ajax' fortunes suffered a steady decline after Koeman got off to a successful start at the Amsterdam ArenA, winning a domestic double in 2001–02. Despite regaining the title in 2003–04, Ajax had fallen eight points behind rivals PSV in the Eredivisie. Coupled with Ajax being knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Auxerre, 3–2 on aggregate, lead Koeman to resign the following day on 25 February 2005.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/feb/25/newsstory.ajax|title = Koeman quits Ajax|work = The Guardian|date = 25 February 2005|accessdate = 22 December 2008[/tpl]

===Benfica===

Koeman bounced back quickly from a disappointing end to his reign at Ajax in February 2005, taking up the vacant position at Portuguese champions Benfica following the departure of legendary Italian Giovanni Trapattoni. In Benfica, against whom he won the 1988 European Cup Final as a player with PSV, Koeman only won the Portuguese Super Cup; the team finished the Portuguese League in third place (behind rivals Porto and Sporting) and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup in the quarter-finals (after losing to Vitória de Guimarães). This, along with an offer from PSV, sufficed for the manager to leave one year before the end of his contract, even though Benfica reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League before losing to Barcelona, who ended up winning the trophy.

===PSV===

In the 2006–07 season, Koeman served as head coach of PSV, as successor of Guus Hiddink. PSV dominated the first season half, putting competitors as AZ and Ajax at a reasonable distance and PSV was almost destined to become champions again. However, PSV suffered in the second half of the season, also because of injuries of players Jefferson Farfán, Alex and Ibrahim Afellay, obtaining only 19 out 39 possible points."PSV roept rampspoed over zich af". de Volkskrant (in Dutch). 23 April 2007. Retrieved 15 April 2013. AZ and Ajax regained their momentum, making for a close finish, with all three teams tied at 72 points before the last competition day. AZ played struggling Excelsior in their final match, but did not manage to win. Ajax played at Willem II, but did not score enough goals; it was PSV eventually who triumphed against all odds, winning at home 5–1 against Vitesse Arnhem, and thereby becoming Eredivisie champions with one goal at front of Ajax.

===Valencia===

On 31 October 2007 Koeman agreed to be the new coach of Valencia after the sacking of Quique Flores, starting on 5 November 2007.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/oct/31/europeanfootball.psveindhoven| title = Koeman agrees to join Valencia|work = The Guardian|date = 31 October 2007|accessdate = 22 December 2008[/tpl] With Valencia he won the 2007–08 Spanish Cup, a tournament he previously won as a player of Barcelona. This was Valencia's first Copa del Rey since 1999.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/apr/21/europeanfootball.sport| title = King's Cup half empty for Koeman|work = The Guardian|date = 21 April 2008|accessdate = 22 December 2008|first=Sid|last=Lowe[/tpl] The remainder of his tenure at Valencia would prove disappointing. The team would slump to 15th in the league, only two points above the relegation zone, along with finishing bottom of their Champions League group. A 5–1 defeat by Athletic Bilbao would prove the final nail in Koeman's time with Valencia. He was sacked the following day, on 21 April 2008.

===AZ===

He was appointed manager of AZ on 18 May 2009,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=830593.html|title=Koeman succeeds Van Gaal at AZ|date=17 May 2009|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] after Louis van Gaal, who won the 2008–09 Eredivisie with AZ, joined Bayern Munich. On 5 December 2009, AZ announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of AZ, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=soccer&id=4717336|title=Dutch champions AZ Alkmaar sack coach Koeman|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=5 December 2009|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]

===Feyenoord===

On 21 July 2011, Koeman was appointed manager of Feyenoord, signing a one-year contract with the Dutch club as replacement for outgoing trainer Mario Been.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jul/21/feyenoord-ronald-koeman-head-coach|title=Feyenoord appoint Ronald Koeman as new head coach|date=21 July 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 July 2011[/tpl] Through such appointment, Koeman has notably become the first man ever to serve as both player and head coach at all teams of the so-called "traditional big three" of Dutch football – Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/203846/Unieke-werkreeks-Koeman-bij-traditionele-topdrie.htm |work=Voetbal International |accessdate=21 July 2011 |date=20 July 2011 |title=Unieke werkreeks Koeman bij traditionele top-drie |trans_title=Unique working stint for Koeman at traditional top-three[/tpl] Moreover, he has completed this in the same order as player and as manager. At the beginning of 2012 it was announced that his contract was extended.

==Personal life==

Koeman married Bartina Koeman in 1985. They have three children, two sons (named Tim and Ronald) and one daughter (named Debbie).

==Trivia==

When Ronald Koeman played for Barcelona, he was a direct neighbor of his trainer, Dutch football legend Johan Cruijff.
Ronald Koeman is, after Johan Cruijff, one of the most impersonated sportsmen in the Netherlands. Comedian Diederik van Vleuten impersonated him on a regular basis for radio and television, often portraying Koeman as a childish man in a grown-up world, usually including references to his deadly accurate shooting abilities, which the character took for granted, leading to humorous misunderstandings.[tpl]nl[/tpl]Diederik van Vleuten impersonating Ronald Koeman on Studio Spaan
