[[Viscoelasticity of bone]]

CATEGORIES: Skeletal system

Viscoelasticity of bone can arise from multiple factors related to structures on multiple length scales.Garner, Elijah, Roderic Lakes, Taeyong Lee, Colby Swan, and Richard Brand. "Viscoelastic Dissipation in Compact Bone: Implications for Stress-Induced Fluid Flow in Bone." Transactions of the ASME 122 (2000): 166-172. Bone is a composite of the bio-polymer collagen and the bio-ceramic hydroxyapatite. Additionally the collagen is plied in various directions around the bone. Bone has two structural forms; cortical and cancellous.Â³
The viscoelasticity of bone can therefore arise from the void collapse and desification of cancellous bone and the natural viscoelastic response of collagen as a polymer.3.051/BE.340 Lecture 20: Biomaterials for Organ Replacement. Cambridge, MA: Anne Mayes, 2006.

==Viscoelasticity==

ViscoelasticityMeyers, and Chawla. Mechanical Behaviour of Materials. Prentice Hall, Inc. (Pearson Education), 1999. is the phenomena of time-dependent strain exhibited by amorphous materials such as polymers or glasses. The viscoelasticity of materials depend on the viscosity and can be mechanically modelled using mechanical elements known as springs and dashpots. In turn, constitutive equations can relate the mechanical interpretation of viscoelasticity to the materials properties and strain rate.
