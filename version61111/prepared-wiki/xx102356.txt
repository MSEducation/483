Cobdenism is an economic theory that focuses on the free market and free trade; it is named after the British statesman and economist Richard Cobden.
Cobdenism traditionally has a strong focus on international free trade and asserts that a result of free trade is world peace. However, the term Cobdenism as such is largely unused nowadays.
