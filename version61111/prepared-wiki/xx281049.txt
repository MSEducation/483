Liviu Floda (1913—1997) was a Romanian-American journalist.

==Biography==

Floda was born on August 16, 1913 in Brăila, Romania. In 1932 he began his career in Bucharest by writing for such newspapers as Dimineaţa and Libertatea. Two years later he got a master's degree from the University of Bucharest and ten years later both a doctorate in economics and in political science from the same institution. From 1940 to 1944, he was assistant principal at the Cultura B lyceum in Bucharest, and from 1947 to 1948 he was a lecturer at both the Commercial Academy and at the college of the Museum of Science. In March of the same year, he was laid off as a teacher by the Communists after their rise to power in Romania. He could not work as a journalist for some time, so he focused his skills onto co-authorship of a play called The Living Flame, which ran from 1957 to 1958.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hoorferl.stanford.edu/bio.php?id=5|title=Liviu Floda|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl]
In 1964, he emigrated to New York City, where he was hired by Radio Free Europe and worked under the pseudonym Andrei Brânduș. In 1972, he retired from there, but continued working as a freelance journalist. When RFE got shut down in 1993, he continued working for the Voice of America. Floda also worked for Viața Noastră, an Israeli newspaper, and MicroMagazin in North America. He was a member of the American Newspaper Guild, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences before he died on June 3, 1997.
