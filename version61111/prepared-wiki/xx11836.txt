</ref>  Large-amplitude [[ocean wave]]s with certain shapes can propagate unchanged, because of properties of the nonlinear surface-wave medium.<ref>

If a traveling wave has a fixed shape that repeats in space or in time, it is a periodic wave.[ref]

</ref> Such waves are sometimes regarded as having a wavelength even though they are not sinusoidal.<ref name=may>
[/ref] As shown in the figure, wavelength is measured between consecutive corresponding points on the waveform.

===Wave packets===

Localized wave packets, "bursts" of wave action where each wave packet travels as a unit, find application in many fields of physics; the notion of a wavelength also may be applied to these wave packets.[ref]

</ref>
The wave packet has an envelope that describes the overall amplitude of the wave; within the envelope, the distance between adjacent peaks or troughs is sometimes called a local wavelength.[ref]

</ref> An example is shown in the figure. In general, the ''envelope'' of the wave packet moves at a different speed than the constituent waves.<ref name= Fromhold>
</ref>
Using Fourier analysis, wave packets can be analyzed into infinite sums (or integrals) of sinusoidal waves of different wavenumbers or wavelengths.[ref]See, for example, Figs. 2.8–2.10 in

Louis de Broglie postulated that all particles with a specific value of momentum p have a wavelength λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. This hypothesis was at the basis of quantum mechanics. Nowadays, this wavelength is called the de Broglie wavelength. For example, the electrons in a CRT display have a De Broglie wavelength of about 10−13 m. To prevent the wave function for such a particle being spread over all space, de Broglie proposed using wave packets to represent particles that are localized in space.[ref]
