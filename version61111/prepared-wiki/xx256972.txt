==Building==

The present church was built 1918. The designs was credited to Gustave Steinback and his noted ecclesiastical architectural firm by the AIA Guide to NYC (1978) and according to Steinback's own claim to the American Institute of Architects for its registry filings. However, the AIA Guide to NYC (2010) has revised the architect of the design to Anton Kloster. Other guides have also attributed the work to Kloster.See Thomas J. Shelley, The Archdiocese of New York: the Bicentennial History, (New York: Archdiocese of New York / Strasbourg: Ã‰ditions du Signe, 2007), p.216, 219.Joe McMahon, Bronx Catholic "Saint Anselm, Tinton Avenue, Morrisania",  March 25, 2008, "This is an attempt to index references to The Bronx in "The Archdiocese of New York: the Bicentennial History," a marvelous 624-page book written by Thomas J. Shelley. The 2007 book may still be available at the St. Patrick Cathedral gift shop. The strength of this blog will be in the alphabetic list of labels to the right, or use the search box at top left. The blog format requires that entries move from recent to old. I continue to add photos and information." (Retrieved 11 May 2011) It is possible that Kloster worked for Steinback at the time.
