Unseen is the seventh studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band The Haunted.http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=151630
Vocalist Peter Dolving has described the album as "Epic. Danceable. Groovy. And very very arty farty metal. With this next record we are going to be taking a piss in the general direction of all the crappy 99.9 percent of generic contemporary Mr. Goatse jerks out there".[tpl]cite web|url=http://squatneysteel.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/interview-peter-dolving|title=Interview: Peter Dolving[/tpl]
The album cover and tracklist were revealed on January 28, 2011. The cover was done by Frode Sylthe, a friend of the band, who also did the cover to their 2004 album Revolver. The band has said that they "really like his design aesthetic, and he seems to come up with something unique every single time".
