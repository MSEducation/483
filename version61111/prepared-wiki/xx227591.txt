Tamahara Dam (玉原ダム) is a rock-fill embankment dam on a Tone River tributary in Gunma Prefecture of Japan. It is located [tpl]Convert|14|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (玉原発電所). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is [tpl]Convert|116|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of [tpl]Convert|14800000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Of that capacity, [tpl]Convert|13000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located [tpl]Convert|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of [tpl]Convert|1177|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at [tpl]Convert|651|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of [tpl]Convert|518|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. When pumping, the pump-generators can move up to [tpl]Convert|210|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of water and when generating, they discharge up to [tpl]Convert|276|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Hydropower & Dams in South and East Asia|url=http://www.hydropower-dams.com/d/d_S&East_Asia_Map.pdf|publisher=Hydropower and Dams|accessdate=3 October 2010|page=9[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tokyo Electric Power Co. power plant Tamahara|url=http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/gunma/tanbara/tanbara.html|publisher=Suiryoku|accessdate=17 February 2012|language=Japanese[/tpl]
