</ref> A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has also led to the identification of [[stellar association]]s. These are most likely groups of stars that share a common point of origin in giant molecular clouds.<ref>

===Magnetic field===

The magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, generating magnetic fields that extend throughout the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic fields that reach out into the corona from active regions. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.[ref]

Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star's stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time.[ref]

the Maunder minimum, for example, the Sun underwent a
70-year period with almost no sunspot activity.

===Mass===

One of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae,[tpl]cite journal | first = Nathan | last = Smith | year = 1998 | url = http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/9804/eta.html | title = The Behemoth Eta Carinae: A Repeat Offender | publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific | journal=Mercury Magazine | volume=27 | page=20 | accessdate = 2006-08-13 [/tpl] which, with 100–150 times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million years. A study of the Arches cluster suggests that 150 solar masses is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.[ref]
