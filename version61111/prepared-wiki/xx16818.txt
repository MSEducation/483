Ossip Zadkine ([tpl]lang-ru|Осип Цадкин[/tpl]; July 14, 1890 – November 25, 1967) was a Belarusian-born artist who lived in France. He is primarily known as a sculptor, but also produced paintings and lithographs.

==Early years and career==

Zadkine was born as Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin ([tpl]lang-ru|Иосель Аронович Цадкин[/tpl]) in a Jewish familyAleksandr Lisov "Zadkine and Vitebsk": Archival materials reported in this article state that Iosel-Shmuila Aronovich Tsadkin, born on January 28, 1888 (sic!), was of Jewish faith and studied in the Vitebsk City Technical School between 1900 and 1904, including two years in one class with would-be artists Marc Chagall (then Movsha Shagal) and Victor Mekler (then Avigdor Mekler). Thus, contrary to what Zadkine himself was saying, his father did not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion and his mother was not of a Scottish extraction.L. Khmelnitskaya 'Marc Chagall's Circle in Vitebsk' in Vitebsk (now Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire).
After attending art school in London, Zadkine settled in Paris about 1910. There he became part of the new Cubist movement (1914-1925). He later  developed his own style, one that was strongly influenced by African art.
Zadkine served as a stretcher-bearer in the French Army during World War I, and was wounded in action. He spent the World War II years in America. His best-known work is probably the sculpture "The Destroyed City" (1951-1953), represents a man without a heart, a memorial to the destruction of the center of the Dutch city of Rotterdam in 1940 by the German Luftwaffe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=FtsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4848,5178621&dq=ossip-zadkine&hl=en|title=Sculptor Dies |date=27 November 1967|publisher=The Age|accessdate=20 April 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Personal life==

In 1920, Zadkine married Valentine Prax (1899—1991), an Algerian-born painter of Sicilian and French Catalan descent. They had no children.
Zadkine was a friend of Henry Miller and was represented by the character Borowski in Tropic of Cancer (novel).Kreg Wallace: "Musée Zadkine", Walking Paris with Henry Miller, http://www.millerwalks.com/content/musee-zadkine. Retrieved 10 July 2013.Frederick Turner: Renegade: Henry Miller and the Making of "Tropic of Cancer", Yale University Press, 2012.
The artist's only child, Nicolas Hasle (born 1960), was the result of his affair with a Danish woman, Annelise Hasle. Since 2009, Hasle, a psychiatrist, who was acknowledged by the artist and had his parentage legally established in France in the 1980s, has been party to a lawsuit with the City of Paris to establish his claim to his father's estate.http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Paris-must-justify-its-right-to-Zadkine-s-estate/23413 Gareth Harris, "Paris must justify its right to Zadkine's estate," The Art Newspaper.
Zadkine died in Paris in 1967 at the age of 77 after undergoing abdominal surgery and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse. His former home and studio is now the Musée Zadkine.
There is also a Musée Zadkine in the village of Les Arques in the Midi-Pyrénées region. Zadkine lived in Les Arques for a number of years, and while there, carved an enormous Christ on the Cross and Pieta that are featured in the 12th-century church which stands opposite the museum.
