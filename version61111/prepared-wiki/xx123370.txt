Jeff Chimenti (born October 21, 1968) is an American keyboardist, best known for his ongoing work with RatDog.  He is also a member of the post-Grateful Dead bands The Dead and Furthur.
A native of the San Francisco Bay area, Chimenti began playing piano when he was four and he studied formally from the age of seven to around the time he finished high school.  Once he graduated from high school, he began playing in bands around the Bay area.  He played in local jazz bands as well as Les Claypool's Frog Brigade; he's also played back-up for pop acts such as En Vogue.
He was playing in Dave Ellis's jazz quartet when Ellis was hired to play saxophone in Ratdog.  Ellis informed him that Ratdog was also looking for a new keyboardist.  Chimenti was hired and played his first show 28 May 1997.
Recently Chimenti has been on tour with Ratdog and is scheduled to perform with Phil Lesh and Friends.
