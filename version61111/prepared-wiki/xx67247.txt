==Biography==

Hursthouse spent her childhood in New Zealand and taught for many years at the Open University in England. She was head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Auckland from 2002 to 2005. Though she had written a substantial amount previously, Hursthouse entered the international philosophical scene for the first time in 1990-91, with three articles: "Arational Actions", which made an important break with models of human voluntary actions familiar from the work of Donald Davidson, "Virtue Theory and Abortion", which outlined the structure of a new version of Aristotelian virtue ethics, defended it against possible objections, and applied it to the issue of abortion, and "After Hume's Justice", which offered an account of social justice in mainly Aristotelian terms and which, though it did not seek to justify democratic institutions, demonstrated that virtue ethics can accommodate certain human or individual rights.[tpl]cite book |author=Michael Slote |editors=Oppy, Graham & Trakakis, N.

Hursthouse, who was mentored by Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot, is best known as a virtue ethicist.
Her work is deeply grounded in the history of philosophy, and especially in Aristotle's ethics, about which she has written extensively. Hursthouse's article "Virtue Theory and Abortion" argues that whereas most discussions of abortion focus on the issue of who has rights to make decisions regarding the foetus, a decision made within one's rights could still be callous or cowardly, meaning that it would be ethically problematic and potentially devastating for the person making it, whatever the status of the foetus and the reproductive rights of women.
Hursthouse has also emphasized the practical nature of virtue ethics in her books Beginning Lives and Ethics, Humans, and Other Animals. Hursthouse's most substantial contribution to modern virtue ethics is her book On Virtue Ethics, which explores its structure as a distinctive action-guiding theory, the relationship between virtue, the emotions and moral motivation, and the place of the virtues within an overall account of human flourishing. It also expands her formulation of right action in terms of what a virtuous person would characteristically do.[tpl]cite book |author=Daniel Russell |editors=Oppy, Graham & Trakakis, N.
