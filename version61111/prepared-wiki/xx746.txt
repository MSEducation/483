</ref> He considered some positional factors, subtracting Â½ point for each [[doubled pawn]]s, [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]. Another positional factor in the evaluation function was ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'', adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered [[checkmate]] to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper:
The evaluation function is clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic.

===The Las Vegas connection: information theory and its applications to game theory===

Shannon and his wife Betty also used to go on weekends to Las Vegas with MIT mathematician Ed Thorp,American Scientist online: Bettor Math, article and book review by Elwyn Berlekamp and made very successful forays in blackjack using game theory type methods co-developed with fellow Bell Labs associate, physicist John L.

Shannon and Thorp also applied the same theory, later known as the Kelly criterion, to the stock market with even better results.William Poundstone website  Claude Shannon's card count techniques were explained in Bringing Down the House, the best-selling book published in 2003 about the MIT Blackjack Team by Ben Mezrich. In 2008, the book was adapted into a drama film titled 21.

===Shannon's maxim===

Shannon formulated a version of Kerckhoffs' principle as "The enemy knows the system". In this form it is known as "Shannon's maxim".
