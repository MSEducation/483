[[Troon Tornadoes]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish basketball teams

The Troon Tornadoes are one of Scotland's leading amateur basketball clubs, competing in the Scottish Men's National League. They are based in the town of Troon, South Ayrshire, but their Senior Men national league side play out of the main sports hall at the Citadel Leisure Centre, Ayr. However, the rest of the teams play out of Marr College, Troon.
In the summer of 2006, several players formed part of a mass exodus towards professional basketball clubs including Dan Wardrope (to Guildford Heat), Brian McCotter (to Newcastle Eagles), and Andy Pearson (to Scottish Rocks).
For the 2006/07 season Troon will also take part in the BBL Cup alongside the professional franchise clubs of the British Basketball League and a select few clubs from the SBL and the English Basketball League.
The club also compete in most other age groups, both at national league level and Strathclyde (local) league level. In the 2009/10, Troon had a men's U16 national and Strathclyde league team, a men's U18 national and Strathclyde league team and a Senior men national and Strathclyde league team. An U14 team may be formed to play in local tournaments.
