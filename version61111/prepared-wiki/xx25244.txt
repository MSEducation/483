The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage listed [tpl]Convert|243|km[/tpl] stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia between the Victorian cities of Torquay and Allansford. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932 and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world's largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain along the coast and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction in the region.

==General==

The Great Ocean Road officially starts at Torquay and travels 243 kilometres westward to finish at Allansford near Warrnambool, the largest city along the road.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=24 June 2010|title=Doncaster site to house shops, offices and flats|date=12 June 2010|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/doncaster-site-to-house-shops-offices-and-flats-20100611-y3ri.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl]  The road is two lane (one in each direction),[tpl]cite web|url=http://visitgreatoceanroad.org.au/great-ocean-road/highlights/the-great-ocean-road|title=The Great Ocean Road – Visit Great Ocean Road|accessdate=2 July 2010|publisher=Geelong Otway Tourism|year=2009|work=visitgreatoceanroad.org.au[/tpl] and is covered by a speed limit changing between 80 kilometres per hour and 100 kilometres per hour
The road is considered a tourist attraction in the area,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senews.com.au/story/89252|title=Critics slam policy to ban coast wind farms|accessdate=9 June 2010|author=Waters, Kim|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Star News Group[/tpl] in which much of the road hugs coastline affectionately known as the Surf Coast between Torquay and Cape Otway and the Shipwreck Coast further west of Cape Otway, providing visibility of Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean. The road traverses rainforests, as well as beaches and cliffs composed of limestone and sandstone, which is susceptible to erosion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/preserving-the-fragile-great-ocean-road/2006/01/01/1136050341672.html|title=Preserving the fragile Great Ocean Road|date=2 January 2006|accessdate=25 June 2010|publisher=The Age|author=Campbell, David[/tpl]   The road travels via Anglesea, Lorne, Apollo Bay, and Port Campbell, the latter being notable for its natural limestone and sandstone rock formations including Loch Ard Gorge, The Grotto, London Arch and The Twelve Apostles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/australia/great-ocean-road/history|title=The Lonely Planet online guide to the road|accessdate=19 May 2008[/tpl] At the stretch of the Great Ocean Road nearer to Geelong, the road meanders along the coast, with tall, almost-vertical cliffs on the other side of it. Road signs put up along the road warn motorists of possible rockfalls, which have occurred before. 
The city of Geelong, close to Torquay, experiences great benefit from Australian and international visitors to the road; with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2008/07/17/16183_news.html|title=Geelong has a billion reason to thank tourists|author=Harper, Jane|date=17 July 2008|accessdate=9 June 2010|publisher=The Geelong Advertiser[/tpl]  The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state's top tourism experience in its Victoria 101 survey, based on spots recommended by members and the public on what they would recommend to visitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/travel/news/great-ocean-road-top-tourism-experience/story-e6freqwo-1111117613309|title=Great Ocean Road 'top tourism experience'|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=25 June 2010|publisher=Queensland Newspapers|work=couriermail.com.au[/tpl]  However, according to a survey performed by the Surf Coast Shire, residents have expressed concern that there are not enough safe crossings along the road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.surfcoast.vic.gov.au/Leisure%20&%20Cty%20Services/Documents/CommPlan/Comm_Plan_04_Environment.pdf|title=Surfcoast.vic.gov.au|publisher=Surf Coast Shire|accessdate=9 March 2011[/tpl]

===Great Ocean Road Marathon===

Besides standard vehicular travel, a 45 kilometre section between Lorne and Apollo Bay is used for the annual Great Ocean Road Marathon, first started in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2010/05/17/173985_news.html|title=Ocean Road to glory for marathon|author=Dickens, Carl|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=30 June 2010|publisher=Geelong Advertiser[/tpl]  [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], the marathon record of two hours, 27 minutes and 42 seconds set in 2011 is held by James Kipkelwon, of Kenya. James Kipkelwon also won the event in 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Highton man second in marathon|author=Eliza Sum|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/05/20/327411_news.html[/tpl]

==History==

The Great Ocean Road was first planned towards the end of the first world war, when chairman of the Country Roads Board William Calder asked the State War Council for funds to be provided for returned soldiers to work on roads in sparsely populated areas in the Western district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070529b.htm|title=Calder, William (1860–1928)|accessdate=24 June 2010|publisher=Australian National University|work=adbonline.anu.edu.au|author=Southern, Roger J.|ISSN=1833-7538[/tpl]  By the time of World War I, the rugged south-west coast of Victoria was accessible only by sea or rough bush track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=EjgRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QJQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5510,4751724&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Great Ocean Road turns 50|author=Downes, Stephen|accessdate=25 June 2010|publisher=The Age|page=12|date=26 November 1982[/tpl]  Besides being dedicated as a memorial, it was also envisaged that the road would connect isolated settlements on the coast, and become a vital transport link for the timber industry and tourism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/canwehelp/txt/s2656311.htm|title=Moment in Time – Episode 27|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl]
Surveying for the road, tentatively titled the South Coast Road, started in 1918 – with the road suggested to travel from Barwon Heads, follow the coast west around Cape Otway, and end near Warrnambool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world/destination/history/great+ocean+road|title=Great Ocean Road – History|publisher=News Limited|work=news.com.au|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl]  In 1918, the Great Ocean Road Trust was formed as a private company, under the helm of president Howard Hitchcock.  The company managed to secure £81,000 in capital from private subscription and borrowing, with Hitchcock himself contributing £3000.  Money would be repaid by charging drivers a toll until the debt was cleared, and the road would then be gifted to the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090317b.htm|title=Hitchcock, Howard (1866–1932)|accessdate=24 June 2010|publisher=Australian National University|author=Wynd, Ian|work=www.adb.online.anu.edu.au[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=H44TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OZYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3484,4884894&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=The Great Ocean Road|publisher=The Sydney Mail|accessdate=25 June 2010|date=24 April 1935[/tpl]

===Construction effort===

Construction on the road began on 19 September 1919, built by approximately 3,000 returned servicemen as a war memorial for fellow servicemen who had been killed in World War I. An advance survey team progressed through dense wilderness at approximately 3 kilometres a month. Construction was done by hand; using explosives, pick and shovel, wheel barrows, and some small machinery,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/travel/travel-destinations/surfing-the-vineyards-on-the-ocean-road-2200613.html|title=Surfing the vineyards on the Ocean Road|accessdate=8 June 2010|author=Goggin, Eleanor|date=30 May 2010|work=Sunday Independent|publisher=Independent.ie[/tpl] and was at times perilous, with several workers killed on the job; the final sections along steep coastal mountains being the most difficult to work on.  Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, as it was the softest ride for them.
The soldiers were paid 10 shillings and sixpence for eight hours per day, also working a half-day on Saturdays. They used tents for accommodation throughout, and made use of a communal dining marquee and kitchen; food costing up to 10 shillings a week. Despite the difficulty involved in constructing the road, the workers had access to a piano, gramophone, games, newspapers and magazines at the camps.  Additionally, in 1924, the steamboat Casino became stranded near Cape Patton after hitting a reef, forcing it to jettison 500 barrels of beer and 120 cases of spirits. The workers obtained the cargo, resulting in an unscheduled two-week-long drinking break.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=30 June 2010|url=http://www.gowest.com.au/great-ocean-road-victoria-history.html|title=Great Ocean Road history|publisher=Go West|work=www.gowest.com.au[/tpl]

===Completion and early usage===

On 18 March 1922 the section from Eastern View to Lorne was officially opened with celebrations.  However it was then closed from 10 May 1922 for further work; opening again on 21 December along with tolls to recoup construction costs.  The charge, payable at Eastern View, was two shillings for motor cars, and 10 shillings for wagons with more than two horses.
In November 1932, the section from Lorne to Apollo Bay was finished, bringing the road to completion. The road was officially opened with Victoria's Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Irvine holding a ceremony near Lorne's Grand Pacific Hotel, and the road subsequently being acknowledged as the world's largest war memorial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2010/06/09/180781_opinion.html|author=Grant, Roger|title=Extra Tiger flights make Geelong a must-see|date=9 June 2010|accessdate=9 June 2010|publisher=The Geelong Advertiser|work=www.geelongadvertiser.com.au[/tpl]  At the time, newspaper The Age commented – "In the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or 'wild-cat scheme', as many dubbed it, into concrete reality".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/great-anniversary-at-75/2007/04/09/1175971018222.html|title=Road's still great, 75 years on|author=Rood, David|date=10 April 2007|accessdate=26 June 2010|publisher=The Age[/tpl]  Hitchcock had however died of heart disease on 22 August 1932, before the road was completed, though his car was driven behind the governor's in the procession along the road during the opening ceremony.  A memorial was constructed in Hitchcock's name on the road at Mount Defiance, near Lorne, and he is still affectionately considered the Father of the Road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/hard-road-to-honouring-diggers/story-e6frg6nf-1111113340576|title=Hard road to honouring Diggers|author=Davis, Michael|publisher=The Australian|date=14 April 2007|accessdate=26 June 2010[/tpl]

In its original state, the road was considered a formidable drive; fitting only a single vehicle comfortably at a time.  Areas with sheer cliffs would be most hazardous, with only few places for drivers to pull over to allow others to proceed in the opposite direction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=dqQRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vecDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5551,1367369&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Double Lines Needed On Ocean Road|publisher=The Age|date=10 June 1961|accessdate=29 June 2010[/tpl]  On 2 October 1936, the road was handed to the State Government; with the deed for the road presented to the Victorian Premier at a ceremony at the Cathedral Rock toll gate.  It was at this time that the tolls were also removed.
In 1962, the road was deemed by the Tourist Development Authority to be one of the world's great scenic roads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=Xl8RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jJYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4214,2226082&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Great Ocean Road in World Class|publisher=The Age|date=15 August 1962|page=4|accessdate=25 June 2010[/tpl]  It also had sections widened between the Lorne Hotel and the Pacific Hotel to improve traffic, while aiming to preserve its character.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=lIUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K5UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4841,1137083&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Widening of Lorne Road|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=8 September 1962|publisher=The Age[/tpl]  Despite improvements, the road was still considered a challenging drive; the Victorian Police motor school even using it for training around 1966.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=J6EpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5301,6321932&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Tighter averages on poor roads in tough run|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=4 December 1966|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl]
Over its life, the Great Ocean Road has been susceptible to natural elements; in 1960 the section at Princetown was partially washed away by water during storms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=RxETAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tqkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6794,3596374&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Washaways|publisher=The Age|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=23 April 1960[/tpl]  It experienced landslides on 11 August 1964,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=Tx0TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=15YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4686,2044336&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|date=12 August 1964|accessdate=25 June 2010|work=The Age|title=Landslide Closes Great Ocean Road[/tpl] and in 1971; both closing sections of the road near Lorne.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=VpAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=r5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5915,1903737&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Ocean Road open – but watch out|publisher=The Age|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=9 December 1971[/tpl]  Because of the terrain surrounding the road, it was also closed due to bush-fires in 1962[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=lDITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gbIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4510,2438041&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Fire Survey Finds Another 200 Homes were Lost|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=20 January 1962|publisher=The Age[/tpl] and 1964; particularly in areas with nearby camp-sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=TKIQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pJUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6068,800843&dq=great+ocean+road&hl=en|title=Great Ocean Road Closed|date=8 January 1964|accessdate=29 June 2010|publisher=The Age[/tpl] In January 2011 a section of the overhanging cliffs collapsed due to heavy rain.
In 2011, the road was added to the Australian National Heritage List.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnston|first=Matt|title=Great Ocean Road added to Australia's national heritage lis|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/great-ocean-road-added-to-australias-national-heritage-list/story-fn7x8me2-1226035330649|accessdate=7 April 2011|newspaper=HeraldSun|date=7 April 2011[/tpl]

===Great Ocean Walk===

In 2004, the Great Ocean Walk opened, connecting 104 km of walking trails that follow the coastline near the Great Ocean Road, stretching from Apollo Bay to the 12 Apostles.[tpl]cite web|title=Great Ocean Walk|url=http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Activities-and-attractions/Outdoor-activities/Walking-and-hiking/Great-Ocean-Walk.aspx|work=Visit Victoria|publisher=Tourism Victoria|accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl]
