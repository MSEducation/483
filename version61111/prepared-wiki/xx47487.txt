Microdictyon is an extinct "armored worm" coated with dot-like
Maotianshan shale of Yunnan China. Microdictyon is sometimes included
in a somewhat ill-defined Phylum – Lobopodia – that includes several
other odd worm-like and segmented free-swimming animals that do not appear
to be arthropods or worms.  The phylum includes Microdictyon, Onychodictyon, Cardiodictyon,
Luolishania, Paucipodia, as well as the
Anomalocarids.  The isolated sclerites of Microdictyon
are known from other Lower Cambrian deposits.  Microdictyon sclerites appear to have moulted; one sclerite seems to have been preserved during ecdysis.Figured in [tpl]cite doi|10.1111/1475-4983.00289[/tpl]
Microdictyon sinicum (Chen, Hou and Lu, 1989) is typical.  The
wormlike animal has ten pairs of sclerites (suggestions that these may be eyes or eye-like structures have no weight[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00634.x[/tpl]) on the sides, matched to a pair
of tentacle-like feet below.  The head and posterior are tubular and
featureless.
