==Offerings==

The park has several different activities available to visitors:

===Fort Fun===

Fort Fun is a playground built in 1992 in the park. A community group, the Huntington Park Playground Association, was established to develop the playground in the early 1990s. The playground was designed professionally, but with significant contributions from local children on what they wanted to see in their new playground. The playground was then built as a volunteer effort - over 1,000 people contributed their time and effort to getting the playground built.
