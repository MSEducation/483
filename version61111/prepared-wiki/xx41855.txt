[[Margites]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek mock-heroic poems, Lost poems, Homer

The Margites is a comic mock-epic of Ancient Greece that is largely lost. From references to the work that survived, we know that its central character is an exceedingly dumb man named "Margites" (from ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|μάργος[/tpl], margos, "raving, mad; lustful") who was so dense he did not know which parent had given birth to him.Stuart Kelly, The Book of Lost Books, New York: Random House, 2005. His name gave rise to the recherché adjective margitomanēs ([tpl]lang|grc|μαργιτομανής[/tpl]), "mad as Margites", used by Philodemus.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon revised edition, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940.
It was commonly attributed to Homer, as by Aristotle (Poetics 13.92): "His Margites indeed provides an analogy: as are the Iliad and Odyssey to our tragedies, so is the Margites to our comedies"; but the work, among a mixed genre of works loosely labelled "Homerica" in Antiquity, was more reasonably attributed to Pigres, a Greek poet of Halicarnassus, in the massive medieval Greek encyclopedia called Suda. It is written in mixed hexameter and iambic lines, an odd whim of Pigres, who also inserted a pentameter line after each hexameter of the Iliad as a curious literary game.Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquity, New York, 1898.
Margites was famous in the ancient world, but only these following lines passed from Medieval tradition:
Fortunately, in Oxyrhynchus, a few papyrus fragments were found and published (P.Oxy 2309, 3693 and 3694). The collected fragments were included in volume II of Iambi et Elegi Graeci ante Alexandrum cantati by M.L. West.
