[[Cangin languages]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of Senegal, Languages of the Gambia, Languages of Mauritania, Cangin languages

The Cangin languages [tpl]IPA-xx|ˈtʃaŋin|[/tpl] are spoken by 200,000 people (as of 2007) in a small area east of Dakar. They are the languages spoken by the Serer people who do not speak the Serer language (Serer-Sine). Because the people are ethnically Serer, the Cangin languages are commonly thought to be dialects of the Serer language. However, they are not closely related; Serer is closer to Fulani than it is to Cangin.
The languages are:

Lehar and Noon are particularly close, as are Ndut and Palor, though not quite to the point of easy intelligibility. Safen is transparently closer to Lehar–Noon than to Palor–Ndut.
