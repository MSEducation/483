==Career==

===Early political career===

Delanoë has been involved in politics since the age of twenty-three as the secretary of the Socialist federation in Aveyron.
He was first elected to the Paris city council in 1977. In 1993, he became the head of the city's Socialist Party.
In 1995, he was elected to the French Senate, where he was secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense.

===Mayor of Paris===

Delanoë has been mayor of Paris since 18 March 2001, when control of the city council was won by a left-wing alliance for the first time since the 1871 Paris Commune. His predecessors were Jean Tiberi (1995–2001), and Jacques Chirac (1977–95), who resigned after 18 years as mayor when he was elected president of France.
Delanoë won the mayorship of Paris, at the head of a coalition of Socialists, Greens and Communists, over the conservative candidates Jean Tiberi and Philippe Séguin, who were unable to resolve their differences and thereby split the conservative vote. This success in a city which has traditionally been a stronghold of the right was made all the more striking by setbacks to the Left in the 2001 elections that occurred more generally – has been partially attributed with the weariness of the Parisian public with respect to various scandals of corruption and graft in the preceding administrations (see corruption scandals in the Paris region).
Delanoë was virtually unknown before the election of 2001, but soon gained fame for organising new and unusual events in Paris, such as the "Paris Beach" (Paris-Plages) on the banks of the Seine every summer in order to give Parisians who could not take a regular vacation a chance to relax, sunbathe and build sandcastles in the center of Paris. The program, especially popular with families with children, has been in place since 2002, and has since been copied by many other international cities.
Since becoming mayor, Delanoë's goals have been to improve the quality of life, reduce pollution, and cut down on vehicle traffic within the city (including a plan for a non-polluting tramway to ease Parisian traffic) and pedestrian malls. Recently he has helped introduce a new program called Vélib' (a portmanteau of “vélo" and "libre” meaning "free bicycles") which gives Parisians access to inexpensive rental bicycles which are available in stations all around Paris. The program has been enormously successful despite the fact that it still has a few logistical problems to be worked out.Vélib'information in English. He has outlined a plan for an autolib, whereby small cars would be shared.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2236005,00.html |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Definitively a mayor à la mode | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=6 January 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] He was reelected in 2008 (57.7%) for a new six-year-term (2008–2014).
In 2009, he  criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI, which were of the effect that condom use was unhelpful or even counter-productive in the fight against AIDS.Canadian Press article[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]

====Assassination attempt====

Delanoë was stabbed on 5 October 2002 during the Nuit Blanche, a night of festivities in Paris, while mingling with the public. His assailant was a Muslim immigrant, Azedine Berkane, who reportedly told police that "he hated politicians, the Socialist Party, and homosexuals." Speaking to Le Monde, one of his neighbors said, "He was a bit like us. We're all homophobic here because it's not natural." Before being taken to hospital, Delanoë ordered that the festivities continue. Delanoë's wound was not life-threatening and he left the hospital after about two weeks.[tpl]cite web |last=Rapp |first=Linda |title=Delanoë, Bertrand |work=glbtq.com |date=13 August 2007 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/delanoe_b.html[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=America Alone |last=Steyn |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Steyn |year=2006 |pages=120–121[/tpl]
Azedine Berkane was eventually permitted to leave the psychiatric hospital where he had been a patient after his doctors no longer considered him a threat. However, in early April, 2007, he failed to keep a scheduled appointment with his doctors, and has not been seen since.

====Olympic bid====

The failure to secure the 2012 Summer Olympics for Paris on 6 July 2005 was Delanoë's first major setback as mayor. In the aftermath of the defeat in his Olympic bid, he accused British prime minister Tony Blair of unduly influencing the result in order to secure the games in London. However, Delanoë's popularity in fact rose during July 2005.Sondage : Delanoë au top, Villepin galope (Survey: Delanoë on top, Villepin galloping), TF1, 21 July 2005 [tpl]fr icon[/tpl]. The French public appeared to have laid more of the blame on President Jacques Chirac, who allegedly said that "the only worse food than British food is Finnish" which is widely believed to have offended two Finnish members of the International Olympic Committee.

===Potential presidential bid===

Delanoë was said to be considering challenging then-current president Sarkozy in the Presidential election in 2012. However, this plan suffered a setback in November 2008 when he lost the race for the party leadership to Lille mayor Martine Aubry.

===Fake New York Times letter===

On 22 December 2008, The New York Times published a letter attributed to Delanoë criticizing Caroline Kennedy's candidacy for the United States Senate seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The newspaper later admitted that the letter, which had been sent by email, had not been properly verified, and was a fake.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/opinion/22letters.corr.html | work=The New York Times | title=Editors' Note | date=22 December 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]
