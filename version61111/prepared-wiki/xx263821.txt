==History==

===2011–2012===

In 2011 Volkswagen competed with seven different drivers in four rallies (Rally Finland, Rallye Deutschland, Rally Catalunya and Wales Rally GB). German Christian Riedemann was the only driver competing in two rallies.
In November 2011, the team revealed they have made a multi-year contract with the French rally star Sébastien Ogier and his co-driver Julien Ingrassia.
For 2012 season, Volkswagen Motorsport continued developing their Polo R World Rally Car and they also completed a full WRC-campaign (except New Zealand) with a pair of Škoda Fabias. Sébastien Ogier drove it in every round of the campaign, while the second car was shared between Andreas Mikkelsen and Kevin Abbring. The team had a third car in their home rally Germany driven by Sepp Wiegand.
The season included some highlights, including Sébastien Ogier's unexpected special stage win in Sardinia. Ogier's fifth place in Sardinia also remains the best ever overall finish for a S2000 car in World Rally Championship.[tpl]cite news|title=Volkswagen driver Sébastien Ogier surprises WRC rivals|url=http://www.vw-motorsport.de/web/news/index.php?PHPSESSID=561fcd6a368e473ae3b97afb14badf1d&flash=ok&lg=e&st=637&id=5168|work=vw-motorsport.de|date=21 October 2012|accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl]

===2013===

Volkswagen Motorsport entered as a fully-fledged manufacturer team in 2013. Sébastien Ogier and Jari-Matti Latvala started the season, whilst Andreas Mikkelsen joined the championship at the fourth round in Portugal. Mikkelsen and his new co-driver Mikko Markkula were registered under a second manufacturer team, known as “Volkswagen Motorsport II” so as to give them as much time as possible testing the Polo R WRC.[tpl]cite news|title=Volkswagen registers second team for Mikkelsen|url=http://www.wrc.com/news/archive/volkswagen-registers-second-team-for-mikkelsen/?fid=18334|work=WRC.com|date=6 March 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl]
The 2013 season started with Rallye Monte-Carlo. Volkswagen entered the rally with two cars, Latvala/Anttila and Ogier/Ingrassia.
