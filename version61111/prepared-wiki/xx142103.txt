==History==

The Irishman Bernard Phelan (1770-1841) acquired the Domaine Le Clos de Garamey in 1805 and Ségur de Cabarnac in 1810. In Ireland, he was a neighbour and friend of Hugh Barton who established Château Léoville-Barton. By his death in 1841 the estate combined to form Château Ségur de Garamey, which passed on to his son Frank Phelan, 30 years a mayor of Saint-Estèphe.
The current owner since 1985 is Xavier Gardinier, with sons Thierry, Stéphane and Laurent. Michel Rolland is employed as a consulting enologist. J. Suckling, 50 Best Bordeaux under $50, Wine Spectator Magazine, pg. 85, March 31, 2007
