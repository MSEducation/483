The 1993 U.S. Open was the 93rd U.S. Open, held June 17â€“20 at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey. Lee Janzen shot all four rounds in the 60s and tied the U.S. Open scoring record to win the first of his two U.S. Open titles, two strokes ahead of  runner-up Payne Stewart.[tpl]cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138183/index.htm|magazine=Sports Illustrated|title=Sweet Sixteen|last=Reilly|first=Rick|date=June 28, 1993|page=28[/tpl]
Janzen's total of 272 tied the U.S. Open scoring record set by Jack Nicklaus in 1980, also at Baltusrol. It was the third consecutive time at Baltusrol that the scoring record was tied or broken. Nicklaus also won in 1967 with a 275, one stroke better than Ben Hogan's 276 at Riviera in 1948. Janzen joined Lee Trevino as the only champion to post all four rounds under 70; Trevino shot 275 in 1968, a quarter century earlier. (Rory McIlroy became the third in 2011 and set the scoring record.)[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/usopen11/news/story?id=6678101 |title=Rory McIlroy runs away with Open title |work=ESPN.com |date=June 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 20, 2011[/tpl]

Janzen began the final round with a one-shot lead over Stewart. He kept the lead at the turn, but at the 10th his drive settled in thick rough and behind trees. Somehow Janzen's approach went through the branches and found the green, where he made par. He eventually lost sole possession of the lead, however, after three-putting at the 12th. A birdie at 14 put Janzen back on top, but after finding trouble at 16, his [tpl]convert|30|ft|0|sing=on[/tpl] chip found the hole for an unlikely birdie. After Stewart missed a lengthy putt for birdie, Janzen held a two-shot lead with just three to play. Another lucky break for Janzen came at the 17th, when his drive hit a tree and deflected back into the fairway. Both players made par, and at the last Janzen hit a brilliant 4-iron approach to set up another birdie and seal the victory.U.S. OPEN GOLF; Janzen: Lucky and Good, Good And Lucky
