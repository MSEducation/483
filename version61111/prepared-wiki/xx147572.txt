[[Bradshaw model]]

CATEGORIES: Topography

The Bradshaw Model is  a geographical model which describes how a river's characteristics vary between the upper course and lower course of a river. It shows that discharge, occupied channel width, channel depth and average load quantity increases downstream. Load particle size, channel bed roughness and gradient are all characteristics that decrease; it is represented by triangles, of different sizes according to their quantity, facing either towards or away from the mouth or the source of the river downstream. Generally it shows the characteristics we expect to see in a river but due to the nature of rivers and the ever changing environment in which we live not all rivers fit the model perfectly therefore the model is usually used in order to compare natural rivers to concepts laid down by the model. earthstudies.co.uk
