Jean François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ fʁɑ̃swa də ɡalop kɔ̃t də lapeʁuːz|pron[/tpl]; (variant spelling of his name comte "de La Pérouse") 23 August 1741 – 1788?) was a French Navy officer and explorer whose expedition vanished in Oceania.Novaresio, Paolo (1996). The Explorers. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, NY ISBN 1-55670-495-X. p. 180. "Lapérouse was born in 1741."

==Early career==

Jean-François de Galaup was born near  Albi, France.Novaresio, 1996, p. 180. "Lapérouse was born at Albi." Lapérouse was the name of a family property that he added to his name.John Dunmore. "French Explorers of the Pacific". Volume One: Eighteenth Century. Oxford Press: 1965, p255. He studied in a Jesuit college and entered the naval college in Brest when he was fifteen.  In 1757 he was posted to the Célèbre and participated in a supply expedition to the fort of Louisbourg in New France.  Lapérouse also took part in a second supply expedition in 1758 to Louisbourg, but as this was in the early years of the Seven Years' War, the fort was under siege and the expedition was forced to make a circuitous route around Newfoundland to avoid British patrols.
In 1759 Lapérouse was wounded in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, where he was serving aboard the Formidable. He was captured and briefly imprisoned before being paroled back to France; he was formally exchanged in December 1760.Dunmore, John. Where fate beckons: the life of Jean-François de la Pérouse. pp. 26-32 He participated in a 1762 attempt by the French to gain control of Newfoundland, escaping with the fleet when the British arrived in force to drive them out.
Following the Franco-American alliance, Lapérouse fought against the Royal Navy off the American coast, and victoriously led the frigate Astree in the Naval battle of Louisbourg, 21 July 1781. He was promoted to the rank of commodore when he defeated the English frigate Ariel in the West Indies. In August 1782 he made his name by capturing two English forts (Prince of Wales Fort and York Fort) on the coast of Hudson Bay, but allowed the survivors, including Governor Samuel Hearne of Prince of Wales Fort, to sail off to England in exchange for a promise to release French prisoners held in England. The next year his family finally consented to his marriage to Louise-Eléonore Broudou, a young creole of modest origins whom he had met on Ile de France (present-day Mauritius)Novaresio, 1996. p. 181 "married a young Creole girl ... met ... at Mauritius" eight years earlier.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=James|title=Review of Where Fate Beckons: The Life of Jean-Francois de La Pérouse, by John Dunmore|journal=Journal of Historical Biography|date=Spring 2009|volume=5|pages=123–127|url=http://www.ufv.ca/jhb/Volume_5/Volume_5_Pritchard.pdf[/tpl]

==Scientific expedition - around the world==

===Objectives===

Lapérouse was appointed in 1785 by Louis XVI and his Minister of the Marine, the Marquis de Castries, to lead an expedition around the world.
Louis XVI and his court had been stimulated by a proposal from the merchant adventurer William Bolts, who had earlier tried unsuccessfully to interest Louis’s brother-in-law, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (brother of Queen Marie Antoinette), in a similar voyage. The French court adopted the concept (though not its author, Bolts), leading to the dispatch of the Lapérouse expedition. Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Director of Ports and Arsenals, stated in the draft memorandum on the expedition that he submitted to the King: "the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery ... has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise". But Fleurieu explained to the King: "I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts".Robert J. King, "William Bolts and the Austrian Origins of the Lapérouse Expedition", Terrae Incognitae, vol.40, 2008, pp.1-28.
The expedition's aims were to complete the Pacific discoveries of James Cook (whom Lapérouse greatly admired), correct and complete maps of the area, establish trade contacts, open new maritime routes and enrich French science and scientific collections. His ships were the Astrolabe (under Fleuriot de Langle) and the Boussole,Novaresio, 1996. p. 181 "Lapérouse's ships, the Astrolabe  and the Boussole" both 500 tons. They were storeships reclassified as frigates for the occasion.  Their objectives were geographic, scientific, ethnological, economic (looking for opportunities for whaling or fur trading), and political (the eventual establishment of French bases or colonial cooperation with their Spanish allies in the Philippines).  They were to explore both the north and south Pacific, including the coasts of the Far East and of Australia, and send back reports through existing European outposts in the Pacific.

===Preparations===

As early as March 1785, Lapérouse proposed that Paul Monneron, who had been chosen as the expedition's chief engineer, go to London to find out about the anti-scurvy measures recommended by Cook and the exchange items used by Cook in his dealings with native peoples, and to buy scientific instruments of English manufacture.The French Navy archives contain an interesting series of letters sent by Monneron to Lapérouse and de Castries during his mission to England.  Presenting himself as an agent accredited by a Spanish lord, Monneron talked to junior officers who had known Cook.  He met John Webber, the artist on the Resolution and painter of a justly famous painting of Cook as well as several drawings of north-west America.  Besides his research findings, Webber passed on several other pieces of useful information: how to behave towards the native peoples, English prices for necessities for the voyage (showing him there was no financial advantage in buying exchange items in England rather than France), and above all, advice on anti-scurvy measures, particularly malt, of which Monneron dispatched several barrels to Paris, and how to cook antiscorbutic preparations with ships' rations.
The best-known figure from Cook's missions, Joseph Banks,Extract from Lapérouse's journal: I here must witness my recognition of Sir Joseph Banks, who, having realised that Monsieur de Monneron could not find an inclining compass in London, wished to lend us those that had served the famous captain Cook.  I received these instruments with a sentiment of religious respect for the memory of this great man. intervened at the Royal Society to obtain for Monneron two inclining compasses that had belonged to Cook. Furnished with a list produced by Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Monneron also bought scientific instruments from some of the largest English firms, particularly Ramsden. He even surpassed Fleurieu's directives by acquiring two sextants of a new type.

====Crew====

Lapérouse was well liked by his men. Among his 114-man crew there were ten scientists: Joseph Lepaute Dagelet (1751-1788), an astronomer and mathematician; Robert de Lamanon, a geologist; La Martinière, a botanist; a physicist; three naturalists; and three illustrators, Gaspard Duché de Vancy and an uncle and nephew named Prévost.Novaresio, 1996. p. 184 "the mathematician and astronomer Dagelet, the botanist La Martiniére and the geologist Lamanon. Then there were the geographers, the physicists, the physicians, and the illustrators like Duché de Vancy and the two Prévosts (uncle and nephew)." Another of the scientists was Jean-André Mongez.  Even both chaplains were scientifically schooled.
One of the men who applied for the voyage was a 16-year-old Corsican named Napoléon Bonaparte.Robert W. Kirk, "Paradise Past: The Transformation of the South Pacific, 1520-1929", McFarland & Company, Inc., 2012, p.206.  Bonaparte, a second lieutenant from Paris's military academy at the time, made the preliminary list but he was ultimately not chosen for the voyage list and remained behind in France. At the time Bonaparte was interested in serving in the navy rather than army because of his proficiency in mathematics and artillery, both valued skills on warships.
Copying the work methods of Cook's scientists, the scientists on this voyage would base their calculations of longitude on precision watches and the distance between the moon and the sun followed by theodolite triangulations or bearings taken from the ship,De Langle's means of taking bearing (navigation)s was exactly that used by Cook. the same as those taken by Cook to produce his maps of the Pacific islands.  As regards geography, Lapérouse decisively showed the rigour and safety of the methods proven by Cook.  From his voyage, the resolution of the problem of longitude was evident and mapping attained a scientific precision.  Impeded (as Cook had been) by the continual mists enveloping the northwestern coast of America, he nevertheless did not succeed any better in producing complete maps, though he managed to fill in some of the gaps.

===Chile and Hawaii===

Lapérouse and his 220 men left Brest on 1 August 1785,Novaresio, 1996. p. 181 "The expedition ... left the port of Brest on the 1st of August, 1785" rounded Cape Horn, investigated the Spanish colonial government in the Captaincy General of Chile.Novaresio, 1996. p. 186 "stopping on the coast of Chile" He arrived on 9 April 1786 at  Easter Island Jean-François de Galaup, count de Lapérouse [tpl]Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046652 |title=Jean-François de Galaup, count de Lapérouse |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=20 September 2006[/tpl]
He then sailed to the Sandwich Islands, the present-day Hawaiian Islands,Novaresio, 1996. p. 186 "Lapérouse headed for Easter Island ... left the island two days after his arrival ... after a brief stop in the Hawaiian Islands" where he became the first European to set foot on the island of Maui.

===Alaska===

Lapérouse sailed on to Alaska, where he landed near Mount St. Elias in late June 1786Novaresio, 1996. p. 186 "Towards mid-June ... the coast of Alaska, dominated by ... Mount Saint Elias" and explored the environs. On 13 July 1786 a barge and two longboats, carrying 21 men, were lost in the heavy currents of the bay called Port des Français by Lapérouse, but now known as Lituya Bay.Novaresio, 1996. p.  186–187 "entered a deep inlet that was baptised French Port (now Lituya Bay) ... On the 13th of July, 1786 .. Only one of the three boats that landed returned ...engulfed by a particularly violent ebb tide. ... Around twenty men perished" The men visited with the Tlingit tribe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=3017 |title=Pérouse, Jean-Francois de la |publisher=abcbookworld.com[/tpl] This encounter was dramatized briefly in episode 13 of Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. Next, he headed south, exploring the northwest coast, including the outer islands of present day British Columbia [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.garylittle.ca/maps-historic/perouse.html |title=Lapérouse: 1786 Chart of the B.C.

===California===

Lapérouse sailed during  10–30 August all the way south to the Spanish Las Californias Province, present day California. He reportedly observed the only historical eruption of Mount Shasta on 7 September 1786, although this account is disputed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B4.htm |title=Early Exploration: Lapérouse Expedition, 1786, (Lapérouse, contrary to legend, did not see Mount Shasta in eruption in 1786) |publisher=siskiyous.edy |accessdate=27 April 2007[/tpl] He stopped in San Francisco long enough to create an outline map of the Bay Area, "Plan du Port du St. Francois," which was reproduced as Map 33  in L. Aubert's 1797 "Atlas du Voyage de la Perouse." He arrived in Monterey Bay and at the Presidio of Monterey on 14 September 1786.Novaresio, 1996. p. 187 "Monterey ... was reached on the 14th of September"  He examined the Spanish pueblo settlements, ranchos, and Las Californias missions. He made critical notes on the missionary treatment of the California indigenous peoples with the Indian Reductions at the Franciscan run missions. France and Spain were on friendly terms at this time. Lapérouse was the first non-Spanish visitor to California since Drake stopped by in 1579, and the first to come to California after the founding of some Spanish missions and presidios.

===East Asia===

Lapérouse again crossed the Pacific Ocean in 100 days, arriving at Macau, where he sold the furs acquired in Alaska, dividing the profits among his men.Novaresio, 1996. p. 187 "After 100 days of sailing ... reached the port of Macao.  ... trying to trade the furs they had acquired in North America" The next year, on 9 April 1787,Novaresio, 1996. p. 187, 191 "On the 9th of April, 1787, ... set sail for Japan." after a visit to Manila, he set out for the northeast Asian coasts. He saw the island of Quelpart, present day Cheju, which had been visited by Europeans only once before when a group of Dutchmen shipwrecked there in 1635. He visited the Asian mainland coasts of Korea.

===Japan and Russia===

Lapérouse then sailed northward to Northeast Asia and Oku-Yeso Island, present day Sakhalin Island, Russia. The Ainu people, Oku-Yeso Island residents, drew him a map showing: their second domain of Yezo Island, present day Hokkaidō Island, Japan; and the coasts of Tartary, Russia on mainland Asia. Lapérouse wanted to sail north through the narrow Strait of Tartary between Oku-Yeso Island and mainland Asia but failed. Instead he turned south, and then sailed west through La Pérouse Strait, between Oku-Yeso Island (Sakhalin) and (Hokkaidō), where he met more Ainu in their third domain of the Kuril Islands, and explored.
Lapérouse then sailed north and reached Petropavlovsk on the Russian Kamchatka peninsula on 7 September 1787.Novaresio, 1996. p. 191 "On the 7th of September, the expedition reached the coast of Kamchatka.  The Russian authorities at Petropavlosk" Here they rested from their trip, and enjoyed the hospitality of the Russians and Kamchatkans. In letters received from Paris Lapérouse was ordered to investigate the settlement the British were establishing in New South Wales, Australia. Barthélemy de Lesseps, the French vice consul at Kronstadt, Russia that had joined the expedition as an interpreter, disembarked in Petropavlovsk to bring the expedition's ships' logs, charts, and letters to France, which he reached after a year-long, epic journey across Siberia and Russia.Novaresio, 1996. p. 191 "to send a young officer across Siberia and Russia to France with the ships' logs and the valuable charts."

===South Pacific===

Lapérouse next stopped in the Navigator Islands (Samoa), on 6 December 1787.Novaresio, 1996. p. 191 "On the 6th of December, ... the explorers dropped anchor off a Samoan island." Just before he left, the Samoans attacked a group of his men, killing twelve of them, among whom were Lamanon and de Langle, commander of the Astrolabe. Twenty men were wounded.Novaresio, 1996. p. 191 "The squad ... was attacked as they were returning to their boats, and 12 men were killed, including De Langle, Lamanon and another officer. Another 20 were seriously wounded." The expedition drifted to Tonga, for resupply and help.

===Australia===

The expedition continued to Australia,Novaresio, 1996. p. 192 "After having reached Tonga, he headed toward Australia" arriving off Botany Bay on 24 January 1788,David Hill, 1788: The Brutal Truth of the First Fleet just as Captain Arthur Phillip was attempting to move the colony from there to Sydney Cove in Port Jackson.[tpl]cite journal |first= Robert J |last= King |title=What brought Lapérouse to Botany Bay? |publisher=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society |volume=85, pt.2 |date = December 1999|pages=140–147 |url=http://search.informit.com.au/search;res=APAFT[/tpl]  The First Fleet was unable to leave until 26 January because of a tremendous gale, which also prevented Lapérouse's ships from entering Botany Bay.
The British received him courteously, and each captain, through their officers, offered the other any assistance and needed supplies. During the 6 weeks of this last recorded landfall the French established the first observatory in the new colony, were responsible for the first Christian services(Catholic masses), the first geological observations, and the first garden. Their chaplain/scientist from L'Astrolabe was buried here and mass is celebrated annually on the anniversary of his death. Although Phillip and Laperouse did not meet, there were 11 visits recorded between the French and EnglishProtos, A.(2000) The Road to Botany Bay. Randwick & District Historical Society Inc. Over the past 200 years Commanders from the French navy have regularly paid their respects at the Laperouse Monument. Laperouse Day, Bastille Day and the foundation of the Laperouse Monument by Hyacinthe de Bougainville are celebrated every year.
Lapérouse took the opportunity to send his journals, some charts and also some letters back to Europe with a British naval ship from the First Fleet—the Alexander.http://laperousemuseum.org/french-firsts/first-mail/ He also obtained wood and fresh water and, on 10 March, left for New Caledonia, Santa Cruz, the Solomons, the Louisiades, and the western and southern coasts of Australia.
Lapérouse wrote that he expected to be back in France by June 1789, however neither he, nor any of his men, were seen again. Fortunately the valuable written documents that he dispatched with the Alexander from the in-progress expedition were returned to Paris, where they were published posthumously.

==Epilogue==

===Rescue mission of D'Entrecasteaux===

On 25 September 1791 Rear Admiral Bruni d'Entrecasteaux departed Brest in search of Lapérouse. His expedition followed Lapérouse's proposed path through the islands northwest of Australia while at the same time making scientific and geographic discoveries. The expedition consisted of two ships, Recherche and Esperance.[tpl]cite web|title=The fate of La Perouse|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/society_art/french/perouse/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=7 February 2013[/tpl]
In May 1793, he arrived at the island of Vanikoro, which is part of the Santa Cruz group of islands.  D'Entrecasteaux thought he saw smoke signals from several elevated areas on the island, but was unable to investigate due to the dangerous reefs surrounding the island and had to leave.  He died two months later.  The botanist Jacques Labillardière, attached to the expedition, eventually returned to France and published his account, Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse, in 1800.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/sep02/article5.html|title=In search of Lapérouse|last=Duyker|first=Edward|date = September 2002|work=NLA news Volume XII Number 12|publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
During the revolution, Franco-British relations deteriorated and unfounded rumours spread in France blaming the British for the tragedy which had occurred in the vicinity of the new colony.  Before the mystery was solved the revolutionary French government had published the records of the voyage as far as Kamchatka: Voyage De La Pérouse Autour du Monde, 1–4 (Paris, 1797). These volumes are still used for cartographic and scientific information about the Pacific. Three English translations were published during 1798–99.[tpl]cite web|title=La Pérouse, Jean-François de Galaup (1741–1788)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/la-perouse-jean-francois-de-galaup-2329|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=14 February 2013[/tpl]

===Discovery of the expedition===

====1826 expedition====

It was not until 1826 that an Irish sea captain, Peter Dillon, found enough evidence to piece together the events of the tragedy. In Tikopia (one of the islands of Santa Cruz), he bought some swords that he had reason to believe had belonged to Lapérouse or his officers. He made enquiries, and found that they came from nearby Vanikoro, where two big ships had broken up years earlier. Dillon managed to obtain a ship in Bengal, and sailed for the coral atoll of Vanikoro where he found cannonballs, anchors and other evidence of the remains of ships in water between coral reefs.
He brought several of these artifacts back to Europe, as did Dumont d'Urville in 1828.Novaresio, 1996. p. 192 "Dumont d'Urville locate the remains of a wreck on the reef around the coral atoll of Vanikoro ... The material recovered ... belonged to the Astrolabe." De Lesseps, the only member of the original expedition still alive at the time, identified them as all belonging to the Astrolabe. From the information Dillon received from the people on Vanikoro, a rough reconstruction could be made of the disaster that struck Lapérouse. Dillon's reconstruction was later confirmed by the discovery, and subsequent examination in 1964, of what was believed to be the shipwreck of the Boussole.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.laperouse-france.fr/spip.php?rubrique67 |title=After Vanikoro-In Search of the Lapérouse Expedition (Lapérouse Museum) |location=Albi, France |publisher=laperouse-france.fr[/tpl] (See below.)

====2005 expedition====

In May 2005, the shipwreck examined in 1964 was formally identified as that of the Boussole.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200505/s1364055.htm |title=La Perouse wreck identified in Solomon Is |publisher=abc.net.au[/tpl] The 2005 expedition had embarked aboard the Jacques Cartier, a French naval vessel.

A further similar mission was mounted in 2008.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://lemysterelaperouse.blogspot.com/2008/05/vanikoro-2008-report-de-la-mission.html |title=Le mystère Lapérouse - Vanikoro 2008 - Report de la mission |date=2 May 2008|publisher=lemysterelaperouse.blogspot.com |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.operationlaperouse2008.fr/ |title=Expédition Lapérouse 2008 |publisher=operationlaperouse2008.fr |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |first=Vale Reece |last=Discombe (1919-2007) |page=10 |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/pambu/newsletters/Pambu24Jun08.htm |title=Pacific Manuscripts Bureau Newsletter |publisher=rspas.anu.edu.au |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl]
The 2008 expedition showed the commitment of France, in conjunction with the New Caledonian 'Association Salomon', to seek further answers about Lapérouse's mysterious fate. It received the patronage of the President of France as well as the support and co-operation of the French Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and the Ministry of Culture and Communication.
Preparation for this, the eighth expedition sent to Vanikoro, took 24 months. It brought together more technological resources than previously and involved two ships, 52 crew members and almost 30 scientists and researchers. On 16 September 2008, two French Navy boats set out for Vanikoro from Nouméa (New Caledonia) and arrived on 15 October, thus recreating a section of the final voyage of discovery undertaken more than 200 years earlier by Lapérouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eramet.fr/us/Site/Template/T1.aspx?SELECTID=214&ID=146 |title=Lapérouse operation 2008 |publisher=eramet.fr |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.operationlaperouse2008.fr/ |title=Expéditon Lapérouse 2008 |publisher=operationlaperouse 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl]On 8 September, Mr. Patrick Buffet took part in the press conference organised at the Press Club de France to launch Operation Lapérouse 2008, which was attended by Admiral Jean-Louis Battet [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eramet.fr/us/Site/Template/T1.aspx?SELECTID=214&ID=146 |title=Launch of "Lapérouse 2008" Operation |accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |title=Le mystère Lapérouse, enquête dans le Pacifique sud |location=Musée de la Marine - Paris |url=http://www.marine-marchande.net/FM/Laperouse_Expo-2008/index_Laperouse_Expo-2008.htm[/tpl]

==The saga==

Both ships had been wrecked on Vanikoro's reefs, the Boussole first. The Astrolabe was unloaded and taken apart. A group of men, probably the survivors of the Boussole, was massacred by the local inhabitants.Australian Shipwrecks - vol1 1622–1850, Charles Bateson, AH and AW Reed, Sydney, 1972, ISBN 0-589-07112-2, p24 According to the islanders, some surviving sailors built a two-masted craft from the wreckage of the Astrolabe and left in a westward direction about nine months later; but what happened to them is unknown. Also, two men, one a "chief" and the other his servant, had remained behind, but had left Vanikoro a few years before Dillon arrived.Peter Dillon, Narrative and Successful Result of a Voyage in the South Seas, Performed by Order of the Government of British India, to Ascertain the Actual Fate of Lapérouse's Expedition, in 2 volumes, London 1829.
Sven Wahlroos, in his 1989 book, "Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas", suggests that there was a narrowly missed chance to rescue one or more of the survivors in 1791.Wahlroos, Sven, "Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas", Salem House Publishers, c/o Harper & Row, New York, NY, 1989
In November 1790, Captain Edward Edwards—in command of HMS Pandora—had sailed from England with orders to comb the Pacific for the mutineers of HMS Bounty. In March of the following year, the Pandora arrived at Tahiti and picked up 14 Bounty men who had stayed on that island. Although some of the 14 had not joined the mutiny, all were imprisoned and shackled in a cramped "cage" built on the deck, which the men grimly nicknamed "Pandora's Box". The Pandora then left Tahiti in search of the Bounty and the leader of the mutiny, Fletcher Christian.
Captain Edwards' search for the remaining mutineers ultimately proved fruitless. However, when passing Vanikoro on 13 August 1791, smoke signals were observed rising from the island. Edwards, single-minded in his search for the Bounty and convinced that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, ignored the smoke signals and sailed on.
Wahlroos argues that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lapérouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time—three years after the Boussole and Astrolabe had foundered. Wahlroos is "virtually certain" that Captain Edwards, whom he characterizes as one of England's most "ruthless," "inhuman," "callous" and "incompetent" naval captains, missed his chance to become "one of the heroes of maritime history" by solving the mystery of the lost Lapérouse expedition.

==Places named after Lapérouse==

Places named in his honour include:
The Micronesian Scrubfowl (Megapodius laperouse) is also named after Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. The species is currently classified as endangered because it has a very small range, restricted to isolated undisturbed offshore islets. Megapodius laperouse occurs on Palau and the Northern Mariana Islands (to USA), and is extirpated from Guam (to USA)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=125&m=0 |title=Micronesian Megapode  Megapodius laperouse |publisher=Birdlife International |accessdate=8 October 2010 [/tpl]
