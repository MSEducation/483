Music from the Motion Picture Juno, released on January 8, 2008, is the soundtrack that accompanies the Academy Award-winning film Juno.

==Background==

The album features several songs performed by Kimya Dawson and her bands Antsy Pants and The Moldy Peaches, due to a suggestion by lead actress Ellen Page:[tpl]Cite journal |title=Music from the Motion Picture Juno (Liner Notes) |date=2007-11-04 |author=Reitman, Jason [/tpl]
 
 At one point, I Jason Reitman asked Ellen Page before we started shooting, 'What do you think Juno listens to?' And she said, 'The Moldy Peaches.' She went on my computer, played the songs, and I fell in love with it. Diablo Cody and I discussed putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches and she started sending me her work, which was beautiful, and that became a lot of the soundtrack.

Initially, Reitman conceived of the character being a fan of glam rock, but rejected it as too inauthentic. He replaced this by scoring the film with Yo La Tengo, but got into contact with Dawson after listening to "Anyone Else but You". Dawson insisted on seeing the screenplay before allowing her songs to be in the film, after which she agreed to send Reitman a package of her solo albums to review.Rolling Stone 1046, February 24, 2008, p. 16
The Michael Cera/Ellen Page cover of "Anyone Else but You" was recorded on the last day of filming on the streets of Vancouver. During rehearsal, Dawson coached the duo on how to perform it and thought "'Aw, man, they sing it better than us.' They sing it so cute."
