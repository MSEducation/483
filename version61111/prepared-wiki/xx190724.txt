[[Manganese(II,III) oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Manganese compounds, Oxides, Mixed valence compounds

Manganese(II,III) oxide is the chemical compound with formula Mn3O4. Manganese is present in two oxidation states +2 and +3 and the formula is sometimes written as MnO.Mn2O3. Mn3O4 is found in nature as the mineral hausmannite.

==Preparation==

Mn3O4 formed when any manganese oxide is heated in air above 1000 °C.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] Considerable research has centred on producing nano-crystalline Mn3O4 and various syntheses that involve oxidation of MnII or reduction of MnVI.Hausmannite Mn3O4 nanorods: synthesis, characterization and magnetic properties Jin Du et al.

==Structure==

Mn3O4 has the spinel structure, where the oxide ions are cubic close packed and the MnII occupy tetrahedral sites and the MnIII octahedral sites. The structure is distorted due to a   Jahn-Teller effect. At room temperature Mn3O4 is paramagnetic, below 41-43 K, it is ferrimagnetic.Magnetic Structure of Mn3O4 by Neutron Diffraction Boucher B., Buhl R., Perrin M., J. Appl.

==Uses==

Mn3O4 is sometimes used as a starting material in the production of soft ferrites e.g. manganese zinc  ferrite,[ref]Method of making manganese-zinc ferrite  U.S Patent number: 4093688 (1978)
