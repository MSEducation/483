In mid-2005, Bright was named as one of three players in the New Zealand Knights' apprenticeship scheme. Shortly after the start of the season, though, Knights player Neil Emblen  was forced onto the injured list, which would allow the club to sign Bright as a replacement for four weeks.[tpl]cite web| title=Bright gets big chance as Emblen ruled out| url=http://www.nzknights.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=2129| date=27 October 2005| accessdate=4 October 2006[/tpl] Bright was rushed into the squad to play the Central Coast Mariners at North Harbour Stadium,[tpl]cite web| title=Knights look on the Bright side| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=242&ObjectID=10352555| work=The New Zealand Herald| last=Maddaford| first=Terry| date=29 October 2005| accessdate=4 October 2006[/tpl] and produced a Man of the Match performance as he played the full 90 minutes on debut as the New Zealand side went down 1-3.[tpl]cite web| title=Match Summary: New Zealand Knights FC vs Central Coast Mariners FC| url=http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000260089/scoreboard.html| date=29 October 2005| accessdate=4 October 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Bright's performance in his first match earned praise from Knights manager John Adshead, and he was rewarded with a starting place in the following match against the Newcastle United Jets.[tpl]cite web| title=Knights build Kiwi contingent| url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/624348| work=One Sport| date=3 November 2005| accessdate=4 October 2006[/tpl] Bright appeared in the Knights's following four games up until Emblen's return from injury, but had done enough to retain his position in the squad, having signed another short-term contract, this time to cover for Joshua Rose.[tpl]cite web| title=Emblen back to face Sydney| url=http://www.nzknights.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=2804| date=29 December 2005| accessdate=4 October 2006[/tpl] By the end of the 2005–06 season, Bright had made a total of 12 appearances, three from the substitutes bench.[tpl]cite web| title=New Zealand squad named to play in Oceania qualifiers| url=http://www.nzsoccer.com/files/u20_final_squad.pdf| work=NZ Soccer| format=pdf| accessdate=4 October 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060823043818/http://nzsoccer.com/files/u20_final_squad.pdf  |archivedate = 23 August 2006[/tpl]
In mid-2006, Bright was asked to trial at Scottish side Kilmarnock, where he was for a month, playing three games & scoring 2 goals.

Bright managed to gain a spot in the starting line-up for the struggling Dutch side. He played in eleven league games, in which he scored one goal, against HFC Haarlem. After interest from Norway, he signed a six-month contract until the end of the Norwegian season with Norwegian club Kristiansund BK. There he scored an amazing 11 goals in 8 games until his season was ended prematurely . With two games remaining in the season and several Norwegian Tippeligaen & Adeccoligaen clubs following his progress, Bright suffered a broken leg. Bright then renewed his contract with Kristiansund BK until January 2009.
After 6 months of recovery, Bright then made his return in the 2008 season opener against Strindheim. He continued his goal scoring form with 2 goals including a 25 metre free-kick to help Kristiansund to a 3-1 win. After playing 12 games, he was top goal-scorer in the league with 10 goals. Also, in the 3rd round of the Norwegian Cup, Bright scored KBK's only goal against Tippeligaen club & close rivals Molde F.K. in a 2-1 extra-time loss.
After a season full of goals again in Norway,  Bright had done enough to sign a 1 and a 1/2 year contract with Greek Super League side Panserraikos F.C., he was given the #32 shirt. He left the Club in July 2009 by mutual consent with a year remaining on his contract due to unpaid wages, and joined English League Two side Shrewsbury Town on 3 August 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/8182184.stm | work=BBC Sport | title=Shrewsbury secure double signing | date=3 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]

He made a total of 26 league appearances in the 2009-10 season, including 22 from the bench, scoring three goals.
After interest from Hungary earlier in the year, and with a new manager arriving at Shrewsbury Town, Bright then found himself signing a 2.5 year deal with former Hungarian giants Honved Budapest on a free transfer. Unfortunately at the end of the first season at the club, and with the club having huge financial difficulties and unable to pay full wages, Bright was to find a new club. 
On 3 October 2011 Bright joined Maltese club Balzan Youths on a short-term deal. Bright linked up Balzan until December before he made the move to Bryne FK in Norway in January. Bright accepted the offer of joining Balzan so that he could maintain his match fitness prior to the move to Bryne. The move was a success helping the recently promoted side to a top 6 finish scoring 5 crucial goals in 10 starts for the club. The 25-year-old had agreed a pre-contract with Bryne and joined up on 1.1.2012.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12040_7220350,00.html | work=Sky Sports News | title=Bright makes Malta move | date=3 October 2009 | accessdate=16 October 2011[/tpl]
After half a season in Bryne, Bright then found himself playing in an accustomed midfield role. With the team struggling in the league, limited opportunities as a striker, and offers from other teams, Bright signed a short term deal on August 2 with FC Haka in the Finland Premier League. Bright cited his reasons for leaving were "to get regular playing time as a striker to score goals". On March 2013 Bright signed a deal with IFK Mariehamn in the Finland Premier Leageue for the whole season 2013.
On 08/03/14 it was announced Bright had signed for Lincoln City for the rest of the season.
