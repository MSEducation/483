==Economy==

The climatic conditions in Homalin have been found suitable to grow Rubber plantations. The conditions have been well exploited by establishing viable rubber cultivation practices by introducing high-yield strains like the PRIM 600, PB-260, BPM-24, GT-1 and PBIG. This has resulted in expansion of rubber plantation areas in the township, which has created ample employment opportunities to the local people and thus improved their economic conditions and living standards. Pineapple plants are also intercropped within the rubber plantations to make the economic yield from the land even more viable.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yYq5C4ZyfHwJ:www.mrtv3.net.mm/open5/251208for.html+Agriculture+in+Homalin&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in|title=White gold plantations of Chindwin region|work= Rubber and pineapple plants seen in Aung Thukha (Lin) rubber plantation of U Aung Than Myint in Homalin Township|accessdate=2010-09-27|publisher=Mirror Daily[/tpl] Since Rubber has a world wide demand, local people have been urged to expand area under cultivate rubber cultivation as also as tea as a commercial venture.

===Hydropower development===

As a part of the overall economic development of the Chindwin region in its upper reaches, several hydropower projects have been planned on the Chindwin River, which includes the Homalin Hydropower Project with a capacity of 150 MW. This project also envisages benefits of irrigation.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mm3YjpwiiLYJ:www.myanmar.gov.mm/Article/Article2004/Apr/Apr10a.htm+Economy+of+Homalin&cd=24&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in|title= Hydroelectric power projects on the golden rivers|accessdate=2010-09-28|publisher=The New Light of Myanmar|date=2004-04-04[/tpl]
The Tamanthi Dam which is component part of the Tamanthi Hydroelectric Project (installed capacity 1200 MW) on the Chindwin River, which was under planning and investigations since 2004, is to be implemented with assistance from the Government of India,  following a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on September 16, 2008 between the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) of India and the Government of Burma,  as a joint venture project. The submergence under this project which is now under implementation, has serious issues of displacements of 380 families from Leivomjang and Tazong villages that would come under submergence between Tamanthi and Homalin in Sagaing Division.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://archive.is/20130414094823/http://www.burmariversnetwork.org/dam-projects/tamanthi.html|title= Tamanthi Dam|accessdate=2010-09-28|publisher=Burma Rivers network[/tpl]
