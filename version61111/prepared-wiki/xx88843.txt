===Labor===

On 15 October 1997, Kernot abruptly defected to the Australian Labor Party, resigning her Senate seat and leaving the leadership of the Democrats to her deputy, Meg Lees. In her resignation speech, Kernot did not criticise the Democrats, saying her motivation was due to a "growing sense of outrage at the damage being done to Australia by the Howard Government" and that her position leading a minor party in the Senate meant she "had a limited capacity to help minimise that damage".[ref]
</ref>  She also stated that she was "well aware of the political risks in this course of action".<ref name="resignationspeech"/> Some derided Kernot because of her ambition; and, according to journalist Julia Baird,<ref name="baird">
</ref> she "found herself at odds with the leadership of the Labor Party". Baird went on to say that "...[Kernot]...unravelled publicly under the stress, and she was portrayed in print as a has-been, a whinger and a poor performer".<ref name="baird"/>
Kernot narrowly won the outer metropolitan Brisbane seat of Dickson for Labor at the 1998 election, before losing it at the 2001 election to the Liberal Party candidate Peter Dutton.  During her period as Member for Dickson, Kernot served in the Shadow Ministry, and held the roles of Shadow Minister for Regional Development, Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Services from 1998 to 1999, and Shadow Minister for Employment and Training from 1999 to 2001.

==Life outside politics==

After retiring from politics, Kernot wrote a "full and frank"[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] biography called Speaking for Myself, which was published in 2002.  The book purported to accurately portray Kernot's political history.[ref]
