[[Artistic freedom]]

CATEGORIES: Visual arts, Freedom of expression

Artistic freedom is the extent of freedom of an artist to produce art to his/her own insight. The extent can deviate to customs in a certain school of art, directives of the assigner, etc.
Artistic freedom should not be confused to the freedom of art (e.g. Kunstfreiheit in Germanic countries), where it is a constitutional provision to prevent political censorship. Software patents are often seen as an example of one of these restrictions.
