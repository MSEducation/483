==Geography==

Land's End has a particular resonance because it is often used to suggest distance. Land's End to John o' Groats in Scotland is a distance of [tpl]convert|838|mi|km[/tpl] by road and this Land's End to John o' Groats distance is often used to define charitable events such as end-to-end walks and races in the UK.
There are two varieties of granite represented at Land's End. Adjacent to the hotel the granite is course grained with large phenocrysts of orthoclase, sometimes more than [tpl]convert|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. To the north, at the First and Last House, there is a finer grained granite with fewer and smaller phenocrysts, and the different granites can be seen from a distance by the smoother weathering of the finer variety. The granite dates to 268–275 million years ago of the Permian period.[tpl]cite book|last=Hall|first=A|title=Geologist's Association Guide No. 19.

The Longships, a group of rocky islets are just over a [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] mile offshore, and together with the Seven Stones Reef and the Isles of Scilly which lie approximately [tpl]convert|28|mi|km[/tpl] southwest — are part of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature.
The headland has been designated part of an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for rare species of flora.[tpl]cite web|title=Land's End|url=http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/important_plant_areas/lands_end|publisher=Plantlife|accessdate=7 February 2012[/tpl]

==History==

In 1769, the antiquarian William Borlase wrote:
 "Of this time we are to understand what Edward I. says (Sheringham. p. 129.) that Britain, Wales, and Cornwall, were the portion of Belinus, elder son of Dunwallo, and that that part of the Island, afterwards called England, was divided in three shares, viz. Britain, which reached from the Tweed, Westward, as far as the river Ex; Wales inclosed by the rivers Severn, and Dee; and Cornwall from the river Ex to the Land's-End". 
In 1987 Peter de Savary purchased Land’s End for almost £7 million from David Goldstone.[tpl]cite web |title=1987: Millionaire's big plans for English landmark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2538000/2538261.stm |publisher =BBC |year=2008 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |quote=Land's End in Cornwall has been sold for nearly £7m to the property tycoon, Peter de Savary.[/tpl] He had two new buildings erected and much of the present theme park development was instigated by him[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl].
