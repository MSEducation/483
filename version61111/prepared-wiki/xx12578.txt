Yoko Ono (オノ・ヨーコ 小野 洋子 Ono Yōko), born February 18, 1933, is a Japanese artist, singer-songwriter, and peace activist. She is the second wife and widow of John Lennon and is also known for her work in avant-garde art, music and filmmaking.[tpl]cite news|url=http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|title=Yoko Ono retrospective opens in Frankfurt|date=February 16, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Malaysia[/tpl]
Dropping out of the graduate track program in philosophy at Tokyo's Peers School, Ono moved to New York in 1953 joining her immediate family who were already there. After some time at Sarah Lawrence College, she became involved in New York City's downtown artists scene, collaborating and working with members in and around the Fluxus group. An independent artist in her own right before meeting Lennon, both the media and the public were critical of her for years. She was repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music, and blamed for the breakup of the Beatles: The couple's early years coincided with the band's final ones. Her experimental art was also not popularly understood, and, after Lennon's death, her disagreements with Paul McCartney received as much attention as her billboards and music releases, which the media usually advanced simply as attempts at self-promotion.
This public perception shifted over time, helped by, among other things, a retrospective at a Whitney Museum branch in 1989. This was followed by a 1992 interview in L.A.-based music magazine, Option which coincided with the release of the six-disc box set Onobox. Retrospectives of her artwork were presented at the Japan Society in New York City in 2001, in Bielefeld, Germany, and the UK in 2008, and Frankfurt, Krems, Austria, and Bilbao, Spain in 2013. She received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009 and the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art.
As Lennon's widow she works to preserve his legacy, funding and maintaining Strawberry Fields in New York City, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan. Individually and under her and Lennon's name, she has made significant philanthropic contributions to arts, peace, Philippine and Japan disaster relief, and outreach programs for AIDS and autism. She has a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from her marriage to Anthony Cox and a son, Sean Lennon, from her marriage to Lennon. She and Sean collaborate frequently musically.
She brought feminism to the forefront in her music influencing artists as diverse as the B-52s and Meredith Monk. Her collaborative albums with Lennon under the Plastic Ono Band rubric — Live Peace in Toronto 1969 and 1972's Some Time in New York City — reached No. 10 and No. 48 on the album charts respectively. (Double Fantasy from 1980, released three weeks before Lennon's death, reached No. 1.)  Since 2003, eleven of her songs, mostly remixes of her older work, have hit No. 1 on the US dance chart.
She and Lennon famously used their honeymoon as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War in their Bed-Ins for Peace in Amsterdam and Montreal in spring of 1969. In addition to co-writing "Give Peace a Chance,"[tpl]cite book |first=Philip |last=Norman |title=John Lennon: The Life |year=2008 |publisher=Doubleday Canada |page= 608 |isbn= 978-0-385-66100-3[/tpl] she also co-wrote with Lennon the experimental piece, "Revolution 9" on The White Album, and contributed lead vocals on "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill," the latter marking the only occasion in the entire Beatles catalog where a woman sings lead vocal. Ono has also remained on the forefront in activism, inaugurating a biennial $50,000 LennonOno Grant for Peace in 2002 and co-founding the group Artists Against Fracking in 2012. On March 20, 2013, she tweeted an image of Lennon's bloodied glasses to her then-3.7 million Twitter followers with the words, "Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since John Lennon was shot and killed on 8 Dec 1980."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/21/john-lennon-glasses-gun-control|title=Yoko Ono uses photo of John Lennon's bloodied glasses in plea for gun control|publisher=The Guardian|date=March 21, 2013|last=Walker|first=Peter[/tpl]

==Early life and family==

She was born in Tokyo on February 18, 1933, to Isoko Ono (小野 磯子 Ono Isoko) and Eisuke Ono (小野 英輔 Ono Eisuke), a banker and one-time classical pianist.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|title=Yoko Ono: biography| publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 1, 2014[/tpl] Isoko's father was ennobled in 1915. Isoko's paternal grandfather Zenjiro Yasuda (安田 善次郎 Yasuda Zenjirō) was an affiliate of the Yasuda clan and zaibatsu Eisuke came from a long line of samurai warrior-scholars. The kanji translation of Yoko's first name Yoko means "ocean child".
Two weeks before Yoko's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco by his employer, the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rest of the family followed soon after, with Yoko meeting Eisuke when she was two. Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936. Yoko was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of 4.[tpl]harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=231[/tpl] In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's Gakushuin (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.
In 1940, the family moved to New York City. The next year, Eisuke was transferred in 1941 from New York City to Hanoi, and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the Mitsui family. She remained in Tokyo through the great fire-bombing of March 9, 1945, during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special bunker in the Azabu district of Tokyo, far from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with members of her family.
Ono and her family were forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings in a wheelbarrow. It was during this period in her life, Ono says, that she developed her "aggressive" attitude and understanding of "outsider" status when children taunted her and Keisuke, who were once well-to-do.  Other stories have her mother bringing a large number of goods with them to the countryside, where they bartered them for food. In one anecdote, her mother bartered a German-made sewing machine for [tpl]convert|60|kg[/tpl] of rice with which to feed the family. Her father remained in the city and, unbeknownst to them, was believed to have been incarcerated in a prisoner of war camp in China. Ono told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now on October 16, 2007 that "He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually..... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|title=EXCLUSIVE: Yoko Ono on the New Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, Art & Politics, the Peace Movement, Government Surveillance and the Murder of John Lennon|last=Goodman|first=Amy|date=October 16, 2007|work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=25 February 2014[/tpl]
By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the imperial palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. She graduated in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.Murray Sayle, "The Importance of Yoko Ono", JPRI Occasional Paper No. 18, Japan Policy Research Institute, November 2000.

==New York==

===College and downtown beginnings===

Ono's family moved to Scarsdale, New York, without her after the war.  When she later rejoined her family in the US, she enrolled nearby in Sarah Lawrence College.  While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said they were disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they found "beneath" her.  In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets and others who represented the "bohemian" lifestyle for which she longed for herself.  Visiting galleries and art happenings in the city whetted her desire to display her own artistic endeavors publicly. American avant-garde artist, composer and musician La Monte Young, her first important contact in the New York art world, helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|title=Yoko Ono to speak at Stanford, Stanford Report|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Stanford University[/tpl]

===Return to Japan, early career, and motherhood===

In 1956, Ono left college to elope with composer Toshi Ichiyanagi,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014[/tpl] a star in Tokyo's experimental community.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=23[/tpl] After living apart for several years, they filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents and, suffering from clinical depression, she was briefly placed in a mental institution.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|title=Yoko Ono Biography|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)[/tpl] Later that year, on November 28, 1962, Ono married Anthony Cox, an American jazz musician, film producer, and art promoter, who was instrumental in securing her release from the Japanese mental institution. However, because Ono had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi, her second marriage was annulled on March 1, 1963.  After finalizing the divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later on August 8, 1963.
The marriage quickly fell apart, but the Coxes stayed together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo's Sogetsu Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time. Tony also managed her publicity. She and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969. However, in 1971, Cox disappeared with their then-eight-year-old daughter, in the midst of the custody battle. He won custody after claiming Ono was an "unfit mother" for drug use. Ono's ex-husband subsequently raised Kyoko under the name Ruth Holman in an organization known as the Church of the Living Word (or "the Walk").[tpl]cite book|last=Hockinson|first=Michael J.|title=The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan[/tpl] Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, to no avail. She first saw Kyoko again in 1998.

==John Lennon==

Fluxus, a loose association of Dada-inspired avant-garde artists that developed in the early 1960s, was active in New York and Europe[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=27[/tpl] Ono was invited to London for artist and political activist Gustav Metzger's Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966, as the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=168[/tpl]
There are two versions of the story regarding how Lennon met Ono.  According to the first, on November 9, 1966, Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar.[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=682[/tpl] Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece had a ladder with a spyglass at the top.  When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word "YES" which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was "anti" everything.[tpl]cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|title=John Lennon: John Lennon Meets Yoko Ono|last=Buskin|first=Richard|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=April 17, 2014[/tpl]
Lennon was also intrigued by Ono's Hammer A Nail. Viewers hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him.  Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it."  Ono supposedly had not heard of the Beatles, but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."[tpl]cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |year=2000 [/tpl]
In a second version of Ono's and Lennon's first meeting, told by Paul McCartney, Ono was in London in 1965 compiling original musical scores for a book on which John Cage was working entitled Notations.  McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts, but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon did, giving Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "The Word."[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|p=272[/tpl]
In a 2002 interview, she said, "I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation." The two began corresponding and, in September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono's solo show at Lisson Gallery in London.  When Lennon's wife Cynthia asked for an explanation for Ono's telephoning their home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her "avant-garde bullshit."[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=683[/tpl] In early 1968, while the Beatles were making their famous visit to India, Lennon wrote "Julia" and included a reference to Ono: "Ocean child calls me," referring to the translation of Yoko's Japanese spelling.[tpl]cite book|chapter="Brought to Book," 31 July 1971 interview with Alan Smith|title=Uncut Presents NME Originals Beatles-The Solo Years|year=2010|page=42[/tpl] In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/yoko-ono/biography#ixzz2sVEUGotR|title=Yoko Ono: Biography|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=Feb 5, 2014[/tpl] after which, he said, they "made love at dawn".Two Virgins liner notes, Apple, SAPCOR 2 When Lennon's wife returned home, she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, "Oh, hi."Lennon, Cynthia, A Twist of Lennon, Avon, ISBN 978-0-380-45450-1, 1978, p. 183

A few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted, Ono became pregnant though suffered a miscarriage of what would have been a male child on November 21, 1968.[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=510[/tpl]Spitz, Bob, The Beatles: The Biography, 2005, p. 800

===Bed-Ins and other early collaborations===

During Lennon's last two years with the Beatles, he and Ono began attending as well as creating their own public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married at the registry office in Gibraltar on March 20, 1969, and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country.Kruse, Robert J. II, "Geographies of John and Yoko's 1969 Campaign for Peace: An Intersection of Celebrity, Space, Art, and Activism," in Johansson, Ola, Bell, Thomas L., eds., Sound, Society and the Geography of Popular Music, Ashgate, ISBN 978-0-7546-7577-8, 2009, p. 16 They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded "Give Peace a Chance".[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=276[/tpl] Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling "guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me."Norman, Philip, John Lennon: The Life, 2008, Doubleday Canada, p. 608, ISBN 978-0-385-66100-3 The famous couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in "bagism", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song "The Ballad of John and Yoko".Coleman, Ray, Lennon: The Definitive Biography, 1992, p. 550
Lennon changed his name by deed poll on April 22, 1969, switching out Winston for Ono as a middle name.  Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.Coleman, Ray, Lennon: The Definitive Biography, 1984b, p. 64 The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire, in southeast England.Norman, Philip, John Lennon The Life, Hammersmith, England: Harper Collins, 2008, ISBN 978-0-00-719741-5, p. 615 et seq When Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, Abbey Road.Emerick, Massey, 2006, pp. 279–80
The two collaborated on many albums, beginning in 1968 when Lennon was still a Beatle, with Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins, an album of experimental musique concrète. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental piece to The White Album called "Revolution 9".  Also on The White Album, Ono contributed backing vocals on "Birthday",[tpl]cite web|last=Gibron |first=Bill |url=http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|title=An in-depth Look at the Songs on Side-Three|work=Rolling Stone |publisher=The White Album Project |date=21 December 1968 |accessdate=1 February 2014[/tpl] and one line of lead vocals on "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill."  The latter marked the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.Lewisohn,  Mark, 2000, The Complete Beatles Chronicle, London: Hamlyn, ISBN 978-0-600-60033-6, p. 284

===The Plastic Ono Band===

Ono influenced Lennon to produce more "autobiographical" output and, after "The Ballad of John and Yoko", they decided it would be better to form their own band than to put the material out under the Beatles name.McDonald, Ian, Revolution in the Head, 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2007, ISBN 978-1-55652-733-3, 1556527330 In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, Live Peace in Toronto 1969, was recorded during the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed an avant-garde set along with the band, finishing with music that consisted mainly of feedback, while she screamed and sang.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|last=Calkin|first=Graham|title=Live Peace in Toronto 1969|publisher=Jpgr.co.uk|accessdate=February 1, 2014[/tpl]Blaney, John (2005).

===First solo album and Fly===

Ono released her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|title=Women in Music: Trailblazing Female Singers, Songwriters and Musicians|publisher=makers.com[/tpl] and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/yoko-ono-plastic-ono-band-mw0000026229/awards|title=Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band: Awards|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl]
When Lennon was invited to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them.Liner notes to Disc 2, Sometime In New York City album. Later that year, she released Fly, a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including "Midsummer New York" and "Mind Train", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments.  She also received minor airplay with the ballad "Mrs. Lennon".  The track "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter,[tpl]cite book|title=The Beatles: An illustrated record|page=83|year=1978|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53367-7|author=Carr, R. & Tyler, T.[/tpl] and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. That same year, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko, where she would not see her daughter until 1998. It was during this time that she wrote "Don't Worry Kyoko," which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album Live Peace In Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of "Happy Christmas (War Is Over)" when Yoko whispers "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, "Happy Christmas, Julian."Jackson, Andrew Grant. Still the Greatest: The Essential Songs of The Beatles' Solo Careers, Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, July 2012 (p.50)  The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" has since become a Christmas standard.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/now-thats-what-i-call-christmas%21-the-essential-mw0000797209|title=Various Artists: Now That's What I Call Christmas!: The Essential|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/happy-xmas-war-is-over-mt0029822393|title=Happy Xmas (War Is Over): Overview|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014[/tpl] That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally handicapped children organized by WABC-TV's Geraldo Rivera.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=320[/tpl]

==Separation from Lennon and reunion==

After the Beatles disbanded, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then in New York—the latter to escape the tabloid racism of the former.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|title=John Lennon's power for the people|date=Feb 2, 2010|last=Ali|first=Tariq|newspaper=The Guardian[/tpl] Their relationship, however, became strained by the threat of deportation Lennon faced (because of drug charges filed in England), and Ono's separation from her daughter. The couple separated in 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between Los Angeles and New York with personal assistant May Pang, with Ono's blessing.[tpl]cite book |first=Geoffrey Giuliano |last=Brenda Giuliano |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kVpXvJn0ZZIC&pg=RA2-PA260&vq=Pang&dq=%22may+pang%22#PRA2-PA213,M1 |title=Press Release Interview with May Pang |accessdate=June 9, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7119-6470-9 |year=1998[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=698-99[/tpl]
By December 1974, Lennon and Pang were considering buying a house together, and he was refusing to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, being exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang, stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001|p=700-01[/tpl]
Ono and Lennon's son, Sean, was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon's 35th birthday. John did not help relations with his first son when he described Julian in 1980 as being part of the "ninety percent of the people on this planet resulted from an unplanned pregnancy" and that "Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference." He said, "I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days."[tpl]cite news|last=Willman |first=Chris |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/julian-lennon-50-never-much-too-lennon-family-004241541.html?pt=2 |title=Julian Lennon At 50: It's Never 'Much Too Late' For Lennon Family Discord | Stop The Presses!

===Lennon's murder, tributes, and memorials===

John Lennon retired from music, becoming a househusband to care for Sean, until shortly before his murder in December 1980, which Ono witnessed at close range.  She has stated that the couple were thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed.[tpl]cite web|title=John Lennon Remembered|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|publisher=CBS News|date=Dec 8, 2005|last=Dakss|first=Brian[/tpl] Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|title=Yoko Ono headlining shows for Japan relief efforts|publisher=On the Red Carpet|last=Allin|first=Olivia|date=March 27, 2011[/tpl]
Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the Strawberry Fields memorial in New York City's Central Park, directly across from the Dakota Apartments where they lived and Lennon died. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday. In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant Jeff Pollack to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of "Imagine".  Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.[tpl]cite news |title=Worldwide Broadcast Planned In Honor of Lennon's 50th Birthday |newspaper=The Tufts Daily |date=October 5, 1990 |page=3 [/tpl]
In 2000, she founded the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Saitama, Japan. In March 2002, she was present with Cherie Blair, at the unveiling of a 7-foot statue of Lennon, to mark the renaming of Liverpool airport to the Liverpool John Lennon Airport. (Julian and Cynthia Lennon were present at the unveiling of the John Lennon Peace Monument next to ACC Liverpool in the same city eight years later.) On October 9, 2007, she dedicated a new memorial called the Imagine Peace Tower, located on the island of Viðey, 1 km outside the Skarfabakki harbour in Reykjavík, Iceland. Each year, between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light high into the sky. In 2009, Ono created an exhibit called "John Lennon: The New York City Years" for the NYC Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon's life in New York, and a portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by Lennon and Ono.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thespiritfoundation.com |title=Spirit Foundation |accessdate=January 31, 2014[/tpl]

===Association with Fluxus===

Ono was an occasional member of Fluxus, whose founder George Maciunas, her friend during the 1960s, admired her work and promoted it with enthusiasm. In one example of Ono's work during this time, she took a fly as her alter ego, then used it as inspiration for her work.[tpl]cite news|last=Frank|first=Peter|url=http://www.artcommotion.com/Issue2/VisualArts/|title=Yoko Ono: One Woman Show[/tpl] Maciunas invited her to more formally join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent.[tpl]cite news|last=Newhall|first= Edith|title=A Long and Winding Road|publisher=ARTnews|date=Oct 2000|p= 163[/tpl] She did however, collaborate with him,[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=40-41[/tpl] Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233[/tpl]
John Cage and Marcel Duchamp were significant influences on Ono's art.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/21934/|title=Influences: Sean Lennon|date=Oct 9, 2009|last=Cardace|first=Sara|publisher=New York magazine[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=17[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160327305/33-musicians-on-what-john-cage-communicates|title=33 Musicians on What John Cage Communicates|last=Blau|first=Max|date=Sep 5, 2012|publisher=npr.org[/tpl] She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and met him through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research:[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65[/tpl] She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233[/tpl]
After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233[/tpl] Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending,[tpl]harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=21[/tpl] and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events,[tpl]cite journal|author=Kotz, Liz|title=Post-Cagean Aesthetics and the "Event" Score |journal=October |volume=95|date=Winter 2001|jstor=779200|pages=55–89 56[/tpl] with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young.[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65[/tpl] The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.

===Cut Piece, 1964===

Ono was an explorer of conceptual art and performance art. A seminal performance work is Cut Piece, first performed in 1964 at the Sogetsu Art Center in Tokyo. It had one simple but destructive verb as its instruction: "Cut." Ono executed the performance by walking to the center of a stage in her best garments and inviting the audience to cut off her clothing, casually sitting on the floor legs tucked underneath, and audience members would begin.[tpl]harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=158[/tpl]
In 1965, she performed the piece at Carnegie Hall, where it received a lot of attention and the audience was more aggressive. She performed it again in London where the audience was even more zealous, and at other venues, garnering drastically different reactions, depending on the audience. In Kyoto, one man dramatically raised the scissors over her head, which culled from Ono a reaction more of dismay than fear. London participants required her to be protected by security; the performance had been publicized as part of Gustav Metzger's Destruction of Art Symposium. Of the piece, John Hendricks in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective wrote: "Piece'' unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model..... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art."
Other performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks. Ono reprised the piece in Paris in 2003, in the low post-9/11 period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is "a time where we need to trust each other." In 2013, Peaches reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre in London, which Ono curated.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Yoko Ono's Meltdown – review|date=June 22, 2013|publisher=The Guardian[/tpl]

===Grapefruit book, 1964===

Another example of her conceptual art includes her book of instructions titled Grapefruit.  First published in 1964, the book includes surreal, Zen-like instructions to be completed in the mind of the reader.  One example is "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies."  An example of heuristic art, Grapefruit was published several times, most widely distributed by Simon and Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. David Bourdon, art critic for The Village Voice and Vogue, called Grapefruit "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960's."  He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and "did virtually the same things" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.
Ono would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including one highly publicized show at the Everson Museum in Syracuse, New York, that was nearly closed when it was besieged by excited Beatles fans, who broke several of the art pieces and flooded the toilets.[tpl]cite book|last=Pang |first= May | title=Loving John | publisher=Warner Books (Paperback)| year=1983 | isbn=978-0-446-37916-8|ref=[tpl]SfnRef|Pang|1983[/tpl][/tpl] Thirty years later, in July 2013, she released a sequel to Grapefruit, another book of instructions, Acorn via OR Books.[tpl]cite book|last=Ono |first= Yoko | title=Acorn | publisher=OR Books| year=2013 | isbn= 978-1-939293-23-7[/tpl]

===Experimental films, 1964–1972===

Ono was also an experimental filmmaker who made 16 films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, often referred to as Bottoms.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|title=Yoko Ono Biography: Films[/tpl] The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks as the subject walks on a treadmill.  The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/watches/finder-detail.sku-GB168.html|title=Film No. 4|publisher=swatch.com|accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl]

She also acted in an obscure exploitation film in 1965, Satan's Bed.

===Wish Tree, 1981-present===

Another example of Ono's participatory art was her Wish Tree project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 Wish Piece had the following instructions:
Her Wish Tree installation in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, established in July 2010, has attracted contributions from all over the world.

==Musical career==

===Pre-Lennon===

Ono took piano from the age of 4 to 12 or 13. She attended kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into an area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.[tpl]harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=232[/tpl]
She met Cage through Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary composition class at the New School for Social Research,[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65[/tpl] and in the summer of 1960, she found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street and allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft with her,[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233[/tpl] with people like Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending. Ono only presented work once during the series. In 1961, years before meeting Lennon, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat Carnegie Recital Hall (smaller than the "Main Hall"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances. She had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted Cut Piece.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/cut-piece/|title=Ono, Yoko: Cut Piece|publisher=Medien Kunst Netz (Media Art Net)|accessdate=November 2013[/tpl]

===1980s===

In early 1980, Lennon heard Lene Lovich and The B-52's' "Rock Lobster" on vacation in Bermuda, and it reminded him of Ono's musical sound. He took this as an indication that her sound had reached the mainstream.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-double-fantasy-20110322 |title=#29: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Double Fantasy |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |work=Rolling Stone[/tpl] (The band in fact had been influenced by Ono.) In addition to her collaborations with experimental artists including John Cage and jazz legend Ornette Coleman, many other musicians, particularly those of the new wave movement, have paid tribute to Ono (both as an artist in her own right, and as a muse and iconic figure). For example, Elvis Costello recorded a version of Ono's song "Walking on Thin Ice",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|title=Elvis Costello-Walking on Thin Ice|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=Feb 7, 2014[/tpl] the B-52's (who drew from her early recordings) covered "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" (shortening the title to "Don't Worry"), and Sonic Youth included a performance of Ono's early conceptual "Voice Piece for Soprano" on their experimental album SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|title= SYR4 - Goodbye 20th Century|publisher=NME|date=Dec 1, 1999[/tpl]
On December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the studio working on Ono's song "Walking on Thin Ice". When they returned to The Dakota, their home in New York City, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining major underground airplay. In 1981, she released the album Season of Glass, which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the liner notes to Season of Glass, Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because "he would have been offended—he was one of us." The album received highly favorable reviews and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.AllMusic Season of Glass Review. AllMusic.

Ono's final album of the 1980s was Starpeace, a concept album that she intended as an antidote to Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. Starpeace became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort.  The single "Hell in Paradise" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and received major airplay on MTV. In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.

===1990s===

Ono went on  a musical hiatus until signing with Rykodisc in 1992 to release the comprehensive six-disc box set Onobox. It included remastered highlights from all of Ono's solo albums, as well as unreleased material from the 1974 "lost weekend" sessions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/onobox-mw0000277368|title=Yoko Ono: Onobox|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl] She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from Onobox, simply titled Walking on Thin Ice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/walking-on-thin-ice-mw0000273502|title=Yoko Ono": Walking on Thin Ice|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl] That year, she sat down for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine Option.

In 2012, the album Yokokimthurston was released featuring a collaboration with Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. Notable also as the first collaboration between Moore and Gordon after their divorce, it was characterized by AllMusic as "focused and risk-taking" and "above the best" of the couple's experimental music, with Ono's voice described as "one-of-a-kind."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/yokokimthurston-mw0002411258|title=Kim Gordon/Thurston Moore/Yoko Ono/YOKOKIMTHURSTON|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl]

==Public image==

Ono was frequently criticized by the press and the public for many years. She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles[tpl]sfn|Badman|1999|p=40[/tpl] and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music. Her experimental art was also not popularly understood. The English press were particularly negative, and prompted the couple's move to the US. As late as December 1999, NME was calling her a "no-talent charlatan," and in October 2014 tennis pro Andy Murray's mother took over a Twitter handle entitled Destroying Yoko Ono on Twitter.
Her name still connotes the figure of the evil female interloper to the mainstream. Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain's widow, has endlessly been compared to Ono for her supposed bothersome role in Nirvana's businesses and as a scapegoat for Cobain's suicide.[tpl]cite book|title=A Bad Woman Feeling Good: Blues and the Women Who Sing Them|author=Jackson, Buzzy|pages=264–65|publisher=W.

==Political activism and social media==

Ono has been an activist for peace and human rights since the 1960s. After their wedding, she and Lennon held a "Bed-In for Peace" in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel in March 1969, where the pair of newlyweds in pajamas invited visitors and members of the press, eager to talk about and promote world peace. Another Bed-In two months later at the Queen Elizabeth Fairmont in Montreal resulted in the recording of their first single, "Give Peace A Chance", a top-20 hit for the newly-christened Plastic Ono Band.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lennon-mn0000232564/awards|title=John Lennon: Awards|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl] Other performance/demonstrations with John included "bagism," iterations with John of the Bag Pieces she introduced in the early '60s,[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=162-65[/tpl] which encouraged a disregard for physical appearance in judging others. In December 1969, the two continued spread their message of peace with billboards in 12 major world cities reading "WAR IS OVER! If You Want It - Happy Christmas from John & Yoko."[tpl]sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=190-91[/tpl]
In the 1970s, Ono and Lennon became close to many radical, counterculture leaders, including Bobby Seale,[tpl]cite book |last=Doggett |first=Peter |title=There's a Riot Going on: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars, and the Rise and Fall of the '60s |publisher=Grove/Atlantic |year=2007 |page=501 [/tpl] Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/special-reports/articles/2014/01/22/john-lennon-rebel-beatle|title=John Lennon: Rebel Beatle|publisher=U.S. News & World Report|last=Risen|first=Tom|date=Jan 22, 2014[/tpl] Michael X,[tpl]sfn|Harry|2001[/tpl] John Sinclair (for whose rally in Michigan they flew to sing Lennon's song "Free John Sinclair" that effectively released the poet from prison),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/03/john-sinclair-rock-revolutionary-mc5-interview|title=John Sinclair: 'We wanted to kick ass – and raise consciousness'|last=O'Hagan|first=Sean|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 2, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014[/tpl] Angela Davis, and street musician David Peel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thevillager.com/2012/12/13/john-lennon-david-peel-and-rocks-greatest-flattery/|title=John Lennon, David Peel and rock's greatest flattery|publisher=The Villager|date=Dec 13, 2012|last=Derienzo|first=Paul[/tpl] Friend and Sexual Politics author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.harvardindependent.com/2011/12/conversations-with-kate-millett-discussing-feminism-art-spanish-and-harvard-1201/|title=Conversations with Kate Millett|last=Simmons|first=William|publisher=The Harvard Independent|date=December 1, 2011[/tpl] Ono and Lennon appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, taking over hosting duties for a week.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mike-douglas-show-with-john-lennon-yoko-ono-mw0001072473|title=The Mike Douglas Show with John Lennon & Yoko Ono|publisher=AllMusic[/tpl] Ono spoke at length about the evils of racism and sexism. She remained outspoken in her support of feminism, and openly bitter about the racism she had experienced from rock fans, especially in the UK. Her reception within the UK media was not much better. For example, an Esquire article of the period was titled "John Rennon's Excrusive Gloupie" and featured an unflattering David Levine cartoon.[tpl]cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=J.

In 1999, after the Columbine High School massacre, Ono paid for billboards to be put up in New York City and Los Angeles that bore the image of Lennon's blood-splashed spectacles. Early in 2002[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1855507.stm|title=Yoko brings peace message to UK|publisher=BBC News|date=March 5, 2002[/tpl] she paid about £150,000 ($213,375)Oanda.com's currency converter, 3/5/02 for a billboard in Piccadilly Circus with a line from Lennon's "Imagine": "Imagine all the people living life in peace." Later the same year, she inaugurated a peace award, the LennonOno Grant for Peace, by giving $50,000 (£31,900) in prize money originally to artists living "in regions of conflict". The award is given out every two years in conjunction with the lighting of the Imagine Peace Tower, and was first given to Israeli and Palestinian artists. Its program has since expanded to include writers, such as  Michael Pollan and Alice Walker, activists such as Vandana Shiva and Pussy Riot, organizations such as New York's Center for Constitutional Rights, even an entire country (Iceland).Imagine Peace.

On Valentine's Day 2003, on the eve of the Iraqi invasion by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, "It's good to speak to you. We're supporting you. We're all sisters together."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2914079.stm |title=Yoko Ono supports bed protest|publisher=BBC |date=April 3, 2003 |accessdate=Feb 10, 2014[/tpl] The couple said that songs like "Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine" inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song "Everyman..... Everywoman....." to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included "Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him" and "Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her".[tpl]cite book |last=Johnstone |first=Nick |title=Yoko Ono Talking |publisher=Omnibus Press|page=13|ISBN=085712255X[/tpl]

In January 2013, the 79-year-old Ono, along with Sean Lennon and Susan Sarandon, took to rural Pennsylvania in a bus under the banner of the Artists Against Fracking group she and Sean created with Mark Ruffalo in August 2012 to protest against hydraulic fracturing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/18/fracking-debate-ono-lennon-sarandon-tour|title= Fracking debate draws Yoko, Lennon and Sarandon to rural battlegrounds: Artists Against Fracking board bus for magical mystery tour of Pennsylvania as New York and New Jersey decisions draw near|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|date=January 18, 2013|work=The Guardian[/tpl] Other group members include Lady Gaga and Alec Baldwin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/fracking-2012-9/|title=Intelligencer: Fracklash|date=September 10, 2012|newspaper=New York[/tpl]

==Relationship with the Beatles==

According to journalist Barry Miles, after Lennon and Ono had been injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road, a bed was installed in the studio with a microphone so the latter could make artistic comments about the album.[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|p=552[/tpl] According to Miles, Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison verbally assaulted her after she took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08udovitt.html|title=Let Us Now Praise Famous Men|newspaper=New York Times|first=Mim|last=Udovitch|date=8 October 2000|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl] The English press dubbed her as "the woman who broke up the Beatles",[tpl]sfn|Badman|1999|p=40[/tpl] but Ono has stated that the Beatles broke up themselves without any direct involvement from her, adding "I don't think I could have tried even to break them up."[tpl]sfn|Badman|1999|p=41[/tpl]
While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as Lennon–McCartney regardless of whether the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, Please Please Me, which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called Wings over America, which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions. Neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as "Yesterday," [tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm |title=Talking Point | Lennon-McCartney: Who do you give credit to? |publisher=BBC News |date=December 23, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl] but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. The two other Beatles agreed that the credits should remain as they always had been, and McCartney withdrew his request.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In a Rolling Stone interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the process of the disintegration of the band.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|title=Yoko Ono Blames Paul McCartney For The Beatles' Breakup?|last=Vultaggio|first=Maria|date=December 29, 2012|work=International Business Times[/tpl] On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, Lennon Legend, the composer credit of "Give Peace a Chance" was changed to "John Lennon" from its original composing credit of "Lennon–McCartney." Although the song was written by Lennon during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the "Plastic Ono Band" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song. In 2002, McCartney released another live album, Back in the U.S. Live 2002, and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as "composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it "an attempt to rewrite history." Nevertheless, Ono did not sue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|title=Update: McCartney Reignites Beatles Credit Controversy|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014[/tpl]
In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Of Ono, McCartney stated: "I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri.Garcia, Gilbert. (January 27, 2003) "The ballad of Paul and Yoko". Salon. Retrieved April 4, 2011. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time. When Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in New York.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=531072002 | location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |location=UK | first=Precious | last=Williams | title=Eternal flame | date=May 19, 2002[/tpl]
Accepting an award at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, "You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch |work=The Independent |location=London  | title=Yoko Ono claims she was misquoted over McCartney outburst | first=Ian | last=Herbert | date=October 15, 2005|accessdate=February 1, 2014[/tpl]
In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's "lost weekend" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. "I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that Paul did for John."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2759900.ece#|title=Can't buy me love: Yoko tells how Paul saved her marriage to John|work=The Times|date=October 9, 2010 [/tpl] While visiting with Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked "What will make you come back to John?"  McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles.  "John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did." In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.[tpl]cite web|title=Paul McCartney: Yoko Ono Didn't Break Up the Beatles|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-yoko-ono-didnt-break-up-the-beatles-20121029?fb_action_ids=10151294334734245&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=aggregation&fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 29, 2012[/tpl]

===Relationship with Julian Lennon===

Ono had a difficult relationship with her stepson, Lennon's son Julian which has gotten better over the years. He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, "when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|title=Julian Lennon blames father John for his lack of children|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl] 
More egregiously, however, Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for unnamed amount which the papers reported was "believed to" be in the area of £20 million, which Julian has denied.
He has admitted that he is his "mother's boy," which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.

==In popular culture==

One of Barenaked Ladies's best-known songs is "Be My Yoko Ono"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=Feb 7, 2014[/tpl] from 1990.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono (Overview)|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=Feb 7, 2014[/tpl] It includes the lyrics: "Isn't it beautiful to see two people / So much in love? / Barenaked as two virgins hand in / Hand and and / And hand in glove", referring to the couple's famous Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins cover. The Canadian foursome go on to sing, "I know that when I say this, / I may be stepping on pins and / Needles; / But I don't like all these people / Slagging her / For breaking up the Beatles."
American folk singer Dar Williams recorded a 2000 song titled "I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dar-Williams-I-Wont-Be-Your-Yoko-Ono/release/3762272|title=Dar Williams - I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=Feb 7, 2014[/tpl] which included the refrain, "But I won't be your Yoko Ono / If you're not good enough for me."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/i-wont-be-your-yoko-ono-mt0003872221/lyrics|title=Dar Williams, I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono, Lyrics|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=Feb 13, 2014[/tpl] That same year German punk band Die Ärzte recorded the song "Yoko Ono" for their 2000 album with a decidedly different take on Ono: Farin Urlaub sings about an ex-girlfriend that annoys him, describing her as "more annoying than Yoko Ono". According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is also shortest single ever released, with a run time of 30 seconds.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/die-%C3rzte-mn0000823202/biography|title=Die Ärzte: Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014|publisher=Allmusic[/tpl]
Ono still continues to symbolize the figure of the evil female interloper to many. Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain's widow, has endlessly been compared to Ono for her supposed bothersome role in Nirvana's businesses and as a scapegoat for Cobain's suicide. When American singer Jessica Simpson was dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo in the late Aughts, their relationship was controversial among some Dallas Cowboys fans. Simpson was blamed for Romo's poor performances, some Cowboys' fans giving her the nickname "Yoko Romo."
The British band Elbow mentioned Ono in their song "New York Morning" from their 2014 album The Take Off and Landing of Everything ("Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon's relationship with the city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881 |title=Yoko Ono thanks Elbow for new song 'New York Morning' in open letter |author= |date=5 March 2014 |website=NME.com |accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl]
