CATEGORIES: Traditional Korean weapons, Pole weapons

The pyeongon is a nunchaku-like weapon used by the Joseon army and is first mentioned in a martial arts manual called Muyesinbo. The weapon was inspired by the farmer's flail to thresh rice with. In the west it mostly known as a Two Section Staff.
The pyeongon consists of a large pole (187cm) with a shorter stick (47cm) attached to it by a metal chain, but sometimes rope was used. The short stick could be covered with spikes.
