Electron microscopes are expensive to build and maintain, but the capital and running costs of confocal light microscope systems now overlaps with those of basic electron microscopes. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field cancelling systems.
The samples largely have to be viewed in vacuum, as the molecules that make up air would scatter the electrons. One exception is the environmental scanning electron microscope, which allows hydrated samples to be viewed in a low-pressure (up to [tpl]convert|20|Torr|kPa|disp=or|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl]) and/or wet environment.
Scanning electron microscopes operating in conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.) Low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible observation of non-conductive specimens without coating.  Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.
Small, stable specimens such as carbon nanotubes, diatom frustules and small mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being examined in the electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in artifacts, but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. It is generally believed by scientists working in the field that as results from various preparation techniques have been compared and that there is no reason that they should all produce similar artifacts, it is reasonable to believe that electron microscopy features correspond with those of living cells. Since the 1980s, analysis of cryofixed, vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.[tpl]cite journal |last=Adrian |first=Marc |coauthors=Dubochet, Jacques; Lepault, Jean; McDowall, Alasdair W. |year=1984 |title=Cryo-electron microscopy of viruses |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5954 |pages=32–36 |doi=10.1038/308032a0 |pmid=6322001|bibcode = 1984Natur.308...32A [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Sabanay |first=I. |coauthors=Arad, T.; Weiner, S.; Geiger, B. |year=1991|title=Study of vitrified, unstained frozen tissue sections by cryoimmunoelectron microscopy |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=227–236 |pmid=1795028[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Kasas |first=S. |coauthors=Dumas, G.; Dietler, G.; Catsicas, S.; Adrian, M. |year=2003 |title=Vitrification of cryoelectron microscopy specimens revealed by high-speed photographic imaging |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=211 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2003.01193.x[/tpl]
