ZDF-Magazin was a West German television news magazine, which ran on ZDF from 1969 to 1988. It was presented by Gerhard Löwenthal. It focused on communist-ruled Eastern Europe and was particularly known for reporting on human rights abuses there. The magazine was known for its conservative and anti-socialist views which led to several controversial reactions from viewers and politicians. Löwenthal criticized communists, East Germany, leftist student movement (″red psychoterrorists″), social democrats' Ostpolitik (″communist agents″), the so-called peace movement (″Moscow's partisans″) and West German writers like Heinrich Böll (″sympathizers of leftist fascism″).http://www.tv-legenden.de/zeitgeschehen/rote-optik-und-zdf-magazin-vs-schwarzer-kanal/
