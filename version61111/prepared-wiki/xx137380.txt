==History==

The company was founded on December 14, 1957 as a merger between seven bus and ferry companies in Trøndelag. The seven companies included Hevne Dampskibsselskap (founded 1885), Uttrøndelag Dampskibsselskap (1889), Fosen Aktie Dampskibsselskab (1904), Fosenhalvøya Billag (1937), Fosen Dampskipsselskap (1950) and Trondheimsfjorden Fosenferja (1955).
In 1993 the company moved to its new terminal, Pirterminalen at Brattøra in downtown Trondheim, and in 1994 the passenger ferries moved there too. In 1996 Fosen got the concession to operate Norway's second largest car ferry line between Moss and Horten in the Oslo Fjord through the subsidiary Bastø Fosen. In 1999 the company bought 66% of TrønderBilene from the Nord-Trøndelag county municipality. The next year the bus division of Fosen was sold to TrønderBilene. Between 2000 and 2003 the company also bought Norgesbuss, operating buses in Oslo and Akershus and the ferry company Innherredsferja in 2004.
