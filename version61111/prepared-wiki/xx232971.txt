==Name==

It is unknown whence Loco received his name.  One theory suggests that he was named for the fact that he was "'crazy' enough to trust the white men."[tpl]cite book|last=Debo|first=Angie|title=Geronimo:  The Man, His Time, His Place|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|year=1976|pages=72|isbn=0-8061-1828-8[/tpl]  Another theory says that he got his name from his actions at a battle against the Mexicans, where he supposedly braved gunfire in order to save an injured warrior.

==Time as chief==

Unlike the militant Geronimo, Loco was an advocate for peace.  After the death of Mangas Coloradas, the Mimbrenos assimilated into the Warm Springs tribe, and Loco, along with Victorio, became chiefs.  In 1882, when a party of Apaches including Geronimo pressured Loco to leave for Mexico, Loco instead waged guerilla warfare against the Chiricahuas.  In 1886, Loco went to Washington, D.C. to negotiate; however, like Geronimo, he was made prisoner and sent to Florida.
