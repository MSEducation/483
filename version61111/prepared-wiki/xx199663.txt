==History==

The museum was founded in the centre of Hanover, in 1937, by the Wilhelm Busch Society. It was the first museum devoted to the Lower Saxon artist Busch.  The building was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1943, although the artworks had already been evacuated.  The museum reopened in 1950, initially in the Wallmodenpalais, with an extensive presentation of works by Busch as well as the first exhibition of caricatures.
As of 2010 the Wilhelm Busch Society has around 2,500 members in and outside Germany.  Since 2002 the museum has also been supported by the Association of Sponsors (Verein der Förderer des Wilhelm-Busch-Museums).Verein der Förderer des Wilhelm-Busch-Museums Hannover [tpl]de icon[/tpl]  The city of Hanover allows the use of the historic exhibition building free of charge, and also makes an annual sponsorship contribution.
