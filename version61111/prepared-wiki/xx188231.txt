The Pizol is a mountain in the Glarus Alps, overlooking Bad Ragaz in the canton of St. Gallen. At 2,844 metres above sea level, it is the highest summit of the chain separating the valleys of the Seez and the Tamina and the highest mountain lying entirely within the canton of St. Gallen.
There are five mountain lakes (Pizolseen) on Pizol: Wangsersee at Pizolhütte, Wildsee, Schottensee, Schwarzsee (2368 m) and Baschalvasee (2174 m). A small glacier, the Pizolgletscher, lies above 2,600 metres on the northern side of the mountain.
The Pizol can be climbed by experienced hikers. The shortest route starts at the Mugger Cham cable car station (near Pizolhütte) at 2,200 metres and crosses the glacier before reaching the summit via the south ridge. The massif is also a popular for the hikes around the lakes.
