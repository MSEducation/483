==Family disputes==

Maharani Laxmi, the Rani of Maharaja Randhir Singh, was not happy with Baldeo Singh, so she went to Brindavan and took with her the keys of fort as well. She died there soon and this settled the dispute. Meanwhile his younger brother’s sons Durjansal and Madho Singh rebelled against Baldeo Sngh. Due to these family disputes Baldeo Singh sought the support of  Sir David Ochterlony, the resident of the British East India Company at Delhi and made his son Balwant Singh as his successor in his presence. After this Baldeo Singh died on 26 February 1825.  Sir David's endorsement of this succession was, repudiated by Lord Amherest, Governor-General of British India and he was replaced.

==British won Bharatpur==

Soon a family dispute developed between Durjansal and Madho Singh.  Madho Singh went to Deeg and started organizing an army. Charles Metcalf, the new resident at Delhi, intervened in the dispute and sent troops of the East India Company to attack the fortress at Bharatpur. The British forces under the leadership of Lord Combermere reached Bharatpur on 10 December 1825. War started on 23 December 1825. The British forces captured the fort of Bharatpur, which had previously been considered impregnable.  After their victory at Bharatpur, the British ruled over the entire Rajputana.
Maharaja Baldeo Singh died on 26 February 1825. The successor of Baldeo Singh was his son  Maharaja Balwant Singh.
