The Kingittorsuaq Runestone (old spelling: Kingigtorssuaq), listed as GR 1 in the Rundata catalog, is a runestone that was found on Kingittorsuaq Island, an island in the Upernavik Archipelago in northwestern Greenland.

==Description==

The Kingittorsuaq Runestone was found in 1824 in a group of three cairns that formed an equilateral triangle on top of the mountain on a small Kingittorsuaq Island in the south-central part of the Upernavik Archipelago. The stone is now located at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.
The stone has been dated to the Middle Ages. The Catholic Encyclopedia states the date as April 25, 1135. William Thalbitzer dates the stone to 1314 using pentadic numerals.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Others have dated the stone between 1250 and 1333.[tpl]cite book |last=Enterline |first=James Robert |authorlink= |others=Center for American Places |title=Erikson, Eskimos & Columbus: Medieval European Knowledge of America |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pr-s7MrkBW8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |format= |accessdate=07-02-2009 |edition=illustrated |year=2002 |publisher=JHU Press |location= |isbn=0-8018-6660-X |pages=127–129 |nopp= |chapter= [/tpl]
The last part of the runic inscription is not transcribed as it apparently is a group of meaningless characters, which some believe contains a secret message.
