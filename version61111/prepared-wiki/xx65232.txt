In 1946 the band won Down Beat, Metronome, Billboard and Esquire polls for best band, nominated by their peers in the big band business.Clancy 90 Along with the high acclaim for their jazz and blues performances, classical composer Igor Stravinsky wrote the Ebony Concerto, one in a series of compositions commissioned by Woody with solo clarinet, for this band.

Throughout the history of jazz, there have always been musicians who sought to combine it with classical music.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/tchaikovsky/atoz/strav_j.shtml |title=Jazz and Stravinsky |publisher=BBC|year=2009 [/tpl]  Ebony Concerto is one in a long line of music from the twenties to the present day that seeks to do this.  Woody Herman said about the Concerto: "Ebony Concerto is a very delicate and a very sad piece."Clancy 88  Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures.  Saxophonist Flip Philips said, "During the rehearsal ... there was a passage I had to play there and I was playing it soft, and Stravinsky said 'Play it, here I am!' and I blew it louder and he threw me a kiss!"Clancy 89 In his own original way Stravinsky noticed the massive amount of smoking at the recording session: "the atmosphere looked like Pernod clouded by water.""Jazz and Stravinsky" Ebony Concerto was performed live by the Herman band on March 25, 1946 at Carnegie Hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centerforjazzarts.org/classical_2c.html |title=Classical Arts |publisher=Center for Jazz Arts |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl]
Despite the Carnegie Hall success and other triumphs, Herman  was forced to disband the orchestra in 1946 at the height of its success.  This was his only financially successful band; he left it to spend more time with his wife and family.  During this time, he and his family had just moved into the former Hollywood home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. One reason Herman may have disbanded was his wife Charlotte's growing problems with alcoholism and pill addiction. Charlotte Herman joined Alcoholics Anonymous and gave up everything she was addicted to.  Woody said, laughing, "I went to an AA meeting with Charlotte and my old band was sitting there."Lees 147 Many critics cite December 1946 as the actual date the big-band era ended, when seven other bands, in addition to Herman's, dissolved."Finally, in December, 1946, almost a dozen years after Benny Goodman had blown the first signs of life into the big band bubble, that bubble burst with a concerted bang.  Inside of just a few weeks, eight of the nation's top bandleaders called it quits-some temporarily, some permanently...." George T. Simon The Big Bands Schirmer Books, New York. 1981. p.32 ISBN 0-02-872420-8.

==The Second Herd and other bands 1947-1987==

In 1947, Herman organized the Second Herd. This band was also known as "The Four Brothers Band".  This derives from the song recorded December 27, 1947 for Columbia records, "Four Brothers", written by Jimmy Giuffre.Clancy 120  "The 'Four Brothers' chart is based on the chord changes of 'Jeepers Creepers', and features the three-tenor, one-baritone saxophone section...."Clancy 121  The order of the saxophone solos is Zoot Sims, Serge Chaloff, Herbie Steward, and Stan Getz. Some of the notable musicians of this band were also Al Cohn, Gene Ammons, Lou Levy, Oscar Pettiford, Terry Gibbs, and Shelly Manne.http://music.yahoo.com/ar-251790-bio-- Among this band's hits were "Early Autumn," and "The Goof and I".  The band was popular enough that they went to Hollywood in the mid-nineteen forties. Herman and his band appear in the movie New Orleans in 1947 with Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039655/|title=New Orleans (1947)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl]  From the late 1940s to the end of his life, record labels Herman recorded for include RCA,"Woody Herman Biography" Capitol, MGM[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/mgm/mgm10.html|title=MGM Album Discography, Part 1 10-inch LPs|publisher=Mike Callahan, David Edwards and Peter Preuss|year=2000[/tpl] and Verve.[ref]

By 1968, the Herman library came to be heavily influenced by rock and roll.Clancy 271 He was also known to feature brass and woodwind instruments not traditionally associated with jazz, such as the bassoon, oboe or French horn.
In the early 1970s he toured frequently and began to work more in jazz education, offering workshops and taking on younger sidemen. For this reason he got the nickname Road Father.[tpl]GroveOnline|Woody Herman|Michael James and Barry Kernfeld|January 13|2014[/tpl] In 1974, Woody Herman's "Young Thundering Herd" appeared without their leader for Frank Sinatra's television special The Main Event and subsequent album, The Main Event – Live. Both were recorded mainly on October 13, 1974 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Clancy 291  On November 20, 1976, a reconstituted Woody Herman band played at Carnegie Hall in New York City, celebrating Herman's fortieth anniversary as a bandleader.Clancy 299 By the 1980s, Herman had returned to straight-ahead jazz, dropping some of the newer rock and fusion approaches.Clancy 312-313  Woody Herman signed a recording contract with Concord Records around 1980, now called the Concord Music Group.Wilson, 1981 In 1981, John S. Wilson warmly reviewed one of Herman's first Concord recordings "Woody Herman Presents a Concord Jam, Vol. I". Wilson's review  says that the recording presents a band that is less frenetic than his bands from the forties to the seventies.  Instead it takes the listener back to the relaxed style of Herman's first band of the thirties that recorded for Decca.[ref]

==Last years==

Herman continued to perform into the 1980s, after the death of his wife and with his health in decline, chiefly to pay back taxes caused by his business manager's bookkeeping in the 1960s.Lees 272 As a result, Woody Herman owed the IRS millions of dollars and was in danger of eviction from his home. With the added stress, Herman still kept performing. In a December 5, 1985, review of the band at the Blue Note jazz club for The New York Times, John S. Wilson pointed out: "In a one-hour set, Mr. Herman is able to show off his latest batch of young stars—the baritone saxophonist Nick Brignola, the bassist Bill Moring, the pianist Brad Williams, the trumpeter Ron Stout—and to remind listeners that one of his own basic charms is the dry humor with which he shouts the blues." Wilson also spoke about arrangements by Bill Holman and John Fedchock for special attention.  Wilson spoke of the continuing influence of Duke Ellington on the Woody Herman bands from the nineteen forties to the nineteen eighties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2DD163BF936A35751C1A963948260|title=Jazz: Woody Herman's Band |publisher=The New York Times| first=John S. | last=Wilson | date=December 5, 1985[/tpl]
