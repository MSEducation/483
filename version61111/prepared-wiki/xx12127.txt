==History==

Waterloo was originally known as Prairie Rapids Crossing. The town was established, according to the original researcher as reported by staff of the Grout Museum in Waterloo, near two Meskwaki American tribal seasonal camps alongside the Cedar River. It was first settled in 1845 when George and Mary Melrose Hanna and their children arrived on the east bank of the Red Cedar River (now just called the Cedar River). They were followed by the Virden and Mullan families in 1846. Evidence of these earliest families can still be found in the street names Hanna Blvd., Mullan Avenue and Virden Creek.
On December 8, 1845 the Iowa State Register and Waterloo Herald was the first newspaper published in Waterloo.[tpl]Cite book|title=The History of Black Hawk County|publisher=Western Historical Company|year=1878|location=Chicago|pages=383 (pdf-375)|url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924028913832[/tpl]
The name "Waterloo" supplanted the original name, "Prairie Rapids Crossing" shortly after Charles Mullan petitioned for a post office in the town. Since the signed petition did not include the name of the proposed post office location, Mullan was charged with selecting the name when he submitted the petition. Tradition has it that as he flipped through a list of other post offices in the United States, he came upon the name "Waterloo." The name struck his fancy, and on December 29, 1851, a post office was established under that name. The town was later called the same, and Mullan served as the first postmaster from December 29, 1851 until August 11, 1854.
There were two extended periods of rapid growth over the next 115 years. From 1895 to 1915, the population increased from 8,490 to 33,097, a 290% increase. From 1925 to 1960, population increased from 36,771 to 71,755. The 1895 to 1915 period was a time of the rapid growth in manufacturing, rail transportation and wholesale operations. During this period the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company moved to Waterloo and shortly after Rath Packing Company moved from Dubuque. Another major employer throughout the first two-thirds of the 20th century was the Illinois Central Railroad. Among the others was the less-successful brass era automobile manufacturer, the Maytag-Mason Motor Company.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.93.
On June 7, 1934, bank robber Tommy Carroll had a shoot-out with the FBI when he and his wife stopped to pick up gas. Accidentally parking next to a police car and wasting time dropping his gun and picking it back up, Carroll was forced to flee into an alley where he was shot. Carroll was then taken to Allen Memorial Hospital in Waterloo, where he died shortly after.
Waterloo suffered particularly hard in the agricultural recession of the 1980s, due to the major employers at the time being heavily rooted in agriculture. In particular, John Deere, the area's largest employer, cut 10,000 jobs, and the Rath meatpacking plant closed altogether, losing 2500 jobs. It is estimated Waterloo lost 14% of its population during this time.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.public.iastate.edu/~rfindlay/history.html|title= City Profile[/tpl] Today the city enjoys a broader industrial base, as city leaders have sought to diversify the industrial and commercial mix. Deere remains a strong presence in the city, but employs only roughly one-third the number of people it did at its peak.

===Flood of 2008===

June 2008 saw the worst flooding in the Waterloo – Cedar Falls area had ever recorded; other major floods include the Great Flood of 1993. The flood control system constructed in the 1970s–90s largely functioned as designed.
For those areas not protected by the system, the Cedar River poured out of its banks and into parking lots, backyards and across the rich Iowa farmland surrounding the city. Although much damage was done, the larger, downstream city of Cedar Rapids was much harder hit.
An area of the west side of the down-town and an area near the former Rath Packing facility were impacted not directly by water coming from the river but were the result of storm run-off draining towards the river but then being trapped on the backside of the flood levy system. These areas did not have lift stations or alternate pumping capacity sufficient to force this water to the river side of the control system. Areas where lift stations had been constructed (Virden Creek and East 7th Street ) to pump this storm run-off into the swollen river remained largely dry (the east and north sides of down-town). Several areas experienced water seeping into basements due to high water-table levels.
According to the National Weather Service the ten highest crests of the Cedar River recorded at East 7th Street in downtown Waterloo:[tpl]cite web|url= http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=dmx&gage=aloi4&view=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1|title=Cedar River at Waterloo|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate= 2011-08-04[/tpl]
Crests reported in the 1960s and prior were before completion of major flood control projects and therefore may not be directly comparable.
