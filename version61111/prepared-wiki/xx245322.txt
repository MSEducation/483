Rule 42 (now Rule 5.1[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_guides/2009_official_guide_part1.pdf|title=2009 official guide part1|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] and Rule 44[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_guides/official_guide1_june10.pdf|title=2008 official guide part1|accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl] in the 2008 guide) is a rule of the Gaelic Athletic Association  (GAA) which in practice prohibits the playing of  non-Gaelic games in GAA stadiums. The rule is often mistakenly believed to prohibit foreign sports at GAA owned stadiums.  However, non-Gaelic games such as boxing and American football did take place in Croke Park before Rule 42 was modified.

==The drive to have Rule 42 changed==

In the early 2000s the GAA came under pressure to allow non-Gaelic games be played in Croke Park so that the Football Association of Ireland could be joint hosts of Euro 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/2259736.stm|title=Croke Park ruled out for Euro 2008|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=15 September 2002[/tpl] Subsequently the association was asked to modify the rule so that the Ireland national rugby union team  and Republic of Ireland national football team would not have to play their home games outside of Ireland while the Lansdowne Road stadium was being redeveloped.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/3417359.stm|title=Green light for Lansdowne|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=27 January 2004[/tpl]  A number of motions to change Rule 42 failed or were blocked from being put on the agenda[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/roscommonherald/2004/11/04/story180.asp|title=Rule 42 debate will go ahead |accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] with the majority of the opposition coming from the Ulster counties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451933.stm |title=Gaelic angst over stadium decision |accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=16 April 2005 | first=James | last=Helm[/tpl]  The Rule was finally modified in 2005 to allow the playing of soccer and rugby union in Croke Park only while Lansdowne Road was being redeveloped. The motion gave  the GAA's central council the power to decide which games would be allowed in Croke Park.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0416/gaa.html|title=GAA Congress Rule 42 decision welcomed|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=RTÉ News|date=16 April 2005[/tpl] The motion to the GAA's annual congress passed 227–97, thus obtaining the two-thirds majority required.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/plugins/newsfeed.cgi?rm=content&plugin_data_id=6101|title=Rule 42 motion is carried|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] 

==When the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road is complete==

Once the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road (now called the Aviva Stadium) is complete Rule 42 will revert to its 2005 wording.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.planetrugby.com/Story/0,18259,3551_1902765,00.html |title=Ireland must wait to enjoy Croke craic |accessdate=2007-02-11 [/tpl]However, high profile GAA members including Seán Kelly, former GAA president, have expressed the view that the rule should not be reversed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2009/1015/walshn.html|title=Walsh wants Croker to stay open|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=RTÉ News|date=15 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1130/1224259709936.html|title=No sense in Croke Park reverting to ban, says Kelly|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=The Irish Times|date=11 November 2009[/tpl] On 17 April 2010 the GAA voted to keep Croke Park open after the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0417/1224268580815.html|title=Croke Park doors to remain open|accessdate=2010-04-18 | work=The Irish Times[/tpl]

==Outside of Croke Park==

In addition to the opening of Croke Park to competing sports, local GAA units have sought to rent their facilities out to other sports organisations for financial reasons in violation of Rule 42. The continued existence of Rule 42 has proven to be controversial since the management of Croke Park has been allowed to earn revenue by renting the facility out to competing sports organisations, but local GAA units which own smaller facilities cannot.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/colm-orourke/colm-orourke-there-is-no-more-room-for-vanity-projects-in-the-gaa-2577493.html | title=There is no more room for vanity projects in the GAA | accessdate=14 March 2011 | author=O'Rourke, Colm | date=13 March 2011 | publisher=Sunday Independent[/tpl] It is also said that it is questionable as to whether or not such rental deals would actually be damaging to the GAA's interests.

==Wording of the rule==

The original wording of Rule 42 is:
[tpl]Quote|Grounds controlled by Association units shall not be used or permitted to be used, for horse racing, greyhound racing, or for field games other than those sanctioned by Central Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gaelicfootball.eusu.ed.ac.uk/documents/GAA%20Official%20Guide%202003.pdf|title= 2003 GAA Guide showing pre-2005 wording of Rule 42|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl][/tpl]
The 2005 amendment added the sentence: 

==The first games in Croke Park==

The first game to take place under the relaxed Rule 42 took place on 11 February 2007.  It was a Six Nations Championship rugby union match between Ireland and France which Ireland lost 17–20.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/6352033.stm|title=Ireland 17–20 France|accessdate=2010-01-12 | work=BBC News | date=11 February 2007[/tpl] The following match against England generated some controversy, since it involved the playing of God Save the Queen at a ground where British soldiers had killed fourteen spectators on Bloody Sunday, 1920.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-02-09-foreign-rugby-invading-irelands-hallowed-ground|title='Foreign' rugby invading Ireland's hallowed ground|accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/god-save-the-queen-at-joness-road-a-remarkable-moment-122168.html|title='God Save the Queen' at Jones's Road a remarkable moment'|accessdate=2010-01-12 | work=Irish Independent|first=John A|last=Murphy|date=18 February 2007[/tpl]
There was a small protest by Republican Sinn Féin outside the ground.  Ireland won the match by 43 points to 13.[tpl]cite web|url=http://conor.net/clog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/srfron250207.jpg|title=Image showing man wearing Celtic tracksuit and holding sign|accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/81201|title=Republicans protest against "God Save The Queen" at Croker|accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl]

==A world record attendance==

In early February 2009, with possibility of an all Irish semi-final in the 2008-09 Heineken Cup, the GAA confirmed that club rugby would also be allowed under the relaxing of Rule 42.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/5019_12325.php|title=Croke Park lined up as potential semi-final venue|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The game was played in Croke Park on 2 May 2009, when Leinster defeated Munster 25–6. The attendance of 82,208 set a new world record attendance for a club rugby union game.
