Sandy is an intelligent, scientific, bipedal anthropomorphic squirrel who resides in Bikini Bottom and is featured as a close friend of SpongeBob SquarePants.

Before a recording, Lawrence prepares when the crew sends a storyboard. She explains, "I absolutely love that! Not only do I get to read the script, I can actually see what the artists have in mind. It is an amazing process and I feel so fortunate to be able to work that way!... I would prefer to let the script come alive in me before a taping."[tpl]cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title=Carolyn Lawrence Sandy Cheeks on 'SpongeBob SquarePants'|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/a/lawrence.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl]

==Reception==

===Criticism and controversy===

Despite claims by the show's creators that SpongeBob and the rest series' characters are "somewhat asexual",[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2313221.stm | work=BBC News | title=Camp cartoon star 'is not gay' | date=October 9, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1021976,00.html | title=SpongeBob Asexual, Not Gay: Creator | date=January 28, 2005 |accessdate=August 26, 2009 | first=Stephen M. | last=Silverman | work=People [/tpl] several annuals state that SpongeBob holds romantic feelings for Sandy, which could be shown in examples where SpongeBob brings Sandy flowers on occasion.
Jeffrey P. Dennis, author of the journal article "The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons," argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love, while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick "are paired with arguably erotic intensity." Dennis noted the two are "not consistently coded as romantic partners," since they live in separate residences, and have distinct groups of friends, but claimed that in the series, "the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded."Dennis, Jeffrey P.
