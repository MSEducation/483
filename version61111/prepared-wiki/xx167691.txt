[[Prophecy from Kremna]]

CATEGORIES: Serbian folklore

The Kremna Prophecies or Prophecy from Kremna are a collection of prophecies purporting to have been written before twentieth-century events that they describe. While the prophecies do indeed closely match the events, there is no evidence that they were written when claimed, and serious doubts have been cast on them.[tpl]fact|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Origin==

The Kremna Prophecies originated in the village of Kremna, in Serbia. Illiterate peasants Miloš Tarabić (Милош Тарабић) and his nephew Mitar Tarabić (Митар Тарабић) built a reputation for predicting the future. Their village priest is said to have recorded their predictions. Both Tarabićs died before 1900. The following simple translations, from Serbo-Croatian to English, were prepared by Robert Gakovich.

==Evaluation==

There appears to be no documentation suggesting that any of the "accurate" prophecies were published in advance of the events they foretell.
Voja Antonić investigated the claims of self-proclaimed prophets Miloš and Mitar Tarabić, and found that twelve copies of the book Prophecy from Kremna were all different, and changed over time. During his research he visited Kremna, where he was offered the "original handwritings" of Mitar Tarabić—who was illiterate. He published his findings (in Serbian) as "Kremansko neproročanstvo: studija jedne obmane" (Non-Prophecy from Kremna - a study of deception).  ISBN 86-902159-2-1.
