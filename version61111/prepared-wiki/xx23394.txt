Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Pfizer's products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia); Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil, for erectile dysfunction); and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.
Pfizer was founded by cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849 as a manufacturer of fine chemicals. Pfizer's discovery of Terramycin (oxytetracycline) in 1950 put it on a path towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer has made numerous acquisitions, including Warner–Lambert in 2000, Pharmacia in 2003 and Wyeth in 2009. The Wyeth acquisition was the largest of the three at US$68 billion.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html |title=Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68 billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth |work=The New York Times |date=January 26, 2009 |author=Andrew Ross Sorkin and Duff Wilson [/tpl] Pfizer is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and its shares have been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since April 2004.Dow Jones Industrial Average Historical Components from moneycontrol.com

==History==

Pfizer owns Monsanto, makers of GMO foods and the chemicals they are saturated in. Numerous scientific studies link GMOs to chronic disease. 

===19th century===

Pfizer is named after German-American cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart (originally from Ludwigsburg, Germany) who launched a chemicals business, Charles Pfizer and Company, from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett StreetKenneth T. Jackson. 9780300055368 The Encyclopedia of New York City. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. ISBN 978-0-300-05536-8 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1849. There, they produced an antiparasitic called santonin. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of citric acid that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street; Harrison Avenue; Gerry Street; and Flushing Avenue. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.

===20th century===

By 1906, sales totaled nearly $3 million.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
World War I caused a shortage of calcium citrate that Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid and were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919. As a result Pfizer developed expertise in fermentation technology. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic penicillin during World War II in response to the need of the U.S. government to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on D-Day was made by Pfizer.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In the 1940s, penicillin became very inexpensive. As a result, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer's discovery and commercialization of Terramycin (oxytetracycline) in 1950 changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. To augment its research in fermentation technology, Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis. Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on[/tpl] farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.
By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Iran, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980 Pfizer launched Feldene (piroxicam), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion United States dollars in total sales.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and Viagra.

===21st century===

Pfizer has recently grown by mergers, including those with Warner–Lambert (2000), Pharmacia (2003), and Wyeth (2009).
On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced that it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of Listerine, Nicorette, Visine, Sudafed and Neosporin) to Johnson & Johnson for $16.6 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2006/6/26/082230.cfm|date=June 26, 2006|title=Johnson & Johnson to Buy Pfizer Unit|accessdate=July 19, 2007|publisher=MoneyNews.com[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=December 2009[/tpl]
Development of torcetrapib, a drug that increases production of HDL, or "good cholesterol", which reduces LDL thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths occurred in the group that took the medicine than expected, and a sixty percent increase in mortality was seen among patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor versus Lipitor alone. Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1 billion developing the failed drug and the market value of the company plummeted in the aftermath.Pfizer Shares Plummet on Loss of a Promising Heart Drug By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW POLLACK. December 5, 2006. The New York Times[ref]
[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2009[/tpl] Each study arm (torcetrapib + Lipitor vs. Lipitor alone) had 7500 patients enrolled; 51 deaths were observed in the Lipitor alone arm, while 82 deaths occurred in the torcetrapib + Lipitor arm.[/ref]
A July 2010 article in BusinessWeek reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of counterfeit prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for trademark infringement. Since 2007, Pfizer has spent $3.3 million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1 million, with another $5 million tied up in ongoing cases.[tpl]cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_29/b4187021988297.htm |title=Pfizer: Civil Suits for Drug Counterfeiters |work=BusinessWeek  |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]

====Warner–Lambert acquisition====

Pfizer acquired Warner–Lambert in 2000.Pfizer, 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner–Lambert, accessed April 7, 2010 Warner–Lambert was founded as a Philadelphia drug store in 1856 by William R. Warner. Inventing a tablet-coating process gained Warner a place in the Smithsonian Institution. Parke–Davis was founded in Detroit in 1866 by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976 and acquired Wilkinson Sword in 1993 and Agouron in 1999.

====Pharmacia acquisition====

In 2002, Pfizer merged with Pharmacia. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex (celecoxib), the COX-2 selective inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer commenced with a massive restructuring resulting in numerous site closures and loss of jobs including: Terre Haute, IN; Holland, MI; Groton, CT; Brooklyn, NY; Sandwich, UK and Puerto Rico.
Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisition with its predecessors, including Searle, Upjohn and Sugen.
Searle was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in Chicago. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the Monsanto Company, headquartered in St. Louis, in 1985.
The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in Kalamazoo, Michigan by Dr. William E. Upjohn, an 1875 graduate of the University of Michigan medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested. In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form Pharmacia & Upjohn. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia & Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm | title = Pharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms' Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01 | date = | quote = [/tpl]
SUGEN was a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors, founded in 1991 in Redwood City, California and acquired by Pharmacia in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and the transfer of several programs to Pfizer. These included sunitinib (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1 bn in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2010/financial/financial2010.pdf |title=Pfizer 2010 annual financial review, p 25. |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]  A related compound SU11654 (Toceranib) was also approved for canine tumors, and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |title=Pfizer Drug Targets Gene Flaw to Shrink Lung Tumors (Update1) |work=Businessweek  |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]
In 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility. Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizer-plant-michigan-cut-275/2008-07-15 | title = Pfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 – FiercePharma | date = | quote = [/tpl]

====Wyeth acquisition====

On January 26, 2009, after more than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival Wyeth for a combined US$68 billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5 billion lent by five major Wall Street banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20 billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since AT&T and BellSouth's US$70 billion deal in March 2006.Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68 billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON. January 26, 2009. The New York Times The combined company was expected to save US$4 billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
The merger was broadly criticized. Harvard Business School’s Gary Pisano told The Wall Street Journal that "the record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good. There’s just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed".The Pfizer–Wyeth Deal Worst-Case Scenario By Jim Edwards | January 23, 2009 – BNET Said analysts at the time, "The Warner–Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders, so it is unclear who benefits from the Wyeth–Pfizer merger to many critics."Matthew Karnitschnig, & Jonathan D.

==Promotional practices==

Access to pharmaceutical industry documents has revealed marketing strategies used to promote Neurontin for off-label use. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer) only for treatment of seizures. Warner–Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used activities not usually associated with sales promotion, including continuing medical education and research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within 5 years the drug was being widely used for the off-label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner–Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses, and paid $430 million to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges.[ref]The settlement was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the False Claims Act.

[/ref]  Today it is a mainstay drug for migraines, even though it was not approved for such use in 2004.
In September 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed four drugs—Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica—"for non-approved uses; it was Pfizer's fourth such settlement in a decade.  Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Inc., a Pfizer subsidiary, agreed to plead guilty to misbranded promotion of Bextra, a felony violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The criminal fine accounts for $1.3 billion of the settlement, and was the largest criminal penalty imposed in American history until the BP plea agreement for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.The United States Department of Justice – United States Attorney's Office – District of Massachusetts[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]The United States Department of Justice – Office of Public Affairs - BP Exploration and Production Inc.

===Kelo case===

Pfizer's interest in obtaining property in New London, Connecticut, for expanded facilities led to the Kelo v. New London case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Kelo v. City of New London handed local governments the right to seize private property for economic development,http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html Kelo v. New London: Opinion of the Court i. e., offices, a hotel to enhance Pfizer Inc.'s nearby corporate facility. However, following the completion of the aforementioned Wyeth merger, Pfizer announced it will close its research and development headquarters in New London, Connecticut, moving employees to nearby Groton.  The property is now owned and operated by Electric Boat.

===Quigley Co.===

Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968, and the division sold asbestos-containing insulation products until the early 1970s.http://www.quigleyreorg.com Quigley Company reorganization Asbestos victims and Pfizer have been negotiating a settlement deal which calls for Pfizer to pay $430 million to 80 percent of existing plaintiffs. It will also place an additional $535 million into an asbestos settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20 percent of current plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley. The compensation deal is worth $965 million all up. Of that $535 million, $405 million is in a 40-year note from Pfizer, while $100 million will come from insurance policies.

===Bjork–Shiley heart valve===

Pfizer purchased Shiley in 1979 at the onset of its Convexo-Concave valve ordeal, involving the Bjork–Shiley heart valve.

The lawsuits also accuse Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. Pfizer denied these claims, and subsequently produced an approval letter for testing from the Nigerian Ethics Committee. The Nigerian government insisted that it was a fake and a panel of Nigerian medical experts agreed that the letter had been concocted and backdated by the company's lead researcher in Kano. They went on to conclude that Pfizer never obtained authorization from the Nigerian government to give the unproven drug to children and infants.Panel Faults Pfizer in '96 Clinical Trial In Nigeria.

===Wyeth's Rapamune===

A "whistleblower suit" was filed in 2005 against Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer, alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug Rapamune. Wyeth is targeted in the suit for off-label marketing, targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of Rapamune, trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to Rapamune and for specifically targeting African-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants, donations and other money.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/05/wyeth-targeted-blacks-with-illegal-marketing-lawsuit/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pharmalot+%28Pharmalot%29 |title=Wyeth Marketing Targeted Blacks Illegally: Lawsuit // Pharmalot |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Tracy Staton |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/congress-joins-probe-wyeths-rapamune-marketing/2010-06-14?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal |title=Congress joins probe into Wyeth's Rapamune marketing |publisher=FiercePharma |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl] A US House of Representatives committee, led by Rep.

===Brigham Young University===

Controversy arose over the drug "Celebrex."  Brigham Young University (BYU) said that a professor of chemistry, Dr. Daniel Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s which would later lead towards the development of Celebrex.  BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales which would equate to $9.7 billion.  The court filings show that a research agreement was made with Monsanto, later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin.  The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues.  A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations in regards to the Monsanto agreement.  This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial.  Pfizer said it would take a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site.  Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses.  Members of the surrounding communities have stated that the EPA has been coerced into accepting a plan that is affordable for Pfizer but is not a complete/proper remediation plan for the site, detrimental to the interest of the community.  The EPA has suggested a remediation plan that includes environmental caps and  redeveloping a portion of it in the future.  This redevelopment will occur on the site which is located within a flood plain, something the EPA failed to address in their feasibility study released in early 2012. The mayor of Bridgewater, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and other key community leaders also came out to endorse the plan without considering the amount of increased flooding that is going to take place if such a plan is implemented.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20120309/NJNEWS/303090029/Even-after-costly-clean-up-toxins-would-remain-American-Cyanamid-site |title=Even after costly clean-up, toxins would remain at American Cyanamid site |publisher=My Central Jersey |accessdate=March 21, 2012[/tpl]

==Political lobbying==

Pfizer is a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget, which funds American diplomatic, humanitarian, and development efforts abroad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition |title=U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members |publisher=Usglc.org |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]
Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics. For example in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3 million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25 million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.Steinbrook, R., 2009. Lobbying, Campaign Contributions, and Health Care Reform" New England Journal of Medicine 361(23), e52–e52. http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358

==AIDS involvement==

Pfizer has been involved in controversies over the medicine Diflucan (generic name fluconazole). In 1998, a campaign by Thai public health groups led to the elimination of the Pfizer monopoly on selling fluconazole in Thailand, and the price of the antifungal drug decreased from 200 baht to 6.5 baht in nine months, vastly expanding access to the medicine for AIDS patients. Faced with pressure for compulsory licenses to the Pfizer patent on this drug, Pfizer later established a program for limited access to the medicine in Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html |title=S.Africa okays Pfizer AIDS drug distribution|publisher=Reuters NewMedia|date=February 21, 2001 |first=Emelia|last=Sithole|accessdate=May 15, 2006[/tpl]
