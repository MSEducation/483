[[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]

CATEGORIES: Works about human pregnancy, Science fiction themes

Because speculative genres explore variants of reproduction, as well as possible futures, SF writers have often explored the social, political, technological, and biological consequences of pregnancy and reproduction.

==Themes==

As real-world reproductive technology has advanced, SF works have become increasingly interested in representing alternative modes of reproduction. Among the uses of pregnancy and reproduction themes regularly encountered in science fiction are:
The phenomenon of pregnancy itself has been the subject of numerous works, both directly and metaphorically. These works may relate pregnancy to parasitism or slavery, or simply use pregnancy as a strong contrast with horror. For example, in the film, Rosemary's Baby (1968) (based on the 1967 novel by Ira Levin) a woman is tricked into a satanic pregnancy by her husband.Lucy Fischer, "Birth Traumas: Parturition and Horror in Rosemary's Baby", Cinema Journal, v.31, n.3, pp. 3–16 (1992).Karyn Valerius, "Rosemary's Baby, Gothic Pregnancy, and Fetal Subjects", College Literature, v.32, no. 3, pp.116–135 (Summer 2005).

===Alien–human hybrids===

Inter-species reproduction and alien-human hybrids frequently occur in science fiction, and women being impregnated by aliens is a common theme in SF horror films, including I Married a Monster from Outer Space, Village of the Damned, Xtro, and Inseminoid.Kuhn, p. 215 The theme has even been parodied, such as in the soft porn Wham Bang! Thanks You Mister Spaceman. They are sometimes used as metaphors for social anxieties about miscegenation or hybridization,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] and other times used to explore the boundaries of humanity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]

==Reproduction and technology==

Speculative fiction in technology of reproduction may involve cloning and ectogenesis, i.e., artificial reproduction).
The latter part of the 2000s decade has also seen an upswing of films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology in contemporary reality rather than being speculation.chicagotribune.com --> Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter.

==Large-scale infertility or population growth==

Fertility and reproduction have been frequent sites for examination of concerns about the impact of the environment and reproduction on the future of humanity or civilization.  For example, The Children of Men by P.D. James is just one of many works which have considered the implications of global infertility; Make Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison is one of many works which have examined the converse, the implications of massive human population surges. Numerous other works, such as Venus Plus X and More Than Human by Theodore Sturgeon examine the future of humanity as it evolves, or particular breeding programs.

==Politics and gender politics==

Pregnancy and control of human reproduction have often been used as proxies for treating gender issues or broader themes of social control; works dealing with pregnancy and human reproduction have also been used to closely explore gender politics.  For instance, "male pregnancy" has been used to comedic effect in mainstream literature and films such as Junior (1994 film, dir. Ivan Reitman),Amy Cuomo, "The Scientific Appropriation of Female Reproductive Power in Junior", Extrapolation, v.39, n.4, pp. 352–363 (Winter 1988).Robert J. Sawyer, Male Pregnancy and has developed a following in fan fiction — the "m-preg" genre."Within fan fiction, a number of subgenres are well recognized....mpreg, where a man gets pregnant."[tpl]cite book |title= Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays|last= Hellekson|first= Karen |authorlink= |coauthors= Kristina Busse|year= 2006 |publisher=  McFarland|page=11 |isbn=978-0-7864-2640-9[/tpl]
The genre of feminist science fiction has explored single-sex reproduction in depth, particularly parthenogenesis, as well as gendered control over the ability and right to reproduce. See also numerous dystopian stories about state-controlled reproduction, abortion, and birth control, such as Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, or her short story, "Freeforall". These works have often been analyzed as explorations of contemporary political debates about reproduction and pregnancy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://genre-commentary.com/node/80|title=Impossible, Yet Inevitable: Unintended Pregnancy in Farscape, Deep Space Nine, Star Wars, and The X-Files |last= Spicer |first=Arwen |date= 23 January 2007 |publisher=Genre-Commentary.com |accessdate=16 January 2013| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081219102906/http://www.genre-commentary.com/node/80| archivedate= 19 December 2008[/tpl]Linda Badley, "Scully Hits the Glass Ceiling: Postmodernism, Postfeminism, Posthumanism, and The X-Files", in Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television (2000), pp. 61–90.
