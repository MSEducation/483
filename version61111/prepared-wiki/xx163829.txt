==Fictional organization history==

The Creators were a league of sorcerers from various time periods, some from at least as far back as the Pre-Cataclysmic era.  Backed by the power of the In-Betweener, the Creators temporarily took control of the universe by transforming themselves into stars in an attempt to control the entire universe, and forcing the real stars into human forms.  All was set right again by Doctor Strange and the Ancient One.Doctor Strange #26-28 (Vol. 2, Dec. 1977 - Apr. 1978 bi-monthly)
