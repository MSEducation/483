Guy Smiley is a character on Sesame Street who was dubbed "America's favorite game show host." His skits are among those on the show that parody commercial media.[tpl]cite journal |last=Poniewozik |first=James |others=Photographs by Greg Miller |date=2007-09-17 |title=17 Shows That Changed TV |journal=Time |volume=170 |issue=12 |pages=80 |issn=0040-781X [/tpl] Smiley has also hosted parodies of This Is Your Life called "Here Is Your Life." Guests who were profiled included a loaf of bread, a tooth and a tree (all aimed at teaching children how things are made). He has also hosted pageants for numbers and letters.
Performed by Jim Henson, the character was mostly discontinued upon Henson's death in 1990. He appeared as a background character in a street scene in 1998, and was performed by Steve Whitmire. He also appeared in the CD-ROMs, "Let's Make a Word" (a spoof of Let's Make a Deal) and "Get Set to Learn", where his voice was credited to Don Reardon. More recently the character has been performed by Eric Jacobson, starting with video inserts in the touring exhibit "Sesame Street Presents: The Body". As seen in the preview for the 39th season, Smiley will officially return to the show.
The character is said to be modeled after game show host Jim Perry.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=where is this documented?|date=June 2012[/tpl]

==Game shows==

Smiley has hosted many game show skits, such as:

==Other appearances==

Smiley did make some appearances that didn't have anything notable to do with his hosting career.  When Cookie Monster was in a bakery chewing up items that rhymed with the word "pie", Smiley came in announcing he was "Guy Smiley, star of daytime TV."  At this point, Cookie couldn't remember that it was a pie he was after, and the repeated use of words that did rhyme with "pie" did nothing to jog his memory. The scene ended with him chasing Smiley around the bakery, trying to eat him.
He also appeared in a sketch featuring Grover as an Elevator Operator.  It was to teach kids to face the front of an elevator.  In this sketch, "Mr Smiley" (as Grover calls him) is also voiced by Jim Henson, but with a different voice to his game show personality.
In one movie theatre skit with Bert and Ernie, using Smiley as a one-line extra, the character is puppeted by Richard Hunt.
He also appeared in On Vacation With Guy Smiley, in which he tried to photograph various animals in the jungle.
Smiley shows up as a non-speaking background extra (wearing an odd, unusually stern expression) along with many other muppets in the musical skit "Some/None".
The Colbert Report has also parodied Mitt Romney by comparing him to Smiley.

==Casting history==

==International==

Sesame Street is localized for international markets, where Smiley is often renamed. In Portugal, for example, he's "Carlos Luz", a play on words with the name of television presenter Carlos Cruz. In the Netherlands, he is called "Henk Glimlach", "glimlach" meaning "smile". In Germany, he appears simply as "Robert", possibly after Robert Lembke, a well-known game show host.
