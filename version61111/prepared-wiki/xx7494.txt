The Macedonians are the largest ethnic group in the country,  accounting for 64.2% of the total population, according to the 2002 census. They speak the Macedonian language and most are Orthodox Christians. Ethnic Albanians are the country's largest minority, making up one-quarter of the total population. They live mainly in the west and northwest. The Turks, who comprise nearly 4% of the population, are mostly scattered, though they form a majority in two municipalities (Plasnica and Centar Župa). The Romani make up 2.7% of the population and are also concentrated throughout Macedonia, while the Serbs, who form just under 2% of the total population, live mostly in the north of the country.

===Administrative divisions===

Macedonia is divided into eight statistical regions: Skopje, Pelagonia, Polog, Vardar, Eastern, Southeastern, Northeastern and Southwestern.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/english/katalog.asp?bg=1&pg=1.03 |title=General and Regional Statistics |publisher=State Staistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia|date= |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl]
The country is further divided into 84 municipalities. Until 1996, there were 123 municipalities, but several laws aimed at increasing the rights of minorities decreased the number of municipalities and modified their overall role. Skopje, the nation's capital, is itself divided into ten municipalities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umk.html |title=Municipalities of Macedonia |publisher=Statoids.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl]

==Economic geography==

Macedonia, like most countries in Eastern Europe, has a developing economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/groups.htm#oem |title=IMF Emerging and Developing Economies List |publisher=World Economic Outlook Database |date=April 2010 |accessdate=25 August 2010[/tpl] Under Yugoslavia, Macedonia saw the establishment of many factories and the significant modernisation of the country, especially after the devastating Skopje earthquake of 1963. Since independence in 1991, Macedonia has suffered the transition to market economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ceu.hu/cens/assets/files/publications/Exec_Economy_Macedonia |title=The Economy of Macedonia since Transition |publisher=Central European University |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010[/tpl] Greece, which believes that the republic is monopolising the cultural and historical heritage of Macedonia, imposed an embargo in 1993 and has prevented the country's accession to organisations like the European Union and NATO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/world/greece-to-lift-embargo-against-macedonia-if-it-scraps-its-flag.html?scp=1&sq=Greece%20to%20Lift%20Embargo%20Against%20Macedonia%20if%20It%20Scraps%20Its%20Flag%20&st=cse |title=Greece to Lift Embargo Against Macedonia if It Scraps Its Flag |publisher=New York Times |date=14 September 1995 |accessdate=25 August 2010 | first=Christopher S. | last=Wren[/tpl]
In 1995, the Greek embargo was lifted and Macedonia was finally able to access the IMF and World Bank. The country still suffers, however, from its isolation and lack of foreign investment. In 2007, the unemployment rate was estimated at 32% and the black market provided about 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.

===Characteristics and advantages===

The Republic of Macedonia's geographical positioning provides it with many advantages. One advantage is the geographical position of the country. It is the center of the Balkans, between Belgrade and Athens, Tirana and Sofia, between the Adriatic and Black Sea. The Vardar valley forms a natural corridor, which connects Greece to the rest of Europe. This corridor is crossed by the highway E75, which crosses in Europe and connects Scandinavia with Attica. This highway has also been renovated in Macedonia with the European Agency for Reconstruction, and the communication channels that connect the Adriatic to the Black Sea, called the Corridor VIII, were also upgraded and maintained through international assistance including the Italian one.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corridor8.org/index2.php?page=corridor_single&id=1 |title=Secretariat Corridor8.it |publisher=Corridor8.org |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl]
Macedonia is also rich with minerals. The country in fact has substantial deposits of chromium and other nonferrous metals like copper, zinc, manganese and nickel. The country also has gypsum mines, marble and granite, located in Pelagonia. Lignite, provides 80% of the Macedonian electricity. In addition to mines and quarries, the country has large cement plants and large complexes of metal, created by the communist regime.
Agriculture is encouraged by the significant water resources, managed by dams and canals. The presence of hot springs of volcanic origin can heat the greenhouses in winter, particularly in the Strumica region, whose products include tomatoes and cucumbers in the month of February. Different climates provide opportunities for various productions in the geographical area, so the vine and tobacco are operated in the south, the rice in the region of Kočani which is largely irrigated, and the wood industry is concentrated around Štip.Dominique Auzias and Jean-Paul Labourdette, cit., p. 182 Agriculture contributes a significant share of exports, especially with the wine and tobacco. The low cost of labor also helps the textile industry.
