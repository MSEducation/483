On the eve of Anzac Day 2008, over 160 headstones of veterans were painted over for maintenance to improve the inscriptions, which received criticism from visitors and the RSA due to the timing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/386661/War-grave-upgrade-angers |title=War-grave upgrade angers |date=25 April 2008 |work=The Press |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
