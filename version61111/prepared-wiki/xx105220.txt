==Biography==

Parkes studied graphic art and painting at the University of Kansas. As a student, Parkes was fascinated by various graphic processes, and he later became proficient in the difficult medium of the colour stone lithograph.  Many of his recent works have been produced as Aurographics, limited edition giclée prints.
His unique style evolved in isolation, after a period in which he gave up the practice of art altogether and went to India in search of philosophical illumination,[tpl]cite news|author=Lo, Kevin|title=A world of wonder: artist Michael Parkes traveled the globe in search of meaning and found it in the worlds he paints and sculpts|work=Art Business News|issue=30.2|date=February 2003|pages=116(2)[/tpl] a location that he and his wife continue to visit annually.[tpl]cite news|title=Fantasy Art has a Real Audience|date=June 1, 2005|publisher=Art Business News|accessdate=October 12, 2009[/tpl]
Early on, he painted in the generally abstract expressionist style common among his teachers.  However, he later began to draw and paint in a meticulous style of detailed representation. This style is realistic in principle, but often uses magical subject matter, with imagery drawn from a range of traditions including the cabalistic and the tantric. Strange beasts encounter mysterious winged women, good and evil fight out their eternal conflict.
Several of Parkes' works have been used as cover illustrations, including:
A Parkes sculpture, Angel Affair (2004), was the Sep/Oct 2004 cover illustration for the Dutch-language Fine Arts Magazine, which also contained a feature article on one of Parkes' exhibitions in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite news|title=Select Focus:  Michael Parkes|work=Fine Arts Magazine|date=Sep–Oct 2004|pages=front cover, pp. 92–93[/tpl]
