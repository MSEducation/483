The Olcott Park Greenhouse 4,500 square feet (420 m²) is a city-operated greenhouse located in the 40 acre (162,000 m²) Olcott Park at N 9th Avenue W and 7th Street N in Virginia, Minnesota. It is open to the public year-round without charge.
Olcott Park was named after W. J. Olcott, an officer of the Great Northern Mining Company. The company first leased the land to the city in 1905 for $1 per year if the city would pay taxes. In 1939 the city purchased the land for $9,015.
This three-room greenhouse dates from the 1930s. Its central room contains a good collection of exotic plants, ranging in size from small specimens to mature Ponderosa lemon trees bearing fruit, with cacti and succulents, large agave, palm, and ficus specimens. Historically, it was the site for huge begonia shows which attracted thousands of visitors. The north and south greenhouses were used to raise bedding plants for flower beds throughout the city.
