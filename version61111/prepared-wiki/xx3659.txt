==Overview==

The demographics of Hong Kong mainly consists of ethnic Chinese, making up more than 93.6% of the population.[tpl]Cite report|date=February 2012 |title=2011 Population Census – Summary Results |url=http://www.census2011.gov.hk/pdf/summary-results.pdf |publisher=Census and Statistics Department |page=37 |accessdate=14 July 2013|format=PDF[/tpl] The ancestral home of most Hong Kong people originates from various regions in Guangdong. Most Hong Kong people nowadays are the descendants of immigrants from Mainland China and around the world after the end of World War II. Despite Filipino and Indonesian foreign domestic helpers being the ethnic minorities, there are over 273,609 foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong,[tpl]cite web|title=Immigration Autonomy|url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/a_report_09-10/eng/ch1/index.htm|work=Immigration Department Annual Report 2009-2010|accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl] accounting for 4% of the entire population.

==Terminology==

People from Hong Kong generally refer to themselves, in Cantonese, as Hèung Góng Yàhn ([tpl]zh|t=香港人|cy=Hèung Góng Yàhn|l=Hong Kong people[/tpl]); however the term is not restricted to those of Chinese descent, owing to Hong Kong's nearly 150-year colonial history that saw the stationing of English, Indians and Russians among other ethnic groups as civil servants or traders. Thus a distinct and legitimate non-Cantonese culture with specifics to Hong Kong grew. Mixing of cultural groups did not occur much beyond governance and business owing to two main reasons:
In English, the term "Hong Kongers" (or sometimes Hongkongers) and "Hongkongese" are becoming more popular to describe the people of and culture of Hong Kong.Poon Angela and Jenny Wong, Struggling for Democracy Under China: The Implications of a Politicised 'Hongkongese' Identity http://www.civic-exchange.org/publications/Intern/2004-JennyandAngela.pdfSidney Cheung, Hong Kong Handover http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol5no1/sidney2.html The term 'Hong Konger' or 'Hongkonger' is used to refer to the Hong Kong people, while 'Hong Kong' (or 'Hongkongese') is an adjective for people or things related to Hong Kong.

==Demographic statistics==

===Census data===

At the end of the 20th century Hong Kong had one of the lowest birth rates in the world. A fast increase in the number of births was recorded during the past decade: between 2001 and 2011 the number of births doubled. However, this increase was not caused by an increase of the fertility rate of Hong Kong women, but by an increase in the number of children born in Hong Kong to women with residence in Mainland China. In 2001 there were 7,810 births to Mainland women (16%) out of a total of 48,219 births. This increased to 37,253 births to Mainland women (45%) out of a total of 82,095 births.The fertility trend in Hong Kong 1981-2009
