==History==

North Bend was founded during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s and was the site of various Canadian Pacific Railway company offices and housing. Equipped with a small railway hotel, Fraser Canyon House, aka the North Bend Hotel or the CPR Hotel, and another, larger hotel, the Mountain Hotel, and within a few hours' range of Vancouver by rail, the town prospered until the era of highway travel, when it became isolated.  It was connected to Boston Bar and the Trans-Canada Highway for many years by the Boston Bar Ferry, an aerial cable ferry which has since been replaced by a bridge built to expedite logging operations on the east bank of the Fraser in that area.  North Bend today is part of the general Boston Bar-area community and shares community services with it.
