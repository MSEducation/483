Butleigh Court, which was abandoned for many years and has now been brought back into use, is noted for its interesting architecture including the tall carved chimney stacks, which are all different. Local legend has it that the family was cursed to die out within a hundred years, which subsequently happened. Another interesting landmark is the cedar avenue, just outside the village. It was built in 1845 by J. C. Buckler, for Henry Neville-Grenville, on the site of an earlier building.[tpl]cite web | title= Butleigh Court | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=267748 | accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]
The village history is told in a slim book, Butleigh — One thousand years of an English Village, by E. F. Synge, a former vicar at the parish church. A reconstruction of life of one farm worker, John Hodges, who lived in the village during the Victorian era, is illustrated at the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury.
