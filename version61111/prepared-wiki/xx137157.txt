===Juventus===

He would be involved in a controversial transfer saga in the summer of 2007.

===Central Coast Mariners===

On 19 July 2010, Vantstrattan was signed by the Central Coast Mariners after he wanted to move back home.Jess To Make Coast Switch Central Coast had recently lost first choice goal keeper Danny Vukovic to Turkish club Konyaspor. The deal was officially confirmed by the Mariners on 19 July 2010. Unfortunately, weeks after signing with the club, Van Stratten suffered a second ACL rupture and missed the duration of the season.Van’s the Man for the Central Coast
On 14 April 2011 Vanstrattan was then released by the Mariners. He would never sign for another professional club and thus retire from football, playing only 34 games in a 12 year career, averaging a game every 4 and a half months. Depression and lack of skill is most likely the reasoning. He is currently is Goalkeeping coach at the Central Coast Mariners Academy which probably explains why Liam Reddy is so crap.
