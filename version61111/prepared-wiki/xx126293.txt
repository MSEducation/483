==Writing and Recording==

Dry County Girl
"I was writing with Marcus last year 2001 and he said, "Mind if I play you a song?" He played it in my truck while we were on the way to lunch and I was blown away. The melody is so captivating. I played it for Jay and Gary and we loved it and put it on hold. It has a lot of energy and a good little story" ~Joe Don Rooney
Like I Am
"This is a very special song for me, since I wrote it after a conversation with my girlfriend Kassidy. For me, like for a lot of men, when a woman says great things about you it can be hard to believe. I thought, "I don’t see EVERYTHING you see in me, but since you see it, I’ll try to be that way." It was very easy to write, and as soon as I came up with the melody I shared the idea with Danny Orton and we wrote it." ~Joe Don Rooney
You
The song "You" was originally scheduled to be recorded by Tim McGraw when the band discovered it towards the end of recording. The publishing company told them if Tim didn't record the song by 2 p.m. that day they could have it. He didn't cut it and the band recorded it that same day.[tpl]Wayback |date=20021207220902 |url=rascalflatts.com/music.htm |title=archived page from Rascalflatts.com from 2002 [/tpl].
Shine On
"When we won the ACM award, the 7th to 12th graders in my hometown, Picher, Oklahoma, made a huge banner and posed in the gymnasium with it. It said, "Shine On, Joe Don." It was so sweet, and I thought, "We’ve gotta write a song called ‘Shine On’." A few months afterward I had this cool melody on the bus and the "Shine On" idea came into my head. I was playing it for Jay and Gary and they started singing this melody over the chord progression. I said, "Sing ‘Shine on’" and boom, right then and there it was married together. It was magic. We wrote it in about 45 minutes." ~Joe Don Rooney
