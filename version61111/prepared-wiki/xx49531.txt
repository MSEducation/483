[[Gemütlichkeit]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological terminology, German words and phrases

Gemütlichkeit ([tpl]IPA-de|ɡəˈmyːtlɪçkaɪt|-|De-gemuetlichkeit.ogg[/tpl]) means a situation that induces a cheerful mood, peace of mind, with connotation of belonging and social acceptance, coziness and unhurry.
Gemütlichkeit derives from gemütlich, the adjective of Gemüt, which means "heart, mind, temper, feeling" expressed by (and cognate with) English mood. This German abstract noun has been adopted into English.[tpl]cite book | title = Oxford dictionary of English| author = Soanes, C. and Stevenson, A. (ed.) | year=   2007| publisher = Oxford University Press[/tpl] The current meaning of the word derives from its use in the Biedermeier period. By the second half of the 19th century, it also became associated with a set of traits supposedly unique to Germans and German culture.   In the United States, the city of Jefferson, Wisconsin uses the phrase: "The Gemütlichkeit City" as its motto.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jeffersonchamberwi.com/ |title=Jefferson Chamber of Commerce | in Jefferson, WI |publisher=Jeffersonchamberwi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]
The song The Bare Necessities from Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), where a cheerful Baloo explains how "a bear can rest at ease with just the bare necessities of life" was rendered as Probier’s mal mit Gemütlichkeit ("consider trying Gemütlichkeit") in the German version. As to talk of "bare necessities" has a certain ring of asceticism to it, the German text seems to convey Baloo's personality even more properly than the original, in spite of not rendering the pun.
In the 1973 English contract law case Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd, a holidaymaker sued after not receiving the Gemütlichkeit promised by the promotional literature for a package holiday to the Swiss Alps.
The word can be used in descriptions of holidays.[ref]

described it as a tradition of "public festivity" (in the form of a "mixture of music, food, and drink"), which "promoted community solidarity."  The Harlem Renaissance was then cited as of how a sense of Gemütlichkeit arises from a "mix of music, art and politics in service of community consciousness".
A less common use of Gemütlichkeit can be found in reference to the economic policy makers and analysts in the United States involved in influencing the decisions of the board of the Federal Reserve System.  With respect to the "inflation dampening effects of globalization", a Georgia Southern University professor writes that interpreting certain U.S. economic trends could "spell an end of the Gemütlichkeit — a situation in which cheap labor and money abroad as well as ever-increasing productivity at home had permitted an uninterrupted spell of controlled growth in overall prices".

Nevertheless, the English author Chesterton wrote in his 1906 book on Charles Dickens, that the English word "cosiness" is not translatable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/CD-2.txt|author=Gilbert Keith Chesterton|title=Charles Dickens|year=1906|accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl] The context of the quote is a section in the first half of the seventh chapter on "English comfort": "The word "comfort" is not indeed the right word, it conveys too much of the slander of mere sense; the true word is "cosiness," a word not translatable."  Chesterton may have given German and the above mentioned Continental nationalities short shrift momentarily, as much of the beginning of that chapter is a comprehensive description of what Gemütlichkeit stands for. On the other hand, Chesterton mentioned in the same chapter a few sections earlier, that "... the thing you cannot see out of Germany is a German beer-garden", an emblem of Gemütlichkeit. Thus the sentence may either reflect Chesterton's peculiar or idiosyncratic thought process or the term "not translatable" stands for the difficulty to find a synonym, to express the emotion of cosiness or Gemütlichkeit in words, also exemplified in the radio interview of Danish visitors quoted above.
