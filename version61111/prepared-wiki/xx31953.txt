In Greek mythology, Aoide ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀοιδή[/tpl]) (or in Latin Aoede) was one of the three original (Boeotian) Muses, though there were later nine.  Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. 
She lends her name to the moon Jupiter XLI, also called Aoede, which orbits the planet Jupiter.
