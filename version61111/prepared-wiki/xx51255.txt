Other recorded populations were the Limba ( 8%), the Kono (5%), the Loko (2%) and the Sierra Leone Creole people (2%), while 15% were recorded as "others".
The wars and civil conflict throughout West Africa,http://www.cryfreetown.org/ have resulted in a decrease in the presence of the traditional music artists.
