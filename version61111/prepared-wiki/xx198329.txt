Knowing is a 2009 American-British science fiction disaster film directed by Alex Proyas and starring Nicolas Cage. The project was originally attached to a number of directors under Columbia Pictures, but it was placed in turnaround and eventually picked up by Escape Artists. Production was financially backed by Summit Entertainment. Knowing was filmed in Docklands Studios Melbourne, Australia, using various locations to represent the film's Boston-area setting. The film was released on 20 March 2009, in the United States. The DVD and Blu-ray media were released on 7 July 2009.

==Plot==

In 1959, student Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) hears whispers as she stares at the sun. When her class is chosen to contribute to the school's Time Capsule, each child is asked to draw what they believe the future will look like. Lucinda writes a page of seemingly random numbers and adds it to her elementary school's time capsule, which is set to be opened in 50 years. Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish but Lucinda continues before her teacher takes it off her desk unfinished. Lucinda then goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found by her teacher, Mrs. Taylor (Danielle Carter), in a utility closet scratching numbers into the door with her fingernails bleeding.
In 2009, Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) is a pupil at the same elementary school as Lucinda. When the time capsule is opened, Caleb is supposed to read and write about some of the capsule's contents. He's given the page of numbers written by Lucinda. His widowed father Jonathan (Nicolas Cage), a professor of astrophysics at MIT, notices the numbers have a specific set of sequences referring to the times and locations of fatal disasters over the last 50 years, including 911012996 (the date and death toll of the 9/11 attacks). The last three sets of digits are dated in the immediate future.
In the following days, a car drives by the family home with two strangers. They give Caleb a small smooth stone. Caleb later dreams of one of the strange men, who points to the window showing the world on fire with burning animals running out from a forest.
Jonathan tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana (Rose Byrne) and granddaughter Abby. Though apprehensive and scared, Diana eventually decides to help Jonathan. She says that her mother used to hear voices and that the next date in the document, October 19, was the day Lucinda always said Diana would die. Searching Lucinda's mobile home, they find pictures of the disasters she predicted, a copy of Matth√§us Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's "chariot vision", and a pile of small smooth stones near Lucinda's bed. The last number in the document appears to be "33" but they notice that it is really "EE" written backwards. They figure out that EE also means "Everyone Else", representing a cataclysm that no one will escape.
Outside, more strangers walk up to the children waiting in the car. John drives them away only to have Abby say that the "whisper people" want her and Caleb to go with them.
The next day, Jonathan has a sudden revelation and rushes them to the MIT observatory, where he discovers that a massive solar flare will soon reach Earth, making it uninhabitable. Diana wants to hide in some caves. Jonathan reluctantly agrees at first, but Diana decides to take the children and heads for the caves without him.
While Diana stops for gas, an emergency broadcast is transmitted to alert the world of the solar flare. Jonathan calls Diana to tell her that the caves are not entirely reliable as the flare's radiation will penetrate a mile into the Earth's crust. While on the phone, the strangers take the children. Diana chases after them but is broadsided by a truck. Jonathan arrives to find the gas station in chaos as customers begin to panic and start looting the store following the broadcast. Jonathan arrives just as Diana dies at exactly midnight and finds the smooth, black stone in Diana's hand. He goes back to Lucinda's mobile home, finding the children and the strangers waiting in a dry river bed covered with the similar black stones. A space ship descends from the sky. Jonathan is refused entry but allows his son to leave with the strangers, who are revealed to be otherworldly beings, strongly hinted to be angels. The ship departs with the children and a pair of rabbits, and a distant shot shows many similar vehicles leaving Earth.
The next morning the skies are on fire from the solar flare. Jonathan drives calmly while listening to classical music through the chaos within the streets of Boston, arriving at his estranged father's home. Together they embrace as the solar flare burns away the atmosphere. A wall of fire incinerates Boston and burns away the entire surface of the Earth, destroying all life on the planet.
Caleb and Abby are deposited by the beings on an Earth-like planet. In the final scene they are seen running through a beautiful field of grass towards a giant white tree which strongly resembles the Tree of Life.

==Production==

In 2001, novelist Ryne Douglas Pearson approached producers Todd Black and Jason Blumenthal with his idea for a film, where a time capsule from the 1950s is opened revealing fulfilled prophecies, the last one of which ended with 'EE' - "everyone else". The producers liked the concept and bought his script.[tpl]cite video|title=Knowing All: The Making of a Futuristic Thriller|location=Knowing DVD[/tpl] The project was set up at Columbia Pictures. Both Rod Lurie and Richard Kelly were attached as directors, but the film eventually went into turnaround. The project was picked up by the production company Escape Artists, and the script was rewritten by Stiles White and Juliet Snowden. Director Alex Proyas was attached to direct the project in February 2005.[tpl]cite journal|first=Nicole |last=Laporte |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918117.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Proyas digs Knowing gig |journal=Variety |date=16 February 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] Proyas said the aspect that attracted him the most was the "very different script" and the notion of people seeing the future and "how it shape their lives". Summit Entertainment took on the responsibility to fully finance and distribute the film.

The film is set primarily in the town of Lexington with some scenes set in the nearby cities of Cambridge and Boston. However, it was shot in Australia, where director Proyas resides.

The scenographic rain led to the usage of a new gel for the flames so the fire would not be put out, and semi-permanent make-up to make them last the long shooting hours. The solar flare destruction sequence is set in New York City, showing notable landmarks such as the Metlife Building, Times Square and the Empire State Building being obliterated."Knowing Film Locations."

Proyas used a Red One 4K digital camera, making the film the first time the director used digital cameras.[tpl]cite news|last=Fischer |first=Paul |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/interviews/proyask.php/ |title=SDCC Interview: Alex Proyas for Knowing |work=Dark Horizons |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008[/tpl] He sought to capture a gritty and realistic look to the film, and his approach involved a continuous two-minute scene in which Cage's character sees a plane crash and attempts to rescue passengers. The scene was an arduous task, taking two days to set up and two days to shoot. Proyas explained the goal, "I did that specifically to not let the artifice of visual effects and all the cuts and stuff we can do, get in the way of the emotion of the scene."[tpl]cite news|last=Minnick |first=Remy |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17682 |title=Alex Proyas: And Knowing Is Half The Battle |work=Comic Book Resources |date=12 August 2008 |accessdate=26 November 2008[/tpl]

A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, "If your intention is to make a brooding, hauntingly allegorical terror-thriller, it's probably not a good sign when spectacles of mass death and intimations of planetary destruction are met with hoots and giggles ... The draggy, lurching two hours of ‚ÄúKnowing‚Äù will make you long for the end of the world, even as you worry that there will not be time for all your questions to be answered."[tpl]cite news|last=Scott |first=A.

He thought Nicolas Cage "borders on ridiculous here, in part because of a script that gives him little to do but freak out or act depressed".[tpl]cite news|last=Hartlaub |first=Peter |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/20/DDLG16IL0E.DTL |title=Movie review: Knowing funny for a thriller |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl]
Writing for The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan thought the film was "creepy, at least for the first two-thirds or so, in a moderately satisfying, if predictable, way ... But the narrative corner into which this movie... paints itself is a simultaneously brilliant and exciting one. Well before the film neared its by turns dismal and ditzy conclusion, I found myself knowing‚Äîyet hardly able to believe‚Äîwhat was about to happen."[tpl]cite news|last=O'Sullivan |first=Michael |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/19/AR2009031901082.html |title=Few Surprises in Knowing |work=The Washington Post  |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found it to be "moody and sometimes ideologically provocative" and added, "Knowing has its grim moments‚Äîand by that I mean the sort of cringe- (or laugh-) inducing lines of dialogue that have haunted disaster films through the ages ... So visually arresting are the images that watching a deconstructing airliner or subway train becomes more mesmerising than horrifying."[tpl]cite news|last=Sharkey |first=Betsy |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-knowing20-2009mar20,0,4009291.story |title=Review: Knowing |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl]
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was enthusiastic, rating it four stars out of four and writing, "Knowing is among the best science-fiction films I've seen‚Äîfrightening, suspenseful, intelligent and, when it needs to be, rather awesome" He continued, "With expert and confident storytelling, Proyas strings together events that keep tension at a high pitch all through the film. Even a few quiet, human moments have something coiling beneath. Pluck this movie, and it vibrates."[tpl]cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090318/REVIEWS/903189991/1023 |title=Knowing |work=Chicago Sun-Times  |date=18 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl] Ebert later listed it as the sixth best film of 2009.
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suggested Knowing was saved by its ending, concluding that "the film sticks to its apocalyptic guns with a spectacular and thoroughly unexpected finish."[tpl]cite news |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/26/knowing-film-review-nicolas-cage |title=Film review: Knowing |work=The Guardian |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2011 [/tpl] Philip French's review in The Observer suggested the premise was "intriguing B-feature apocalypse, determinism versus free-will stuff" and that the ending has something for everyone: "A chosen few will apparently be swept away by angels to a better place. If you're a Christian fundamentalist who believes that Armageddon is nigh, you'll have a family hug and wake up to be greeted by St Peter at the Pearly Gates. On the other hand, Darwinists will be gratified to see Gaia and her stellar opposite numbers sock it to an unconcerned mankind."[tpl]cite news |first=Philip |last=French |authorlink=Philip French |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/29/sciencefictionandfantasy |title=Film review: Knowing |work=The Observer |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2011 [/tpl]

===Litigation===

On 25 November 2009, Global Findability filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Summit Entertainment and Escape Artists in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, claiming that a geospatial entity object code was used in the film Knowing which infringed U.S. Patent No. 7,107,286 entitled "Integrated Spatial Information Processing System for Geospatial Positioning."[tpl]cite news|title=Complaint|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/11/30/TechPat.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=Courthouse News|date=30 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|title=Can a science-fiction movie infringe a tech patent?|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/science-fiction-movie-infringe-tech-63508|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Crouch|first=Dennis|title=Patents and the Movie Industry: Stopping [tpl]sic|Nich|olas|hide=y[/tpl] Cage|url=http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/12/nicholas-cage-patent.html|publisher=PatentlyO blog|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl] The case was dismissed on 10 January 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Case Docket for No. 09-2247|url=http://ia600208.us.archive.org/7/items/gov.uscourts.dcd.139658/gov.uscourts.dcd.139658.docket.html|publisher=PACER docket saved on archive.org|accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]

===Science controversy===

Regarding the film's grounding in science, Director Alex Proyas said at a press conference, "The science was important. I wanted to make the movie credible. So of course we researched as much as we could and tried to give it as much authenticity as we could."Erin McCarthy Knowing Blends Science Fact with Fiction Popular Mechanics, Retrieved January 5, 2012
However, Ian O'Neill of Discovery News criticized the film's solar flare plot line, pointing out that the most powerful solar flares happen 100 million miles away from Earth, and thus could never incinerate Earthly cities.Ian O'Neill ‚ÄúKnowing‚Äù How Solar Flares Don‚Äôt Work Astro Engine, Retrieved January 5, 2012 According to MIT physicist Dr. Edward Farhi, the sun will eventually expand into a red giant and envelop Earth, but "Our sun is very, very far from that," Farhi says. "It's 4 billion years away."
Erin McCarthy of Popular Mechanics calls attention to the film's confusion of numerology, the occult's study of how numbers like dates of birth influence human affairs, with the ability of science to describe the world mathematically to make predictions about things like weather or create technology like cell phones.
Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique refers to the film's approach as disappointingly "pseudo-scientific." He writes, "Cage plays an astronomer, and his discussions with a colleague hint that the film may actually grapple with the question of predicting the future, perhaps even offer a plausible theory. Unfortunately, this approach is abandoned as Koestler pursues the disasters, and the film eventually moves into a mystical approach."Steve Biodrowski Knowing - Science Fiction Film Review Cinefantastique, Retrieved January 5, 2012
Asked about his research for the role, Nicolas Cage stated, "I grew up with a professor, so that was all the research I ever needed." His father, August Coppola, was a professor of comparative literature at Cal State Long Beach."August Coppola, arts educator, dies at 75." San Francisco Chronicle Cage plays an astrophysicist at MIT in the film.
