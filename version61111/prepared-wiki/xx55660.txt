[[Eurovision Young Dancers 1993]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision Young Dancers

The 5th Eurovision Young Dancers Competition final was held in Stockholm, Sweden on June 15, 1993.
Although the number of countries remained 15, there were many changes, since 4 countries took part for the first time (Poland, Estonia, Slovenia and Greece) and Austria returned, but 5 countries withdrew (Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia).
As it happened in 1989 and 1991, a semifinal was held to choose the finalists. The semifinal took place 2 days before the final (13 June 1993).
