[[Naturopathy]]

CATEGORIES: Alternative medical systems, Naturopathic medicine, Simple living, Vitalism, Pseudoscience

Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is a form of alternative medicine based on a belief in vitalism, which posits that a special energy called "vital energy" or "vital force" guides bodily processes such as metabolism, reproduction, growth, and adaptation. Naturopathy favors a holistic approach with non-invasive treatment and generally avoids the use of surgery and drugs. Practitioners of naturopathy often prefer methods of treatment that are not compatible with evidence-based medicine, and in doing so, reject the tenets of biomedicine and modern science. Naturopathic medicine is replete with pseudoscientific, ineffective, unethical, and possibly dangerous practices.
The term "naturopathy" is derived from Latin and Greek, and literally translates as "nature disease". Modern naturopathy grew out of the Natural Cure movement of Europe. The term was coined in 1895 by John Scheel and popularized by Benedict Lust, the "father of U.S. naturopathy". Beginning in the 1970s, there was a revival of interest in the United States and Canada, in conjunction with the holistic health movement. Today, naturopathy is primarily practiced in the United States and Canada. The scope of practice varies widely between jurisdictions, and naturopaths in unregulated jurisdictions may use the Naturopathic Doctor designation or other titles regardless of level of education.
Naturopathic practitioners in the United States can be divided into three categories: traditional naturopaths; naturopathic physicians; and other health care providers that provide naturopathic services. Naturopathic physicians employ the principles of naturopathy within the context of conventional medical practices. Naturopathy comprises many different treatment modalities, including nutritional and herbal medicine, lifestyle advice, counseling, flower essence, homeopathy and remedial massage.
Much of the ideology and methodological underpinnings of naturopathy are in conflict with the paradigm of evidence-based medicine. Many naturopaths have opposed vaccination based in part on the early views that shaped the profession. According to the American Cancer Society, "scientific evidence does not support claims that naturopathic medicine can cure cancer or any other disease, since virtually no studies on naturopathy as a whole have been published."

==History==

Some see the ancient Greek "Father of Medicine", Hippocrates, as the first advocate of naturopathic medicine, before the term existed.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.naturopathy-uk.com/home/home-what-is-naturopathy/ |title= What is Naturopathy? |work= College of Naturopathic Medicine website |location= UK |accessdate= |author=  [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ncahf.org/articles/j-n/naturo.html |title= NCAHF Fact Sheet on Naturopathy |accessdate= 2009-04-17 |date= January 30, 2001 |origyear= copyright 1997 |last= Jarvis |first= William T. |publisher= National Council Against Health Fraud [/tpl] The modern practice of naturopathy has its roots in the Nature Cure movement of Europe during the 19th century.[tpl]cite journal |pmc= 1139856 |title= Nineteenth-century American health reformers and the early nature cure movement in Britain |last= Brown |first= P.S. |journal= Medical History |volume= 32 |pages= 174–194 |pmid= 3287059 |issue= 2 |date= April 1, 1988 |doi=10.1017/S0025727300047980[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |last=Langley |first= Stephen |title= History of Naturopathy |work= College of Naturopathic Medicine website |publisher= |location=UK |url=http://www.naturopathy-uk.com/blog/2007/11/28/history-of-naturopathy/ |accessdate= [/tpl] In Scotland, Thomas Allinson started advocating his "Hygienic Medicine" in the 1880s, promoting a natural diet and exercise with avoidance of tobacco and overwork.[ref][tpl]cite web |title= How it all began |url= http://www.allinsonflour.co.uk/history/ |author=  |work= Allinson Flour website |publisher= Silver Spoon, British Sugar, Associated British Foods |accessdate= [/tpl]

In 1901, Lust founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York. In 1902 the original North American Kneipp Societies were discontinued and renamed "Naturopathic Societies". In September 1919 the Naturopathic Society of America was dissolved and Benedict Lust founded the American Naturopathic Association to supplant it.[tpl]cite web |title= Naturopathy: A Critical Analysis |last1= Beyerstein |first1= Barry L. |last2= Downie |first2= Susan |date= May 12, 2004 |accessdate= 2009-03-21 |work= NaturoWatch |publisher= QuackWatch |url= http://www.naturowatch.org/general/beyerstein.html[/tpl] Naturopaths became licensed under naturopathic or drugless practitioner laws in 25 states in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Naturopathy was adopted by many chiropractors, and several schools offered both Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) and Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degrees. Estimates of the number of naturopathic schools active in the United States during this period vary from about one to two dozen.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.idt.mdh.se/kurser/ct3340/archives/ht03/assignment-2d-extra-articles/Alternative%20Medicine.pdf |title= Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) |year= 1997 |publisher= American Medical Association |laysummary= http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/csaph/csaa-97.pdf |laysource= 1997 Annual Meeting of the American Medical Association:Summaries and Recommendations of the Council on Scientific Affairs |laydate= 1997[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title= Naturopathic Medicine | publisher = American Cancer Society  |date= November 1, 2008  |url= http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/MindBodyandSpirit/naturopathic-medicine  | accessdate = 2010-11-20 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101130114645/http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/MindBodyandSpirit/naturopathic-medicine |archivedate= 2010-11-30 [/tpl]
After a period of rapid growth, naturopathy went into decline for several decades after the 1930s. In 1910 the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching published the Flexner Report, which criticized many aspects of medical education, especially quality and lack of scientific rigour. The advent of penicillin and other "miracle drugs" and the consequent popularity of modern medicine also contributed to naturopathy's decline. In the 1940s and 1950s, a broadening in scope of practice laws led many chiropractic schools to drop their ND degrees, though many chiropractors continued to practice naturopathy. From 1940 to 1963, the American Medical Association campaigned against heterodox medical systems. By 1958 practice of naturopathy was licensed in only five states. In 1968 the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued a report on naturopathy concluding that naturopathy was not grounded in medical science and that naturopathic education was inadequate to prepare graduates to make appropriate diagnosis and provide treatment; the report recommends against expanding Medicare coverage to include naturopathic treatments.[tpl]cite web |title= HEW Report on Naturopathy (1968) |url= http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/hew.html |author=  |date= August 30, 1999 |work= QuackWatch |accessdate= 2013-09-03[/tpl] Citing: [tpl]cite book |last = Cohen |first = Wilbur J. |title = Independent Practitioners Under Medicare: A Report to the Congress | publisher = United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare |year= 1969 |oclc= 3000280  |url=   | isbn= [/tpl] In 1977 an Australian committee of inquiry reached similar conclusions; it did not recommend licensure for naturopaths.[tpl]cite web |title= Naturopathy: Report of the Australian Committee of Inquiry (1977) |url= http://www.naturowatch.org/hx/australia.html |author=  |work= NaturoWatch |publisher= QuackWatch |date= December 25, 2003 |accessdate= 2013-09-03[/tpl] Citing: [tpl]cite book |last= Webb |first= Edwin C. |last2= et al. |title= Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Chiropractic, Osteopathy, Homoeopathy and Naturopathy |publisher= Australian Government Publishing Service |location= Canberra |year= 1977 |pages=|isbn= 064292287X |oclc= |doi= |url= [/tpl] As of 2009, fifteen U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia licensed naturopathic doctors,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=57 |title= Licensed States & Licensing Authorities |work= American Association of Naturopathic Physicians website |author=  |publisher=  |year= 2009 |accessdate= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091130234327/http://naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=57 |archivedate= 2009-11-30[/tpl] and the state of Washington requires insurance companies to offer reimbursement for services provided by naturopathic physicians.[tpl]cite web |title= Washington Administrative Code: Title 284, Chapter 43, Section 205: Every category of health providers |url= http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=284-43-205 |publisher= Washington State Legislature |date= August 28, 1999 (effective)[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title= Insuring Alternatives |series= NewsHour with Jim Lehrer |serieslink= PBS NewsHour |last= Minott |first= Rod |transcript= Online NewsHour transcript |transcripturl= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july96/alt_medicines_7-3.html |date= July 3, 1996 |network= PBS[/tpl] South Carolina and Tennessee prohibit the practice of naturopathy.

==Practice==

Naturopathy is based on vitalism, which posits that a special energy called vital energy or vital force guides bodily processes such as metabolism, reproduction, growth, and adaptation. Diagnosis and treatment focus on alternative therapies which naturopaths claim promote the body's natural ability to heal.[tpl]cite web |url= http://skepdic.com/natpathy.html |title= Naturopathy |accessdate= 2009-04-17 |date= February 23, 2009 |last= Carroll |first=Robert T. |work= The Skeptic's Dictionary  |archivedate= 2009-05-05 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090505052716/http://www.skepdic.com/natpathy.html  |deadurl= no[/tpl] Naturopaths focus on a holistic approach, often completely avoiding the use of surgery and drugs.[tpl]cite book|last1=Sarris|first1=Jerome|last2=Wardle|first2=Jon|title=Clinical Naturopathy: An evidence-based guide to practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lpEAJ9vjPyUC&pg=PT32|accessdate=2013-09-01|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone / Elsevier Health Sciences |location= Sydney |isbn=9780729579261|pages=32–36[/tpl] Naturopaths aim to prevent illness through stress reduction and changes to diet and lifestyle, often rejecting the methods of evidence based medicine.[tpl]cite book |editor1-last= Clark |editor1-last= Carolyn C. |editor2-last= Gordon |editor2-first= Rena J. |title= Encyclopedia of Complementary Health Practice |chapterurl= http://books.google.com/books?id=cwYnA1qunUwC&pg=PA57 |accessdate= 2013-09-03 |year= 1999 |publisher= Springer Publishing |isbn= 9780826117229 |pages= 57–59 |chapter= Naturopathy: Practice Issues |last= Pizzorno |first= Joseph E.[/tpl]
A consultation typically begins with a lengthy patient interview focusing on lifestyle, medical history, emotional tone, and physical features, as well as physical examination. Many naturopaths present themselves as primary care providers, and some may prescribe drugs, perform minor surgery, and integrate other conventional medical approaches with their naturopathic practice.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cnme.org/resources/2007_hoa.pdf |title= Handbook of Accreditation for Naturopathic Medicine Programs |year= 2007 |publisher= Council on Naturopathic Medical Education |accessdate= 2010-11-20[/tpl] However, traditional naturopaths focus exclusively on lifestyle changes, not diagnosing or treating disease. Naturopaths do not generally recommend vaccines and antibiotics, based in part on the early views that shaped the profession, and they may provide alternative remedies even in cases where evidence-based medicine has been shown effective.

===Methods===

The particular modalities used by an individual naturopath varies with training and scope of practice. These include: Acupuncture, applied kinesiology, botanical medicine, brainwave entrainment, chelation therapy for atherosclerosis,[tpl]cite journal |last= Atwood IV |first= Kimball.

===Traditional naturopaths===

Traditional naturopaths are represented in the United States by the American Naturopathic Association (ANA), representing about 1,800 practitioners [tpl]cite book|editor1-last=Swartout|editor1-first=Kristy A.|author2=Thomson Gale (Firm)|title=Encyclopedia of Associations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wf6PPHSMD4IC|accessdate=2013-09-04|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=9780787682866|pages=1777–1778[/tpl] and the American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA).[tpl]cite web |url= http://anma.org/  |title= American Naturopathic Medical Association |work= American Naturopathic Medical Associaton website |publisher=  |author=  |date= [/tpl][tpl]Self-published source|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]Self-published inline|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The level of naturopathic training varies among traditional naturopaths in the United States. Traditional naturopaths may complete non-degree certificate programs or undergraduate degree programs and generally refer to themselves as Naturopathic Consultants. These programs often offer online unaccredited degrees, but do not offer proper biomedical education or clinical training. Those completing a Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree from an ANMCB approved school can become a Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.anmcb.org |title= American Naturopathic Medical Certification Board |work= American Naturopathic Medical Certification Board website |accessdate= 2010-03-12 |publisher=  |date=  |author= [/tpl][tpl]Self-published source|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]Self-published inline|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first= Paul |last= Wendel |title= Standardized Naturopathy |year= 1951 |location= Brooklyn, NY |publisher= Wendel |oclc= 6617124[/tpl][tpl]Self-published source|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]Self-published inline|date=September 2013[/tpl] This board certification is in no way the same as holding an ND license and holds no weight in states that regulate the practice of naturopathic medicine.

===Lack of scientific basis===

Naturopathy lacks an adequate scientific basis, and it is rejected by the medical community. Some methods rely on immaterial "vital energy fields", the existence of which has not been proven, and there is concern that naturopathy as a field tends towards isolation from general scientific discourse.[tpl]cite book |last1= Herbert |first1= Victor |last2= Barrett |first2= Stephen |title= The Vitamin Pushers: How the "Health Food" Industry is Selling America a Bill of Goods |publisher= Prometheus Books |location= Buffalo, NY |year= 1994 |pages= |isbn=9780879759094 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1= Barrett |first1= Stephen |last2= Raso |first2= Jack |title=Mystical Diets: Paranormal, Spiritual, and Occult Nutrition Practices |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, New York |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0879757612 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] Naturopathy is criticized for its reliance on and its association with unproven, disproven, and other controversial alternative medical treatments, and for its vitalistic underpinnings.[tpl]cite news| first= Peter |last= McKnight |title= Naturopathy's main article of faith cannot be validated; Reliance on vital forces leaves its practises based on beliefs without scientific backing |date= March 7, 2009 |url= http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=1364389 |newspaper= Vancouver Sun |page= C5 |edition= final |accessdate= 2009-03-21 [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last2= Ernst |first2= Edzard |last1= Singh |first1= Simon  |authorlink1= Simon Singh|authorlink2 = Edzard Ernst|title= Trick or Treatment : The Undeniable Facts About Alternative Medicine |publisher= W.

Kimball C. Atwood IV writes, in the journal Medscape General Medicine, "Naturopathic physicians now claim to be primary care physicians proficient in the practice of both "conventional" and "natural" medicine. Their training, however, amounts to a small fraction of that of medical doctors who practice primary care. An examination of their literature, moreover, reveals that it is replete with pseudoscientific, ineffective, unethical, and potentially dangerous practices". In another article, Atwood writes that "Physicians who consider naturopaths to be their colleagues thus find themselves in opposition to one of the fundamental ethical precepts of modern medicine. If naturopaths are not to be judged "nonscientific practitioners", the term has no useful meaning".[tpl]cite journal |last= Atwood IV |first= Kimball.

===Unproven treatments and pseudoscientific practices===

According to Arnold S. Relman, the Textbook of Natural Medicine is inadequate as a teaching tool, as it omits to mention or treat in detail many common ailments, improperly emphasizes treatments "not likely to be effective" over those that are, and promotes unproven herbal remedies at the expense of pharmaceuticals. He concludes that "the risks to many sick patients seeking care from the average naturopathic practitioner would far outweigh any possible benefits".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/relman1.html |title= Textbook of Natural Medicine |accessdate= 2009-04-17 |last= Relman |first= Arnold S. |authorlink= Arnold S.

"Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", says William T. Jarvis.[tpl]cite journal |pmid= 1643742 |date=August 1992 |last1= Jarvis |first1= William T. |title= Quackery: A national scandal |volume= 38 |issue= 8B Pt 2 |pages= 1574–86 |journal= Clinical chemistry[/tpl]

===Safety of natural treatments===

Naturopaths often recommend exposure to naturally occurring substances, such as sunshine, herbs and certain foods, as well as activities they describe as natural, such as exercise, meditation and relaxation. Naturopaths claim that these natural treatments help restore the body's innate ability to heal itself without the adverse effects of conventional medicine. However, "natural" methods and chemicals are not necessarily safer or more effective than "artificial" or "synthetic" ones, and any treatment capable of eliciting an effect may also have deleterious side effects.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ncahf.org/pp/herbal.html |title= NCAHF Position Paper on Over the Counter Herbal Remedies (1995) |accessdate= 2009-04-17 |year= 1995 |publisher= National Council Against Health Fraud[/tpl]

===Anti-vaccine beliefs===

Many forms of alternative medicine, including naturopathy, homeopathy, and chiropractic are based on beliefs opposed to vaccination and have practitioners who voice their opposition. The reasons for this opposition are based, in part, on the early views which shaped the foundation of each profession. A survey of a cross section of students of a major complementary and alternative medicine college in Canada reported that students in the later years of the program opposed vaccination more strongly than newer students.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Vaccine |year= 2008 |volume= 26 |issue= 49 |pages= 6237–42 |title= Attitudes towards vaccination among chiropractic and naturopathic students |last1= Busse |first1= Jason W. |last2= Wilson |first2= Kumanan |last3= Campbell |first3= James B. |doi= 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.020 |pmid=18674581[/tpl]
A University of Washington study investigated insurance claim histories for alternative medicine use in relation to the receipt of vaccinations against preventable illnesses, grouped into children aged 1–2 years and 1–17 years. Both groups were significantly less likely to receive a number of their vaccinations if they visited a naturopath. The study found a significant association between visits to naturopaths with a reduced receipt of pediatric vaccinations and with increased infection by vaccine-preventable diseases.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Maternal and Child Health Journal |year=2009 |volume= 14 |issue= 6|pages= 922–30|title=Pediatric vaccination and vaccine-preventable disease acquisition: associations with care by complementary and alternative medicine providers |last1= Downey |first1= Lois |last2= Tyree |first2= Patrick T. |last3= Huebner |first3= Colleen E. |last4= Lafferty |first4= William E. |displayauthors= 4 |pmid= 19760163 |url=  |pmc= 2924961 |doi= 10.1007/s10995-009-0519-5[/tpl]

==Regulation==

Naturopathy is practiced in many countries, primarily the United States and Canada, and is subject to different standards of regulation and levels of acceptance. The scope of practice varies widely between jurisdictions, and naturopaths in some unregulated jurisdictions may use the Naturopathic Doctor designation or other titles regardless of level of education. The practice of naturopathy is illegal in two states.

===North America===

In five Canadian provinces, seventeen U.S. states, and the District of Columbia, naturopathic doctors who are trained at an accredited school of naturopathic medicine in North America, are entitled to use the designation ND or NMD. Elsewhere, the designations "naturopath", "naturopathic doctor", and "doctor of natural medicine" are generally unprotected or prohibited.
In North America, each jurisdiction that regulates naturopathy defines a local scope of practice for naturopathic doctors that can vary considerably. Some regions permit minor surgery, access to prescription drugs, spinal manipulations, obstetrics and gynecology and other regions exclude these from the naturopathic scope of practice or prohibit the practice of naturopathy entirely.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dora.state.co.us/OPR/archive/2008NaturopathicPhysiciansSunrise.pdf |deadurl= yes |archivedate= 2008-10-02 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081002001141/http://www.dora.state.co.us/opr/archive/2008NaturopathicPhysiciansSunrise.pdf |date= January 4, 2008 |title=2008 Sunrise Review: Naturopathic Physicians |pages=18–19 |author= Office of Policy, Research and Regulatory Reform, Department of Regulatory Agencies, State of Colorado |publisher= [/tpl]

====Canada====

Several Canadian provinces license naturopathic doctors: British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Saskatchewan.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cand.ca/index.php?40 |title= Questions: Education and Regulation |accessdate= 2013-09-06 |work= Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors website |publisher=  |author=  |date= [/tpl] British Columbia has regulated naturopathic medicine since 1936 and together with Ontario (since 2009) are the only two Canadian provinces that allow certified NDs to prescribe pharmaceuticals and perform minor surgeries.[tpl]cite news |title= B.C. gives naturopaths right to prescribe drugs |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2009/04/10/bc-naturopaths.html |date= April 10, 2009 |author=  |work= CBC News[/tpl]
The province of Quebec does not directly regulate naturopathy. The Quebec Ministry of Education has prohibited schools from offering doctoral programs in the subject, and there are no universities with a naturopath program. Therefore, studies must be done out of province. Furthermore, in Quebec, the Collège des médecins du Québec (CMQ) has exclusive rights to perform certain activities including but not limited to: ordering diagnostic examinations, prescribing medication and other substances and clinically monitoring the condition of patients whose state of health presents risks. This severely restrains the scope of practice for a naturopathic doctor.[ref]

In Quebec, group benefits insurance is mandatory if offered by the employer, and coverage for a naturopathic doctor is typically included in these policies. As a result of the limitations (scope of practice, title, education) in Quebec concerning naturopathic doctors, the term naturotherapy has been accepted by some insurance carriers.[tpl]cite web |title= Welcome |url= http://www.anpq.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=110%3Adefinition&catid=35&Itemid=82&lang=en |work=  Association des Naturothérapeutes du Québec website[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Naturopathie - Présentation |url= http://www.passeportsante.net/fr/Therapies/Guide/Fiche.aspx?doc=naturopathie_th |work= PasseportSanté.net website |publisher= |date= |language= French |accessdate= [/tpl][tpl]Verify source|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Australia===

Currently the  industry is self-regulated. There is no protection of title, meaning that technically anyone can practice as a naturopath.
In 1977 a committee reviewed all colleges of naturopathy in Australia and found that, although the syllabuses of many colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little relationship to the documented course. In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, at a level of dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlap to an enormous extent, no specific indications are or can be taught.

===India===

In India there is a 5½-year degree course offering a "Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences" (BNYS) degree. Also there are two post graduation programs Called MD(Naturopathy) and MD(Yoga-Clinical) which can be done after completing the BNYS program. The first college of naturopathy was started in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh by B. Venkatrao which offered a Diploma in Naturopathy (ND). There are a total of seventeen naturopathy colleges in India.[tpl]cite web |author= No author given |date= nd |url= http://www.punenin.org/attach/BNYS.pdf |publisher= Hosted on the National Institute of Naturopathy website (Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India) |accessdate= 2013-09-08 |title= BNYS (list of colleges with university affiliation / government recognition)[/tpl][tpl]Self-published source|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]Self-published inline|date=December 2012[/tpl]
