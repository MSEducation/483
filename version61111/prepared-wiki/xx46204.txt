Bumper cars is the generic name for a type of flat ride consisting of several small electric cars which draw power from the floor and/or ceiling, and which are turned on and off remotely by an operator.[tpl]cite web|last=Gussow|first=Seth|title=Going Bump In The Night|publisher=Automobile Magazine|date=November 1997|url=http://www.lusseautoscooters.com/html/legend_history.html|accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] They are also known as bumping cars, dashing cars, dodgem cars, or simply dodgems, the last name being the usual term in British English.
The inventor was Victor Levand, who worked for G.E.

Power is commonly supplied by one of two methods:
The metal floor is usually set up as a rectangular or oval track, and graphite is sprinkled on the floor to decrease friction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] A rubber bumper surrounds each vehicle, and drivers ram each other as they travel. The controls are usually an accelerator and a steering wheel. The cars can be made to go backwards by turning the steering wheel far enough in either direction, necessary in the frequent pile-ups that occur.
Although the idea of the ride is to bump other cars, safety-conscious (or at least litigation-conscious) owners sometimes put up signs reading "This way around" and "No (head on) bumping."[tpl]cite web|last =Dolan|first=Maura|title=Ruling over bumper-car injury supports amusement park|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 1, 2013|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/01/local/la-me-amusement-park-injuries-20130101|accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=A Guide To The Rides|publisher=Santa's Village Jefferson, New Hampshire|date=2013|url=http://www.santasvillage.com/public/explore/rides/bumper_cars.cfm|accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] Depending on the level of enforcement by operators, these rules are often ignored by bumper car riders, especially younger children.
During their heyday (in the late 1920s through 1950s), the two major bumper cars brands were Dodgem and the Lusse Brothers' Auto-Skooter.  In the mid 1960s, Disneyland introduced hovercraft-based bumper cars called Flying Saucers, which worked on the same principle as an air hockey game; however the ride was a mechanical failure and closed after a few years.
The current largest bumper cars floor is located at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois, and is called the Rue Le Dodge (Rue Le Morgue during October for Fright Fest). The ride is [tpl]convert|51|ft|m[/tpl], 9Â inches by [tpl]convert|124|ft|9|in|m[/tpl] or a total of [tpl]convert|6455|sqft|m2[/tpl]. A replica of the ride was built at California's Great America in Santa Clara, CA; in 2005, however,  a concrete island was added to the middle of the floor to promote one-way traffic, reducing the floor area and restoring Rue Le Dodge at Six Flags Great America's largest floor title.
