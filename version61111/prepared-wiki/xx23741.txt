In 2463 of the Third Age, Déagol became the third bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron and Isildur. He found the Ring—which had been lost for thousands of years—while fishing with Sméagol in the Gladden river.
Instantly ensnared by its beauty and seductive power, Sméagol demanded the Ring as his "birthday-present". When Déagol refused to give it up, Sméagol strangled him and hid his body, which was never found; nevertheless, the murderer (nicknamed Gollum after the swallowing noises he made) was eventually driven from his home and into the Misty Mountains.

In Peter Jackson's 2001–2003 live-action adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, Déagol is played by New Zealand actor Thomas Robins.
