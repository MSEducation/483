[[Aspect ratio (aerodynamics)]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering ratios, Aircraft wing design

In aerodynamics, the aspect ratio of a wing is essentially the ratio of its length to its breadth (chord).  A high aspect ratio indicates long, narrow wings, whereas a low aspect ratio indicates short, stubby wings.Kermode, A.C. (1972), Mechanics of Flight, Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London ISBN 0-273-31623-0
For most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio AR is defined as the square of the wingspan b divided by the area S of the wing planform,Anderson, John D. Jr, Introduction to Flight, Equation 5.26Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, sub-section 5.13(f) which is equal to the length-to-breadth ratio for a constant chord wing.  In symbols,

==Aspect ratio of aircraft wings==

Aspect ratio and planform can be used to predict the aerodynamic performance of a wing.
For a given wing area, the aspect ratio, which is proportional to the square of the wingspan, is of particular significance in determining the performance.  Roughly, an airplane in flight can be imagined to affect a circular cylinder of air with a diameter equal to the wingspan.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, section 5.15  A large wingspan is working on a large cylinder of air, and a small wingspan is working on a small cylinder of air.  For two aircraft of the same weight but different wingspans the small cylinder of air must be pushed downward by a greater amount than the large cylinder in order to produce an equal upward force.  The aft-leaning component of this change in velocity is proportional to the induced drag''.  Therefore the larger downward velocity produces a larger aft-leaning component and this leads to larger induced drag on the aircraft with the smaller wingspan and lower aspect ratio.
The interaction between undisturbed air outside the circular cylinder of air, and the downward-moving cylinder of air occurs at the wingtips and can be seen as wingtip vortices.

There are several reasons why not all aircraft have high aspect wings:

==Variable aspect ratio==

Extending the trailing-edge wing flaps causes a decrease in aspect ratio because extending the flaps increases the wing chord but with no change in wingspan.  This decrease in aspect ratio causes an increase in induced drag which is detrimental to the airplaneâ€™s performance during takeoff but may be beneficial during landing.
Aircraft which approach or exceed the speed of sound sometimes incorporate variable-sweep wings.  This is due to the difference in fluid behavior in the subsonic and transonic/supersonic regimes.  In subsonic flow, induced drag is a significant component of total drag, particularly at high angle of attack.  However, as the flow becomes transonic and then supersonic, the shock wave first generated along the wing's upper surface causes wave drag on the aircraft, and this drag is proportional to the length of the wing - the longer the wing, the longer the shock wave.  Thus a long wing, valuable at low speeds, becomes a detriment at transonic speeds.  If the aircraft design can fulfil its mission profiles with the extra weight and complexity of a moveable wing, the swing-wing provides a solution to this problem.

==Wetted aspect ratio==

The wetted aspect ratio is a good indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft. It is a better measure than the aspect ratio. It is defined as:
A good example of this is the Boeing B-47 and Avro Vulcan. Both aircraft have very similar performance although they are radically different. The B-47 has a high aspect ratio wing, while the Avro Vulcan is a low aspect ratio blended wing body. They have, however, a very similar wetted aspect ratio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Aeronautics/Burnelli.htm |title=The Lifting Fuselage Body |publisher=Meridian-int-res.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-10[/tpl]

==Aspect ratio of bird wings==

High aspect ratio wings abound in nature.  Most birds that fly long distances have wings of high aspect ratio, and with tapered or elliptical wingtips. This is particularly noticeable on soaring birds such as albatrosses and eagles.  By contrast, hawks of the genus Accipiter such as the Eurasian Sparrowhawk have wings of low aspect ratio (and long tails) for maneuverability.
