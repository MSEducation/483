</ref>" On April 10, 1971, nine American players, four officials, and two spouses stepped across a bridge from [[Hong Kong]] to the Chinese mainland and then spent their time during April 11–17 playing fun matches, touring the [[Great Wall]] and [[Summer Palace]], and watching a [[ballet]].

===Legacy===

During the week of June 9, 2008, a three-day ping-pong diplomacy event was held at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. Original members of both the Chinese and American ping-pong teams from 1971 were present and competed again.
In 1988, table tennis became an Olympic sport.

==Reactions==

Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the U.S. He said:
 
 "The people are just like us. They are real, they're genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It's beautiful. They got the Great Wall, they got plains over there. They got an ancient palace, the parks, there's streams, and they got ghosts that haunt; there's all kinds of, you know, animals. The country changes from the south to the north. The people, they have a, a unity. They really believe in their Maoism."[ref]

==Nixon's visit==

Two months after Richard Nixon's visit, Zhuang Zedong visited the U.S. as the head of a Chinese table-tennis delegation, April 12–30, 1972. Also on the itinerary were Canada, Mexico and Peru. However, China's attempts to reach out to countries through "ping-pong diplomacy" were not always successful, such as when the All Indonesia Table Tennis Association (PTMSI) refused China's invitation in October 1971, claiming that accepting the PRC's offer would improve the PRC's reputation. Because neither Soviet athletes nor journalists appeared in China following the appearance of the American players and journalists, one speculation is that the act showed the equal scorn of both countries towards the USSR.
