==History==

===Ancestor institutions: 1869–1930===

The history of Dillard University dates back to 1869 and its founding predecessor institutions--Straight University (later to be renamed Straight College) and Union Normal School (which was to become New Orleans University).

====Straight University====

Responding to the post-Civil War need to educate newly freed African Americans in New Orleans, Louisiana and the surrounding region, the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church founded Straight University on June 12, 1868. 
Straight University also offered professional training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886, and its graduates participated in local and national Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era civil rights struggles.   
Straight University was renamed Straight College in 1915.

====Union Normal School/New Orleans University====

The Union Normal School was established by the Freedman's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church on July 8, also in 1868.  
In addition to Straight University, the AMA helped found several other Historically Black Colleges and Universities, such as Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University (with Freedmen's Bureau), Huston-Tillotson University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Talladega College, and Tougaloo College.  Straight University and Union Normal School later became Straight College and New Orleans University, respectively.  Both schools offered elementary level education, but quickly enlarged curriculum to include secondary, collegiate, and professional level instruction.
New Orleans University operated a secondary school--Gilbert Academy.  By the 1890s, the university offered professional medical training.  It included a school of pharmacy, the Flint Medical College, and the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School.  After the medical college was ended in 1911, the Flint Goodridge Hospital emerged and continued nurse training.

==="A Great Negro University in New Orleans": 1930–1935===

Local Black and White leaders felt there was a need for a larger, more notable African American institution of higher learning to emerge within New Orleans and the greater South. Due to economic hardships and rounds of negotiations between the two institutions, Straight College and New Orleans University chartered Dillard University on June 6, 1930.Louise and Radiclani Clytus. Within These Walls: A Short History of Dillard University. New Orleans: Dillard University, 1999. 10. Named after James H. Dillard,http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/dillard-university-1869 the new university was created to "... offer a traditional liberal arts curriculum—rather than nonprofessional, vocational training" and emphasize a close engagement with the Black community through "various education extension programs, societies, and clubs."Louise and Radiclani Clytus. Within These Walls: A Short History of Dillard University. New Orleans: Dillard University, 1999. 11.
Despite the hope of this new charter, the building of Dillard University was tempered by its context of Jim Crow America. Many local Whites took concern with the possibility of a Black president presiding over White faculty members. Similarly, the increased numbers of African American bus riders in the Gentilly area disturbed some White sensibilities. As an influential and diplomatic member of Dillard's board of trustees, Edgar B. Stern suggested Will W. Alexander as a suitable compromise.  Will W. Alexander, a white Southern preacher, was Dillard's first acting president (1935–1936), whose experience as the director of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation proved valuable.  Dillard University opened its doors in the fall of 1935, and was able to attract a number of prominent scholars, such as Horace Mann Bond, psychology and education; Frederick Douglass Hall, music; Lawrence D. Reddick, history; and St. Clair Drake, sociology and anthropology.

===Hurricane Katrina===

In August 2005, the campus, not far from the lower levee breach of the London Avenue Canal, suffered extensive flood damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Nelson Hall was destroyed by a fire. A bus fire also destroyed belongings of 37 students who were in the process of being evacuated.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.centenary.edu/news/2005/August/0018.html|title=Community Responds with Donations for Hurricane Evacuees from Dillard University at Centenary College|accessdate=30 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=D9&Date=20050828&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=828001&Ref=PH&Params=Itemnr=2|title=Hurricane Katrina Shelters Open|work=Shreveport Times|accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl]
