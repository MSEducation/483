[[Halin graph]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families, Planar graphs

In graph theory, a Halin graph is a type of planar graph. It is constructed from a tree that has at least four vertices, none of which have exactly two neighbors. The tree is drawn in the plane so none of its edges cross; then edges are added that connect all its leaves into a cycle.Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, first Supplementary volume, 1988, ISBN 0-7923-4709-9, p. 281, article "Halin Graph", and references therein. Halin graphs are named after German mathematician Rudolf Halin, who studied them in 1971,[ref]
