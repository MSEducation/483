The song got substantial radio support from P3, who added it to their 'Inevitable' list on the day of release.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/p3/musik/p3suu/2012/10/08/p3-prisvinderen-fallulah-er-p3s-uundgaelige/ |title=P3-prisvinderen Fallulah er P3's Uundgåelige |language=Danish |publisher=P3 |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] The title refers to the music industry, which she has a love / hate relationship with. Fallulah explained that the song is her "attempt to navigate in the world, which can be great but also rotten and shallow."
"Dried-Out Cities" was released as the album's second single on 11 January 2013. It's music video was delayed numerous times before being uploaded online on 16 April 2013. Fallulah describes the song as about the division between the aspiration for your life and eventuality of settling down and having children and taking out a large loan from the bank so you can buy an apartment or a house."[tpl]cite web |last=Broberg|first=Signe |url=http://www.dr.dk/p3/programmer/smag-paa-p3/2013/01/11/forst-i-smag-pa-p3-lyt-til-fallulahs-nye-single |language=Danish |title=Først i Smag på P3: Lyt til Fallulahs nye single |work=P3 |publisher=DR |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

==Reception==

===Critical response===

Escapism received generally positive reviews from music critics.

===Commercial performance===

The album debuted at number two on the Danish Album Charts, selling 626 copies in its first week.[tpl]cite web |last=Treo|first=Thomas |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/musik/dkmusiknyt/article1920616.ece |language=Danish |title=Kæmpeflop af Basim |work=Ekstra Bladet |publisher=JP/Politikens Hus |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] This was described as "a surprisingly weak start" by Ekstra Bladet, who said that the music industry crisis was to blame for its poor sales. First week sales figures for Escapism were more than 9,000 copies behind the second week of the 2013 compilation of MGP Junior, Denmark's wildly popular junior singing competition. The week also saw poor performances from all other new releases. The album fell to number nine the following week, and stayed in the top forty for five weeks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://danishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Fallulah&titel=Escapism&cat=a |title=Fallulah - Escapism |work=danishcharts.com |publisher=Hung Medien |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
