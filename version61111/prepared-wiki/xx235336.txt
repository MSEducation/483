==History==

St Stephen's General Apostolic Church in Zion was founded under the name The General Faith Assembly Zion Church in 1936 by Stephen W.S Moloi, a former member of the Faith Assembly Church. St. Stephen members trace the founding of the church to a revelation which S.W.S Moloi is said to have received from GOD in 1934. The church was initially based in Ntate Moloiâ€™s home in Harrismith, Free State Province. 
It grew and established branches in Swaziland and Lesotho. When Bishop S.W.S Moloi died in the 1960s the church started having problems and two of its Pastors decided to break away from the chand move the headquarters from Harrismith to Bethlehem, Free State. Reverend Radebe from Bethlehem and Mthembu from Cornelia took with them most of the congregation and they worked very hard to build a strong congregation. They recruited more members and the church gained strength with Rev Radebe as Bishop and Rev Mthembu as the National President of the church. The church continued to grow stronger and larger and in 2007 some members of the GFA church also brokeaway from the church and form what is now known as St Stephen's General Apostolic Church in Zion the name is in honour of the founder Bishop Stephen Moloi. St Stephen's General Apostolic Church in Zion is also registered in the South African Council of Churches as being founded in 1936. The administrative headquarters are now in Orange Farm, Gauteng but Harrismith is still known as the place where the church was founded.
The belief exists that the religious leader of the church (or bishop), can provide faith-healing in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
