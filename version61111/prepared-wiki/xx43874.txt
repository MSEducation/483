Overall, Bayern has reached ten European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals, most recently winning their fifth title in 2013 as part of a continental treble. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally. Since the formation of the Bundesliga, Bayern has been the dominant club in German football with 23 titles and has won 6 of the last 10 titles. They have traditional local rivalries with TSV 1860 München and 1. FC Nürnberg, as well as a contemporary rivalry with Borussia Dortmund.
Since the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the team crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

==History==

===Early years (1900–65)===

FC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), eleven members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals and reached the semifinals of the 1900–01 South German championship. In the following years the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded "Kreisliga", the first regional Bavarian league. They won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of World War I in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 30–40 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
In the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions, before winning their first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 51–63 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
Their first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard "Little Dombi" Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.
The advent of Nazism put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. The president and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the "Jew's club" and as a semi-professional club Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again. In the following years Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 101–2 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
After the war, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. In 1955 they were relegated, but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.[tpl]cite web | title = A Period of Reconstruction | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | accessdate =11 August 2008 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/club/history/00267.php[/tpl] The club struggled financially though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer Roland Endler provided the necessary funds and was rewarded with four years at the helm of the club.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 120–126 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl] In 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. Bayern finished third in that year's southern division, but another Munich team, TSV 1860 München, had won the championship. As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city, Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga. They gained promotion two years later, fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, and Sepp Maier — who would later be collectively referred to as the axis.

===Golden years (1965–79)===

In their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year's European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in a dramatic final against Scottish club Rangers, when Franz Roth scored the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory. In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln, and SV Werder Bremen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 155–158 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
Udo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 165–171 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl] Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay.[tpl]cite web | title = The Golden Years | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | accessdate =11 August 2008 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/club/history/00266.php[/tpl] This title – after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage. During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. "We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end we were the winners but we were very, very lucky", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was "very suspicious." Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European Football for three years.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_euro_showdown/347144.stm | title = Unlucky Paris match for Leeds | date = 19 May 1999 |work=BBC Sport | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =29 March 2012[/tpl] A year later in Glasgow, AS Saint-Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 190–198 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl] The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 214–226 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl] Bayerndusel was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.

===From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1979–98)===

The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed FC Breitnigge, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. However, European success was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 226–267 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
Jupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90 Bayern's form dipped. After a second place in 1990–91 the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In the season of 1993–94, Bayern  lost out in the UEFA Cup second round to the Premier League team Norwich City, who remain the only English football club to beat them at the Olympiastadion. Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 273–299 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl]
His successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.[tpl]cite web | title = Forward into the next Millenium | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | accessdate =11 August 2008 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/club/history/00120.php[/tpl] During this time Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/174/uefa-champions-league/2010/04/08/1869197/cl-comment-van-gaals-bayern-give-new-meaning-to-fc-hollywood |title=CL Comment: Van Gaal’s Bayern Give New Meaning to "FC Hollywood" |publisher=Goal.com |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2013[/tpl] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

===Renewed international success (1998–present)===

After his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United in injury time after leading for most of the match. The following year, in the club's centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2001/05/19/german_roundup/|title=Bayern wins Bundesliga, eyes Champions League|date=19 May 2001|accessdate=28 November 2013|work=Sports Illustrated[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sport1.de/de/fussball/fussball_bundesliga/artikel_104971.html|title=Vier Minuten im Mai|language=German|date=12 May 2009}accessdate=28 November 2013|work=Sport1[/tpl] Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia CF on penalties. The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup, but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 351–433 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X[/tpl] Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.
Felix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shares with TSV 1860 München. On the field their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.[tpl]cite web | title = Bayern part company with Felix Magath | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | accessdate =15 July 2008 | date = 31 January 2007 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2007/10644.php[/tpl]
Hitzfeld returned as trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season fourth, thus failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.
For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. They signed a total of eight new players and sold, released or loaned out nine of their players.Bayern Magazin: 1/59, pages: 16–21, 11 August 2007 (in German) Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern went on to win the Bundesliga, being on top of the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.[tpl]cite web | title = Fussballdaten – Zahlen, Texte, Bilder | publisher = fussballdaten.de | accessdate =15 July 2008 | date = 17 May 2008 | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de | language = German[/tpl]
On 11 January 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann was named as Hitzfeld's successor, taking charge on 1 July 2008. He signed a two-year contract.[tpl]cite web|title = Jürgen Klinsmann to succeed Hitzfeld at Bayern | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2008/14731.php | accessdate =11 January 2008 | date = 11 January 2008 | publisher = The official FC Bayern Munich website[/tpl] Bayern Munich lost the DFL-Supercup 1–2 against Borussia Dortmund in 2008. Bayer Leverkusen eliminated Bayern in quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal. In the Champions League Bayern also reached the quarter-finals after winning Group F and defeating Sporting Clube de Portugal in the first knockout round, achieving a Champions League record aggregate of 12–1. On 27 April, two days after a home defeat against Schalke which saw Bayern drop to the third place in the table, Klinsmann was fired. Former trainer Jupp Heynckes was named as caretaker until the end of the season.[tpl]cite web|title = Bayern part company with Jürgen Klinsmann | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2009/19312.php | accessdate =27 April 2009 | date = 27 April 2009 | publisher = The official FC Bayern Munich website[/tpl] Bayern eventually finished second, thus qualifying directly for the Champions League in 2009–10.
Bayern then signed Dutch manager Louis van Gaal for the 2009–10 season. Multi-million signings of Arjen Robben and Mario Gómez also followed in a bid to return Bayern to the top of the European scene. On 8 May 2010, Bayern Munich won the 2009–10 Bundesliga after a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=783485&sec=europe&cc=5739&cc=5739|title= Bayern celebrate title with win|date= 8 May 2010 |work=ESPN|accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl] Bayern then won the DFB-Pokal on 15 May 2010 to secure the domestic double.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8684950.stm|title= Bayern win Cup to clinch Double|date= 15 May 2010|work=BBC|accessdate=15 May 2010[/tpl] Bayern also reached the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final but were beaten 2–0 by Internazionale, failing to become the first German club to complete the treble.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/404786/Live/Europe-UEFA-Champions-League-2009-2010-Bayern-Munich-Inter|title=Champions League Final 2010 Statistics|publisher=WhoScored.com[/tpl]

==Colours==

In the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also the younger players were called red-shorts, which was meant as an insult. Bayern has played in red and white for most of its existence, but blue has been included on occasion. In the 1968–69 season the shirts were striped in blue and red, and the shorts and socks were also blue. Bayern also wore red and blue stripes between 1995 and 1997, and in 1997 blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999 Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.
The club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. In 2009, the home kit was red, the away kit was dark blue, and the international kit was white.[tpl]cite web | title = Kits / Adidas Collection | publisher = FC Bayern Fan-Shop | accessdate =13 August 2008 | date = August 2008 | url = http://shop.fcbayern.de/en/6/0/-fcb-_--/[/tpl] For the 2010–11 season, Bayern had a red and white striped home jersey, white away shirts with dark blue away shorts, and all-dark blue for international (Champions League) matches. For the 2012–13 season, Bayern had red and gold home jerseys, with white and orange away jerseys.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.1.

==Crest==

Bayern's crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954.
The modern version of the crest has evolved from the 1954 version in several steps. While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current (2008) crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.

==Stadiums==

Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße. As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.
From 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.[tpl]cite web | title = Das Grünwalder Stadion | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | accessdate =11 August 2008 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/de/verein/ag/stadion/gruenwalder/ | language = German[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Sportliche Höhepunkte in der Geschichte des Sechz'gers | publisher = Freunde des Sechz'ger Stadions e.V. | accessdate =14 July 2008 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.gruenwalder-stadion.de/?id=43 | language = German[/tpl]
For the 1972 Summer Olympics the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture, was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. The stadium was, in its early days, considered to be one of the foremost stadia in the world and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of 1974 FIFA World Cup.[tpl]cite web | title = The Olympic Stadium – Event Highlights | accessdate =12 July 2008 | date = 31 December 2007 | publisher = Olympiapark München GmbH | url = http://www.olympiapark-muenchen.de/index.php?id=hoehepunkte_olystad[/tpl] In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50% to ca. 66% [tpl]clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl]. Eventually the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches, and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, the stadium betraying its track and field heritage. Modification of the stadium proved impossible as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.
After much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, FC Bayern, and TSV 1860 jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season. Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.[tpl]cite web | title = General information about the Allianz Arena | accessdate =12 July 2008 | year = 2007 | publisher = Allianz Arena München Stadion GmbH | url = http://www.allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/allgemeine-informationen/[/tpl] Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/news/2012/36639.php?fcb_sid=9d0aae24da5dbb195a669b10d3d42561 |title=Allianz Arena capacity increased to 71,000 | publisher = fcbayern.com |accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl]
The most prominent feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects. Usually, red lighting is used for Bayern home games, blue for 1860 home games and white for German national team home games.
In May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/news/2012/35233.php|title=FCB Erlebniswelt opens to the public[/tpl]

==Rivalries==

Bayern Munich has a rivalry with Borussia Dortmund.[tpl]cite web |url=http://de.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicderby/news/newsid=110383.html|title=Der Klassiker: Borussia Dortmund – FC Bayern München[/tpl] Bayern and Dortmund have competed against each other for many Bundesliga titles. Bayern and Dortmund have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, and will meet again in 2014. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 DFB-Pokal final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2008, 2012, and 2013. The height of the rivalry was when Bayern defeated Dortmund, 2–1 in the final of the 2013 UEFA Champions League.
Bayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is TSV 1860 München, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, TSV 1860 moved between the first and the third division, but lately have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs.Bayern Magazin: Sonderheft DFB-Pokal, 27 February 2008 (in German) 1860 is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Bayern is considered the establishment club,[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.
Since the 1920s, 1. FC Nürnberg has been Bayern's main and traditional[tpl]cite web|title=Bavarian derby's long and turbulent history|url=http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/news/2011/28979.php|publisher=FC Bayern Munich|accessdate=7 April 2011[/tpl] rival in Bavaria. Philipp Lahm said that playing Nürnberg is "always special" and is a "heated atmosphere". Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five championships in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in 1987, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg. The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby.
Bayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern led 4–1 to lose 7–4,Bundesliga 1973/1974 » 12. Spieltag Kaiserslautern versus bayern Weltfussball.de. Retrieved 15 May 2009The "Roten Teufel" (red devils) – tradition and wonder sportfive.com. Retrieved 15 May 2009 but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding Palatinate having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite after the end of the Second World War.
Since the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s this was Borussia Mönchengladbach, in the 1980s the category expanded to include Hamburger SV.

Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League with 14 matches and the European Cup with 19 matches.

Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup. The last time the two teams met were in the 2–1 win of Real Madrid in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals (3–3 on aggregate) forcing extra time and penalties. Bayern Munich won 3–1 on penalties to reach their first ever home Champions League final. The two teams were also drawn together in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, a rematch of the 2012 semi.

Bayern is an exception in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way.[tpl]cite web | title = FC Bayern AG – Bayerischer Superclub (1/3) | publisher = offensivgeist.de | date = 7 December 2012 | accessdate = 27 February 2013 | url = http://www.offensivgeist.de/fc-bayern-muenchen-ag-bayerischer-superclub/ | language = German[/tpl] This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.
In 2011–12, Bayern reported revenues of €373.4 million, marking the eighth consecutive time that Bayern has topped their previous record earnings.[tpl]cite web | title = A club in great shape | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 30 January 2013 | publisher = FC Bayern Munich | url = http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/news/2012/38202.php[/tpl] According to the 2013 edition of Deloitte's annual Football Money League, Bayern was the fourth richest club in the world in 2012, generating revenues of €368.4 million.[tpl]cite web |title = Deloitte Football Money League 2013 – Captains of Industry | url = http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/sports/football/deloitte-football-money-league/index.htm | publisher = Deloitte |year=2013 | accessdate = 30 January 2013[/tpl]
While other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern has focused on Germany.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-20/bayern-munich-second-in-brand-value-after-champions-league-final.html | title = Bayern Munich Second in Brand Value After Champions League Final |publisher=Bloomberg | date = 21 May 2012 | accessdate =21 May 2012 | first = Bob | last = Bensch[/tpl] Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fifth most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's at value $1.235 billion.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.forbes.com/soccer-valuations/list/| title= The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams|author= Dan Bigman|date= 19 April 2012|publisher= Forbes |accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl] As a result of Bayern's finals appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League, the club's brand value has reached $786 million USD which is up 59 percent from the previous year. Among European teams this is ahead of Real Madrid's $600 million USD and behind first place Manchester United whose brand is valued at $853 million USD. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/news/2013/42822.php

==Charity==

Bayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami the "FC Bayern – Hilfe e.V." was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club.[tpl]cite web | title = FC Bayern Hilfe e.V. | publisher = FC Bayern Munich official website | accessdate =20 July 2009 | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/de/verein/ev/hilfe/index.php | language = German[/tpl] At its inception this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club.[tpl]cite web | title = FC Bayern Hilfe e.V. | publisher = FC Bayern Fanclub Hofherrnweiler e.V. | accessdate =20 July 2009 | url = http://www.fcb-fanclub-hofherrnweiler.de/bayernhilfe.html | language = German[/tpl] The money was amongst other things used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. In April 2007 it was decided that the focus of the foundation would shift towards supporting people in need locally.
The club has also time and again shown to have a soft spot for clubs in financial disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners.[tpl]cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fcbayern.telekom.de/en/news/matchreport/2013/43679.php | title = FCB hit four in fund-raiser for stricken Hansa | publisher = FC Bayern Munuch | date = 14 July 2013 | accessdate = 22 July 2013[/tpl]

==Training facility==

FC Bayern Munich training facilities, for both the professional and the Junior Team, are located at the Bayern Munich Headquarters.[tpl]cite web|title = Performance centre | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/company/saebenerstr/16510.php | accessdate =12 August 2008 | year = 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Youth academy | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/company/saebenerstr/16513.php | accessdate =12 August 2008 | year = 2008[/tpl] There are four grass pitches, one of which has undersoil heating, one artificial grass field and a multi-functional sports hall.[tpl]cite web|title = Training ground | publisher = FC Bayern Munich Official Website | url = http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/company/saebenerstr/16512.php | accessdate =14 August 2008 | year = 2008[/tpl] After the closure of Munich American High School, FC Bayern purchased the DoDDS adjacent sporting fields that previously held MAHS's football pitch and baseball field. A new grass pitch was placed over the existing football pitch while an artificial turf field was placed over the baseball diamond.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The players' quarters opened in 1990 and were reconstructed after the 2007–08 season on suggestions by the new coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, who took inspiration from various major sports clubs. The quarters are now called the performance centre and feature a weights and fitness area, a massage unit, dressing rooms, the coaches' office, and a conference room with screening facilities for video analysis. A café, a library, an e-Learning room, and a family room are also included.
Located at the headquarters is also the Youth academy, which houses up to 13 young talents from outside the city. While being part of Bayern's Junior Team they can work there on their development as footballers. Former residents of the Youth House include Owen Hargreaves, Michael Rensing, and Bastian Schweinsteiger.
