===Swimming===

17 swimmers, including four women, competed for Germany at the 1912 Games. It was the fourth time the nation had competed in swimming, having missed only the 1896 swimming events. 
The German men took six medals, four in breaststroke events and two in backstroke. The breaststroke trio swept the 200 meter breaststroke medals, and Bathe added a second gold medal in the 400 meter event. The four women took silver in the inaugural women's relay event. None of the women won an individual medal, with Rosenberg finishing 0.2 seconds behind the bronze medalist in the final to take fourth place. 
Ranks given for each swimmer are within the heat.

==30px Athletics==

24 athletes represented Germany. It was the fifth appearance of the nation in athletics, which Germany had appeared each time the Olympics had been held. The nation finished with two medals, both silver. Hanns Braun finished with the silver in the 400 metres and Hans Liesche won the silver medal in the high jump; these silvers were Germany's best results in the 1912 athletics competition and tied Germany's best results in athletics in Olympic history to that point.
The 4x100 metre relay team tied for the best time in the preliminary heats, matching the Olympic record set earlier in that round by the Swedish team. It then had the fastest time in the semifinals, taking sole possession of the Olympic record. This new record stood even after the finals as none of the finalist teams ran a better time; Germany committed a fault passing the baton and was disqualified in the final.
Ranks given are within that athlete's heat for running events.

==30px Cycling==

Eleven cyclists represented Germany. It was the fourth appearance of the nation in cycling, which had only not competed in cycling in 1904. Franz Lemnitz had the best time in the time trial, the only race held, placing 26th. The top four German cyclists had a combined time that placed them 6th of the 15 teams.

===Road cycling===

==30px Diving==

Four divers, all men, represented Germany. It was Germany's third appearance in diving, with two of the top divers who had represented the nation in 1908 returning. The German men dominated the 3 metre springboard event with its second straight medal sweep in the event, taking the top four places in 1912. The team was less successful in the other two events, with only one of the four men advancing to the final in each. Zürner, the defending champion who finished fourth in the springboard, got a silver medal in the 10 metre platform event; this gave each of the four Germans a medal.
