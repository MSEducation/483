Helena High School is an under-construction public high school in Helena, Alabama. It will open in August 2014, at the beginning of the 2014–15 school year. The original plan for it was proposed in September 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=State plans for Helena high school|author=Hurst, Katie|url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2010/09/24/state-plans-for-helena-high-school|publisher=Shelby County Reporter|accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]

==Development==

Children in grades 9 through 12 that live in Helena have attended nearby Pelham High School since its opening in 1974, but due to major overcrowding, the Shelby County School System and City of Helena were encouraged to invest in opening a new school in Helena. As a result, in September 2010, Helena announced that a high school would be opening within city limits in the next coming years. It will be located on Hillsboro Parkway opposite Helena Middle School in southwestern Helena, near the Hillsboro Trail. The school's colors will be silver, black and bright blue, and its nickname will be the Huskies, as voted on by students and residents of Helena on November 27, 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Helena High will be the Huskies|author=Wagner, Neal|url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2012/11/30/helena-high-will-be-the-huskies|publisher=Shelby County Reporter|accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] In addition, the colors and mascots of the other public schools in Helena (Helena Elementary, Helena Intermediate, and Helena Middle) have been changed to concur with those of the new high school.
Helena High School is being built on the former site of a coal mine that operated in Helena in the early 20th century, and many artifacts found by workers building the school will be preserved in a museum in Helena.[tpl]cite news|title=Helena's new school sits on 1917 mine|author=Snyder, Sarah|url=http://www.abc3340.com/story/16195312/helenas-new-school-sits-on-1917-mine|publisher=ABC 33/40 Birmingham|accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]
On May 16, 2013, former Chelsea High School principal Jay Peoples was named the first principal of the school.[tpl]cite news|title=Helena High School's new principal has been leading Chelsea High School|author=Reed, Martin J.|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/05/helena_high_schools_new_princi.html|publisher=AL.com|accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl] Additionally, on December 19, Arab High School coach Watt Parker was named head football coach and athletic director, Pelham High School band director Jeff Burnside was named head director of bands, and experienced educator/counselor Kim Bailey was named lead counselor.[tpl]cite news|title=PHS band director moving to Helena High|author=Wagner, Neal|url=http://www.pelhamreporter.com/2013/12/20/phs-band-director-moving-to-helena-high|publisher=The Pelham Reporter|accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl] The school is actively hiring the rest of its staff and administration, of which a large portion is expected to come from Pelham High.
Students in the Classes of 2015 and 2016 (who will be seniors and juniors, respectively, when the new school opens) who now attend Pelham High School, but who live in Helena, were given the choice to remain at Pelham High or to transfer to Helena High. Those students were required to submit their decision by December 20, 2013, and those who did not submit a decision were automatically placed in HHS.[tpl]cite news|title=Time to decide if you're going to HHS|author=Gentry, Katie|url=http://pelhampacesetter.com/uncategorized/2013/12/12/time-to-decide-if-youre-going-to-hhs/|publisher=Pelham Pacesetter|accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl] All sophomores and freshmen for the 2014–15 school year that live in Helena will attend HHS.
On January 12, 2014, builders discovered vandalism, including spray-painted walls and released fire extinguishers, scattered throughout the school. Five suspects, all of whom live in Helena and are expected to attend the school, were captured and charged with third degree criminal mischief and third degree burglary by January 16. The damage was estimated to cost around $1,000.[tpl]cite news|title=5 teens charged in Helena High School vandalism case|author=Posey, Melanie and Sides, Melynda|url=http://www.myfoxal.com/story/24474343/5-teens-charged-for-vandalism-at-helena-high-school|publisher=FOX6 WBRC Birmingham|accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]
