A quad, or quadruple, is a figure skating jump with four or more, but fewer than five, revolutions.International Olympic Committee - Sports Most quadruple jumps have exactly four revolutions; the quadruple Axel has 4Â½ revolutions, although no figure skater to date has completed this jump, either in practice or in competition.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] The quadruple toe loop and quadruple Salchow are the two most commonly skated. The first quad Lutz was ratified in 2011.
The first person to land a ratified quadruple jump in competition was Kurt Browning in 1988. Quadruple jumps have become increasingly common among World and Olympic level men's single skaters, to the point that not having one in a program may be considered a handicap.

==Execution==

A jump harness is often employed in training quads. Max Aaron stated that the smallest error may make the difference in the success of a quad attempt: "The minute your left arm is behind you, or your three-turn is too fast, if your hips don't turn in time, if your foot isn't in the right place, anything will throw you off." Ross Miner stated that the quality of the ice sometimes plays a role but more on the quad salchow than the toe loop. Practicing quads increases the risk of injury and wear and tear on a skater's body.
