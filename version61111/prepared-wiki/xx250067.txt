Ulrich K. Laemmli is a Professor in the biochemistry and molecular biology departments at University of Geneva. He is known for the refinement of SDS-PAGE, a widely used method for separating proteins based on their electrophoretic mobility. His paper describing the method is among the most cited scholarly journal articles of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/meid:125|title=Bio Infobank Library-Kinetics|publisher=BioInfoBank Institute|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/eval_of_science_oslo.html|title=THE USE OF JOURNAL IMPACT FACTORS AND CITATION ANALYSIS FOR EVALUATION OF SCIENCE|last=Garfield|first=Eugene|year=1998|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Garfield|first=Eugene|date=12 February 1990|title=The most cited papers of all time|journal=Current Comments|volume=13|issue=7|pages=2–14|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v13p045y1990.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] His current research involves studying the structural organization of nuclei and chromatin within the cell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molbio.unige.ch/laemmli/index.php|title=PROFESSOR ULRICH K.

==Major scientific contributions==

Although electrophoresis was used to separate proteins before Laemmli's work, he made significant improvements to the method. The term "Laemmli buffer" is often used to describe a tris-glycine buffer system that is utilized during SDS-PAGE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/SDS-PAGE.htm|title=SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)|year=2010|publisher=EnCor Biotechnology Inc. |accessdate=9 January 2010|location=Gainesville, FL[/tpl]
