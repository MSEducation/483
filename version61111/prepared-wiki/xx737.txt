Cambridge is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, situated directly north of Boston, across the Charles River.  It was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in England, an important center of the Puritan theology embraced by the town's founders.[tpl]cite book|last=Degler|first=Carl Neumann|title=Out of Our Pasts: The Forces That Shaped Modern America|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|year=1984|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NebLe1ueuGQC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=cambridge+university+puritans+newtowne#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=September 9, 2009 | isbn=978-0-06-131985-3[/tpl] Cambridge is home to two of the world's most prominent universities, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cambridge has also been home to Radcliffe College, once one of the leading colleges for women in the United States before it merged with Harvard.  According to the 2010 Census, the city's population was 105,162.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25/2511000.html | title=Cambridge, QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau[/tpl] It is the fifth most populous city in the state, behind Boston, Worcester, Springfield, and Lowell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25000.html | title=Massachusetts, QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau[/tpl] Cambridge was one of the two seats of Middlesex County prior to the abolition of county government in 1997; Lowell was the other.

==History==

The site for what would become Cambridge was chosen in December 1630, because it was located safely upriver from Boston Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Thomas Dudley, his daughter Anne Bradstreet and her husband Simon were among the first settlers of the town. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as "the newe towne."[tpl]cite book|last=Drake|first=Samuel Adams|title=History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts|publisher=Estes and Lauriat|location=Boston|year=1880|volume=1|pages=305–16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QGolOAyd9RMC&pg=PA316&lpg=PA305&dq=newetowne#PPA305,M1|accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] Official Massachusetts records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by 1632.[tpl]cite book|title=Report on the Custody and Condition of the Public Records of Parishes|publisher=Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IyYWAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA298&lpg=RA1-PA298&dq=%22Ordered+That+Newtowne+shall+henceforward+be+called%22|location=Boston|year=1889|page=298|accessdate=December 24, 2008[/tpl] Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston, Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including Boston, Dorchester, Watertown, and Weymouth) founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under governor John Winthrop.

The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy (J.F.K.) and Winthrop Streets, then at the edge of a salt marsh, since filled. The town included a much larger area than the present city, with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: Newton (originally Cambridge Village, then Newtown) in 1688,[tpl]cite book |last= Ritter |first= Priscilla R. |coauthors= Thelma Fleishman |title= Newton, Massachusetts 1679–1779: A Biographical Directory |year= 1982 |publisher= New England Historic Genealogical Society [/tpl] Lexington (Cambridge Farms) in 1712, and both West Cambridge (originally Menotomy) and Brighton (Little Cambridge) in 1807.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brightonbot.com/history.php |title=A Short History of Allston-Brighton |first=Marchione |last=William P. |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2011 |work=Brighton-Allston Historical Society |publisher=Brighton Board of Trade |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl] Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of Belmont in 1859, and the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867; Brighton was annexed by Boston in 1874.

In 1636, the Newe College (later renamed Harvard College, after benefactor John Harvard), was founded by the colony to train ministers. Newe Towne (later named Cambridge) was chosen for the site of the new college by the Great and General Court (the Massachusetts legislature)...primarily, according to testimony by Cotton Mather, to be near the highly respected, popular Puritan preacher Thomas Shepard. By 1638, the name "Newe Towne" had "compacted by usage into 'Newtowne'."

Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles (13 km) by road from Boston, the capital of the colony. By the American Revolution, most residents lived near the Common and Harvard College, with farms and estates comprising most of the town. Most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of Anglican "worthies" who were not involved in village life, who made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along "the Road to Watertown" (today's Brattle Street, still known as Tory Row). In 1775, George Washington came up from Virginia to take command of fledgling volunteer American soldiers camped on the Cambridge Common—today called the birthplace of the U.S. Army. (The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.) Most of the Tory estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, Henry Knox arrived with artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga, which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.
Between 1790 and 1840, Cambridge began to grow rapidly, with the construction of the West Boston Bridge in 1792, that connected Cambridge directly to Boston, making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles (13 km) through the Boston Neck, Roxbury, and Brookline to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new Middlesex Canal. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts.
In the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literature. Cambridge was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. In their day, the Fireside Poets—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes—were as popular and influential as rock stars are today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Soon after, turnpikes were built: the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the Middlesex Turnpike (Hampshire St. and Massachusetts Ave. northwest of Porter Square), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets were roads to connect various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, railroads crisscrossed the town during the same era, leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring town Somerville from the formerly rural parts of Charlestown.
Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846. This was despite noticeable tensions between East Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and Old Cambridge that stemmed from differences in each area's culture, sources of income, and the national origins of the residents.Cambridge Considered: A Very Brief History of Cambridge, 1800-1900, Part I. http://cambridgeconsidered.blogspot.com/2011/01/very-brief-history-of-cambridge-1800.html The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the downtown of the city around this time. Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character—streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills of the city. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge then led to three major changes in the city: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and Alewife Brook; the ice-cutting industry launched by Frederic Tudor on Fresh Pond; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries.
For many decades, the city's largest employer was the New England Glass Company, founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the world. In 1888, all production was moved, by Edward Drummond Libbey, to Toledo, Ohio, where it continues today under the name Owens Illinois. Flint glassware with heavy lead content, produced by that company, is prized by antique glass collectors today. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but there is a large collection in the Toledo Museum of Art. There are also a few pieces in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and in the Sandwich (Cape Cod, MA) Glass Museum.
Among the largest businesses located in Cambridge was the firm of Carter's Ink Company, whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the world.
By 1920, Cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of New England, with nearly 120,000 residents. As industry in New England began to decline during the Great Depression and after World War II, Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began the transition to being an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important in the city (both as a landowner and as an institution), but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students.  Also, the move of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from Boston in 1916 ensured Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.
After the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly, as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups, creating software such as Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3, and advanced computers, but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and DOS-based systems. However, the city continues to be home to many startups as well as a thriving biotech industry. By the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the Northeastern United States.
While maintaining much diversity in class, race, and age, it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay. The end of rent control in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable, in Somerville and other communities. In 2005, a reassessment of residential property values resulted in a disproportionate number of houses owned by non-affluent people jumping in value relative to other houses, with hundreds having their property tax increased by over 100%; this forced many homeowners in Cambridge to move elsewhere.Cambridge Chronicle, October 6, 13, 20, 27, 2005
As of 2012, Cambridge's mix of amenities and proximity to Boston has kept housing prices relatively stable despite the bursting of the United States housing bubble.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Cambridge has been a sanctuary city since 1985 and reaffirmed its status as such in 2006.City Of Cambridge - City Council Policy Order Resolution O-16 May 8, 2006Los Angeles Times: "In immigrant-rich Cambridge, arrest baffles locals" By Melanie Mason, Michael J.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, Cambridge has a total area of [tpl]convert|7.1|sqmi|km2[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|6.4|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it is land and [tpl]convert|0.7|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it (9.82%) is water.

===Adjacent municipalities===

Cambridge is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by:
The border between Cambridge and the neighboring city of Somerville passes through densely populated neighborhoods which are connected by the MBTA Red Line. Some of the main squares, Inman, Porter, and to a lesser extent, Harvard, are very close to the city line, as are Somerville's Union and Davis Squares.

===Neighborhoods===

====Squares====

Cambridge has been called the "City of Squares" by some,[tpl]cite web|author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/9/18/cambridge-a-city-of-squares-pcambridge/ |title="Cambridge: A City of Squares" Harvard Crimson, Sept. 18, 1969 |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=September 18, 1969 |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelwritersmagazine.com/RonBernthal/Cambridge.html |title=Cambridge Journal: Massachusetts City No Longer in Boston's Shadow |publisher=Travelwritersmagazine.com |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] as most of its commercial districts are major street intersections known as squares. Each of the squares acts as a neighborhood center. These include:

====Other neighborhoods====

The residential neighborhoods in Cambridge border, but are not defined by the squares. These neighborhoods include:

===Parks and outdoors===

Consisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. This is partly compensated for, however, by the presence of easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including Harvard Yard, the Radcliffe Yard,  and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of Mount Auburn Cemetery. At the western edge of Cambridge, the cemetery is well known as the first garden cemetery, for its distinguished inhabitants, for its superb landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country), and as a first-rate arboretum. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within the bounds of Watertown.http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CambridgeStreetMap18x24_032007.pdf It is also a significant Important Bird Area (IBA) in the Greater Boston area.
Public parkland includes the esplanade along the Charles River, which mirrors its Boston counterpart, Cambridge Common, a busy and historic public park immediately adjacent to the Harvard campus, and the Alewife Brook Reservation and Fresh Pond in the western part of the city.

==Government==

===Federal and state representation===

Cambridge is split between Massachusetts's 5th and 7th congressional districts. The 5th district seat is held by Democrat Katherine Clark, who replaced now-Senator Ed Markey in a 2013 special election; the 7th is represented by Democrat Mike Capuano, elected in 1998. The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, elected in 2012, who lives in Cambridge. The Governor of Massachusetts is Democrat Deval Patrick, elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2010.
On the state level, Cambridge is represented in six districts in the Massachusetts House of Representatives: the 24th Middlesex (which includes parts of Belmont and Arlington), the 25th and 26th Middlesex (the latter which includes a portion of Somerville), the 29th Middlesex (which includes a small part of Watertown), and the Eighth and Ninth Suffolk (both including parts of the City of Boston). The city is represented in the Massachusetts Senate as a part of the "First Suffolk and Middlesex" district (this contains parts of Boston, Revere and Winthrop each in Suffolk County); the "Middlesex, Suffolk and Essex" district, which includes Everett and Somerville, with Boston, Chelsea, and Revere of Suffolk, and Saugus in Essex; and the "Second Suffolk and Middlesex" district, containing parts of the City of Boston in Suffolk County, and Cambridge, Belmont and Watertown in Middlesex County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/ |title=Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from |publisher=Mass.gov |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl]

===City government===

Cambridge has a city government led by a mayor and nine-member city council. There is also a six-member school committee which functions alongside the Superintendent of public schools. The councilors and school committee members are elected every two years using the single transferable vote (STV) system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/election/Proportional_Representation.cfm |title=Proportional Representation Voting in Cambridge |publisher=Cambridgema.gov |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl]
The mayor is elected by the city councilors from amongst themselves, and serves as the chair of city council meetings. The mayor also sits on the school committee. However, the mayor is not the chief executive of the city. Rather, the city manager, who is appointed by the city council, serves in that capacity.
Under the city's Plan E form of government, the city council does not have the power to appoint or remove city officials who are under direction of the city manager. The city council and its individual members are also forbidden from giving orders to any subordinate of the city manager.http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/planE.pdf
Richard C. Rossi is the city manager; he succeeded Robert W. Healy, who retired in June 2013 after serving 32 years in the position.  In recent history, the media has highlighted the salary of the city manager as being one of the highest for a civic employee in Massachusetts.[tpl]cite news |title=Cambridge city manager's salary almost as much as Obama's pay |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/features/x1837730973/Cambridge-city-managers-salary-almost-as-much-as-Obamas |agency= |newspaper=Wicked Local: Cambridge |publisher= |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2011 |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=[/tpl]

===Water department===

Cambridge is unusual among cities inside Route 128 in having a non-MWRA water supply. City water is obtained from Hobbs Brook (in Lincoln and Waltham), Stony Brook (Waltham and Weston), and Fresh Pond (Cambridge).  The city owns over [tpl]convert|1200|acres|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of land in other towns that includes these reservoirs and portions of their watershed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CWD/wat_lands.cfm |title=Cambridge Watershed Lands & Facilities |publisher=.cambridgema.gov |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl] Water is treated at Fresh Pond, then pumped uphill to an elevation of [tpl]convert|176|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level at the Payson Park Reservoir (Belmont); From there, the water is redistributed downhill via gravity to individual users in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CWD_March_2010.pdf |title=Water supply system |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl]Is Fresh Pond really used for drinking water?, Cambridge Water Department[tpl]dead|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===County government===

Cambridge was a county seat of Middlesex County, along with Lowell, prior to the abolition of county government. Though the county government was abolished in 1997, the county still exists as a geographical and political region. The employees of Middlesex County courts, jails, registries, and other county agencies now work directly for the state. At present, the county's registrars of Deeds and Probate remain in Cambridge; however, the Superior Court and District Attorney have had their base of operations transferred to Woburn. Third District court has shifted operations to Medford, and the Sheriff's office for the county is still awaiting a near-term relocation.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/14/court_move_a_hassle_for_commuters/ |title=Court move a hassle for commuters |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 14, 2008 |work=The Boston Globe |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=In a little more than a month, Middlesex Superior Court will open in Woburn after nearly four decades at the Edward J.

==Education==

===Higher education===

Cambridge is perhaps best known as an academic and intellectual center, owing to its colleges and universities, which include:
At least 129 of the world's total 780 Nobel Prize winners have been, at some point in their careers, affiliated with universities in Cambridge.
The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is also based in Cambridge.

===Primary and secondary public education===

==Economy==

Manufacturing was an important part of the economy in the late 19th and early 20th century, but educational institutions are the city's biggest employers today. Harvard and MIT together employ about 20,000.Top 25 Cambridge Employers: 2008[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl], City of Cambridge As a cradle of technological innovation, Cambridge was home to technology firms Analog Devices, Akamai, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN Technologies) (now part of Raytheon), General Radio (later GenRad), Lotus Development Corporation (now part of IBM), Polaroid, Symbolics, and Thinking Machines.
In 1996, Polaroid, Arthur D. Little, and Lotus were top employers with over 1,000 employees in Cambridge, but faded out a few years later.

==Transportation==

===Road===

Several major roads lead to Cambridge, including Route 2, Route 16 and the McGrath Highway (Route 28). The Massachusetts Turnpike does not pass through Cambridge, but provides access by an exit in nearby Allston. Both U.S. Route 1 and Interstate 93 also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in Boston. Route 2A runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the Longfellow Bridge and the Harvard Bridge, eight of which are open to motorized road traffic.
Cambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major "squares" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Central Square, or Hampshire Street between Kendall Square and Inman Square.

===Mass transit===

Cambridge is well served by the MBTA, including the Porter Square stop on the regional Commuter Rail, the Lechmere stop on the Green Line, and five stops on the Red Line (Alewife, Porter Square, Harvard Square, Central Square, and Kendall Square/MIT). Alewife Station, the current terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day [tpl]as of|lc=y|2009[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=10029 |title=> Schedules & Maps > Subway > Alewife Station |publisher=MBTA |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl] The Harvard Bus Tunnel, under Harvard Square, reduces traffic congestion on the surface, and connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912, and served trackless trolleys and buses as the routes were converted. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.
Outside of the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in city, in addition to the municipal government itself.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |title=Charles River TMA Members |author=Staff writer |date=(As of) January 1, 2013 |work=CRTMA |publisher= |language= |trans_title= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl]

===Cycling===

Cambridge has several bike paths, including one along the Charles River,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |title=Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl] and the Linear Park connecting the Minuteman Bikeway at Alewife with the Somerville Community Path. Bike parking is common and there are bike lanes on many streets, although concerns have been expressed regarding the suitability of many of the lanes. On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk. Cambridge bans cycling on certain sections of sidewalk where pedestrian traffic is heavy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_ban.html |title=Sidewalk Bicycling Banned Areas – Cambridge Massachusetts |publisher=Cambridgema.gov |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_reg.html |title=Traffic Regulations for Cyclists – Cambridge Massachusetts |publisher=Cambridgema.gov |date=May 1, 1997 |accessdate=2012-04-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
