Some "For Real" segments can also be viewed online.[tpl]cite web|title=Cyberchase Videos|url=http://pbskids.org/cyberchase/videos/|publisher=Thirteen|accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] As of September 17, 2012, "Oh Noah!", shorts that teach kids to speak Spanish, have been used instead of re-running the "For Real" segments.[tpl]cite news|last=Miramar-Garcia|first=Gabriel|title=PBS to broadcast Oh Noah! with Cyberchase for Hispanic Heritage month|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2012091724088/pbs-to-broadcast-oh-noah-with-cyberchase-for-hispanic-heritage-month.html|accessdate=2012-10-14|newspaper=Rapid TV News|date=2012-09-17[/tpl] The "For Real" segment has returned in season 9, but only with Harry.

==History and Education Philosophy==

According to the Website, Motherboard (sometimes referred to as "Mother B.") is the "Brain of the giant computer system that oversees all of Cyberspace.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/cyberchase/media/games/webisodes-global/how_started.html|title=Cyberchase How it all Started [/tpl] Her technician computer scientist, Dr. Marbles, keeps her functioning properly. Dr. Marbles creates The Hacker as an assistant, but Hacker turns against Motherboard. Digit is the assistant to The Hacker and watches as Hacker steals the Encryptor Chip. He eventually escapes Hacker, after Dr. Marbles drains Hacker's battery and banishes him to the Northern Frontier. Unfortunately, Hacker is able to find a way to recharge himself, build Buzz and Delete, and formulate a plan to launch a virus that attacks Motherboard. When the kids Matt, Jackie, and Inez, meet by merely a random chance, and interact with a library map, this opens up  a door for Hacker to infect Motherboard with the virus.
Cyberchase aims to show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it. The series encourages viewers to see, think, and do mathematics in their world. The show and supporting activities have been designed to support math education and reflect the curriculum standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nctm.org/ |title=National Council of Teachers of Mathematics |publisher=Nctm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05[/tpl] The showâ€™s philosophy is to foster enthusiasm for math, to model mathematic reasoning, to help children improve their problem-solving skills and to inspire all children to approach math with confidence and a "can-do" attitude.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/parents/cyberchase/about-cyberchase/learning-goals |title=Cyberchase Learning Goals |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05[/tpl]

==Cybersites==

Cyberspace consists of plane-like bodies called Cybersites which are based on locations such as Ancient Egypt, the American Old West, mythological Greece, and Carnival. The Cybersquad travels to many of these locations in order to protect Cyberspace from The Hacker. Each Cybersite has their own type of Cybercitizen if it is inhabited. They are meant to represent the diversity of websites in the internet, and reflect the many ecosystems and neighborhoods of today's world. For example, Gollywood is a Cyberspace representation of Hollywood, and Pefectamundo represent the 100% sustainable ecosystem of tomorrow.

===Critical response===

The series has had a generally positive response.
On the site common sense media, the show was for ages 5 and up and rated 4/5 stars. The reviewer, Joly Herman, commented that "the adventures aren't scary, violent, or sexually inappropriate" but "require fortitude and brain power". Proposed discussion points sprouting from the series include "Can your child take the skills learned in each episode and figure out how to apply it to everyday life?" Herman noted that the only downside was that the adventures did not take place in the "real world" but added that the "For Real" segments solved this problem. The show was given a rating of 3/5 smiley faces under the "The Good Stuff" section.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/cyberchase | title=Cyberchase | accessdate=2011-01-02 | author=Herman, Joly | publisher=common sense media[/tpl]
Carey Bryson of About.com gave the show a rating of 4/5 stars. Bryson noted that the series' explanations of "simple mathematical ideas" are "usually explained well and woven throughout the story in a fun and interesting way". The review commended the series for its accessibility: "Children can easily learn from the example in the cartoon story" and praised the "Cyberchase For Real segment that follows each episode". Citing an example from the series using codes, Bryson explained how the show could be used to expand upon the curriculum: "Not only did five-year-old learn about codes, but she also got in a ton of spelling practice". Bryson commended the series: "Educationally, Cyberchase delivers".[tpl]cite web | url=http://kidstvmovies.about.com/od/cyberchase/fr/Cyberchase.htm | title=Cyberchase - TV Show Review | accessdate=2011-01-02 | author=Bryson, Carey | work=About.com[/tpl]
