==History==

The route was originally designated as FM 473 in 1945, as a short route connecting US 87 in Comfort to rural areas of western Kendall County. The route was extended several times: to Sisterdale in 1949, to RM 474 in 1951, and to US 281 in 1953 (replacing FM 1622). The designation was changed from a FM to RM route in 1956. The addition of the section between US 281 and RM 32 occurred in 1970. Also, while the official designation has not been amended, signage does indicate that the route begins at SH 27, and not at US 87 (or its successor business route).

==Major intersections==

The total mileage in the table below is greater than that given by TxDOT, because the concurrency with US 281 is not included in its official description or mileage; however, the route is signed as concurrent.
