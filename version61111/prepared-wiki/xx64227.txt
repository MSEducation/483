[[Trace metal]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Trace metals are metals in extremely small quantities that are present in animal and plant cells and tissue.  They are a necessary part of nutrition and physiology. Ingestion of, or exposure to, excess quantities is often toxic. However, insufficient plasma or tissue levels of certain trace metals can cause pathology as well; as is the case with iron. 
Trace metals include iron, magnesium, lithium, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, arsenic, molybdenum, manganese, selenium and others.[tpl]cite book |title=Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5229785 |edition=28th ed |author1=Bender DA |author2=Mayes PA |author3=Murray RK |author4=Botham KM |author5=Kennelly PJ |author6=Rodwell VW |author7=Weil PA |chapter=Chapter 44.

Trace metals are depleted through the expenditure of energy by various metabolic processes living organisms. They are replenished in animals through diet as well as environmental exposure, and in plants through the uptake of nutrients from the soil in which the plant grows.
Human vitamin pills and plant fertilizers both contain trace metals as additional sources for trace metals.  
Trace metals are sometimes referred to as trace elements, though the latter is a broader category. See also Dietary mineral.
Trace elements though required in smaller quantities are to be taken in diet as they are required by the body for specific functions but taking them in excess causes various problems. For example fluorine is required for the formation of bones and enamel on teeth.However, when taken in more quantities due to its excessive content in ground water by people in some areas causes a disease called "Fluorosis', in which bone deformations and yellowing of teeth are seen.
The harder you work to expend energy, the more trace metals you will lose. These metals need to be replaced so that your body can properly function. Things such as vitamins and sports drinks can help with this along with fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Some metals are naturally found in the body and are necessary for proper human health. Iron can help to prevent anemia, and zinc is a cofactor in over 100 enzyme reactions. All though trace metals are good for humans, in high doses they may be toxic to the body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.becomehealthynow.com/article/hairchiro/123 |title=The Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis / The Trace Metals |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl]
Copper is one of the most important trace metals. It has many uses in the body. Copper helps to oxidize glucose which gives the body more energy. Copper also carries oxygen through the blood, that is how you are able to get oxygen to your muscles. Copper also has a lot more important uses.
