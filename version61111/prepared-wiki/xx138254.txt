Group member Erik Darling recruited two friends to record a folk version of "Walk Right In" after hearing the original Cannon recording. Darling wanted the record to have a distinctive sound, so he and group member Bill Svanoe both played twelve string guitars on the song, although they had some difficulty in acquiring the instruments. Darling is quoted as saying that prior to the making of this record, "you couldn't buy a 12-string guitar...I ordered one from the Gibson Company, but in order to record song with two 12-strings, we had to wait for the company to build a second one for Bill!" (a left-handed model). The success of the song was a boon to Cannon, who was in his late 70s and had been forced to pawn his banjo the previous winter to pay his heating bill; he received royalties as a songwriter and saw renewed interest in his music, which led to a recording contract of his own.

==Trivia==

The French singer, author and composer Claude Fran√ßois became famous in his debut thanks to this song, that he sang in French ("Marche tout droit").
Despite many songs at the time, he seemed doomed to never become famous. But "Marche tout droit" was one important step for him on the path to success, so one can wonder that without this song, "Comme d'habitude", which was later world-famous as "My Way", might have never been written.
