Ordinary Average Guy is the ninth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1991 (see 1991 in music).

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Vincent Jeffries wrote of the album "This collection of nostalgia, decent balladry, and quirky anthems probably reinforced any notions of Joe Walsh's creative decline... this reflective, sometimes half-hearted effort bellies a weariness that's both sad and difficult to appreciate as this master goes through the motions."
