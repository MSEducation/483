These non residential uses are arranged over 3 levels cascading down to the beach and the sea. They are covered by a spectacular single span ETFE roof.  The six towers step up from 19 to 29 floors. The seventh and central tower will contain apartments and a hotel, a casino at its base and a skybar and restaurant at the top. It will rise up to 42 floors, making it Romania's tallest building.
