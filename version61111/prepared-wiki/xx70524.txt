==Biography==

===Masaya and G-Craft===

Toshiro Tsuchida worked for Japanese development studios Masaya and G-Craft, the latter of which he founded in 1993 after leaving Masaya. During the development of Front Mission 2 and Front Mission Alternative, Square initiated talks with Tsuchida in an attempt to purchase G-Craft in 1997. As the buyout occurred during Front Mission 2's development, it became the last title with G-Craft credited as the developer.[tpl]cite journal|title=Dengeki GAMES February 2004 Special Edition, "100 Year History of Front Mission"|editor=Dengeki|publisher=MediaWorks|date=February 2004|language=Japanese|quote=[/tpl]

===Square Enix===

Tsuchida was also the battle director for both Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XIII. As battle director of Final Fantasy X, he pulled away the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which started with Final Fantasy IV and originally designed by Hiroyuki Ito, replacing it with a more strategic battle system, which is known as the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) system. He kept Final Fantasy IV in mind when working on Final Fantasy X. Tsuchida was the head of Product Development Division-6 within Square Enix.[tpl]cite web |author=Winkler, Chris |date=2003-09-20 |title=Square Enix Talks Current Status |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2003/1934.html |publisher=RPGFan |accessdate=2013-12-07[/tpl]
He produced Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King, and stated that Square Enix was excited to be the first ones to bring a new game to Wiiware game platform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/25/gdc-2008-my-life-as-a-king-interview|last=Hatfield|first=Daemon|title=GDC 2008: My Life as a King Interview|publisher=IGN|date=February 25, 2008|accessdate=2013-02-28[/tpl] The game concept was to take the role of the king, not the hero, and the Crystal Chronicles series has a large amount of character interactions. Game development began before the Wiiware tools were distributed. Developing Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King required a change from the typical way the Square Enix developed games, switching from starting with the graphics and to beginning with gameplay.[ref]
