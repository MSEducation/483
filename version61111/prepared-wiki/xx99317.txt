His music was further exposed to younger generations through a movement known as by The Beat Army, an online music forum based on Facebook, which is operated by author and music producer Paul Collins. Royal continues to tour regularly, performing concerts at casinos, music festivals and clubs in Canada, the United States, Japan and throughout Europe. Royal's set lists include a mixture of songs representing multiple genres from the 1960s to the present day.
