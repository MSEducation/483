[[River Horn/Hornbach]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Lorraine (region)

The River Horn (French: La Horn; German: Hornbach) is a left tributary of Schwarzbach flowing through the region of Lorraine, in north-east France, and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in southern Germany. Its headwaters rise in the French town of Bitche, in the Moselle Department, following a north by north-eastern course, before forming a part of the border between France and Germany. As the Franco-German border takes a sharp turn to the west, the Horn continues into Germany. Here, it follows a roughly north-western course, ending in the German town of Zweibr√ºcken, emptying into the Schwarzbach.
