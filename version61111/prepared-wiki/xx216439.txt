===2005: Move to Taiwan and learning Chinese===

In March 2005 he signed under Yang Dengkui's First Media Holdings Corporation and moved to Taiwan to pursue a career in acting. He lived at his uncle's house and shared a bedroom with his cousin when he first moved to Taiwan. As he was unfamiliar with the Chinese language since he only spoke a few words and couldn't read or write Chinese he spent his entire first year in Taiwan learning basic Chinese and memorizing the lines to his first drama "Emerald on the Roof".

===2006-2007: Acting debut===

In 2006 he made his acting debut as the 2nd male lead alongside Wallace Huo in the idol drama "Emerald on the Roof". As his Chinese pronunciations wasn't fluent his voice was dubbed by a voice actor in the drama. 
His next drama, 2007's pre-war China comedy, romance, action drama "Love at First Fight" starred mostly the same cast from "Emerald On the Roof" with the addition of Hong Kong actress/singer Miriam Yeung as the female lead. His voice was once again dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese for this drama.

===2007-2009: Collaboration with "Fahrenheit" members===

In late 2007 he moved to more mainstream idol drama "Romantic Princess" playing Taiwanese boyband Fahrenheit member Wu Chun's younger brother. This is the first drama his real voice can be heard. That same year he also had a minimal role in the 2nd installment of popular Taiwanese idol K.O. drama franchise "The X-Family" starring alongside the rest of the other Fahrenheit members. 
In early 2008 he once again played Wu Chun's younger brother in a supporting role for the idol drama "Hot Shot" working alongside popular Taiwanese idols Jerry Yan and Show Luo. 
In the summer of 2008 he starred alongside Rainie Yang and Jiro Wang from Fahrenheit in the idol drama "ToGetHer" as Jia Sen aka Ah Gan. The drama was aired in early 2009. For this role he had to play a 20 year old college student and swimming captain with the mind of a 8 year old boy, he also had to train his body to resemble a championship swimmer.

===2009-2010: First leading role and music career===

In early 2009 till early 2010 he starred in his first leading role for the 3rd installment of the K.O. drama franchise "K.O.3an Guo" as a modern version of Chinese historical general Guan Yu. The drama was filmed as it aired. During the beginning filming period of "K.O.3an Guo" he was involved in a traffic accident while on his way to the film set. His left leg was injured, he relied on crutches or a wheelchair to get around for 3 month, because of his injury he was not able to perform much of his martial arts stunts for the early episodes of the drama. Also due to the popularity of the drama he and his co-stars were later formed into a five member boy band called "Wu Hu Jiang" or "Tiger Team" in English.

===2010-2011: Difficult times and change of management===

Most of 2010 and early 2011 was a difficult year for Hu. His band "Wu Hu Jiang" ceased activity due to restructuring of their management company and he received little to none filming offers. His only work during this period was in a minor role for the idol drama "Me & My Brothers". Due to the minimum work offers he received during this time his father had said to him that if he wanted to quit show business and return to New York it will be fine with his family, but he persisted and signed with Yang Dengkui's new management company Polyland International Entertainment in 2011.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] http://tw.fashion.yahoo.com/%E5%A0%85%E6%8C%81%E5%88%B0%E5%BA%95-%E8%83%A1%E5%AE%87%E5%A8%81-121336904.html George Hu TW Cosmopolitan interview Retrieved 2014-02-16 His first role under Polyland's management was as the lead in 2011's "Hayate the Combat Butler" based on the popular Japanese manga of the same name.

===2012-2013: Turning point and popularity rising===

The turning point in his career came in late 2012 starring as the male lead alongside Annie Chen as the female lead in SETTV's romance drama "Love, Now". In an interview for LETV he stated that he had accepted the project during the early stages of development and without even knowing the story line or seeing a script to the project in order to re-establish his presence in Taiwan since he had been filming dramas in Mainland China for the past year.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] http://www.letv.com/ptv/vplay/1860171.html LETV interview Retrieved 2012-12-29 He received a lot of notice for his role as Lan Shi-da a cold but caring business family man.

His fame continued to rise in late 2013 after starring in the joint mainland China and Taiwan historical drama "Lan Ling Wang" as the lead character's younger half brother An De Wang. He's voice was dubbed for his mainland China dramas since he still cannot pronounce Chinese Mandarin with hundred percent fluency and still maintains a foreigner accent when speaking Chinese Mandarin. His popularity in Taiwan also continued to rise after his 2nd successful collaboration with Annie Chen in the drama "Love Around".
