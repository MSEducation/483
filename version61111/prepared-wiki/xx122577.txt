The Very Best of Grateful Dead is a single-CD compilation album chronicling all the years of the San Francisco psychedelic band the Grateful Dead. It is the first release to document every label the band has played on; Warner Bros. Records, Arista Records and Grateful Dead Records/United Artists Records. It was released on September 16, 2003.
A songbook under the same name was released alongside this album which provides lyrics and musical tablature.

==Critical reception==

On Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said, "The Very Best of Grateful Dead marks the first attempt to do a thorough single-disc overview of the group's career, encompassing not just their classic Warner albums but also the records they cut for their own Grateful Dead/UA and Arista. As always with the Dead, it's hard to condense the band's free-ranging, freewheeling output onto one disc... but the 17 tracks here do present nearly all sides of the Dead while hitting their biggest songs... The collection would have been better if sequenced a little more chronologically, but nevertheless it provides a first-class introduction to a band whose catalog can often seem a little unwieldy."
