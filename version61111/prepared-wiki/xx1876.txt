Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process.[tpl]cite journal | title=Orbit Determination and Evolution of Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | bibcode=1996MNRAS.281..916B | last=Bailey | first=M.

It has been calculated that the previous visit by Hale–Bopp occurred in July 2215 BC. The comet may have presented a similar sight to people then, as the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4 AU, but no records of it have survived. Hale–Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June 2215 BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215 BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System.
The estimated probability of impacting Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5 x 10−9 per orbit. However, given that the comet nucleus is around 60 km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. A calculation given by Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35 km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3 x 1019 g. An impact velocity of 52.5 km/s yields an impact energy of 1.9 x 1032 ergs, or 4.4 x 109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.

==Scientific results==

Comet Hale–Bopp was observed intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high (up to 2.0[tpl]e|6[/tpl] kg/s),[tpl]cite journal | title= Particulate Mass Loss from Comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1999AJ....117.1056J | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 1056–1062 | last=Jewitt | first = David | year=1999 | doi=10.1086/300743 | last2= Matthews | first2= Henry[/tpl] which may have made the inner coma optically thick.[tpl]cite journal | last = Fernández | first= Yanga R. | title = The Inner Coma and Nucleus of Comet Hale–Bopp: Results from a Stellar Occultation | bibcode = 1999Icar..140..205F | year = 1999 | journal = Icarus | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–220 | doi = 10.1006/icar.1999.6127| last2= Wellnitz | first2= Dennis D. | last3= Buie | first3= Marc W. | last4= Dunham | first4= Edward W. | last5= Millis | first5= Robert L. | last6= Nye | first6= Ralph A. | last7= Stansberry | first7= John A. | last8= Wasserman | first8= Lawrence H. | last9= a'Hearn | first9= Michael F. | last10= Lisse | first10= Carey M. | last11= Golden | first11= Meg E. | last12= Person | first12= Michael J. | last13= Howell | first13= Robert R. | last14= Marcialis | first14= Robert L. | last15= Spitale | first15= Joseph N. [/tpl] Based on the properties of the dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10 μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.[tpl]cite journal | title = Observations of Unusually Small Dust Grains in the Coma of Comet Hale-Bopp C/1995 O1 | bibcode = 2001ApJ...549..635M | last = Mason | first=C.

J. | last4 = Woodward | first4 = C E. | last5 = Hanner | first5 = M. S. | last6 = Williams | first6 = D. M.[/tpl]
Hale–Bopp showed the highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.[tpl]cite journal | title = Polarimetric observations of the comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1998A&AS..129..489G | last = Ganesh | first=S. | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement | year=1998 | volume = 129 | issue = 5 | pages = 489–493 | doi = 10.1051/aas:1998201 | last2 = Joshi | first2 = U. C. | last3 = Baliyan | first3 = K. S. | last4 = Deshpande | first4 = M. R.[/tpl]

===Sodium tail===

One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.[tpl]cite journal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 490 | issue = 2 | pages =L199–L202 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.1086/311040 | title = Neutral Sodium from Comet Hale–Bopp: A Third Type of Tail | author1 = Cremonese, G | author2 = Boehnhardt, H | author3 = Crovisier, J | author4 = Rauer, H | author5 = Fitzsimmons, A | author6 = Fulle, M | author7 = Licandro, J | author8 = Pollacco, D | author9 = Tozzi, G. P | bibcode=1997ApJ...490L.199C|arxiv = astro-ph/9710022 | display-authors = 8 | last10 = West | first10 = R. M. [/tpl]
The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner coma, although not necessarily the nucleus. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding the nucleus, and 'sputtering' of sodium from dust grains by ultraviolet light. It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating Hale–Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow and diffuse[tpl]cite journal | last=Wilson |first=J. K.| title=Three tails of comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25..225W | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages=225–228 | doi=10.1029/97GL03704 | year=1998 | last2=Baumgardner | first2=J. | last3=Mendillo | first3=M.[/tpl] components of the tail may have different origins.[tpl]cite journal | first=G. | last=Cremonese | title=Sodium In Comets | bibcode=1997EM&P...79..209C | journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume=79 | issue=1 | pages=209–220 | year=1997 | doi=10.1023/A:1006245619568 | last2=Fulle | first2=Marco[/tpl]
While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from the comet's head by radiation pressure.

===Deuterium abundance===

The abundance of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp in the form of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.[tpl]cite journal | title = Cometary Deuterium | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 90 | issue = 1–2 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005269208310 | pages = 33–43 | first = Roland | last = Meier | last2 = Owen | first2 = Tobias C.|bibcode = 1999SSRv...90...33M [/tpl]
Deuterium was also detected in many other hydrogen compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds, rather than in the solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45 Kelvin.

===Organics===

Spectroscopic observations of Hale–Bopp revealed the presence of many organic chemicals, several of which had never been detected in comets before. These complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus, or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet.[tpl]cite journal | title = Organic synthesis in the coma of Comet Hale–Bopp?| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 320 | issue = 4 | year = 2002| doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04208.x | pages = L61–L64  | first = S. D. | last = Rodgers | last2 = Charnley | first2 = S. B.|bibcode = 2001MNRAS.320L..61R [/tpl]

===Detection of argon===

Hale–Bopp was the first comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are chemically inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, they can be used for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20 K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance,[tpl]cite journal | title=Detection of Soft X-rays and a Sensitive Search for Noble Gases in Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) | bibcode=1997Sci...277.1488K | last=Krasnopolsky | first=Vladimir A. | year = 1997 | journal=Science | volume=277 | pages=1488–1491 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5331.1488 | pmid=9278508 | issue=5331 | last2=Mumma | first2=MJ | last3=Abbott | first3=M | last4=Flynn | first4=BC | last5=Meech | first5=KJ | last6=Yeomans | first6=DK | last7=Feldman | first7=PD | last8=Cosmovici | first8=CB[/tpl] while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Discovery of Argon in Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | bibcode=2000ApJ...544L.169S | last=Stern | first=S. A. | year=2000 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=544 | issue=2 | pages = L169–L172 | doi=10.1086/317312 | last2=Slater | first2=D. C. | last3=Festou | first3=M. C. | last4=Parker | first4=J. Wm. | last5=Gladstone | first5=G. R. | last6=A'hearn | first6=M. F. | last7=Wilkinson | first7=E.|arxiv = astro-ph/0011327 [/tpl] Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40 K, but has at some point been warmer than 20 K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.

===Rotation===

Comet Hale–Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the material streaming away from these jets[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/anim30.html |title=Bergeron Comet Hale-Bopp Animation |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=Stardust|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA[/tpl] allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume = 136 | issue = 2 |pages =245–256 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1051/aas:1999213 | title = Dust continuum imaging of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp): Rotation period and dust outflow velocity | author1 = Warell, J | author2 = Lagerkvist, C.-I | author3 = Lagerros, J. S. V|bibcode = 1999A&AS..136..245W [/tpl]

===Binary nucleus question===

In 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30 km, with the main nucleus being about 70 km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180 km.[tpl]cite journal | title = Detection of a Satellite Orbiting The Nucleus of Comet Hale–Bopp (C/1995 O1) | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006230712665 | pages = 155–163 | first = Z. | last = Sekanina|bibcode = 1997EM&P...77..155S [/tpl] This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.
Although observations using adaptive optics in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus,[tpl]cite journal | last = Marchis | first = F. | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | year = 1999 | title = Adaptive optics observations of the innermost coma of C/1995 O1.

R. | last4 = Le Mignant | first4 = D. [/tpl] controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations.[tpl]cite journal| last=McCarthy | first=D.

Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.

==UFO claims==

In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek of Houston, Texas took a CCD image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called the Art Bell radio program Coast to Coast AM to announce that he had discovered a "Saturn-like object" following Hale–Bopp. UFO enthusiasts, such as remote viewing proponent Courtney Brown, soon concluded that there was an alien spacecraft following the comet.[tpl]cite news|title=The man who spread the myth | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986171,00.html | work=Time| date=April 14, 1997 | first = Leon | last = Jaroff | coauthors = Willwerth, James | accessdate=2008-10-30[/tpl]

However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.[tpl]cite web  |date=January 15, 1997 | title=Fraudulent use of a IfA/UH picture |url=http://www.sc.eso.org/~ohainaut/Hale_Bopp/hb_ufo_tholen.html | publisher=European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere |accessdate=2008-10-14|  first = David J. | last = Tholen |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930225155/http://www.sc.eso.org/~ohainaut/Hale_Bopp/hb_ufo_tholen.html |archivedate = September 30, 2007[/tpl]
A few months later, in March 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide with the intention of teleporting to a spaceship they believed was flying behind the comet.[tpl]cite journal | title = Heaven's Gate: The End | first = Wendy Gale | last = Robinson | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | url = http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol3/issue3/robinson.html [/tpl]
Nancy Lieder, a self-proclaimed contactee who claims to receive messages from aliens through an implant in her brain, stated that Hale–Bopp was a fiction designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of "Nibiru" or "Planet X", a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth's rotation, causing global cataclysm.[tpl]cite news|title= Comets Breed Fear, Fascination and Web Sites|author=George Johnson|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/28/us/comets-breed-fear-fascination-and-web-sites.html?sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2009-09-27 | work=The New York Times | date=1997-03-28[/tpl] Although Lieder's original date for the apocalypse, May 2003, passed without incident, predictions of the imminent arrival of Nibiru continued by various conspiracy websites, most of whom tied it to the 2012 phenomenon.[tpl]cite web|title=The Myth of Nibiru and the End of the World in 2012|author=David Morrison|publisher=Skepical Enquirer|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2008-05/morrison.html|accessdate=2009-04-28[/tpl]

==Legacy==

thumb|150px|right| Comet Hale–Bopp, at a distance of nearly 2 billion kilometres from the Sun. Credit: ESOIts lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant that Hale–Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley's Comet in 1986, and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Hale–Bopp by April 9, 1997.[tpl]cite journal | last = Aguirre | first = Edwin L. | title = The Great Comet of 1997 | journal = Sky and Telescope | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/skyandtelescope/access/886291661.html?dids=886291661:886291661&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:PAGE&date=Jul+1997&author=Edwin+L+Aguirre&desc=The+Great+Comet+of+1997 |date=July 1997 [/tpl]

It was also brighter than magnitude 0 for eight weeks, longer than any other recorded comet.
