"I Am... I Said" took Diamond four months to compose.[tpl]cite book | last= Jackson | first = Laura | authorlink=Laura Jackson | title= Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion | publisher= ECW Press | year= 2005 | isbn = 1-55022-707-6 | pages = 80â€“81[/tpl]  One of his most intensely personal efforts, it depicts the singer lost between two worlds:
Verses start quietly in a low vocal range, half sung and half spoken, with a soft rock guitar and light strings backing.  By the chorus climaxes, the vocals are much louder and higher in pitch, with horns, heavier drums and more strings joining in, but the singer even more uncertain:
"I Am... I Said" was later included on Diamond's November 1971 album Stones.  The single version leads off the LP, while a reprise of the song, taken from midway to a variant ending with Diamond exclaiming "I am!", concludes.
Critical opinion on "I Am... I Said" has generally been good, with Rolling Stone calling its lyric excellent in a 1972 review,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neildiamond/albums/album/106714/review/5942720/stones | title = Neil Diamond: Stones | author-link = Paul Gambaccini | first = Paul | last = Gambaccini | publisher= Rolling Stone | date= 1972-01-20 | accessdate= 2008-04-30[/tpl] while The New Yorker used it to exemplify Diamond's songwriting opaqueness in a 2006 retrospective.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/01/16/060116crmu_music | title= Hello, Again | first = Sasha | last = Frere-Jones | author-link = Sasha Frere-Jones | publisher= The New Yorker | date = 2006-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-04-30[/tpl]  A 2008 Diamond profile in The Daily Telegraph simply referred to the song's "raging existential angst,"[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/05/03/bmdiamond103.xml | title=Neil Diamond: the hurt, the dirt, the shirts | first =Neil | last = McCormick | publisher= The Daily Telegraph | date=2008-03-05 | accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl] and Allmusic calls it "an impassioned statement of emotional turmoil... very much in tune with the confessional singer/songwriter movement of the time." 
The song garnered Diamond his first Grammy Awards nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male.
"I Am... I Said" has been included in live versions on Diamond's Hot August Night (from 1972, in a performance that Rolling Stone would later label "fantastically overwrought"[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neildiamond/articles/story/8730821/neil_diamonds_jewels | title= Neil Diamonds' Jewels | first =Dan | last = Epstein | publisher=Rolling Stone | date=2005-11-03 | accessdate = 2008-05-08[/tpl]) and The Greatest Hits: 1966-1992 (from 1992), as well as in various compilations.
Brooke White performed the song on American Idols seventh season during its Neil Diamond week,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/blog/2008/04/a_couple_of_adm.html | title='Idol:' Loose Diamonds | first =Joanna | last = Weiss | publisher= The Boston Globe | date=2008-04-29 | accessdate=2008-05-16[/tpl] changing the lyric to replace New York City with her home state of Arizona. Among the foreign versions are the Italian language "La casa degli angeli" ("House of the angels"), performed by Caterina Caselli in 1971.[tpl]cite web | location = IT | url = http://www.lavocedelledonne.it/cantante.aspx?id_cantante=211 | title=Caterina Caselli | first = Augusta | last = Grignano | publisher= La voce delle donne | language= Italian | accessdate= 2008-05-16[/tpl] and by Dutchman Jan Rot on his 2008 album Hallelujah as "Zeg God... zeg ik", taking the title as someone who curses, while the Jewish word for God means 'I am'. The Brazilian singer Diana recorded the song as "Porque Brigamos" (Why we argue) in 1972, with lyrics written by the composer and producer Rossini Pinto. The band Killdozer also covered the song on their 1987 album Little Baby Buntin'.
