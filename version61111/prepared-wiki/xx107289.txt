By the middle of 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion with deep roots in the regions of South Travancore and South Tirunelveli.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 91: "By the middle of the nineteenth century, AV (abbreviation of Ayyavazhi) had expanded into a recognisable religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in South Tiruvitankur (Travancore) and in the southern parts of Tirunelveli. From the LMS reports, one gathers the information that AV was spreading with 'extraordinary' speed." The numbers of faithful increased significantly from the 1840s. By the close of the 19th century, Swamithope was considered the religio-cultural epi-center of Ayyavazhi.LMS Report for the year 1872, p. 107. After the time of Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi was spread through his teachings. The five Seedars, disciples of Vaikundar and their descendants, traveled to several parts of the country bearing the mission of Ayyavazhi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 120 "Vaikunda cami chose these disciples as close associates to propagate his teachings and ideas to the people" Meanwhile, the Payyan dynasty started administrating the Swamithoppe pathi,N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World Chapter 4, p. 21 "The temple is managed by the Gurus of Lord Vaikuntar's gurukulam. The Gurus are the descendants of Guru Podukutti." while other Pathis came under the administration of the followers of Ayya.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanathi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of The World Chapter 8, pp. 41–44 (sources). Following the instructions of Akilattirattu Ammanai (Akilam), the Nizhal Thangals (small pagodas) have been established across the country for worship and the study of scripture.V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493
Arul Nool, the first Ayyavazhi work in print was released in 1927, followed by the Akilam in 1933,(Another view has Akilam published in 1939 and Arul Nool in 1918. This uncertainty results from the unfortunate absence of publication data in early editions of the Arul Nool. Source: N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum). almost a century after it had been written down.N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum. As a result, Ayyavazhi abandoned active oral traditions in favor of literary scriptures. Ayyavazhi headquarter reports that Ayyavazhi spread more rapidly after Indian Independence (1940s) and still more rapidly through the 1990s.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar The light of the world, p. 61 Many Ayyavazhi-based social welfare organisations were established in the late 20th century.V.T. Chellam,Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 16, pp. 598–599. Several alternative versions of Akilam, including some controversial versions, were released during the same period.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, pp.(additional) 18–23 The Anbukkodimakkal Thirucchabai, a democratic bureau, was established by the religious headquarters in the early 1990s to organize and govern the religion.

Considering the growth of Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, the day of Vaikundar's incarnation, was declared a holiday by the state administration for the district of Kanyakumari in 1994, followed by the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin in 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dinamalar.com/2006mar03/general_tn3.asp |title=Report on declaration of the holiday|publisher=Dina Malar|accessdate=3 February 2007 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]Dr. R.

==Scriptures and holy places==

The holy books of Ayyavazhi are the Akilattirattu Ammanai (commonly referred to as )[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/20287371|title= www.worldcatlibraries.org|accessdate=23 January 2008 |format= Akilam: vacan̲a kāviyam|work=Publisher: K Patchaimal, Cāmitōppu.[/tpl] and the Arul Nool, and they are the source of the religion's mythology. The Akilattirattu Ammanai was written by Hari Gopalan Seedar in 1841,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, pp. 118–119 "The author claims that God woke him up during sleep and commissioned him to write it by 'telling' him what to write" as if hearing the contents of Akilam told by Narayana to his consort Lakshmi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 119 "It is presented as if Vishnu is narrating the whole story to his consort Leksmi" In addition to the mythological events Akilam also provides an extensive quantity of historical facts,Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 183. especially that of mid and late 2nd millennium CE. While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as the  Swamithope version, the Kottangadu version as well as the Panchalankurichi versions, are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam. Other released versions includes the Sentrathisai Ventraperumal, the Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai, the Vivekanandan, the highly criticised VTVN. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part-1. and the earliest and commonly accepted Palaramachandran version. Akilam contains more than 15,000 verses in seventeen sections. It is written in poetic Tamil in a ballad form, and is composed with a unique literal-style with two sub-genres, Viruttam and Natai throughout.
The secondary scripture, Arul Nool, includes various books that are believed to be written by Arulalarkal (one possessed by divine power).G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, pp. 119–120 It contains prayers, hymns and instructions for the way of worship in Ayyavazhi, as well as rituals prophesy and many acts. It also contains many events found in the Akilam pertaining to the life of Vaikundar.R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamigal Ore Avataram, Ram Publications, pp. 11–12 Unlike Akilam, there is no definitive history for Arul Nool. All these texts are compiled in Tamil language.Dr. C. Poulose, Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattampi Swamikal, p. 24.
To the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called Pathis,[tpl]cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=9780810861947|page=48|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&pg=PA48&dq=Ayya+Vaikundar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X1B_Us7mG4rlrAf4voCwDw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&f=false[/tpl]R.Shanmugam, Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, p. 195 with the Pancha pathis being the most important.G.

" The temple of the Swamithope pathi is the headquarters of the Ayyavazhi.The New Indian Express(English Daily), Madurai Edition, 3/4/2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsi.org.in/conference/chennai_tourism.asp#temple |title=www.tsi.org.in|accessdate=11 October 2007 |format= Tourism in Chennai|work=Temples: "Swamithoppe – Ayya Vaikundar Pathi, religious head quarters of Ayyavazhi." |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009031519/http://www.tsi.org.in/conference/chennai_tourism.asp#temple  |archivedate = 9 October 2007[/tpl]N.

The five Pancha pathi are:
1. the Swamithope Pathi, the venue of the great Tavam and the religion's headquarters.
2. Ambala Pathi, where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.
3. Mutta Pathi, the venue of the Second and Third Vinchais.
4. Thamaraikulam Pathi, where the Akilattirattu Ammanai was written down.
5. Poo Pathi, where Ayya unified the Earth goddess Poomadanthai to himself by symbolic marriage.
Vakaippathi, though not included in the Pancha pathis by the headquarters, is still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world, Chapter 6 (Thuvayal Panthy), p. 31G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 117 " However, there is also another list which includes Vakaipati in tuvaiyal tavacu's place " There is disagreement among followers of Ayyavazhi regarding the holiness of some other Pathis, such as Vaikunda Pathi and Avathara Pathi. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include these Pathis.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world, Chapter 8, p. 41 (Panchappathi)

==Symbolism==

The symbol of Ayyavazhi is a lotus carrying a flame-shaped white Namam.[tpl]cite book|last=Kulendiren|first=Pon|title=Hinduism a Scientific Religion|year=2012|publisher=iUniverse|location=Bloomington, Indiana.|isbn=9781475936735|page=85|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bwxDc6B9eokC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Tha. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 108. The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled Sahasrara (in Tamil, Ladam), while the Namam represents the Aanma Jyothi or atman. Both of the Ayyavazhi scripturesAkilam15:39 "Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya Thirunama Pottumittu"Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. Source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool – Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 62 refer to Thirunamam (the "flame shaped symbol" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.In the abcense of written references, there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older, but is not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbol.
The mythical narration in akilam about the eight yugas is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight chakras.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. (Additional) XII–XIII " Athara thana vilakka attavanai ". The first Neetiya Yukam, is Bindu and the final state, Dharma Yukam, is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of consciousness (Namam) of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment is for experiencing the absolute "bliss".A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. 374. The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is Ekam, which is a part of Vaikundar a Trinity conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute. Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol, "Lotus with Thirunamam", shows "Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara."
In certain Hindu texts the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |publisher=kheper.net |title= Sahasrara Chakra|accessdate=3 February 2007 [/tpl] But in Ayyavazhi symbolism, Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in Ayyavazhi symbolism. Sahasrara is symbolised as a lotus without a stem.
Ayyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of Sahasrara is used to cover the roof.See this Image:Image:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png, a Nizhal Thangal constructed in this architectural manner near Marthandam, Tamil Nadu. The lotus may also represent the heart and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.Pulavar. R. Shanmugam's, (2000), Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam, Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, p. 207
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including Vaishnavite ' Triple Namam '(not used currently), and Conch.

==Teachings and impact==

The majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book Akilattirattu Ammanai and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool.N. Vivekanandan, Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 8 Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The mystical teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as Ayya, "dear father", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.Dr. R. Ponnu, Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam, pp. 128–129
Ayyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness.A. Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. 384 Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The evil of Kali blocks the ultimate or supreme oneness prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of individuality and of extreme pride. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 12 Ekam—the "over-soul" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is "one which undergoes different changes with respect to space and time" because of the evil force maya.A. Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. 103–121
All of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 97 All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam,T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 60–61. which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 14 On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as Paramatma (over-soul) by which, God is the "Husband", while all other souls are his "consorts",Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, p. 534 symbolised by Thirukkalyana Ekanai, where Vaikundar marries the individual souls. Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the creation of human beings and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnumani, Ucchippadippu, pp. 32–33.
Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 114 " Other verses from Akilattirattu like, 'throw the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes." It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.
From its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system.Cf. Ward and Conner, Geographical and Statistical Memoir, p. 133; V. Nagam Aiya, The Travancore State Manual, Volume-2, p. 72. In this contest, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.Cf. Ponneelan, Vaikunta Cuvamiyum Avar Kalamum, Mimeograph note, p. 6.

==Worship centers==

The followers of Ayyavazhi established Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, which are centers of worship and religious learning in various parts of the country.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 116–117 They serve as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi. There are thousands of Nizhal Thangals[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tamilstar.com/news/publish/article_3251.shtml|title= Sujibala without a blouse in Ayyavazhi (Preview about the Film 'Ayyavazhi')|accessdate=23 January 2008 |format= www.tamilstar.com|work="Now there are thousands of temples erected in honour of Vaigundaswamy." |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070818154224/http://www.tamilstar.com/news/publish/article_3251.shtml  |archivedate = 18 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.kollywoodtoday.com/news/nallakannu-watches-ayyavazhi/|title= Nallakannu Watches Ayyavazhi|accessdate=9 June 2008 |format= www.kollywoodtoday.com|work=" Now there are thousands of temples erected in Honour of Vaigundaswamy."[/tpl] throughout India,C. Poulose, Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattampi Swamikal, p. 24, "To propagate his teachings and ideas he opened up 7 Pathis and 7 Tangs (The Primary Nizhal Thangals) in Travancore as well as hundreds of small pagodas (Nizhal Thangals) throughout India." Accrediting the Worship centers of Ayyavazhi across India and so the Ayyavazhi followers.R. Shanmugam, Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam, p. 192, "நாடெங்கும் உள்ள நிழல் தாங்கல்களுக்கெல்லாம் தலைமைப் பதி, குமரி மாவட்டதில் முன்கூறிய சாமிதோப்பு என்ற ஊரில் இருக்கிறது." "(The head quarters of all these Nizhal Thangals which are found across the country, is at the place called Swamithoppe as told earlier.)" mostly in South India. A research paper approved by Madurai Kamaraj University reports more than 8000 worship centres in Tamil Nadu and Kerala alone.Tha. Krishna Nathan's, Ayyaa vaikuNdarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum (Tamil), Chapter 4, p. 83: "இதற்கு ஆதாரமாக அய்யா வைகுண்டரைத் தெய்வமாக ஏற்றுக்கொண்ட சுமார் 8000 – க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அய்யாவழிப் பதிகள் தமிழ்நாடு மற்றும் கேரளப்பகுதிகளில் இயங்குவதைக் கூறலாம்." (This citation is from a Tamil Wikipedia article) Reports from the London Missionary Society (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of Nizhal Thangals.From the following reports: James Town Mission District for 1863, Neyoor Mission District for 1869, Santhapuram Mission District for 1858, Nagercoil Mission District for 1864, from the ARTDC for the respective years. Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, Swamithope pathi serves as the religious headquarters for all. The Pathis earn more importance among the worship centers.
The seven Pathis, obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship. The Swamithope pathi, though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All Pathis, except itself, are managed by independent committees.N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World, pp. 41–44 The five Pathis known as Pancha pathi are considered foremost among Pathis.
Nizhal Thangals, compared with Pathis, are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days.R. Ponnu, Vaikundacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum, p. 71. Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres.P. Sarvesvaran, Sri Vaikunda Swamikal – A Forgotten Social Reformer, p. 8. Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 118. Vaikuntacami is said to have established seven of these nilaltankalkal at Chettykudiyirrupu, Agastisvaram, Palur, Chundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadampankulam and Pampankulam. and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency Chapter 5, p. 118.
These centers emerged as the abode of Dharma.Journal of Dharma (1985), Published by 'Center for the Study of World Religions', Dharmaram College, Bangalore. The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide Panividai at least once daily.

==Ethics==

The ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, Akilattirattu Ammanai.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 112. Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, Chapter 5, p. 120 In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as "told by God" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, devas, saints, etc. when ever asked by them.
Neetham is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, Vinchai is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first Vinchai of Tiruchendur forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.
To an extent, the Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and "attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for Devas also.Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part – 2). It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then. Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force kalimayai with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as maya rules the minds of people.
Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially circumambulations, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religious studies==

It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the Hindu scriptures. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119. It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120–121. Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.
The philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on Ayyavazhi theology.P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram, pp. 20–21 But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, pp.10–20. For example, if the 96 tatvas are understood, then the Kaliyan is understood. Therefore theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, pp. 190–191. However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the Hindu ideas and concepts. Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.
On mythical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main mythology of Hinduism, including Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kantha Purana and Vishnu Purana, but with limited details.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p.62. It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate Hindu scriptures that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151. Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155. some are regenerated, while others are rejected.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency, 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130–131.
Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.

==God==

The theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other monistic religions.V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493 It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matters as an absolute constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, infinite, genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, "one", "absolute",M. Winslow (1869), A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary, American Mission Press (Madras), ISBN 81-206-0001-0, p. 185 "the whole which exists"V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi, p. 210 and "the incomparable";Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi, p. 173. all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.
Narrating through mythology, The Sivam and the Sakthi are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The Natham(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified Devas. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the Trinity takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from Akilam thirteen says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is created by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more monotheistic rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a turbine power who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.
In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation, was fragmented into six and each fragments took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu roles throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called Kalimayai (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a wayArisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 1, p. 36, "Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance." that contrasts the dualistic view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give pantheistic and panentheistic definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

==Festivals and rituals==

There are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is celebrated on the twentieth day of the Tamil month Masi (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the Solar calendar.Tha. Krishna Nathan, Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum, Chapter 4, p. 74. The mass procession conducted on this day from Nagercoil to Swamithoppe is a popular one in this part of the country.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=5 March 2007 |format= Kanyakumari District|work=Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Thiru Edu-Vasippu is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December). This celebration of textual reciting as a festival itself is a unique feature to Ayyavazhi. Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of Kodiyettru Thirunal in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as  'Nitham Thirunal' .Tha. Krishna Nathan, Ayyaa vaikundarin vazhvum sinthanaiyum, Chapter 4, p. 70.
In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19 Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as  'Anna Dharmam' , physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through Thuvayal Thavasu,The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (1986), Published by 'Mythic Society', Bangalore, India, v.77 (1986). eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 93–96. and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.Akilathirattu p. 252: "the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well."
But they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The Muthirikkinaru and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the Patham and Namam of them have the power to heal all sorts of mentalN. Amalan, Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varalaru, Akilam Publications, 86–87: "முத்திரிபுகளை (மும்மலம்) போக்க முத்திரிக்கிணற்றில் பதம் விட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்". as well as physical illness.The LMS Report for the year 1847, pp. 88–89: "They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water as the cure for all their diseases." Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam.A. Ari Sundaramani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai, p. 485. The use of the crown reveals that "all are kings", visualising an ideology similar to advaita. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 137. Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the alternative phrases religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==

The formula of inclusiveness and exclusivity, as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
Ayyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of Allah and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp. 61–65. It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings. But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the cruel nature of his boons, for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar, and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scripturesPon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Chapter 3, p. 30. had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda Avatar, Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in Akilam thirteen which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana, but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the Bible composition. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is "it was created with the intention of man and not that of God"."He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention". – Akilam5:571 In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like  'Accept God; Reject religion' .Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai p. 470.
Ayyavazhi accepts various incarnations in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' Hindu ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.Akilam 12:151 – "Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal" Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as boon they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only  'Book of Perfection' . By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only its own. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost Kali mayai (evil of Kali).R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram, pp. 114 -116. The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.

==Mythology==

The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present, and a future – constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts." It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely Santror, Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with Hindu mythology. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social."
It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of Kroni through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1. The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, Kaliyan, is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula −6th&11th Venpaas (a species of verse).
The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of Kroni. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,Samuel Zecharia (1826–1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805–1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201. Wearing of Headgear during worship,M.S.S. Pandiyan, Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism p. 180. Thuvayal ThavasuLMS Report for 1838, p. 71 says "About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform." all were noted in history.
Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten Avatars of Vishnu, it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and Dharma yukam==

The Santror is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 151 "Canror (Santror) is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)" There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, pp. 151–152. In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early "Chanars", who were called by the Arabs as "Al Hind", and known in biblical times as the "People of Five Rivers"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world. But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term "Santror" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignityR. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Socil Equality in South India, p. 23, line 5. and supreme knowledge,A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 3, p. 92. giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Chapter 3, p. 25. A quote from Akilam too reads, "Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly."
The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to born in the mythical garden Ayodha Amirtha Vanam (supposed to be between present-day Srirangam, Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, Sri Lanka) by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by Thirumal, to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term "Santror" refers to the entire human race.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Chapter 3, p. 90. Their lineage started at the end phase of Dvapara Yukam and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.
The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of Dharma Yukam.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam." The basis of the belief is that Ayya Vaikundar had come to establish and rule as the everlasting kingG. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 109 says, "Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it." over the Dharma Yukam in the place of Kali YukamG. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam." after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of Dwaraka pathi, the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of Dwapara Yuga by Krishna) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari.Sm. Ramasamy, Geomatics in Tsunami, p. 04, "Also in Ayyavazhi mythology the 'Akilathirattu Ammanai'  tells about a sunken land at about 152 miles sout or south-east to kanyakumari with 16008 streets." The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 161, "Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist eternally ..." It is often related to Moksha—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. 657–658Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), pp. 300–301

==Relation with Hinduism==

The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other Hindu scriptures remained with Divinity. Each of the gods referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 214 Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread maya or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.T. Kirushnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 63. In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to maya and are unhelpful.
The reason, as stated in Akilam for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, there in Mount Kailash, Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, p. 106 So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 315 So Siva and Brahma surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 321 Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to Shaivism, where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52 Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of Kali Yuga until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had bought as boon the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by Lakshmi and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 270–271
And from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and Brahma therefore form a part within Vaikundar.A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 288–289 This ideology about Trimurthi (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through Vinchais. After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal powerA. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai, pp. 290–291
Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 119 The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities. So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Part 1, p. 427 and so the Dharma was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.
