[[New London County, Connecticut]]

CATEGORIES: New London County, Connecticut, 1666 establishments in Connecticut, 1960 disestablishments in Connecticut

New London County is a county located in the southeastern corner of the U.S. state of Connecticut bordering Long Island Sound.  As of 2010 the population was 274,055. The total area of the county is [tpl]convert|772|sqmi|km2[/tpl], including inland and coastal waters.
As is the case with all eight of Connecticut's counties, there is no county government and no county seat. In Connecticut, Towns are responsible for all local government activities, including fire and rescue, snow removal and schools.  In a few cases, neighboring Towns will share certain resources (e.g. water, gas, etc.). New London County is merely a group of Towns on a map; it has no governmental authority.
It contains reservations of four of the five state-recognized Native American tribes, although the Paugassett were historically located further west.

==History==

Southeastern New England was dominated by the powerful Pequot people at the time of English encounter; they spoke the Mohegan-Pequot language and were one of the Algonquian-speaking tribes in the coastal areas. After years of conflict, the English and their Indian allies killed many and disrupted the Pequot in the Pequot War of 1637, ending their dominance. Two descendant Pequot tribes are recognized by the state today, as are three other tribes, all descended from Algonquian peoples.
New London County was one of four original counties in Connecticut that were established on May 10, 1666, by an act of the Connecticut General Court.  The act establishing the county states:
As established in 1666, New London County consisted of the towns of Stonington, Norwich, New London, and Saybrook. The "Homonoscet Plantation" referred to in the constituting Act was settled in March 1663, at first as Kenilworth but incorporated as the town of Killingworth in 1667.Frances Manwaring Caulkins, History of New London, Connecticut: From the first survey of the coast in 1612, to 1852 (New Haven) 1852, p. 249: "New London County extended from Pawkatuck River to the west bounds of Hammonasset Plantation (Killingworth,) including all the eastern parts of the colony". Several new towns were incorporated and added to New London over the next few decades: Preston in 1687, Colchester in 1699, and Lebanon in 1700. The settlements along the Quinebaug Valley were placed under New London jurisdiction in 1697 (later incorporated as Plainfield in 1699). By 1717, more towns were established in northeastern Connecticut (between the Quinebaug Valley and the Rhode Island border) and added to New London County.
Windham County was constituted from Hartford and New London counties on 12 May 1726, consisting of towns in northeastern Connecticut. New London County lost the towns of Voluntown, Pomfret, Killingly, Canterbury, Plainfield, and Lebanon to the newly formed county. In 1785, Middlesex County was constituted, consisting of towns along the lower Connecticut River Valley, taking away the towns of Killingworth and Saybrook from New London County. Several additional boundary adjustments took place in the 19th century: the establishment of the town of Marlborough in 1803, the transfer of the town of Lebanon from Windham County in 1824, and the transfer of the town of Voluntown from Windham County in 1881.Newberry Library -- Connecticut Atlas of Historical County Boundaries

==Cities, towns, and villages*==

 Villages are named localities within towns, but have no separate corporate existence from the towns they are in.

==Government and municipal services==

As of 1960, counties in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. All municipal services are provided by the towns. In order to address regional issues concerning  infrastructure, land use, and economic development, regional councils of governments throughout the state were established in 1989. Most of the towns of New London County are part of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, the exceptions being the towns of Lyme, Old Lyme, and Lebanon. Lyme and Old Lyme are part of the Connecticut River Estuary Regional Planning Agency, while Lebanon is part of the Windham Regional Council of Governments.

===Judicial===

The geographic area of the county is coterminous with the New London judicial district, with the superior courts located in the cities of New London and Norwich.

===Law enforcement===

Law enforcement within the geographic area of the county is provided by the respective town police departments. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff's Department existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, and court security. These responsibilities have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System.

===Fire protection===

Fire protection in the county is provided by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services to a section of the town.

===Water service===

Water service to 12 of the 21 towns of New London County is provided by a regional non-profit public corporation known as the Southeastern Water Authority. The Southeastern Water Authority supplies water to participating towns within New London County and is one of only two such county-wide public water service providers in the state. Seven towns receive water service from one or more private corporations. The city of Norwich and most of the town of Groton provide for their own water service.

===Garbage disposal===

Several towns in New London County have organized the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority. The participating towns are East Lyme, Griswold, Groton, Ledyard, Montville, New London, North Stonington, Norwich, Preston, Sprague, Stonington, and Waterford.

===Education===

Education in the county area is usually provided by the individual town governments. The less populated towns of Lyme and Old Lyme have joined together to form a single, regional school district (Region 18).
