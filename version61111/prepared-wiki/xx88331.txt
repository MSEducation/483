In press interviews, at public speaking events, as well as in her writing,and Me: The Neuroscience of Identity Greenfield has expressed concerns that modern technology, and in particular social networking sites and video games, may have a negative impact on child development, leading to conditions including dementia and autism.[tpl]cite news|last=Derbyshire|first=David|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1153583/Social-websites-harm-childrens-brains-Chilling-warning-parents-neuroscientist.html|title=Social websites harm children's brains|accessdate=5 March 2009|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Daily Mail|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite episode|title=Social websites: bad for kids' brains?|series=BBC Newsnight|serieslink=Newsnight|airdate=25 February 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7909847.stm|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/feb/25/social-networking|title=Age Concern backs social networks but Ben Goldacre's blood pressure still rising|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=25 February 2009|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2009|location=London, UK[/tpl] 
In 2011, Greenfield was criticised for explicitly linking the increase in internet usage to a rise in autism, with the National Autistic Society describing her statements as "unhelpful speculation". Greenfield responded by saying "I point to the increase in autism and I point to internet use.

Goldacre suggested that "A scientist with enduring concerns about a serious widespread risk would normally set out their concerns clearly, to other scientists, in a scientific paper."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/21/bad-science-publishing-claims|title=Serious claims belong in a serious scientific paper|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Ben|last=Goldacre|date=21 October 2011[/tpl]
