Ireland ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪər|l|ə|n|d[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|l|ə|n|d[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ga|Éire[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ga|ˈeː.ɾʲə|pron|Eire_pronunciation.ogg[/tpl]), also commonly referred to as the Republic of Ireland ([tpl]lang-ga|Poblacht na hÉireann[/tpl]), is a sovereign state in Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, located in the eastern part of the island, whose metropolitan area is home to around a quarter of the country's 4.6 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. It is  surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic[tpl]citation|title=Constitutional Law of 15 EU Member States|author1=L. Prakke|author2=C. A. J. M. Kortmann|author3=J. C.

The head of government, the Taoiseach, is nominated by the lower house of parliament, Dáil Éireann.
Following the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland gained effective independence from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State in 1922. Northern Ireland exercised an option called the Ulster Month to remain in the United Kingdom. Initially a dominion within the British Empire (later the Commonwealth of Nations), the Free State received official British recognition of full legislative independence in the Statute of Westminster of 1931. A new constitution was adopted in 1937, by which the name of the state became Ireland. In 1949 the remaining duties of the king — defined by the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 — were removed and Ireland was declared a republic under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The state had no formal relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but since 1999 the two have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Good Friday Agreement.
Once one of western Europe's poorest states, modern Ireland now ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita.[tpl]cite web |title=Country Comparison: GDP – per capita (PPP) |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Ireland&countryCode=ei&regionCode=eur&rank=27#ei |work=World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] After joining the European Union (then called the European Economic Community) in 1973, Ireland enacted a series of liberal economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country achieved considerable prosperity from 1995 to 2007, during which it became known as the Celtic Tiger. This was halted by an unprecedented financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent global economic crash."EU: Causes of Growth differentials in Europe", WAWFA think tank[tpl]cite news |last=Nicoll |first=Ruaridh |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/10/ireland-financial-crisis-emigration |title=Ireland: As the Celtic Tiger roars its last |date=16 May 2009 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 March 2010|location=London[/tpl]
Although still recovering from its economic crash, Ireland remains one of the world's most prosperous nations. In 2011 and 2013, it was ranked as the seventh-most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf |title=Table 1 |author=United Nations |year=2011 |work=Human Development Index and its components |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] Ireland also performs well in several metrics of national performance, including freedom of the press, economic freedom and civil liberties. Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD. It pursues a policy of neutrality through non-alignment and is consequently not a member of NATO,http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/nato_countries.htm although it does participate in Partnership for Peace.

==Name==

The Constitution of Ireland provides that "the name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland". Under Irish statute law, Republic of Ireland (or Poblacht na hÉireann) is "the description of the State"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1948/en/act/pub/0022/sec0002.html#zza22y1948s2 |title=Article 2 |work=Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 |author=Government of Ireland |publisher=Government of Ireland |location=Dublin |year=1948 |quote=It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.[/tpl] but not its official name. This official description was provided for in the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which transferred the remaining duties of the monarch to an elected president. However, the name of the state in English remained Ireland. A change to the name of the state would require a constitutional amendment. In the United Kingdom however, the Ireland Act 1949 provided that Republic of Ireland may be used as a name for the Irish state (although it did not make use of that term mandatory).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1949/41/pdfs/ukpga_19490041_en.pdf |title=Official text of Ireland Act 1949 |format=PDF |accessdate=4 November 2011[/tpl]
Although initially accepted by the British government,The Manchester Guardian, 30 December 1937 Britain accepts new name for the Free State. Full text of British Government's communiqué cited in Clifford, Angela, The Constitutional History of Éire/Ireland, Athol Books, Belfast, 1985, p153. the name Ireland became a source of contention between the British and Irish governments. These concerns arose because part of the island of Ireland is in the United Kingdom and so its government regarded the name as inappropriate. In a 1989 case, a majority of the Irish Supreme Court expressed the view that Irish authorities should not enforce extradition warrants where they referred to the state by a name other than Ireland (in this case the warrants had used the name Éire).Casey, James, Constitutional Law in Ireland, ISBN 978-1-899738-63-2, p. 31, in reference to the Ellis v O'Dea extradition case. As part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which resolved issues relating to Northern Ireland, the state dropped its claim to jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland. Since that agreement, the United Kingdom has accepted and uses the name Ireland.
The terms Republic of Ireland, the Republic or the South are often used when there is a need to distinguish the state from the island or when discussing Northern Ireland (the North). Many Irish republicans, and other opponents of partition, avoid calling the state Ireland. They see it as reinforcing partition and fuelling the perception that 'Ireland' and 'Irishness' are restricted to the Republic (see partitionism). Instead, they often refer to the state as the 26 Counties (with Northern Ireland as the Six Counties or 6 Counties) and sometimes as the Free State (a reference to the pre-1937 state).[tpl]cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0518/D.0518.200004130005.html |title=Parliamentary Debates: Volume 518 - 13 April 2000 |date=13 April 2000 |publisher=Dáil Éireann |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Home-rule movement===

From the Act of Union on 1 January 1801 until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. One million Irish died of starvation and/or disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, particularly to the United States.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mokyr|first = Joel|authorlink = Joel Mokyr|title = New Developments in Irish Population History 1700–1850|journal = Irish Economic and Social History|volume = xi|pages = 101–121|year= 1984|ref=harv[/tpl] This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in a constant population decline up to the 1960s.
From 1874, particularly under Charles Stewart Parnell from 1880, the Irish Parliamentary Party moved to prominence through widespread agrarian agitation, via the Irish Land League, that won improved tenant land reforms in the form of the Irish Land Acts, and with its attempts to achieve Home Rule, via two unsuccessful Bills which would have granted Ireland limited national autonomy. These led to the "grass-roots" control of national affairs under the Local Government Act 1898 previously in the hands of landlord-dominated grand juries of the Protestant Ascendancy.
Home Rule seemed certain when the Parliament Act 1911 abolished the veto of the House of Lords, and John Redmond secured the Third Home Rule Act 1914. However, the Unionist movement had been growing since 1886 among Irish Protestants after the introduction of the first home rule bill, fearing discrimination and loss of economic and social privileges if Irish Catholics achieved real political power. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of Ulster, where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. It was feared that any tariff barriers would heavily affect that region. In addition, the Protestant population was more prominent in Ulster, with a majority in four counties. Under the leadership of the Dublin-born Sir Edward Carson of the Irish Unionist Party and the northerner Sir James Craig of the Ulster Unionist Party, unionists became strongly militant in order to oppose the Coercion of Ulster. After the Home Rule Bill passed parliament in May 1914, to avoid rebellion with Ulster, the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith introduced an Amending Bill reluctantly conceded to by the Irish Party leadership. This provided for the temporary exclusion of Ulster from the workings of the bill for a trial period of six years, with an as yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area to be temporarily excluded.

===Revolution and steps to independence===

Though it received the Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books in 1914, the implementation of the Third Home Rule Act was suspended until after the First World War. For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war, Redmond and his Irish National Volunteers supported Britain, with 175,000 joining Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish), 16th (Irish), while Unionists joined the 36th (Ulster) divisions of the New British Army.[tpl]cite web |title=Irish Soldiers in the First World War |url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/History_of_Government/1916_Commemorations/Irish_Soldiers_in_the_First_World_War.html |work=1916 Commemorations |publisher=Department of the Taoiseach |accessdate=29 August 2011 |year=2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The core of the Irish Volunteers, who opposed any support of Britain, together with the Irish Citizen Army launched an armed insurrection against British Rule in the 1916 Easter Rising. This commenced on 24 April 1916 with the declaration of independence. After a week of heavy fighting, primarily in Dublin, the surviving rebels were forced to surrender their positions. The majority were imprisoned but fifteen of the prisoners (including most of the leaders) were executed as traitors to Britain. This included Patrick Pearse, the man recognised as Ireland's first President and founding father of the modern Irish nation, as well as James Connolly, socialist and founder of the Industrial Workers of the World union, and both the Irish and Scottish Labour movements, who was General during the rising and wounded. This event had a profound effect on public opinion in Ireland.
In January 1919, after the December 1918 general election, 73 of Ireland's 106 MPs elected were Sinn Féin members who refused to take their seats in the British House of Commons. Instead, they set up an Irish parliament called Dáil Éireann. This Dáil in January 1919 issued a Declaration of Independence and proclaimed an Irish Republic. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 Proclamation with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the United Kingdom. The new Irish Republic was recognised internationally only by the Russian Soviet Republic.[tpl]cite book|first=Desmond|last=Fennell|title=Heresy: the Battle of Ideas in Modern Ireland|publisher=Blackstaff Press|location= Belfast|year=1993|isbn=0-85640-513-2|page=33|quote=Both the new Irish Republic and the labour movement were sympathetic to the new soviet regime in Russia. The government of the Soviet Union recognised the Republic, and the Dáil authorised the establishment of diplomatic relations.[/tpl] The Republic's Aireacht (ministry) sent a delegation under Ceann Comhairle Seán T. O'Kelly to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, but it was not admitted.
After the War of Independence and truce called in July 1921, representatives of the British government and the Irish treaty delegates, led by Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins, negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London from 11 October to 6 December 1921. The Irish delegates set up headquarters at Hans Place in Knightsbridge and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken on 5 December to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann.
The Second Dáil Éireann narrowly ratified the Treaty.
In accordance with the Treaty, on 6 December 1922 the entire island of Ireland became a self-governing British dominion called the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann). Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Parliament of Northern Ireland had the option to leave the Irish Free State exactly one month later and return to the United Kingdom. During the intervening period, the powers of the Parliament of the Irish Free State and Executive Council of the Irish Free State did not extend to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland exercised its right under the Treaty to leave the new dominion and rejoined the United Kingdom on 8 December 1922. It did so by making an Address to the King requesting, "that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland."[tpl]cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report, 7 December 1922 |publisher=Stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk |date=7 December 1922 |accessdate=9 July 2009[/tpl]
The Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy over which the British monarch reigned. It had a Governor-General, a bicameral parliament, a cabinet called the "Executive Council" and a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council.

===Irish Civil War===

The Irish Civil War was the consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by Éamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty abolished the Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Empire and that members of the Free State Parliament would have to swear, what the Anti-Treaty side saw as, an oath of fidelity to the British King. Pro-Treaty forces, led by Michael Collins, argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".
At the start of the war, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an anti-treaty IRA. The pro-Treaty IRA disbanded and joined the new Irish Army. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, Michael Collins and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army with many tens of thousands of World War I veterans from the 1922 disbanded Irish regiments of the British Army, capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty forces (often called the Irregulars) and the determination of the government to overcome the Irregulars contributed significantly to their defeat.

===1937 Constitution===

On 29 December 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na hÉireann) came into force, which replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and called the state Ireland, or Éire in Irish.T. Garvin, 1922: the birth of Irish democracy, Gill & Macmillan: Dublin, 2005.

Koch, Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO: Santa Barbara, 2006. The former Irish Free State government had taken steps to formally abolish the Office of Governor-General some months before the new Constitution came into force.and the Governor-General's office was finally abolished under the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937 with effect from December 1936 Although the Constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open. Diplomats were accredited to the King, but the President exercised the internal functions of a Head of State.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mary E. Daly|date=January 2007|title=The Irish Free State/Éire/Republic of Ireland/Ireland: "A Country by Any Other Name"?|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=46|issue=1|pages=72–90|doi=10.1086/508399|jstor=10.1086/508399|quote=After the enactment of the 1936 External Relations Act and the 1937 Constitution, Ireland's only remaining link with the crown had been the accreditation of diplomats. The president of Ireland was the head of state. When opposition deputies asked de Valera whether Ireland was a republic—a favorite pastime in the mid‐1940s—he tended to resort to dictionary definitions showing that Ireland had all the attributes of a republic.[/tpl] For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI. George VI was only an "organ", that was provided for by statute law.
Ireland remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as the Emergency. The link with the monarchy ceased with the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and declared that the state was a republic. Later, the Crown of Ireland Act was formally repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act, 1962. Ireland was technically a member of the British Commonwealth after independence until the declaration of a republic on 18 April 1949. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the London Declaration of 28 April 1949. Ireland did not reapply when the rules were altered to permit republics to join.

===Recent history===

Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after previously being denied membership due to its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause.[tpl]cite news|author=November getaways |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/review-ireland-at-the-un-memories-of-the-early-years-by-noel-dorr-2307174.html |title=Ireland at the UN |publisher=Independent.ie |date=22 August 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl] At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary.[tpl]cite news|author=November getaways |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/a-frank-account-of-irelands-un-affairs-2235851.html |title=Ireland's UN affairs |publisher=Independent.ie |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl]
Interest towards membership of the European Economic Community developed in Ireland during the 1950s, with consideration also given to membership of the European Free Trade Area. As the United Kingdom intended on EEC membership, Ireland formally applied for membership in July 1961 due to the substantial economic linkages with the United Kingdom. However, the founding EEC members remained skeptical regarding Ireland's economic capacity, neutrality, and unattractive protectionist policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/EU/eu.htm |title=National Archives – Ireland and European Unity |publisher=Nationalarchives.ie |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl] Many Irish economists and politicians realised that economic policy reform was necessary. The prospect of EEC membership became doubtful in 1963 when French President General Charles de Gaulle stated that France opposed Britain's accession, which ceased negotiations with all other candidate countries. However, in 1969 his successor, Georges Pompidou, was not opposed to British and Irish membership. Negotiations began and in 1972 the Treaty of Accession was signed. A referendum held in 1972 confirmed Ireland's entry, and it finally succeeded in joining the EEC in 1973.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/index1_en.htm |title=Joining the European Community |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=31 July 1961 |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl]
The economic crisis of the late 1970s was fueled by Fianna Fáil's budget, the abolition of the car tax, excessive borrowing, and global economic instability. There were significant policy changes from 1989 onwards, with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the Celtic Tiger period, which lasted until the global Financial crisis of 2007–08.
In the Northern Ireland question, the British and Irish governments started to seek a peaceful resolution to the violent conflict involving many paramilitaries and the British Army in Northern Ireland known as "The Troubles". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement, was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border. As part of the peace settlement, the territorial claim to Northern Ireland in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland was removed by referendum.

==Geography==

Ireland extends over an area of approximately five-sixths ([tpl]convert|70273|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) of the island of Ireland ([tpl]convert|84421|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]), with Northern Ireland constituting the remainder. The island is bounded to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the northeast by the North Channel. To the east, the Irish Sea connects to the Atlantic Ocean via St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest.
The western landscape mostly consists of rugged cliffs, hills and mountains. The central lowlands are extensively covered with glacial deposits of clay and sand, as well as significant areas of bogland and several lakes. The highest point is Carrauntoohil ([tpl]convert|1038|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]), located in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks mountain range in the southwest. The River Shannon, which traverses the central lowlands, is the longest river in Ireland at [tpl]convert|386|km|mi|disp=or[/tpl] in length. The west coast is more rugged than the east, with numerous islands, peninsulas, headlands and bays.
Preceding the arrival of the first settlers in Ireland approximately 9,000 years ago, the landscape was extensively covered by forests of oak, ash, elm, hazel, yew, and other native trees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forestryservices.ie/history|title=History of Forestry in Ireland|accessdate=15 June 2011[/tpl] The growth of blanket bog and the extensive clearing of woodland to facilitate farming are believed to be the main causes of deforestation during the subsequent centuries. Today, approximately 12% of Ireland is forested, of which a significant majority is composed of mainly non-native coniferous plantations for commercial use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/5-15062011-BP/EN/5-15062011-BP-EN.PDF|title=Forests cover around 40% of the EU27 land area|accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl] Ideal soil conditions, high rainfall and a mild climate give Ireland the highest growth rates for forests in Europe. Hedgerows, which are traditionally used to define land boundaries, are an important substitute for woodland habitat, providing refuge for native wild flora and a wide range of insect, bird and mammal species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.noticenature.ie/Hedgerow.html|title=Hedgerows|accessdate=15 June 2011[/tpl]
Agriculture accounts for approximately 64% of the total land area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teagasc.ie/agrifood |title=Agriculture in Ireland |publisher=Teagasc.ie |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl] This has resulted in limited land to preserve natural habitats, in particular for larger wild mammals with greater territorial requirements.[ref]
