==Regular season==

Led by longtime owner-manager Connie Mack, the Athletics dominated during the regular season. Mack had purchased quite a few players from the Baltimore Orioles minor league club, and many of them would contribute to the A's 1929-31 dynasty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
The most famous of these players was ace Lefty Grove. In 1929, Grove led the American League in ERA and strikeouts on his way to a 20-6 record. Big George Earnshaw was the number two pitcher on the squad. He led the league in wins (24) and was second in strikeouts. Led by these two, Philadelphia allowed the fewest runs of any AL team.
On the offensive side, the A's boasted Hall of Famers Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, and Al Simmons. Simmons beat out Babe Ruth for the RBI crown in 1929.

Al Simmons and the 1929-1931 Athletics were the subject of an August 19, 1996 cover-story in Sports Illustrated with the teaser, "The Team that Time Forgot". Author William Nack wrote, "according to most old-timers who played in that era, the 1927 and '28 Yankees and the 1929 and '30 Athletics matched up so closely that they were nearly equal, with the A's given the nod in fielding and pitching and the Yankees in hitting."[tpl]cite news |first=William |last=Nack |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Lost in History |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008586/index.htm|work= |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=August 19, 1996 |accessdate=August 17, 2009[/tpl]
