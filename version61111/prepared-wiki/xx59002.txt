KYTV is a British television comedy show about a fictional television station that ran on BBC2 from 1989 to 1993, which satirised satellite television in the UK at the time.

==History==

The show was effectively the TV version of Radio Active, which spoofed local radio stations, and was developed by the same team.
It was written by Angus Deayton and Geoffrey Perkins, produced by Jamie Rix, directed by John Kilby and John Stroud, and with music by Philip Pope.  The majority of the programme's scripts had already aired on Radio Active.
The five key actors all performed various roles, some multiple, others on a single occasion. Their main characters as presenters were:
The pilot show was broadcast on 12 May 1989, and a series of 6 programmes began on 3 May 1990. A second series of 6 began on 17 March 1992, and a final 6 episodes were broadcast between 17 September and 22 October 1993, plus an additional Children in Need special, for a total of 19 episodes.
In 1992 the series won the Silver Rose and the Special Prize of the City of Montreux at the Festival Rose d'Or for the "Good Morning Calais" episode. Also, in the DVD commentary for The Micallef Programme, lead writer and performer Shaun Micallef cites this series as an inspiration for his show's format.

==Format==

KYTV combined irreverent sketches and variety elements (such as song and dance routines) with a broad-based satire of the public perception of UK satellite television - that of opportunistic entrepreneurs producing cheap, low quality television in order to exploit viewers.
KYTV was supposedly a low-budget satellite television station named after its alleged owner Sir Kenneth Yellowhammer, and bore a suspicious similarity to Sky Television. The name KYTV is actually a joke itself which becomes more apparent when it is occasionally referred to as "KY Telly", a play on the sexual lubricant KY Jelly.
In the second series KYTV merged with the fictional "BSE Television", just as Sky merged with BSB. The channel's new name was also KYTV: it was decided to take the first two letters of KYTV, the last two of BSETV, and the result was: KYTV. The third series featured parodies of Carlton Television's early logos.
Each episode featured a central theme (for example, a terrorist siege, the Channel Tunnel, or a costume drama) which sketches could revolve around.
Comedic elements included:
A regular feature was "Mike Flex's Master Quiz", in which contestants typically had to answer one question correctly to win "a ch√¢teau in the Loire". Mike Flex always managed to arrange the questions in such a way that nobody's answer was ever quite right. (Name that Tune: "Beatles, Yellow Submarine!" "Sorry, it was The Beatles, Yellow Submarine.  Bad luck.")
