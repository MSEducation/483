==History==

Although it is likely that schoolboys were taught by monks well beforehand, by 1179 Westminster School had certainly become a public school (i.e., a school available to members of the public from across the country, so long as they could pay their own costs, rather than private tuition provided to the nobility) as a decree of Pope Alexander III required the Benedictine monks of the Abbey at Westminster to provide a charity school to local boys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/641114/Westminster-School |title=Westminster School. (2009) |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl] Parts of the school's buildings date back to the 11th century, older than the current Abbey.
This arrangement changed in 1540, when Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of the monasteries in England, but personally ensured the School's survival by his royal charter.Historical notes on Westminster Schools. Westminster City Council. "After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540, Henry VIII personally ensured its survival by statute". The College of St. Peter carried on with forty "King's Scholars" financed from the royal purse. During Mary I's brief reign the Abbey was reinstated as a Roman Catholic monastery. The School occupies a number of the buildings vacated by the monks.
Elizabeth I re-founded the School in 1560,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/westminsterschool.htm |title=Elizabeth I has been credited with founding the Westminster School in 1560 |publisher=Luminarium.org |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/14/118165/Westminster-Abbey |title=The dean and 12 prebendaries were incorporated by the name of the dean and chapter of the collegiate church of St Peter, Westminster, by Queen Elizabeth, who also placed therein a school. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] with new statutes to select 40 Queen's Scholars from boys who had already attended the school for a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonancestor.com/leighs/chr-wests.htm |title=Westminster School in London |publisher=Londonancestor.com |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] Queen Elizabeth frequently visited her scholars, although she never signed the statutes nor endowed her scholarships, and 1560 is now generally taken as the date that the school was "founded", although legal separation from the Abbey was only achieved with the Public Schools Act 1868. There followed a scandalous public and parliamentary dispute over a further 25 years, to settle the transfer of the properties from the Canons of the Abbey to the School. Under the Act, the Dean of Westminster Abbey is ex officio the Chairman of the Governors; and school statutes have been made by Order in Council of Queen Elizabeth II. Furthermore the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford and the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge are ex officio members of the school's governing body.

Regardless of politics, he thrashed Royalist and Puritan boys alike without fear or favour. Busby also took part in Oliver Cromwell's funeral procession in 1658; when Robert Uvedale, a Westminster schoolboy, succeeded in snatching the "Majesty Scutcheon" (white satin banner) draped on the coffin[tpl]cite web|author=Denis Larionov & Alexander Zhulin |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/frances-parthenope-verney/memoirs-of-the-verney-family--volume-3-ala/page-28-memoirs-of-the-verney-family--volume-3-ala.shtml |title=The 'Majesty Scutcheon.' taken from Cromwell's bier. ebooksread.com electronic library |publisher=Ebooksread.com |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] (it was given to the School by his family two hundred years later). Busby remained in office throughout the Civil War and the Commonwealth, when the school was governed by Parliamentary Commissioners, and well into the Restoration.
In 1679, a group of scholars killed a bailiff, ostensibly in defence of the Abbey's traditional right of sanctuary, but possibly because the man was trying to arrest a consort of the boys. Dr Busby obtained a royal pardon for his scholars from Charles II, and added the cost to the school bills.
During the 16th century the school educated writers including Ben Jonson[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/jonson001.html |title=Ben Jonson: Biography |publisher=Theatrehistory.com |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] and Richard Hakluyt; in the seventeenth, the poet John Dryden, philosopher John Locke, scientist Robert Hooke, composer Henry Purcell and architect Christopher Wren were pupils; and in the 18th century, philosopher Jeremy Bentham and several Whig Prime Ministers and other statesmen; recent Old Westminsters include prominent politicians of all parties, and many members of the arts and media.
Until the 19th century, the curriculum was made up of Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, all taught Up School. The Westminster boys were uncontrolled outside school hours and notoriously unruly about town, but the proximity of the School to the Palace of Westminster meant that politicians were well aware of the boys' exploits. After the Public Schools Act 1868,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artabbey.htm |title=Westminster Abbey |publisher=London-footprints.co.uk |accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl] in response to the Clarendon Report on the financial and other malpractices at nine pre-eminent public schools, the school began to approach its modern form. Unusually among the leading public schools, however, Westminster did not adopt most of the broader changes associated with the Victorian ethos of Thomas Arnold, such as the emphasis on team over individual spirit, and the school retained much of its distinctive character. Despite many pressures, including evacuation and the destruction of the School roof during the Blitz, the school also refused to move out of central London along with other schools such as Charterhouse and St. Paul's, and remains in its original location.
Westminster Under School was formed in 1943[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westminsterunder.org.uk/about.html |title=Westminster Under School |publisher=Westminsterunder.org.uk |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] at the evacuated school, as a distinct preparatory school for day pupils between the ages of 8 to 13 (now 7 to 13). Only the separation is new: for example, in the 18th century, Edward Gibbon attended Westminster from the age of 11. The Under School has since moved to Vincent Square,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.educationuk.org/pls/hot_bc/bc_bd_school.page_pls_school_details?x=126739512409&y=0&a=0&b=&psch=1227&psrc=16254576&pseq=1&pinc=1000 |title=Innovative.

In 1967, the first female pupil was admitted to the Upper School, with girls becoming full members in all houses from 1973 onwards.[tpl]cite news |author=Rae, John |url= http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/3539666/tales-out-of-school.thtml |title=The Old Boys' Network |work=The Spectator |location=London |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] In 1981, a single-sex boarding house, Purcell's, was created again, for girls. In 1997 the school expanded further with the creation of a new day house, Milne's at 6a, Dean's Yard.
In 2005 the school was one of fifty leading private schools guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by The Times, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of customers.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece |title= Independent schools face huge fines over cartel to fix fees |newspaper=The Times |location= London |first= Tony |last= Halpin |date=10 November 2005[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article877567.ece |title= Parents may sue on school fee rise 'cartel' |newspaper=The Times |location= London |date=4 May 2003 |first= Jonathan |last= Calvert[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html |title= Private schools send papers to fee-fixing inquiry |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=15 March 2011[/tpl] However, each school agreed to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and ex-gratia payments totalling £3 million into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06 |title=OFT names further trustees as part of the independent schools settlement |publisher=Office of Fair Trading |date= 21 December 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511425/Why-did-OFT-take-a-pile-driver-to-crack-a-nut.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Why did OFT take a pile-driver to crack a nut? |first=John |last=Clare |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2005/nov/09/schools.uk |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Elite schools 'breached law' on fees |first=Donald |last=MacLeod |date=9 November 2005 |accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl]

In 2010, the school and Westminster Abbey hosted an event to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the granting of the institution's Royal Charter. Queen Elizabeth II, a guest of the occasion, unveiled a statue of her namesake in Dean's Yard. The Statue of The School's Foundress was created by sculptor and Old Westminster Matthew Spender.
In May 2013, the school was criticised for staging an auction involving the selling of internships to fund bursaries, resulting in adverse coverage in the press.Luke Hurst: Westminster School are Slapping You in the Face With a Big Wad of Cash. Huffington Post. Retrieved 13 August 2013.

==Notable buildings==

Westminster School, situated in the middle of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Westminster Abbey, St. Margaret's, and the Palace of Westminster, has several buildings notable for unique qualities, age, and history.
'College Hall', the 14th-century Abbot's state dining hall, is one of the oldest and finest examples of medieval refectory in existence, and is still in use for its original purpose every day in term-time; outside of term it reverts to the Dean, as the Abbot's successor.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Queen Elizabeth Woodville took sanctuary here in 1483 with 5 daughters and her son Richard, but failed to save him from his fate as one of the Princes in the Tower.

College dates from 1729, and was designed by the Earl of Burlington based on earlier designs from Sir Christopher Wren (himself an Old Westminster).
'School', originally built in the 1090s as the monks' dormitory, is the School's main hall, used for Latin Prayers (a weekly assembly with prayers in the Westminster-dialect of Latin),Westminster School Almanack, p. 13. exams, and large concerts, plays and the like. From 1599 it was used to teach all the pupils, the Upper and Lower Schools being separated by a curtain hung from a 16th-century pig iron bar, which remains the largest piece of pig iron in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] The stone steps and entranceway to School have been attributed to Inigo Jones, and are engraved with the names of many pupils who used to hire a stonemason for the purpose. The panelling "up School" is similarly, but officially, painted with the coats of arms of many former pupils. The original shell-shaped apse at the North end of School gave its name to the Shell forms taught there and the corresponding classes at many other public schools. The current shell displays a Latin epigram on the rebuilding of School, with the acrostic Semper Eadem, Elizabeth I's motto. The classroom door to the right of the Shell was recovered from the notorious Star Chamber at its demolition.

In 1721 when Ashburnham housed the King's and Cottonian libraries, which form the basis of the British Library,Cotton Manuscripts, British Library. there was a disastrous fire, and many of the books and manuscripts still show the marks. After the Public Schools Act 1868 there was a scandalous parliamentary and legal battle between the Abbey and the School, until the School eventually obtained Ashburnham under the Act for £4,000. In 1881 William Morris conducted a public campaign which succeeded in preventing its demolition but failed to save the neighbouring mediaeval buildings. During the Second World War, the library was used for military purposes, and the ground floor as an American officers' club.

A cook who failed to get the 'pancake' over the bar would formerly have been "booked", or stoned with Latin primers, although that tradition has long lapsed.Westminster School Pancake Greaze at Answers.com (with bibliography)[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B03E6DA1730E132A25751C0A9659C94689ED7CF&oref=slogin | title = One Pancake for Fifteen Boys | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2 March 1899 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B0DEFDD1739E433A25752C1A9619C946297D6CF | title = English Schoolboys: Recollections of Westminster | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 11 July 1903 [/tpl]
The privilege of being the first commoners to acclaim each new sovereign at their coronation in Westminster Abbey is reserved for the Queen's (or King's) Scholars. Their shouts of "Vivat Regina/Rex" ("Long Live the Queen/King") are incorporated into the Coronation Anthem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations/guide-to-the-coronation-service |title=Guide to the Coronation Service |publisher=Westminster Abbey |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl]
Despite the formal separation from the Abbey,"Westminster School, a public school with ancient and modern buildings nearby, was once the Abbey School."[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] the school remains Anglican, with services in the Abbey attended by the entire school at least twice a week, and many other voluntary-attendance services of worship. The school was expressly exempted by the Act of Uniformity to allow it to continue saying Latin prayers despite the Reformation. Every Wednesday there is an assembly Up School known as Latin Prayers, which opens with the Headmaster leading all members of the school in chanting prayers in Latin, followed by notices in English. The School's unique pronunciation of formal Latin is known as 'Westminster Latin', and descends from medieval English scholastic pronunciation: Queen Elizabeth I, who spoke fluent Latin, commanded that Latin was not to be said "in the monkish fashion", a significant warning upon loyalties between Church and State. A service called 'Little Commem' is given in Latin each year, in which the Queen's Scholars commemorate the school's benefactors, laying pink roses on the tomb of Elizabeth I in Westminster Abbey. In alternate years a much larger service called 'Big Commem' is given in its place, where the Praefectus (the Head Boy/Captain of the Queen's Scholars) lays a wreath of pink roses on the tomb of Elizabeth I. From 2010 "Big Commem" will occur in every other year.
Since the monastic Christmas revels of medieval times, Latin plays have been presented by the Scholars, with a prologue and witty epilogue on contemporary events. Annual plays, "either tragedy or comedy", were required by the school statutes in 1560, and some early plays were acted in College Hall before Elizabeth I and her whole Council. However, in a more prudish age Queen Victoria did not accompany Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales to the play, and recorded in her diary that it was "very Improper". Today, the play is put on less frequently, any members of the school may take part, and the Master of the Queen's Scholars gives the Latin prologue. The 1938 play caused a diplomatic incident with the German ambassador withdrawing offended by the words 'Magna Germania' figuring in extenso on a map of Europe displayed.
The Queen's Scholars have privileged access to the House of Commons gallery, said to be a compromise recorded in the Standing Orders of the House in the 19th century, to stop the boys from climbing into the Palace over the roofs.

==Entry==

There are four main points of entry for pupils:
As well as the Queen's Scholarships which pay one half of boarding fees, and of which there are normally eight in each year, there are Honorary Scholarships for boys who pass the Challenge and could have been scholars but do not want to board. Stephen Hawking was entered for the Challenge in 1952, but fell ill on the day of the Challenge examination.
Those entering the Lower School also have the opportunity to win scholarships based on musical talent, and bursaries for those whose parents are not able to fund their tuition. Ignoring scholarships and bursaries, annual fees are as follows:School Fees, Westminster School website

==Westminster jargon==

Westminster has an unusual system for naming the school years, which can cause confusion to those not familiar with the system.Westminster School | Studying at Westminster[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The Lower and Upper Shell years are named after the shell-shaped alcove up School where they were originally taught; the name has been adopted by several other schools with a Westminster connection.
The first term of the academic year, from September to December, is known as Play Term. This is the term in which the Latin Play used to take place (see Customs). The second term, from January to Easter is the Lent Term. The third term of the academic year, from April to July is the Election Term. This is the term in which new scholars are elected, formerly in place of those examined and elected to the universities.

===Other jargon and slang===

==Houses==

The school is split into 11 houses, some of which are 'day houses' (and only admit day-pupils, those who go home after school), the others having a mix of day-pupils and boarders. The houses are named after people connected to the house or school in various ways – mainly prominent Old Westminsters but also former Head Masters and House Masters. Other than College, Grant's is the oldest house, not only of Westminster but of any public school.
Houses are a focus for pastoral care and social and sporting activities, as well as accommodation for boarders. All the day houses are mixed-sex, and all houses admit girls; only Busby's, Liddell's and Purcell's provide boarding accommodation for girls – the remainder admit day girls only.Westminster School | Entry Levels | Entry at 7/8[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Each house has associated colours, which are worn on ties awarded for various (usually sporting) achievement while representing the house. There are also pink-striped ties awarded for achievement while representing the whole school, with the amount of pink denoting the level of achievement. Wren's and Milne's use slightly different colours on house ties from those seen on their shirt.
College, the House of the Queen's Scholars (all of whom board), has assigned to it some of the non-boarding girls who enter the School in the VIth form.

==Sport ("Station")==

The School has three Eton Fives courts, located behind Ashburnham House. The school frequently fields pupils as national entries in international competitions in rowing, or "Water", and fencing.
Westminster School Boat Club is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, located on the River Thames. The Oxford University Boat Club uses Westminster's boat house at Putney as its HQ for the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat race on the Thames. The boathouse was remodelled in 1997, and won a Wandsworth design award in 1999.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] The school's colour is pink; Westminster rowers raced Eton College for the right to wear pink.Prospectus, p. 20. "In 1837 there was a boat race against Eton in which each school chose their colours – Westminster chose pink which remains the school's colour to this day." The story goes that, at one annual Eton-Westminster rowing race, both crews arrived wearing pink, which was fashionable at the time. The Eton crew bought some light-blue ribbon (which later became the standard Eton colours) to differentiate themselves, but the Westminster crew won the race and the right to wear pink in perpetuity.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1204392/Why-real-macho-men-proud-wear-pink.html | title = Why real macho men are proud to wear pink | newspaper = Daily Mail | location = London | first = Harry | last = Mount | date = 5 August 2009 | quote =To this day, the strapping male rowing teams at Westminster School wear a fondant-fancy coloured kit; legend has it that they had to beat their arch-rivals Eton in a race in 1837 for the privilege of wearing the fashionable colour.

It is not large enough for all the pupils doing these sports to use simultaneously (the football pitches are made into cricket pitches for the summer). Therefore the school hires and owns other sporting facilities near the school. These include the oldest boating club in the world, an astroturf ground in Battersea, and a fencing centre. 'Green' (Dean's Yard) is also used, as are the 2 school gyms (one in the Abbey Cloisters and one in the Weston's school building) and the three Fives courts, as well as informal "yard cricket", "yard football" and "Scuba Football" played in Little Dean's Yard.
Westminster played in the first school cricket match against Charterhouse School in 1794The Earliest School Match and from 1796 played cricket against Eton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/314/314336.html |title=Eton College v Westminster 1796 |publisher=Cricket Archive |accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl]
Westminster has an historic joint claim to a major role in the development of Association Football,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame4.html |title=History of Football – The Global Growth |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] which remains the school's largest sport. During the 1840s at both Westminster and Charterhouse, pupils' surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/press/news/news/2006/june/world-cup-kicked-off-in-the-cloisters |title=World Cup kicked off in the Cloisters |publisher=Westminster Abbey |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as Rugby impossible, and necessitating a new code of rules. During the formulation of the rules of Association Football in the 1860s, representatives of Westminster School and Charterhouse also pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing ("passing on"). Other schools (in particular Eton College and Harrow) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. By 1867 the Football Association had chosen in favour of the Westminster and Charterhouse game and adopted an off-side rule that permitted forward passing.Marples, Morris. A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London 1954, page 150FIFA.com – Football Rules are brilliant![tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] The modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of Westminster and Charterhouse Football.
