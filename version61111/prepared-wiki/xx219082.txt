Krisalis Software Ltd. was a video game developer and publisher founded by Tony Kavanagh, Peter Harrap, and Shaun Hollingworth in 1987 under the name Teque Software. The company was restructured in April 2001 with a new management team of Tony Kavanagh, Tim James and Simeon Pashley and reused the original name of Teque Software development.
Overall, Krisalis software worked on over 60 different computer and console games before permanently closing on November 30, 2001. Their final game development was a port of The F.A. Premier League Stars 2001 for the Game Boy Color (released on June 8, 2001).

==History==

The Krisalis name was originally used as a subsidiary label (beginning in 1988) under Teque software until the official company name was changed to Krisalis Software Ltd. in 1991. Originally, the name was intended to be Chrysalis Software Ltd., but a dispute with record company Chrysalis Records resulted in a minor spelling change.
