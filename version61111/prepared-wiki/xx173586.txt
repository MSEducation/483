Page (Surrey cricketer) (first name, birth and death details unknown) refers to a noted professional cricketer in the 18th century who was chiefly associated with Surrey in the 1760s and early 1770s.  
Most of his career took place before cricket's statistical record began with regular scorecards in 1772 and he is recorded in only three major cricket matches.  He is known to have been playing in 1768 when his name appeared in the lists for the Surrey v Hampshire match.  He played for All-England v Hampshire in 1772 but scored only 0 and 3.  His last known appearance was for Surrey v Kent in 1773 when he scored 2 and 1 and took 1 catch.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862
