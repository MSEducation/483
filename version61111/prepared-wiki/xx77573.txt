[[Locomotor ataxia]]

CATEGORIES: Neurodegenerative disorders

Locomotor ataxia is the inability to precisely control one's own bodily movements. Persons afflicted with this disease may walk in a jerky, nonfluid manner. They will not know where their arms and legs are without looking, but can, for instance, feel and locate a hot object placed against their feet. It is often a symptom of tabes dorsalis, which is a key finding in tertiary syphilis.
It is caused by degeneration of the posterior (dorsal) white column of the spinal cord.
