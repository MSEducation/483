The band has expressed that the process of writing the music and lyrics to this album has been different from doing so for albums past.Hawthorne Heights Bio at Amazon Woodruff states: "We had the luxury of time to sit around and think about what we wanted to do, which helped us create something new." Bucciarelli adds: "We wrote more songs for this album than ever before. We wrote over 30, then whittled them down to the absolute best ones. We took parts from some and added them to others and made a Frankenstein out of them. We were always writing, re-writing, arranging and re-arranging. Howard Benson really pushed us in the song writing department to go against what we’ve done in the past." The final track listing for the album was publicly announced on February 5, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawthorneheights.com |title=Hawthorne Heights |publisher=Hawthorne Heights |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04[/tpl] Skeletons was released on June 1, 2010.

==Reviews and reception==

Skeletons has received generally positive reviews. A review on the AbsolutePunk website has stated that the album brings out "JT Woodruff’s best vocal performance yet," and is full of "killer choruses."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1726262 |title=Hawthorne Heights - Skeletons - Album Review |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl]
In an early review of the album, RoomThirteen.com gave the album a 12 out of 13 rating. They stated "For those who fell in love with Hawthorne Heights six years ago, ‘Skeletons’ will merely reaffirm their passion for a band that has survived so much in such a short time. For those who have yet to truly listen to the band, this is an album that will alter your perceptions."[tpl]cite web|url=http://roomthirteen.com/cd_reviews/10834/Hawthorne_Heights__Skeletons.htmlho |title=Hawthorne Heights - Skeletons - RoomThirteen - Online Rock Metal Alternative Music Magazine - Reviews Interviews News Tours |publisher=RoomThirteen |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl]
Skeletons stylistically reverts to "music similar to their first two albums",[tpl]cite web|author=Abstract by Ivan Mitchell |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/hawthorne-heights/skeletons/38929/ |title=Album Review: Hawthorne Heights - Skeletons | Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl] although it has substantially less unclean vocals. The album "refuses to stomp over old ground" by incorporating "electro" and "pop punk" elements into a few of the tracks. Other reviewers, though, criticize the album by calling it "safe", and saying that it doesn't take any "deviations from the beaten path."[tpl]cite web|author=Pernell Fowler |url=http://www.bringonmixedreviews.com/?p=6127 |title=Hawthorne Heights - Skeletons - Review | So, Bring On Mixed Reviews |publisher=Bringonmixedreviews.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl]

==2009 Never Sleep Again tour==

On October 14, an e-mail about a nationwide 2009 tour was sent out to the Hawthorne Heights official mailing list. The e-mail stated:

Not all of the bands mentioned ended up joining Hawthorne Heights for the 2009 Never Sleep Again tour. Anarbor declined the offer in order to focus on the recording of their debut album The Words You Don't Swallow. Likewise, Punchline declined and was replaced with The Story Changes, a rock band that formed in Dayton, Ohio, the same city Hawthorne Heights originated in.
Fans had a chance to hear two songs from the upcoming album during this tour, however. As promised, download cards for the song "Unforgivable" were distributed while on tour. In addition, "End of the Underground," which was originally going to be included as a track on the band's previous album, was performed live.OkGazette.com tour info[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] On Skeletons, "Unforgivable" became track number 12, and "End of the Underground" became track number 3.

==Album title==

The album's title is not taken from any of the tracks' titles, or even lyrical content on the album (although "End of the Underground" does make lyrical references to skeletons); instead, JT Woodruff explained:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/hawthorneskeletons.htm |title=Alternative Press | News |publisher=Altpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl][tpl]cquote|This album sounds like us, but we were able to grow our sound. We took it down to the essentials, the skeleton of who we are as a band. We then tried on some new skins, and added the flesh and blood. We're just excited to play these new songs and see how people react to them.[/tpl]Thus, the album was given the name Skeletons.
