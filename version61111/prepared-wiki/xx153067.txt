==Career==

Seth started her career as a guest relation executive at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Bombay. According to her, her entry into the world of modeling happened by chance. A 'couple of people' had asked her if she’d like to model and, at that time, it just 'meant extra pocket money'. Over the span of her career as a model she did several commercials including Clean and Clear moisturiser, TATA Home Finance, Ponds Talc, Frooti, Lifebuoy Soap, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, LG, Airtel, Mrs. Marino Hair Softener, Stayfree Secure, Dominos etc.
Eventually, she moved to television. At the start of her career in modeling and television, Seth said that “fate was pushing me in that direction and I just followed the course.” She also said that it was her stint on Channel V “that firmly put me on the map.”[tpl]cite news|title=The TRP game is skewed: Shruti Seth |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/The-TRP-game-is-skewed-Shruti-Seth/articleshow/5825488.cms |publisher=Times of India|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=18 April 2010[/tpl]
For Channel V, India she hosted First day First show and Junglee Jukebox. She acted in many serials such as Kyun Hota Hai Pyarrr, Des Mein Niklla Hoga Chand and Shararat (sitcom) with actress Farida Jalal. She is also seen in Rishta.com on Sony Entertainment Television. On Rishta.com, she said in an interview that, "They (the Yash Raj serials) haven’t got any TRPs at all. But it’s not for the people who are watching TV in the first place. The whole TRP game is very skewed. I don’t believe that in a population of over a billion people, 15,000 households decide what the entire country wants to watch. This lot of Yash Raj was conceptualised for those who are not watching TV". She further said in the same interview that "All our loyal audience for my serial on TV is in London, America, South Africa, Australia. It’s not that the Indians will not like it, it’s just sad that they are not aware of it, because the publicity has been disappointing. She has also hosted several seasons of Comedy Circus on Sony Channel."

==Film career==

She has starred in a few films. On moving from television to films, she stated that, “I haven’t really moved on to anything. It’s not that I would not do TV and only do films. Yes, more avenues have started opening for me. I am game for doing something exciting on any medium – stage, celluloid or TV". She is probably best known for her role as Fatima "Fatty" in Fanaa (2006) with Aamir Khan and Kajol. She starred in Tara Rum Pum, produced by Yash Raj Films and made an appearance in Prakash Jha's film Raajneeti in 2010. On her role in Rajneeti, she said in an interview that "I am hoping that my hard-hitting role in Rajneeti will change my being typecast, because it is the most unlikely character one would expect me to play".

==My Company==

She is an Indian entrepreneur running a company named "My Company" which provides event, marketing and promotional ideas and solutions to build business, expand clientele, generate revenue and create awareness
