420, 4:20, or 4/20  (pronounced four-twenty) is a code-term that refers to the consumption of  cannabis and by extension, as a way to identify oneself with cannabis subculture or simply cannabis itself. Observances based on the number 420 include smoking cannabis around the time 4:20 p.m. (with some sources also indicating 4:20 a.m.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/How_420_became_a_marijuana_holiday.html|title=How 420 became a marijuana holiday|last=Chris Goldstein|date=April 17, 2013|work=Philadelphia Media Network|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl]http://hightimes.com/read/power-420) on any given day, as well as smoking and celebrating cannabis on the date April 20 (4/20 in U.S. form).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/April/24/local/stories/08local.htm  |title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark cannabis holiday |first=Matt |last=King |date=April 24, 2007 |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070426081319/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/April/24/local/stories/08local.htm |archivedate = April 26, 2007[/tpl]

Soon, cannabis aficionados were using "420" as a code for smoking and using it as a sign-off on flyers for concerts where the drug would be plentiful. In recent years, the April 20 events have become so widespread that several colleges have discouraged students from participating. At the University of Colorado, Boulder, where thousands of students regularly use the day to light up in the quad, administrators sent an e-mail message this month pleading with students not to "participate in unlawful activity that debases the reputation of your university and degree."|work=The New York Times|date=April 19, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110120011019/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/us/20marijuana.html| archivedate= 20 January 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=High Times|title=The Official High Times Cannabis Cookbook: More Than 50 Irresistible Recipes That Will Get You High|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W-vas6K75YYC&pg=PA97|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=21 March 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-0133-0|pages=97–[/tpl] began using the term in connection with a plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop that they had learned about in autumn 1971.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/20/420-meaning-the-true-stor_n_543854.html|title=420 Meaning: The True Story Of How April 20 Became 'Weed Day'|work=The Huffington Post|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=January 23, 2011|first=Ryan|last=Grim|authorlink=Ryan Grim[/tpl] Although their typical "hang-out spot was a wall outside the school," the Waldos designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 p.m. as their meeting time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/20/what-420-means-the-true-s_n_188320.html|title=What 420 Means: The True Story Behind Stoners' Favorite Number|work=The Huffington Post|date=April 20, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2011|first=Ryan|last=Grim|authorlink=Ryan Grim[/tpl] The Waldos referred to this initial plan with the phrase "4:20 Louis", but after multiple attempts to find the crop failed, the phrase evolved in form and use—shortened simply to "4:20", the teens increasingly relied on the codeword to refer to pot-smoking in general.
