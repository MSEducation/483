==History==

Chen Yuanyuan was born to a peasant family, and on the death of her father, she became a courtesan. Due to her beauty and singing ability, she became a lead figure in opera in Suzhou.[tpl]cite book|title=Biographical dictionary of Chinese women|year=1998|publisher=East Gate|isbn=0-7656-0043-9|pages=21–26|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uwPWtJ5WSQMC&pg=PA25&dq=%22Chen+Yuanyuan%22#v=onepage&q=%22Chen%20Yuanyuan%22&f=false[/tpl] Fearing for her life due to an abduction attempt, she became the concubine of Mao Xiang.
In 1642, Chen was abducted by the Tian Hongyu family where she became the singing courtesan. She then moved into the possession of Wu Sangui, though how is unclear - she may have been purchased by Wu's father or given as a gift by Tian.
In April 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng.  Chongzhen gathered the entire imperial household and ordered them, except for his sons, to commit suicide. The Empress hanged herself.  Princess Changping refused.  In a fit of rage Chongzhen had her left arm cut off. He then fled to nearby Jingshan Park(景山公園), where he hanged himself on the famous Guilty Chinese Scholartree (罪槐). Chen Yuanyuan reluctantly assisted by helping him up to the noose, according to some accounts.
Li established what he called the Shun Dynasty, but it fell to the Manchus at the end of May.  Seizing their chance, the Manchus crossed the Great Wall after Wu Sangui opened the gates at Shanhai Pass.  They quickly overthrew Li, who fled the Forbidden City.
After he defeated remnant forces consisting of Ming loyalists in southwestern China, Wu was rewarded with the title of Pingxi Wang (平西王; translated as "Prince Who Pacifies the West" or "King Who Pacifies the West") with a fief in Yunnan by the Qing imperial court. Wu took Chen Yuanyuan with him to Kunming.
Wu Sangui later died during a rebellion against the Qing, and his successor Wu Shifan committed suicide after being besieged by the Qing army, Wu Shifan's wife and Chen committed suicide together.
