[[Dale Nixon]]

Dale Nixon is a pseudonym originally used by Greg Ginn of Black Flag to obfuscate the fact that he played bass on the Black Flag album, My War.  It has since been used by other artists (typically punk in origin), usually to appear on albums without being in breach of record label contracts that stipulate label exclusivity.
