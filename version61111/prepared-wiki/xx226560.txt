==Special Geology==

Peters Mountain is unique compared to surrounding mountains. In it's area, it is one of the only mountains that contains limestone. Limestone ,calcium carbonate, is a special type of mineral that neutralizes many harmful substances. these harmful substances may include sulfur or carbonic acid. Water elsewhere may contain these harmful substances. However the water in Monroe County West Virginia dose not contain any of these. The limestone in peters mountain is also very good for water storage. In all the mountain contains roughly 250 square miles of pure stored water. This fresh water can than come out as mountain spring water or can be pumped out to every house in the area.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
