Henry de Motlowe (died 1361) was an English-born judge who briefly held  office as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.Ball, F. Elrington  The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol.1 p.79
Hw was born in Cheshire to a family which had links with Nether Alderley. The surname may also suggest a connection with Mobberley, which was called Motburlege in the Domesday Book. He owned lands at Church Lawton: in 1338 Ralph de Lawton gave a quitclaim for all lands held there by Henry and his heirs.
He was a senior Crown official by 1346, when he appears on a commission in London to investigate the forgery of the Royal seal.Ball p.79 In the same year he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but seems to have spent no more than a few months in office, since he was replaced in the same year by John de Rednesse, and is shortly afterwards heard of as member of a Commission of Oyer and Terminer in Derbyshire.Ball p.79
In 1357 he was made a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (England) and in the same year sat on another commission,  to investigate an alleged affray  between a servant of John Gynwell, Bishop of Lincoln and members of the Order of Hospitallers. Ironically the  Prior of the Hospitallers, Richard de Wirkeley, who allegedly instigated the affray, had also been Lord Chief Justice of Ireland: the commission included yet another Irish Chief Justice, William de Notton.Calendar of Patent Rolls of Edward III May 9, 1357
Motlowe died in 1361.Ball p.79
