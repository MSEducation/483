City Tower, (formerly the Sunley Building) is a 30-storey skyscraper situated at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, England. It has the highest office space currently available in Manchester standing 107 metres (351 ft) tall. City Tower was completed in 1965, the Plaza complex was constructed by the developers Bernard Sunley and designed by Covell, Matthews & Partners. It is currently the third tallest building in Manchester. The Tower has retail units on the ground and is Manchester's main radio transmitting station located on the roof.

==Background==

The tower has entrances on York Street (renamed New York Street in 2008) and Piccadilly Gardens. Over the years, the tower became increasingly run down and  many tenants left.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] A refurbishment programme was drawn up in the late 1990s, but this was never realised until property company Bruntwood purchased Piccadilly Plaza for £65 million in 2004.  This plan is complete, with a new central ground floor entrance. The next phase involved repainting and fitting an atrium to the sides of the tower. An advertising screen has been erected showing full motion video clips to passers by in the gardens.
The tower is one of Manchester's main broadcast transmission sites, hosting the antennas of local radio stations XFM, Rock Radio, Capital on FM and digital radio multiplexes Digital One, BBC, MXR North West and CE Manchester.
The penthouse (floor 28) is different to the other floors as it originally had a walkway around the perimeter. When Bruntwood acquired City Tower they removed the walkway and installed wider windows. The redesign included an overhang with floor to ceiling windows.
Although City Tower is not the highest building in the city, the 28th floor is the highest commercial office space in Manchester and is occupied by UKFast[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2008/11/17/171108_online_sales_feature.shtml  | title=BBC | publisher= BBC Highest office space in Manchester[/tpl][tpl]-[/tpl]
