[[Juno Awards of 1994]]

CATEGORIES: Juno Awards by year, 1994 music awards, 1994 in Canadian music

The Juno Awards of 1994, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 20 March 1994 in Toronto at a ceremony in the O'Keefe Centre. Roch Voisine was the host for the ceremonies, which were taped that afternoon for broadcast that evening on CBC Television.
Nominations were announced 8 February 1994. Starting in 1994, the Best New Solo Artist combined the former Most Promising Male and Female Vocalist categories. Reggae also received its own category, after years of being included under banners such as "world beat" or mixed with calypso.
A new category for aboriginal music was also introduced and was awarded by Robbie Robertson. Nominee Sazacha Red Sky generated controversy over her recording of a prayer song her adopted brother Leonard George claimed was used by the family of Chief Dan George. Leonard objected to the song's recording by Red Sky aka Nancy Nash on the Peter Gzowski radio show.Red Sky is a former Vancouver resident who is many ancestries including First Nations. She is adopted into four First Nations families including Salish, Haida, Okanagan and Cherokee. Juno regulations for the aboriginal category required that the music, rather than the artists, be of native content or origin. Grand Chief Slaholt also brother to Dan George confirmed the song Red Sky recorded was not from his nation or a song of his brothers. This origin of this song is Tibetan and since 1995 was listed with Socan as Public Domain.
Around the time of the 1994 ceremonies, there were plans to host the 1995 ceremonies in Winnipeg. However, Juno organisers CARAS was demanding substantial funding from the Winnipeg committee attempting to host the awards.
Atlantic group The Rankin Family was the major winner in 1994, winning awards in four categories including Entertainer of the Year.
