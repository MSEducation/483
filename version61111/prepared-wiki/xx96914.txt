Burj Khalifa ([tpl]lang-ar|برج خليفة[/tpl], "Khalifa Tower"), known as Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and is the tallest man-made structure in the world, at [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Construction began on 21 September 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010,[tpl]cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/property/uae/official-opening-of-iconic-burj-dubai-announced-1.523471|title=Official Opening of Iconic Burj Dubai Announced|publisher=Gulfnews|date=4 November 2009|accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8439618.stm|title=World's tallest building opens in Dubai |date=4 January 2010|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl] and is part of the new [tpl]convert|2|km2|acre|-1|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] development called Downtown Dubai at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district.
The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.emaar.com/index.aspx?page=press-release-details&id=361|title=Burj Dubai reaches a record high|publisher=Emaar Properties|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=24 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=1006&articleID=385534|title=Adrian Smith Leaves SOM, Longtime Skidmore partner bucks retirement to start new firm|last=Keegan|first=Edward|publisher=ArchitectOnline|date=15 October 2006|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl] The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=7787|title=Burj Dubai, Dubai – SkyscraperPage.com|publisher=SkyscraperPage|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl]

==Conception==

Burj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), [tpl]convert|3|ha|acre|1[/tpl] of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the [tpl]convert|12|ha|acre|adj=on[/tpl] man-made Burj Khalifa Lake.
The decision to build Burj Khalifa is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in the city to garner more international recognition, and hence investment.  "He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational," said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/13/world/fg-dubai13|title=In Dubai, the Sky's No Limit|last=Stack|first=Megan|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=26 March 2006[/tpl]

==Height==

===Records===

===History of height increases===

There are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the [tpl]convert|560|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM).[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/26/1046064104215.html|title= Grollo tower to go ahead, in Dubai|publisher=The Age |location=Australia|first=Paul|last=Robinson|date=27 February 2003|accessdate=6 January 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Marshall Strabala, an SOM architect who worked on the project until 2006, in late 2008 said that Burj Khalifa was designed to be [tpl]convert|808|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/540205-secret-of-burj-dubai-height-revealed|title=Architect reveals Burj Dubai height|publisher=Arabian Business|date=3 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2008[/tpl]
The design architect, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase it to the current height.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] It has been explicitly stated that this change did not include any added floors, which is fitting with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender.[tpl]PDFlink|Cityscape Daily News[tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl]|264 KB[/tpl] Cityscape, 18 September 2005.

===Delay===

Emaar Properties announced on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was delayed by upgraded finishes and would be completed only in September 2009. An Emaar spokesperson said "The luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was initially conceptualized, is now being replaced by upgraded finishes. The design of the apartments has also been enhanced to make them more aesthetically attractive and functionally superior."[tpl]cite news|url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/08/06/09/10219878.html|title=Burj Dubai completion delayed by another eight to nine months|last=Das Augustine|first=Babu|publisher=Gulf News|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=21 June 2008[/tpl] A revised completion date of 2 December 2009 was then announced.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.homesoverseas.co.uk/news/Burj_Dubai_opening_date_announced/12072-1002|title=Burj Dubai opening date announced|publisher=Homes Overseas|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=1 August 2009[/tpl] However, Burj Khalifa was opened on 4 January 2010, more than a month later.

==Architecture and design==

The tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the new One World Trade Center in New York City. The Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-9180-top-10-worlds-tallest-steel-buildings/1/print/ |title=Top 10 world's tallest steel buildings |publisher=Constructionweekonline.com |accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allaboutskyscrapers.com/property/burj-khalifa-2 |title=Burj Khalifa |publisher=AllAboutSkyscrapers.com |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl] Proportionally, the design uses half the amount of steel used in the construction of the Empire State Building thanks to the tubular system.[tpl]cite news|last=Bayley|first=Stephen|title=Burj Dubai: The new pinnacle of vanity|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/6934603/Burj-Dubai-The-new-pinnacle-of-vanity.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=5 January 2010|location=London[/tpl] Its design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile high skyscraper designed for Chicago. According to Marshall Strabala, a SOM architect who worked on the building's design team, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73 floor Tower Palace Three, an all residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.
Subsequent to the original design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hyderconsulting.com/EN/AboutUs/News/Pages/content.aspx?pageID=83 |title=Burj Dubai becomes tallest manmade structure |publisher=Hyder Consulting |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] Hyder was selected for its expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hyderconsulting.com/EN/AboutUs/News/Pages/content.aspx?pageID=190 |title=Hyder reinforces its reputation for unrivaled engineering ability with the opening of the Burj Khalifa – the world's tallest building |publisher=Hyder Consulting |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify SOM's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities. NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the Office Annex Building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ghd.com.au/aptrixpublishing.nsf/Content/BurjDubaiTower_prj |title=GHD is playing a vital role in managing the long term structural integrity of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Dubai Tower. |publisher=GHD|accessdate=11 April 2009[/tpl] an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.
The design of Burj Khalifa is derived from patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture. According to the structural engineer, Bill Baker of SOM, the building's design incorporates cultural and historical elements particular to the region such as the spiral minaret. The spiral minaret spirals and grows slender as it rises.  The Y-shaped plan is ideal for residential and hotel usage, with the wings allowing maximum outward views and inward natural light.  As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiralling pattern, decreasing the cross section of the tower as it reaches toward the sky and creating convenient outdoor terraces.  At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire.  At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of [tpl]convert|1.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/housing-property/burj-dubai-is-the-height-of-success-1.55605|title= Burj Dubai is the height of success|last=Saberi|first=Mahmood|date=19 April 2008|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=31 December 2009[/tpl]
As part of a study which reveals the unnecessary "vanity space" added to the top of the world's tallest buildings by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, it was revealed that without its 244-metre spire, the 828-metre Burj Khalifa would drop to a substantially smaller 585-metre height without any reduction in usable space. As the report states, the spire "could be a skyscraper on its own".
To support the unprecedented height of the building, the engineers developed a new structural system called the buttressed core, which consists of a hexagonal core reinforced by three buttresses that form the ‘Y' shape. This structural system enables the building to support itself laterally and keeps it from twisting.
The spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than [tpl]convert|4000|t|ST LT[/tpl] of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighing [tpl]convert|350|t|ST LT[/tpl] was constructed from inside the building and jacked to its full height of over [tpl]convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] using a strand jack system. The spire also houses communications equipment.
In 2009, architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa, featuring 196 bronze and brass alloy cymbals representing the 196 countries of the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/burj_dubai_pr_20090528|title=Skidmore, Owings & Merrill Leads Process for Art Program at Burj Dubai|date=28 May 2009[/tpl] It was planned that the visitors in this lobby would be able to hear a distinct timbre as the cymbals, plated with 18-carat gold, are struck by dripping water, intended to mimic the sound of water falling on leaves.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/news/special-reports/burj-dubai-will-officially-open-for-the-uae-national-day-12755|title=Burj Dubai will officially open for the UAE National Day|date=29 July 2009|publisher=Dubai Chronicle|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa consists of [tpl]convert|142000|m2|sqft|-3|abbr=on[/tpl] of reflective glazing, and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins. The cladding system is designed to withstand Dubai's extreme summer temperatures.
Additionally, the exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6 °C (11 °F) cooler than at its base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/wea00/wea00131.htm |title=Temperature and Elevation |publisher=United States Department of Energy |date=21 May 2002 |accessdate=11 April 2009[/tpl] Over 26,000 glass panels were used in the exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa. Over 300 cladding specialists from China were brought in for the cladding work on the tower.
A 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotelmanagement-network.com/projects/Armani/ |title=Armani Hotel Burj Dubai, United Arab Emirates |publisher=hotelmanagement-network.com |accessdate=11 April 2009[/tpl] The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eyeofdubai.com/v1/news/newsdetail-37992.htm |title=Worlds first Armani Hotel to open on 18 March 2010 in Dubai |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=EyeOfDubai.com |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/577810-burj-dubais-armani-hotel-to-open-on-mar-18 |title=Burj Dubai's Armani hotel to open on Mar 18 |last=Sambidge |first=Andy |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=Arabian Business |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=174074 |title=Armani hotel opens in Dubai's Khalifa tower |date=27 April 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=27 April 2010[/tpl] The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eyeofdubai.com/v1/news/newsdetail-37982.htm |title=Burj Dubai: Fact Sheet |publisher=Eyeofdubai.com |accessdate=11 May 2010[/tpl] yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.
The sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/burj-dubai-to-welcome-residents-in-feb-2010/82037/on|title=Burj Dubai to welcome residents in Feb 2010|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] Floors through to 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for a 122nd, 123rd and 124th floor where the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck is located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents from February 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dubaicityguide.com/site/news/news-details.asp?newsid=27511|title=Burj Dubai To Welcome First Residents From February 2010 Onwards|date=31 December 2009|publisher=DubaiCityGuide|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
A total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators are installed.

===Plumbing systems===

The Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of [tpl]convert|946000|liters|gal|abbr=on[/tpl] of water per day through [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of pipes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2437 |title=Escaping the Dubai Downturn: Voltas’s Latest Engineering Feat |date=20 April 2010 |publisher=Wharton, University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=21 May 2011[/tpl]  An additional [tpl]convert|213|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of piping serves the fire emergency system, and [tpl]convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system. The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.[tpl]cite conference |url=http://repository.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/4529/ESL-HH-06-07-19.pdf |title=Mechanical and Electrical Systems for the Tallest Building/Man-Made Structure in the World: A Burj Dubai Case Study |author=Frechette, Leung & Boyer |date=24–26 July 2006 |conference=Fifteenth Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates |location=Orlando, Florida |format=pdf |accessdate=15 July 2013 |page=7[/tpl]

===Air conditioning===

The air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timeoutdubai.com/knowledge/features/12706-khalifa-creators |title=Air Conditioning in Burj Khalifa |publisher=Timeoutdubai.com |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl]  At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is equivalent to that provided by [tpl]convert|13000|t|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] of melting ice in one day. The condensate collection system, which uses the hot and humid outside air, combined with the cooling requirements of the building, results in a significant amount of condensation of moisture from the air. The condensed water is collected and drained into a holding tank located in the basement car park; this water is then pumped into the site irrigation system for use on the Burj Khalifa park.

===Window cleaning===

To wash the 24,348 windows, totaling [tpl]convert|120000|m2|ft2|-4|abbr=on[/tpl] of glass, a horizontal track has been installed on the exterior of Burj Khalifa at levels 40, 73, and 109. Each track holds a [tpl]convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] bucket machine which moves horizontally and then vertically using heavy cables. Above level 109, up to tier 27 traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the spire, however, is reserved for specialist window cleaners, who brave the heights and high winds, dangling on ropes to clean and inspect the top of the pinnacle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/a-tall-order-burj-dubai-all-set-to-come-clean-1.546504|title=A tall order: Burj Dubai all set to come clean|date=25 August 2009|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=7 December 2009[/tpl] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units will be operational, it will take 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior façade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.burjdubai.com/the-tower/structure.aspx|title=Structural Elements – Elevator, Spire, and More|publisher=BurjDubai.com|accessdate=31 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/so-you-think-your-windows-are-hard-to-keep-clean-20100104-lq5x.html|title=So you think your windows are hard to keep clean?|last=Dobbin|first=Marika|date=5 January 2010|publisher=The Age |location=Australia|accessdate=6 January 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

Burj Khalifa is surrounded by an [tpl]convert|11|ha|acre|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] park designed by landscape architects SWA Group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emaar.com/index.aspx?page=press-release-details&id=994 |title=An 11-hectare green oasis envelops the foot of Burj Dubai |date=20 December 2009 |publisher=Emaar Properties |accessdate=20 March 2010[/tpl] The design of the park is also inspired by the core design concepts of Burj Khalifa which is based on the symmetries of the desert flower, Hymenocallis.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.burjdubai.com/news-media/11-hectare_green_oasis.aspx|title=An 11-hectare green oasis envelops the foot of Burj Dubai|date=20 December 2009|publisher=BurjDubai.com|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] The park has six water features, gardens, palm lined walkways, and flowering trees.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/576615-11-hectare-park-unveiled-at-burj-dubai-site|title=11-hectare park unveiled at Burj Dubai site|last=Baxter|first=Elsa|date=20 December 2009|publisher=Arabian Business|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] At the centre of the park and the base of Burj Khalifa is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. In addition the railing, benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower.
The plants and the shrubbery will be watered by the buildings's condensation collection system that uses water from the cooling system. The system will provide [tpl]convert|68000000|L|impgal|abbr=on[/tpl] annually. WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.emaar.com/index.aspx?page=press-release-details&id=970|title=An 11-hectare green oasis envelops the foot of Burj Dubai|date=20 December 2009|publisher=Emaar Properties|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]

==Construction==

The tower was constructed by Samsung Engineering & Construction of South Korea, which also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secc.co.kr/e_secc/introduction/history.html|title=Samsung E&C Projects|publisher=Samsung Engineering & Construction|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Samsung Engineering & Construction built the tower in a joint venture with Besix from Belgium and Arabtec from UAE. Turner is the Project Manager on the main construction contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.turnerconstruction.com/international/content.asp?d=3457&p=2372|title=Turner International Projects – Burj Dubai|publisher=Turner Construction|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl]
Under UAE law, the Contractor and the Engineer of Record, Hyder Consulting, is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.
The primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project. Over [tpl]convert|45000|m3|cuyd|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] of concrete, weighing more than [tpl]convert|110000|t|ST LT|lk=on[/tpl] were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre diameter x 43 m long, buried more than [tpl]convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] deep. Burj Khalifa's construction used [tpl]convert|330000|m3|cuyd|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] of concrete and [tpl]convert|55000|t|ST LT[/tpl] of steel rebar, and construction took 22 million man-hours.  A high density, low permeability concrete was used in the foundations of Burj Khalifa. A cathodic protection system under the mat is used to minimize any detrimental effects from corrosive chemicals in local ground water.  In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete to a then world record delivery height of [tpl]convert|606|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load.[tpl]cite news|last=Croucher |first=Martin |title=Myth of ‘Babu Sassi’ Remains After Burj Cranes Come Down |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2009/November/theuae_November338.xml&section=theuae&col= |accessdate=3 June 2011 |newspaper=Khaleej Times |date=11 November 2009[/tpl] The remaining structure above is constructed of lighter steel.
Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors are located approximately every 35 floors where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.building.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3123781|title=Burj Dubai: Top of the world|last=Puckett|first=Katie|date=3 October 2008|publisher=Building|accessdate=31 December 2009[/tpl]
Special mixes of concrete are made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete used was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for SOM, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctlgroup.com/ClientsAndProjects/Project/Detail/220 |title=Clients & Projects – Burj Khalifa, the Tallest Building in the World |publisher=CTLGroup |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl]
The consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach [tpl]convert|50|C|F|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air is cooler and the humidity is higher. A cooler concrete mixture cures evenly throughout and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.
The unique design and engineering challenges of building Burj Khalifa have been featured in a number of television documentaries, including the Big, Bigger, Biggest series on the National Geographic and Five channels, and the Mega Builders series on the Discovery Channel.

===Milestones===

===Real estate values===

In March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m²) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m²).[tpl]cite news|url=http://zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20080305042540|title=Burj Dubai offices to top US$4,000 per sq ft|publisher=Zawya|date=5 March 2008|accessdate=23 March 2009[/tpl] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5 billion.
The project's completion coincided with the global financial crisis of 2007–2012, and with vast overbuilding in the country; this led to high vacancies and foreclosures.[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/01/the-burj-dubai-and-architectures-vacant-stare.html|title=The Burj Dubai and architecture's vacant stare|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 January 2010 | date=1 January 2010| author=Christopher Hawthorne[/tpl] With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703580904574638111667658806.html|title=World's Tallest Skyscraper Opens in Dubai |last=Bianchi|first= Stefania|author2=Andrew Critchlow|date=4 January 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc|accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://business.maktoob.com/20090000414838/Burj_Dubai_renamed_Burj_Khalifa_/Article.htm |title=828-metre Burj Dubai renamed Burj Khalifa |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=Maktoob Group |accessdate=10 February 2010[/tpl]
Because of the slumping demand in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/burj-khalifa-rents-tumble-40|title=Burj Khalifa rents tumble 40%|publisher=The National|first=Brad|last=Reagan|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=6 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/armani-residences-defy-70-burj-khalifa-price-drop-357451.html|title=Armani Residences defy 70% Burj Khalifa price drop|publisher=Arabian Business|first=Shane|last=McGinley|date=21 October 2010|accessdate=6 November 2010[/tpl] However, over the next two and a half years, overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space in Burj Khalifa.[tpl]cite web|title=Offices stand empty in tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18929271 |date=21 July 2012 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl] By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.[tpl]cite web|title=Emaar Reports 80% Occupancy Levels In Burj Khalifa|url=http://www.reidin.com/news/showNews/ae_reidin-reidinmediawatch-20120706-1/emaar-reports-80-occupancy-levels-in-burj-khalifa.html|publisher=REIDIN.com|accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl]

===Official launch ceremony===

The opening of Burj Khalifa was held on 4 January 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0105/World-s-tallest-building-What-s-it-worth-to-have-the-Dubai-tower-and-what-should-people-call-it|title=World's tallest building: What's it worth to have the Dubai tower – and what should people call it?|last=Huang|first=Carol|date=5 January 2010|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.arabianbusiness.com/577720-burj-dubai-ceremony-details-revealed|title=Burj Dubai ceremony details revealed|first=Andy|last=Sambidge|publisher=Arabian Business|date=3 January 201|accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl] The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major.[tpl]cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article7034748.ece|title=Designer's light touches far and wide|last=Devine|first=Rachel|date=21 February 2010|publisher=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 November 2010[/tpl] Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the façade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of the other effects.
The event began with a short film which depicted the story of Dubai and the evolution of Burj Khalifa. The displays of sound, light, water and fireworks followed. The portion of the show consisting of the various pyrotechnic, lighting, water and sound effects was divided into three. The first part was primarily a light and sound show, which took as its theme the link between desert flowers and the new tower, and was co-ordinated with the Dubai Fountain and pyrotechnics. The second portion, called 'Heart Beat', represented the construction of the tower in a dynamic light show with the help of 300 projectors which generated a shadow-like image of the tower. In the third act, sky tracers and space cannons enveloped the tower in a halo of white light, which expanded as the lighting rig on the spire activated.
The ceremony was relayed live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island, as well as several television screens placed across the Downtown Dubai development. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene. In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.[tpl]cite news|url=http://business.maktoob.com/20090000413858/Two_billion_to_watch_Burj_Dubai_opening/Article.htm|title=Two billion to watch Burj Dubai opening|publisher=Maktoob Business|date=3 January 2010|accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl]

==Reception==

===Awards===

In June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.[tpl]cite web | title = CTBUH 9th Annual Awards, 2010  | publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat | url = http://www.ctbuh.org/Events/Awards/2010Awards/tabid/1571/language/en-GB/Default.aspx | accessdate =15 June 2007 [/tpl] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for best project of year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010.[tpl]cite web | title = Burj Khalifa won Best Project of Year at Middle East Architect Awards 2010 | publisher=Constructionweekonline.com | url = http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-9617-burj-khalifa-wins-best-project/ | accessdate =30 September 2010 [/tpl]
The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat bestowed a new award for Burj Khalifa at its annual “Best Tall Buildings Awards Ceremony” on 25 October 2010 when Burj Khalifa honored as first recipient of CTBUH’s new Tall Building “Global Icon” Award. According to CTBUH the new “Global Icon” award recognizes those very special supertall skyscrapers that make a profound impact, not only on the local or regional context, but on the genre of tall buildings globally. Which is innovative in planning, design and execution, the building must have influenced and reshaped the field of tall building architecture, engineering, and urban planning. It is intended that the award will only be conferred on an occasional basis, when merited by an exceptional project perhaps every ten or fifteen years.[tpl]cite web | title = Burj Khalifa won "Global Icon" Award | publisher=Council on Tall Buildings And Urban Habitate | url = http://www.ctbuh.org/Events/Awards/2010Awards/2010AwardsDinner/tabid/1710/language/en-US/Default.aspx | accessdate =2 November 2010 [/tpl]
CTBUH Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture said:

===Climbing===

On 28 March 2011, Alain "Spiderman" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took six hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness for the climb.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12888817 |title='Spiderman' Alain Robert scales Burj Khalifa in Dubai |date=28 March 2011 |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl]

===Suicide===

Within 17 months of the building's official opening, a man described as "an Asian in his mid-30s" who worked at one of the companies in the tower, committed suicide on 10 May 2011 by jumping from the 147th floor. He fell 39 floors, landing on a deck on the 108th floor. Dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide, reporting that "We also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/10/man-dies-in-jump-from-worlds-tallest-building/?iref=obnetwork |title=Man dies in jump from world's tallest building|publisher=News.blogs.cnn.com |date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

During the summer of 2009, while Burj Khalifa was still under construction, contestants from The Amazing Race 15 visited the 120th floor to collect a clue.  The helipad of the building was later featured as the pitstop of the fourth leg of the race in the second season of the reality competition series The Amazing Race Australia.

==Fireworks displays==

==Labour controversy==

Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/mar/23/brianwhitaker.mainsection|title=Riot by migrant workers halts construction of Dubai skyscraper|last=Whitaker|first=Brian|publisher=The Guardian |location=UK |date=23 March 2006|accessdate=25 March 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article74907.ece|title=Burj Dubai opens tomorrow, final height still a secret! |date=3 January 2010|publisher=The Hindu |location=India|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl]  On 17 June 2008, there were 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site.  Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84.  According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Human Rights Watch |url= http://www.hrw.org/en/node/11123/section/6 |title= Building Towers, Cheating Workers Section V. |date= 11 November 2006 |accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7985361.stm |title=Dark side of the Dubai dream |date=6 April 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=Migrant-Rights.org |url= http://www.migrant-rights.org/2010/01/04/behind-the-glamorous-facade-of-the-burj-khalifa/ |title= Behind the Glamorous Facade of the Burj Khalifa |date= 4 January 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] During the construction of Burj Khalifa, only one construction-related death was reported.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/property/keeping-the-burj-dubai-site-safe-for-workers-1.561805 |title=Keeping the Burj Dubai site safe for workers |publisher=gulfnews |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are "poorly documented".
On 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers, who were upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested, damaged cars, offices, computers, and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost £500,000 in damage. Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.
