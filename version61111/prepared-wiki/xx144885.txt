Jacket (now published as Jacket2) is an online literary periodical, which was founded by the Australian poet John Tranter. The first issue was in October 1997.
Until 2010, each new number of the magazine was posted at the Web site piece by piece until the new issue was full, when the next issue started. Past issues remain posted as well. Most of the material was original to the magazine, "but some is excerpted from or co-produced with hard-to-get books and magazines, partly to help them find new readers", according to the Jacket website. 
Peter Forbes called Jacket the "prince of online poetry magazines".Peter Forbes (June 6, 2002) Working the web: Poetry, in The Guardian. Accessed 2006-12-13. After the 40th volume, Tranter gave the magazine to the University of Pennsylvania in 2010, where it is published with an augmented staff and resources at the Kelly Writers House.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/about-us |title=About us |publisher=Jacket2 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/00/home.shtml |title=Jacket Homepage |publisher=Jacketmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl]
