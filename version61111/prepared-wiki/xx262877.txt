Content from the United States diplomatic cables leak has depicted Saudi Arabia and related subjects extensively. The leak,  which began on 28 November 2010, occurred when the website of WikiLeaks — an international new media non-profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks — started to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence — diplomatic cables — between the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day.

==Financial support for terrorist groups==

Diplomats claim that Saudi Arabian donors are the main funders of non-governmental armed groups like Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Militants seeking donations often come during the annual hajj pilgrimage, Umrah and Ramadan. In one occasion, LeT, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, used a Saudi-based front company to fund its activities. A main concern of the officials at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh is protecting Saudi oilfields from al-Qaida attacks.[tpl]cite news|title=Saudi King Urged U.S. To Attack Iran: WikiLeaks|first=Ross |last=Colvin |work=Reuters |date=28 November 2010|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AP06Z20101128 |accessdate=28 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]Registration required|date=December 2010[/tpl] Obtained by WikiLeaks Shine Light Into Secret Diplomatic Channels - Page 2; The New York Times.

==Afghanistan-Saudi relations==

Afghan President Karzai's visited Saudi Arabia on February 2–3, although richer in symbolism than significance, was a sign that lukewarm Saudi-Afghan relations may finally be warming up. Saudi Arabia announced an aid package of 150 USD million for reconstruction in Afghanistan. However, the Saudis continue to have concerns about Afghan corruption and believe greater political unification of the Pashtun community is essential. Their apparent wish to de-emphasize Karzai's visit, may also indicate the King Abdullah's desire to keep some distance and maintain his credibility as a potential reconciliation mediator.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/248602 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US embassy cables: Saudi rulers' contempt for Pakistan president Zardari | date=1 December 2010[/tpl] Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Turki Al Faisal called Afghanistan a "puzzle," "where establishing trust with Afghan leaders, and recognizing the links between Pakistan and the Taliban, were keys to success. All financial aid to the Afghan government should be conditional, benchmarks must be set for the leadership, and aid must be withheld until these are met."

==GCC-Saudi relations==

Saudi Arabia attempts to block co-operative projects between other GCC members. Furthermore, the Saudis are blocking a proposed causeway project between Qatar and the UAE and a proposed gas pipeline project between Qatar and Kuwait, because of Saudi objections, the Kuwaitis are now turning to the Iranians for gas. The Qatar-UAE causeway, when combined with the planned Qatar Bahrain Causeway, would greatly facilitate travel between the three countries this would eliminate the need to transit through Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/bahrain-jordan | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US embassy cables: King of Bahrain discusses Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel/Palestine | date=7 April 2011[/tpl]

===No to Iranian interference in Arab affairs===

A heated discussion took place between the Former Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki and Saudi King Abdullah noted Iran's interference in Arab affairs." When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that "these are Muslims." "No, Arabs" countered the King, "You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters." The King said the Iranians wanted to improve relations and that he responded by giving Mottaki an ultimatum. "I will give you one year" (to improve ties), "after that, it will be the end."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/198178 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US embassy cables: Saudi king's advice for Barack Obama | date=28 November 2010[/tpl]

===Iranian supremacy rejected===

King Abdullah asserted that "Iran is trying to set up Hizballah-like organizations in African countries, the Iranians don't think they are doing anything wrong and don't recognize their mistakes."  Abdullah said "he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election, were he to run." He described Iran not as "a neighbor one wants to see," but as "a neighbor one wants to avoid." He said the Iranians "launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world. A solution to the Arab/Israeli conflict would be a great achievement, the King said, but Iran would find other ways to cause trouble. Iran's goal is to cause problems," he continued, "There is no doubt something unstable about them." He described Iran as "adventurous in the negative sense," and declared "May God prevent us from falling victim to their evil." Mottaki had tendered an invitation to visit Iran, but Abdullah said he replied "All I want is for you to spare us your evil." Summarizing his history with Iran, Abdullah concluded: "We have had correct relations over the years, but the bottom line is that they cannot be trusted."

===Iranian Nuclear ambitions are evil===

During a meeting with Dutch and Russian Ambassadors in Riyadh, Prince Turki al Kabeer Saudi Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that "if Iran tried to produce nuclear weapons, other countries in the Gulf region would be compelled to do the same, or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the Gulf to serve as a deterrent to the Iranians."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/189229 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US embassy cables: Saudi official warns Gulf states may go nuclear | date=28 November 2010[/tpl] Prince Turki also raised concerns that "the United States will negotiate a grand bargain with Iran without consulting Saudi Arabia is a concern we have heard often in recent weeks. Saudi Arabia is also concerned about the Russian-built reactor at Bushehr. A leakage from a plant at that location could bring an environmental catastrophe to Saudi Arabia, pointing out that it is located less than 300 kilometers away from Saudi shores, across open water." The Russian Ambassador Gibinvish, responded that Iran's wants to enrich uranium as it fears being attacked by Israel or the United States and also a sign of Iran's desire to establish its "supremacy" in the region. Prince Turki interjected: "And we cannot accept Iranian supremacy in the region. We are okay with nuclear electrical power and desalination, but not with enrichment." He said that the prospect of Iranian enrichment raises troubling questions about their motivations for doing so: "they do not need it!"

==Iraq-Saudi relations==

===Iraqi government wary of Saudi Arabia===

The Iraqi government sees Saudi Arabia rather than Iran as the "biggest threat to the integrity and cohesion of their fledgling democratic state".Tisdall, Simon (5 December 2010).

===Saudi Arabia counters Iraqi Shiite influence===

Furthermore, Saudis had pressured Kuwait to backtrack on initial agreements with Iraq on issues dating to the Saddam-era. Saudi Arabia was also opposed to Qatar's and Bahrain's plan to seek better ties with Iraq. According to American diplomats, like the Iranians, the Saudis have not hesitated to use their money and political influence inside Iraq. Iraqi contacts assess that the Saudi goal and that of most other Sunni Arab states, to vary degrees is to enhance Sunni influence, diminish Shia dominance and promote the formation of a weak and fractured Iraqi government. The Saudis are using their money and media power through satellite channel like Al-Arabiyya, Al-Sharqiya and other various media they control or influence to support Sunni political aspirations, exert influence over Sunni tribal groups and counter the Shia-led Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and Iraqi National Alliance (INA).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/world/middleeast/06wikileaks-iraq.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | first=Michael R. | last=Gordon | title=WikiLeaks Archive — Meddling Neighbors Torment Iraq | date=5 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/226620 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US embassy cables: Struggle for Iraq | date=5 December 2010[/tpl] A recent Iraqi press article quoted anonymous Iraqi intelligence sources assessing that Saudi Arabia was leading a Gulf effort to destabilize the Maliki government and was financing "the current al Qaida offensive in Iraq."

===Saudi contempt for Zardari===

The diplomatic cables also reveal Saudis have never liked the Shi'a-dominated Pakistan People Party and complain over Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's "alleged corruption and incompetence" and suggest a Saudi bias against Zardari as a Shi'ite, friendly with Iran. According to a cable sent in October 2008, shortly after the 2008 Pakistani presidential election, the Pakistani Deputy Chief of Mission Sarfraz Khanzada said that Saudi financial assistance to Pakistan had been sharply reduced because of "a lack of Saudi confidence in the Zardari government."[tpl]cite document| last =Rundell| first =David | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Pakistani relations with Saudis "strained" | id=[tpl]cablegate|08RIYADH1541[/tpl] |work =| publisher =WikiLeaks| date =16 October 2008| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/10/08RIYADH1541.html |format =| doi =| accessdate =3 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vTAWEPFp |archivedate=3 January 2011  |deadurl=no [/tpl] Khanzada stated his opinion that "the Saudi government appeared to be 'waiting for the Zardari government to fall.'"

===Saudi Arabia's friend Nawaz Sharif===

Saudi King Abdullah would prefer to see Pakistan run by former PM Nawaz Sharif, and were cutting back assistance to Pakistan to hasten this eventuality.

From missionary and Islamic charity organizations and apparently with the direct support of governments in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, nearly 100 million USD was making its way annually to clerics in madrassas located in the southern part of Pakistan's largest Punjab Province. A network of Deobandi and Wahhabi mosques and madrassahs are being strengthened through an influx of charity which originally reached organisations such as Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Al khidmat foundation. Some amount would also be given away to clerics in order to expand these sects. Moreover, children recruited would receive specific indoctrination including sectarian extremism, hatred for non-Muslims, anti-Western/anti-Pakistan government philosophy and are encouraged to wage Jihad.http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/22/saudi-arabia-uae-financing-extremism-in-south-punjab.htmlhttp://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/12640/World/Region/Saudi-Arabia,-UAE-funded-jihadi-networks-in-Pakist.aspx

Iraqi officials have noted that frequent anti-Shia outbursts from Saudi religious figures are often allowed to circulate without sanction or disapproval from the Saudi leadership, moreover Wahabbi Sunni Islam condones religious incitement against Shia. The Saudis have traditionally viewed Iraq as a Sunni-dominated bulwark against the spread of Shiism and Iranian political influence. In the aftermath of bombings in predominantly Shia areas across the country in 2009 that killed dozens, PM Maliki pointed publicly to one such statement, made by a Saudi imam in May, and stated, "We have observed that many governments have been suspiciously silent on the fatwa provoking the killing of Shiites."

Even though these parties are in complete violation of CPVPV's laws, the mutaween of CPVPV are afraid to raid these parties, since these parties are hosted by the young princes of al-Saud, the monarchic ruling house of Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite document| last =Quinn| first =Martin R.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Underground party scene in Jeddah: Saudi youth frolic under "princely protection" | id=[tpl]cablegate|09JEDDAH443[/tpl] |work =| publisher =WikiLeaks| date =18 November 2009| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/11/09JEDDAH443.html |format =| doi =| accessdate =2 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vQOJwWeW |archivedate=1 January 2011  |deadurl=no [/tpl]

===Exclusive parties===

The Economist summarised cable descriptions of "exclusive parties" in Saudi Arabia, stating, "An American official in Saudi Arabia describes un-Islamic mores at a clandestine Halloween party, hosted by a royal prince. Alcohol and prostitutes abounded at the event, attended by 150-plus Saudis. The host's status kept the fearsome religious police away. Such parties, the writer concluded, were increasingly typical in the kingdom."[tpl]cite news| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = More dope, no highs — Blushes, frowns but no explosions in the latest WikiLeaks' disclosures | work =| publisher =The Economist| date =9 December 2010| url =http://www.economist.com/node/17674097 |format =| doi =| accessdate =4 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vUbAXaao |archivedate=4 January 2011 |deadurl=no [/tpl]

==Censorship and propaganda==

According to a May 2009 cable, the "Saudi regulatory system offers the al-Saud regime a means to manipulate the nation's media to promote its own agenda," and criticism of the al-Saud regime is not tolerated at all.[tpl]cite document| last =Rundell| first =David| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Ideological and ownership trends in the Saudi media| id=[tpl]cablegate|09RIYADH651[/tpl] |work =| publisher =WikiLeaks| date= 11 May 2009| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09RIYADH651.html |format =| doi =| accessdate =2 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vQOYUjoW |archivedate=1 January 2011  |deadurl=no [/tpl] All major media outlets in Saudi Arabia — newspapers, such as Al-Watan, Al-Hayat, and Asharq Al-Awsat, and free-to-view television networks, such as MBC Group and Rotana — are owned and controlled by the al-Saud regime, and accordingly self-censorship is the order of the day — which is "motivated by profit and politics". The pro-western ideologies in these newspapers and American programming — such as Friends, Desperate Housewives, the Late Show with David Letterman and Hollywood films — are seen as an antidote to extremist religious thoughts in the recruitment of terrorists, especially young teenagers, because of the demographic target groups of these programs.

==Oil Production==

Cables revealed that the US was warned by Sadad al Husseini, a senior Saudi government oil executive, that the country's oil reserves are overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels (40% of the claimed reserve). It is therefore not possible for Saudi Arabia to prevent the oil price from rising.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/08/saudi-oil-reserves-overstated-wikileaks |title=WikiLeaks cables: Saudi Arabia cannot pump enough oil to keep a lid on prices |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |publisher=The Guardian |author=John Vidal |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/02/201129171520279835.html |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |title=Saudi oil reserves 'overstated' |publisher=Al Jazeera[/tpl]
