A Farewell to Kings is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1977. It was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales, and mixed at Advision Studios in London.
A Farewell to Kings would become Rush's first US gold-selling album, receiving the certification within two months of its release, and was eventually certified platinum.
Geddy Lee originally wrote his bass lines on his acoustic bass. The birds heard on "A Farewell to Kings" and "Xanadu" were recorded outside near Rockfield Studios.

==Musical style==

This album continues the band's explorations of their musical style and sound. Bringing a greater sense of depth to it are Alex Lifeson's use of classical guitar to open the title track. Also of note are the subtle keyboard and synthesizers Geddy Lee uses in "Xanadu", along with their prominent use in the melodic bridge and the chorus section. Anchoring the album is Neil Peart's percussion, an ever-expanding range of drums, woodblocks, bells and chimes.
The lyrics of "Cinderella Man" are based on the Frank Capra film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. It is also notable as one of the few Rush songs for which Lee wrote all of the lyrics after Peart's entry into the band.
"Madrigal" is one of the band's softest songs of this time period. It is also one of Rush's shortest songs at 2:35. The only other Rush songs that are shorter are "Broonâ€²s Bane" (1:37), "Need Some Love" (2:19), "Malignant Narcissism" (2:17), "Hope" (2:02), and "BU2B2" (1:28).
