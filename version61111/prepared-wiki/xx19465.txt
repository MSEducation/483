Pau Casals i Defilló ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈpaw kəˈzaɫz i dəfiˈʎo|lang[/tpl]; December 29, 1876[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]October 22, 1973), known during his professional career as Pablo Casals,EMI official web siteHonors To Be Conferred On English Composers: Series of Concerts Devoted to modern Englishmen to be Given in London, New York Times, 1911-04-09, retrieved 2009-08-01"Pablo Casals – the Musician and the Man" was a Catalan cellist and conductor. He is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century, and one of the greatest cellists of all time. He made many recordings throughout his career, of solo, chamber, and orchestral music, also as conductor, but he is perhaps best remembered for the recordings of the Bach Cello Suites he made from 1936 to 1939.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early years===

Casals was born in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain. His father, Carles Casals i Ribes (1852–1908), was a parish organist and choirmaster. He gave Casals instruction in piano, song, violin, and organ. He was also a very strict disciplinarian. When Casals was young his father would pull the piano out from the wall and have him and his brother, Artur, stand behind it and name the notes and the scales that his father was playing. At the age of four Casals could play the violin, piano and flute; at the age of six he played the violin well enough to perform a solo in public. His first encounter with a cello-like instrument was from witnessing a local traveling Catalan musician, who played a cello-strung broom handle. Upon request, his father built him a crude cello, using a gourd as a sound-box. When Casals was eleven, he first heard the real cello performed by a group of traveling musicians, and decided to dedicate himself to the instrument. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
In 1888 his mother, Pilar Defilló de Casals, who was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico of Catalonian ancestry, took him to Barcelona, where he enrolled in the Escola Municipal de Música.[ref]
</ref> There he studied cello, theory, and piano. In 1890, when he was 13, he discovered in a second-hand sheet music store in Barcelona a tattered copy of Bach's six cello suites. He spent the next 13 years practicing them every day before he would perform them in public for the first time.<ref>Eric Siblin,''The Cello Suites: J.S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a Baroque Masterpiece''. Atlantic; 336 pages, 2010</ref> Casals would later make his own version of the six suites.<ref>[http://ovationpress.com/c-84-casals-pablo.aspx Ovation Press Editors: Pablo Casals]</ref>
He made prodigious progress as a cellist; on February 23, 1891 he gave a solo recital in Barcelona at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the Escola with honours five years later.

===Youth and studies===

In 1893, Catalan composer Isaac Albéniz heard him playing in a trio in a café and gave him a letter of introduction to the Count Guillermo Morphy, the private secretary to María Cristina, the Queen Regent. Casals was asked to play at informal concerts in the palace, and was granted a royal stipend to study composition at the Real Conservatorio de Música y Declamación in Madrid with Víctor Mirecki. He also played in the newly organized Quartet Society.
In 1895 he went to Paris, where, having lost his stipend from Catalonia, he earned a living by playing second cello in the theater orchestra of the Folies Marigny.  In 1896, he returned to Catalonia and received an appointment to the faculty of the Escola Municipal de Música in Barcelona. He was also appointed principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the Liceu. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, and was awarded the Order of Carlos III from the Queen. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

===International career===

In 1899, Casals played at The Crystal Palace in London, and later for Queen Victoria at Osborne House, her summer residence, accompanied by Ernest Walker. On November 12, and December 17, 1899, he appeared as a soloist at Lamoureux Concerts in Paris, to great public and critical acclaim. He toured Spain and the Netherlands with the pianist Harold Bauer in 1900–1901; in 1901–1902 he made his first tour of the United States; and in 1903 toured South America.
On January 15, 1904, Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt. On March 9, of that year he made his debut at Carnegie Hall in New York, playing Richard Strauss's Don Quixote under the baton of the composer.  In 1906 he became associated with the talented young Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia,Mercier, Anita Guilhermina Suggia, retrieved 2009-08-01 who studied with him and began to appear in concerts as Mme. P. Casals-Suggia, although they were not legally married. Their relationship ended in 1912.
The New York Times of  April 9, 1911 announced that Casals would perform at the London Musical Festival to be held at the Queen's Hall on the second day of the Festival (May 23). The piece chosen was Haydn's Cello Concerto in D and Casals would later join Fritz Kreisler for Brahms's Double Concerto for Violin and Cello.
In 1914 Casals married the American socialite and singer Susan Metcalfe; they were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.
Although Casals made his first recordings in 1915 (a series for Columbia), he would not release another recording until 1926 (on the Victor label).
Back in Paris, Casals organized a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud; they played concerts and made recordings until 1937. Casals also became interested in conducting, and in 1919 he organized, in Barcelona, the Pau Casals Orchestra and led its first concert on October 13, 1920. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the Orquesta Pau Casals ceased its activities.
Casals was an ardent supporter of the Spanish Republican government, and after its defeat vowed not to return to Spain until democracy was restored. Casals performed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu on October 19, 1938, possibly his last performance in Catalonia before his exile.Abella, Rafael La vida cotidiana durante la guerra civil: la España republicana p. 422 (published by Editorial Planeta, 1975)
He settled in the French Catalan village of Prada de Conflent, near the Spanish Catalan border; between 1939 and 1942 he made sporadic appearances as a cellist in the unoccupied zone of southern France and in Switzerland. So fierce was his opposition to the dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco in Spain that he refused to appear in countries that recognized the authoritarian Spanish government.  He made a notable exception when he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on November 13, 1961, at the invitation of President John F. Kennedy, whom he admired. On December 6, 1963, Casals was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.Chronological List of Medal of Freedom, archived 2007-10-18, retrieved 2009-08-01
Throughout most of his professional career, he played on a cello that was labeled and attributed to "Carlo Tononi ... 1733" but after he had been playing it for 50 years it was discovered to have been created by the Venetian luthier Matteo Goffriller around 1700. It was acquired by Casals in 1913.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=2366|title=Cello by Matteo Goffriller, 1700c (ex-Casals)|publisher=Cozio|accessdate=2007-01-22[/tpl] He also played another cello by Goffriller dated 1710, and a Tononi from 1730.

====Prades Festivals====

In 1950 he resumed his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent, organized in commemoration of the bicentenary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach; Casals agreed to participate on condition that all proceeds were to go to a refugee hospital in nearby Perpignan.
In 1952, Casals met Marta Angélica Montañez y Martinez, a 15-year-old Puerto Rican student who had gone to Spain to participate in the Festival. Casals was very impressed with her and encouraged her to return to Mannes College of Music in New York to continue her studies. He continued leading the Prades Festivals until 1966.

====Puerto Rico====

Casals traveled extensively to Puerto Rico in 1955, inaugurating the annual Casals Festival the next year. In 1955 Casals married as his second wife long-time associate Francesca Vidal de Capdevila, who died that same year. In 1957, at age 80, Casals married 20-year-old Marta Montañez y Martinez.[tpl]cite news|title=Master cellist Pablo Casal marries 21-year-old pupil|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19570805&id=hpxJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mwwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1738,948032|newspaper=The News and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)|date=5 August 1957[/tpl] He is said to have dismissed concerns that marriage to someone 60 years his junior might be hazardous to his health by saying, "I look at it this way: if she dies, she dies."[tpl]cite news|last=Gardner|first=Jasmine|title=Julian Lloyd Webber talks music and marriage|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/julian-lloyd-webber-talks-music-and-marriage-7578985.html|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=20 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Amis|first=John|title=Master of the Cello: Pablo Casals|journal=The Tablet|date=6 February 1993|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/6th-february-1993/16/master-of-the-cello[/tpl] Pablo and Marta made their permanent residence in the town of Ceiba, and lived in a house called "El Pessebre" (The Manger).Festival Casals de Puerto Rico: Historia, retrieved 2009-08-01 [tpl]Es icon[/tpl] He made an impact in the Puerto Rican music scene, by founding the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra in 1958, and the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico in 1959.

==Legacy==

The International Pablo Casals Cello Competition is held in Kronberg and Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under the auspices of the Kronberg Academy once every four years, starting in 2000, to discover and further the careers of the future cello elite, and is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage of Marta Casals Istomin. One of the prizes is the use of one of the Gofriller cellos owned by Casals. The first top prize was awarded in 2000 to Claudio Bohórquez.
American comedian George Carlin, in his interview for the Archive of American Television, refers to Casals when discussing the restless nature of an artist's persona. As Carlin states, when Casals (then aged 93) was asked why he continued to practice the cello three hours a day, Casals replied, "'I'm beginning to notice some improvement...' And that's the thing that's in me. I notice myself getting better at this," Carlin continued.
In Puerto Rico, the Casals Festival is still celebrated annually. There is also a museum dedicated to the life of Casals located in Old San Juan. On October 3, 2009, Sala Sinfonica Pablo Casals, a symphony hall named in Casals' honor, opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The $34 million building, designed by Rodolfo Fernandez, is the latest addition to the Centro de Bellas Artes complex. It is the new home of the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra.
In Tokyo, the Casals Hall opened in 1987 as a venue for chamber music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nagata.co.jp/e_sakuhin/factsheets/casals.pdf |title=Casals Hall |publisher=Nagata Acoustics |accessdate=March 6, 2012[/tpl] Pablo Casals Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois, USA is named in his honor."Pablo Casals Elementary School" Chicago Public Schools.
