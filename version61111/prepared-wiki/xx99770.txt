===Origins===

After Boyi helped Yu the Great bring flood control to the early Chinese, Yu's son and successor Qi of Xia offered Boyi's son, Xuanzhong, the position of Lord of Jiangdi ([tpl]zh|c=江地[/tpl] - modern Jiangling County in Hubei Province).Tong Zhi - Shi Zu Lüe - Yi Guo Wei Shi 《通志·氏族略·以国为氏》.  Boyi's descendants ruled the area as kings of an autonomous "River Kingdom" ([tpl]zh|c=江国|p=Jiāng Guó[/tpl]) during the Shang Dynasty and Western Zhou Dynasty, with its capital city near today's Zhengyang County, Henan Province.[tpl]zh|c=《姓谱》：“伯益之裔，封于江陵，子孙以国为氏。[/tpl]
During the Spring and Autumn Period, the kingdom was often under attack from the neighboring states of Chu, Song, and Qi, each of which was larger than the "River Kingdom".  While defending from neighbors' attacks, the Jiang state also had to deal with the Huai River's frequent flooding, which often inundated the kingdom's central areas.  These difficulties prevented Jiang from developing significant economic or military power.  It survived until 623 BC when it was destroyed by Chu.
At the time of the kingdom's destruction, many of its surviving inhabitants fled to what is now Henan Province and took the kingdom's name, "Jiang", as their clan name.
