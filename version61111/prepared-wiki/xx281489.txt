==Release==

In June 7, 1973 according to a marketing strategy proposed by Paulo Coelho, Raul Seixas summoned the press to register his walking by Rio Branco Avenue, where he sang Ouro de Tolo. This was shown on prime time on Brazilian TV. The lyrics were a castigation on the country's conformism about the illusory gains offered by the dictatorship. It instantly became a single and was recorded by Philips Records along with nine other songs on the album Krig-ha, Bandolo!, his first solo LP, in 1973.
