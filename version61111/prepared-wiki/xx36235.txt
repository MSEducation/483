==History==

It was founded in 1854, when it received handelspladsprivilegiet. Before, it had been only a ferry terminal with permission to hold markets either side of the fjord. In 1883 a rail link was established to Randers, and in 1900 another to Aalborg. Hadsund had two stations: Hadsund Nord (demolished in 1985) and Hadsund Syd.
There has long been a bridge over Mariager Fjord, which is why a settlement grew up here. From ancient times a bridge went from Hobro to Aalborg via Randers or vice versa. In 1904 a railway bridge over the inlet opened, bringing the hinterland south of the fjord closer to the town.

==Hadsund Arms==

was given to the town in 1937. The coat of arms shows mainly the 1904 bridge. The four waves symbolize villages that lay in the municipality: Skelund, Visborg, Vive, and Hadsund. The crescent shape symbolizes the new municipality, and the star represents longevity. The bridge was replaced in 1976, but its classic steel arches were never changed in the town logo.
