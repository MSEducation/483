[[Affricate consonant]]

CATEGORIES: Affricates

Affricates are consonants that begin as stops (most often an alveolar, such as [tpl]IPA|t[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|d[/tpl]) but release as a fricative (such as [tpl]IPA|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|z[/tpl] or occasionally into a fricative trill) rather than directly into the following vowel. English has two affricates, spelled ch and j.

==Examples==

The English sounds spelled "ch" and "j" (transcribed [tpl]IPA|t͡ʃ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|d͡ʒ[/tpl] in IPA), German and Italian z [tpl]IPA|t͡s[/tpl] and Italian z [tpl]IPA|d͡z[/tpl] are typical affricates. These sounds are fairly common in the world's languages, as are other affricates with similar sounds, such as those in Polish and Chinese. However, other than [tpl]IPA|d͡ʒ[/tpl], voiced affricates are relatively uncommon. For several places of articulation they are not attested at all.
Much less common are labiodental affricates, such as [tpl]IPA|p͡f[/tpl] in German and Izi, or velar affricates, such as [tpl]IPA|k͡x[/tpl] in Tswana (written kg) or High Alemannic Swiss German dialects. Worldwide, relatively few languages have affricates in these positions, even though the corresponding stop consonants [tpl]IPA|p, k[/tpl] are virtually universal. Also less common are alveolar affricates where the fricative is lateral, such as the [tpl]IPA|t͡ɬ[/tpl] sound found in Nahuatl and Navajo. Some other Athabaskan languages, such as Dene Suline, have unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective series of affricates that may be dental, alveolar, postalveolar, or lateral, that is [tpl]IPA|t̪͡θ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t̪͡θʰ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t̪͡θʼ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡s[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡sʰ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡sʼ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ʃ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ʃʰ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ʃʼ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ɬ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ɬʰ[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|t͡ɬʼ[/tpl].

==Notation==

Affricates are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by a combination of two letters, one for the stop element and the other for the fricative element. In order to show that these are parts of a single consonant, a tie bar is generally used. The tie bar appears most commonly above the two letters, but may be placed under them if it fits better there, or simply because this is more legible.For example, in Niesler, Louw, & Roux (2005) analysis of Afrikaans, English, Xhosa and Zulu using South African speech databases http://www.ajol.info/index.php/salas/article/viewFile/6562/13287 Thus:
or
A less common notation is to indicate the release of the affricate with a superscript:
This is derived from the IPA convention of indicating other releases with a superscript. However, this convention is more typically used for a fricated release that is too brief to be considered a true affricate.
Though they are no longer standard IPA, ligatures are available in Unicode for the six common affricates
Any of these notations distinguishes affricates from sequences of stop plus fricative, a difference that distinguishes words in languages such as Polish. However, in languages where there is no such distinction, such as English, the tie bars are commonly dropped.
In other phonetic transcription systems, such as the Americanist system, the affricates [tpl]IPA|t͡s[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|d͡z[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ʃ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|d͡ʒ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|t͡ɬ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|d͡ɮ[/tpl] are transcribed respectively as [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|c[/tpl][/tpl] or [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|¢[/tpl][/tpl]; [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|j[/tpl][/tpl], [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ƶ[/tpl][/tpl], or (older) [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ʒ[/tpl][/tpl]; [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|c[/tpl][/tpl] or [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|č[/tpl][/tpl]; [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ǰ[/tpl][/tpl], [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ǧ[/tpl][/tpl], or (older) [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ǯ[/tpl][/tpl]; [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ƛ[/tpl][/tpl]; and [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|λ[/tpl][/tpl] or [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|dl[/tpl][/tpl]. Within the IPA, [tpl]IPA|tʃ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|dʒ[/tpl] are sometimes transcribed with the symbols for the palatal stops, [tpl]angbr|[tpl]IPA|c[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]angbr|[tpl]IPA|ɟ[/tpl][/tpl].

==Affricates vs. stop–fricative sequences==

Affricates can contrast phonemically with stop–fricative sequences. Examples:
and
In the stop–fricative sequence, the stop has a release burst before the fricative starts; but in the affricate, the fricative element is the release. Stop–fricative sequences may have a syllable boundary between the two segments, but not necessarily.
In English, [tpl]IPA|/ts/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/dz/[/tpl] (nuts, nods) are considered phonemically stop–fricative sequences because they may contain a morpheme boundary (for example, nuts = nut + s). But the sounds are phonetically affricates.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] The English affricate phonemes [tpl]IPA|/t͡ʃ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/d͡ʒ/[/tpl] do not require a morpheme boundary. The sounds are sometimes written with the unitary symbols [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|č[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]angbr|[tpl]Unicode|ǰ[/tpl][/tpl], though it is not considered standard IPA notation. However, English speakers (depending on dialect) do distinguish affricates from stop–fricative sequences:
Here [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] debuccalizes to a glottal stop before [tpl]IPA|/ʃ/[/tpl] in many dialects, making it phonetically distinct from [tpl]IPA|/t͡ʃ/[/tpl].
The acoustic difference between affricates and stop–fricative sequences is rate of amplitude increase of the frication noise, which is known as the rise time. Affricates have a short rise time to the peak frication amplitude whereas stop–fricative sequences have longer rise times (Howell & Rosen 1983, Johnson 2003, Mitani et al. 2006).

==List of affricates==

In the case of coronals, the symbols [tpl]angbr|[tpl]IPA|t, d[/tpl][/tpl] are normally used for the stop portion of the affricate regardless of place. For example, [tpl]IPA|t͡ʂ[/tpl] is commonly seen for [tpl]IPA|ʈ͡ʂ[/tpl].
The exemplar languages are ones that these sounds have been reported from, but in several cases they may need confirmation.

===Sibilant affricates===

The Northwest Caucasian languages Abkhaz and Ubykh both contrast sibilant affricates at four places of articulation: alveolar, postalveolar, alveolo-palatal and retroflex. They also distinguish voiceless, voiced, and ejective affricates at each of these.
When a language only has one type of affricate, it is usually a sibilant; this is the case in e.g. some Arabic dialects ([tpl]IPA|d̠ʒ[/tpl]), most dialects of Spanish ([tpl]IPA|t̠ʃ[/tpl]), and Thai ([tpl]IPA|t̠ɕ[/tpl]).

===Non-sibilant affricates===

===Lateral affricates===

===Trilled affricates===

===Heterorganic affricates===

Although most affricates are homorganic, Navajo and Chiricahua Apache have a heterorganic alveolar-velar affricate [tpl]IPA|tx[/tpl] (McDonough & Ladefoged 1993, Hoijer & Opler 1938). Other heterorganic affricates are reported for Northern Sotho (Johnson 2003) and other Bantu languages such as Phuthi, which has alveolar–labiodental affricates [tpl]IPA|tf[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|dv[/tpl], and Sesotho, which has bilabial–palatoalveolar afficates [tpl]IPA|pʃ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|bʒ[/tpl]. Djeoromitxi (Pies 1992) has [tpl]IPA|ps[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|bz[/tpl].

===Phonation, coarticulation and other variants===

The more common of the voiceless affricates are all attested as ejectives as well: [tpl]IPA|tsʼ, tɬʼ, tʃʼ, tɕʼ, tʂʼ, cʎ̥ʼ, kxʼ, kʟ̝̊ʼ[/tpl]. Several Khoisan languages such as !Xóõ are reported to have voiced ejective affricates, but these may actually be consonant clusters: [tpl]IPA|dtʃʼ[/tpl]. Affricates are also commonly aspirated: [tpl]IPA|tθʰ, tsʰ, tɬʰ, tʃʰ, tɕʰ, tʂʰ[/tpl], occasionally murmured: [tpl]IPA|d̠ʒʱ[/tpl], and sometimes prenasalized: [tpl]IPA|ⁿdzʱ, ᶯɖʐ, ᶯɖʐʱ[/tpl]. Labialized, palatalized, velarized, and pharyngealized affricates also occur. Affricates may also have phonemic length, that is, affected by a chroneme, as in Italian and Karelian.
