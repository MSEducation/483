The Newseum is an interactive museum of news and journalism located at 555 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, D.C. The seven-level, [tpl]convert|250000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] museum features 15 theaters and 14 galleries. The Newseum's Berlin Wall Gallery includes the largest display of sections of the Berlin Wall outside of Germany. The Today's Front Pages Gallery presents daily front pages from more than 80 international newspapers. 
Other galleries present topics including news history, the September 11 attacks, the First Amendment, world press freedom and the history of the Internet, TV and radio. It opened at its first location in Rosslyn, Virginia, on April 18, 1997, where it admitted visitors without charge.
Its mission is "to help the public and the news media understand one another better" and to "raise public awareness of the important role of a free press in a democratic society."
In five years, the original Newseum attracted more than 2.25 million visitors. The Newseum's operations are funded by the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan foundation dedicated to "free press, free speech and free spirit for all people." The new Newseum has become one of Washington's most popular destinations, and its high definition television studios hosts news broadcasts and Al Jazeera America's Washington D.C. bureau. The adult admission fee (in 2013) is $22.

==History==

In 2000, Freedom Forum decided to move the Newseum from its location in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River to downtown Washington, D.C. The original Newseum was closed on 3 March 2002, to allow its staff to concentrate on building the new, larger museum. The new museum, built at a cost of $450 million, opened its doors to the public on April 11, 2008.[tpl]cite news | first=Gillian |last=Gaynair |title=Newseum Sets Opening Date |work=Washington Business Journal | date=2008-02-07 |url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/02/04/daily44.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5htX60PaYzfsAO4BwYqz53u3AUWAgD8VUOTFG1|title=Newseum to Open in New Home Friday|author=Zongker, Brett|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-11[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl]
Tim Russert, a Newseum trustee, said, "The Newseum made a pretty good impression in Arlington, but at your new location on Pennsylvania Avenue, you will make an indelible mark."
After obtaining a landmark location at Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street NW, the Newseum board selected noted exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum, who had designed the original Newseum in Arlington, Virginia, and architect James Stewart Polshek, who designed the Rose Center for Earth and Space with Todd Schliemann at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, to work on the new project.
This design team had the following goals:
Highlights of the building design unveiled October 2002 include a façade featuring a "window on the world", 57 ft × 78 ft (17 m × 24 m), which looks out on Pennsylvania Avenue and the National Mall while letting the public see inside to the visitors and displays. It features the 45 words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, etched into a four story tall stone panel facing Pennsylvania Avenue.
One feature carried over from the prior Arlington site was the Journalists Memorial, a glass sculpture which lists the names of 1,900 journalists from around the world killed in the line of duty. It is updated and rededicated every year.
The museum website is updated daily with images and PDF versions of newspaper front pages from around the world. Images are replaced daily, but an archive of front pages from notable events since 2001 is also available. Hard copies of the front pages are featured in a gallery within the museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/archive.asp|title=Archived Pages|publisher=Newseum|accessdate=2008-06-22[/tpl] Unlike its original museum in Arlington, the new Newseum charges admission fees to the general public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newseum.org/tickets/about.aspx?item=tickets_splash&style=a|title=Tickets|publisher=Newseum|accessdate=2008-04-30[/tpl]
Jerry Frieheim, a 1956 graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism, was the first executive director of the Newseum and claims to have coined the name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mizzoumag.missouri.edu/2009-Winter/index.php|title=Mizzou: The Magazine of the Mizzou Alumni Association, Winter 2009|publisher=University of Missouri Alumni Association|accessdate=2008-11-18[/tpl]
Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School students are admitted to the Newseum free of charge, as Smith's son, Robert H. Smith, was a founding partner of the Newseum.
In October 2009, the Newseum ended 29 full-time positions, which represented about 13% of its total personnel at that time. As of December 2009, the group has now reduced its staff by 23% through its history. President Kenneth Paulson stated that the "cuts are spread throughout the organization, but should not affect the experience of museum visitors". He also said that overall month-by-month attendance had increased in 2009 compared to 2008.[tpl]Cite news|date=December 2, 2009|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/01/AR2009120103965.html|title=Newseum trims its staff once again|first=Jacqueline|last=Trescott|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate= January 5, 2010[/tpl]

==Building==

The 643,000-square-foot (60,000 m²) Newseum includes a [tpl]convert|90|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] high atrium, seven levels of displays, 15 theaters, a dozen major galleries, many more smaller exhibits, two broadcast studios, and an expanded interactive newsroom.
The building features an oval, 500-seat "Forum" theater; approximately 145,500 square feet (14,000 m²) gross of housing facing Sixth and C streets; 75,000 square feet (7,000 m²) of office space for the staff of the Newseum and Freedom Forum; and more than 11,000 square feet (1,000 m²) of conference center space on two levels located directly above the Newseum Atrium. The building is also known for the largest and tallest hydraulic passenger elevators in the world, with a capacity of 18,000 pounds capable of carrying up to 72 passengers when fully loaded, and a travel distance of 100 feet that covers 7 floors. A curving glass memorial to slain journalists is located above the ground floor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2008/0903/design_1-1.html |title=Newseum by Polshek |last=Lebovich |first=William |work=ArchitectureWeek |date=March 9, 2008 |accessdate=March 4, 2010[/tpl]
Showcase environments throughout the museum are climate controlled by four microclimate control devices. These units provide a flow of humidified air to the cases through a system of distribution pipes.
ABC's This Week began broadcasting from a new studio in the Newseum on April 20, 2008, with George Stephanopoulos as host.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=4622090 |title=New Museum Tells Media Story |last=Venkataraman |first=Nitya |publisher=ABC News |date=April 10, 2008 |accessdate=March 4, 2010[/tpl] ABC moved This Week back to its Washington, D.C. bureau at the beginning of June, 2013 citing the network's infrequent use of the Newseum studio compared to the cost of operating and maintaining a studio there. The studio is now home to Al Jazeera America's Washington, D.C. bureau which also has editing facilities and office space in the Newseum.http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/abcs-this-week-moving-out-of-the-newseum-al-jazeera-america-moving-in_b180253 Al Jazeera America broadcasts it's flagship newsmagazine show America Tonight nightly on weeknights from the studio.

==Critical response==

The Newseum is very popular with the general public but has received mixed reviews from journalists. The website TripAdvisor ranks it 2nd out of 198 attractions in the Washington area and its contributors rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g28970-d1005305-Reviews-Newseum-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html |title=Newseum |publisher=TripAdvisor |accessdate=March 4, 2010[/tpl] Reviewers on the website Yelp also give the Newseum high marks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yelp.com/biz/newseum-washington |title=Newseum |publisher=Yelp |accessdate=March 4, 2010[/tpl] The San Francisco Bay Guardian described it as "the most comprehensive, evocative look at the power and responsibility of the journalist under one roof that our country has yet produced."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/pixel_vision/2010/03/03/dcs-newseum-real-headliner |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian Online |title=DC's Newseum is a real headliner |date=March 3, 2010 |first=Caitlin |last=Donohue |accessdate=March 4, 2010[/tpl] The Sunday Times ranked it one of the "world's 12 coolest museums".[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/history_and_travel/article6877285.ece |title=The world's 12 coolest museums |first=Sean |last=Newsom |coauthor=Vincent Crump |date=October 18, 2009[/tpl] The Dallas Morning News praised its interactive exhibits and said " While the free Smithsonian museums do a fine job of housing our important artifacts, I believe the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue does an unparalleled job of telling our nation's story.

Other reviewers were more critical. 
The New York Times Architecture Review panned the second Newseum building as "the latest reason to lament the state of contemporary architecture in" Washington, D.C.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/arts/design/11arch.html|title=Get Me Rewrite: A New Monument to Press Freedom|publisher=The New York Times|work=Architecture Review|first=Nicolai|last=Ourousoff|date=2008-04-11|accessdate=2008-04-24[/tpl] Of the Newseum's actual content, the Times stated that "a good portion of the museum’s earnestly sought attention is well deserved",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/arts/design/11news.html|title=Chasing the News: Mark Twain’s Inkwell to Blogger’s Slippers|page=1|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=2008-04-11|accessdate=2008-04-24 | work=The New York Times[/tpl] but "the museum’s preening does call for some skepticism".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/arts/design/11news.html|title=Chasing the News: Mark Twain’s Inkwell to Blogger’s Slippers|page=2|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=2008-04-11|accessdate=2008-04-24 | work=The New York Times[/tpl] USA Today repeated "mixed" reviews of the building's architecture and cited the number of visitors as a sign that the Newseum is a "success as a destination in the museum-rich national capital".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2008-04-03-newseum-opening_N.htm|title=Massive Newseum opens window on journalism|first=Maria|last=Puente|publisher=USA Today|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-04-30[/tpl]
An exhibit at the Newseum discusses the "effort to avoid bias" by journalists. It includes a 2006 Gallup poll in which 44% of Americans called the media "too liberal" while only 19% found it "too conservative" as well as other comments on possible political media bias, many of which come from Fox News contributors. Jonathan Schwarz of Mother Jones criticized the exhibit and called it an example of corporate propaganda from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. He also argued that most of the U.S. news media is controlled by businesses who shut out stories that would counter their interests.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2008/04/bias-new-newseum|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=January 4, 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Schwarz|date=April 14, 2008|title="Bias" At The New Newseum[/tpl] Kevin D. Williamson of National Review Online defended the Newseum and called the criticism "nonsense concentrate". He argued that media-owning companies have an interest in promoting non-conservative causes such as protectionism and of shifting their health care costs over to the government.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://media.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjdkOGM4ODJjYjc1OTVhMTMzODc2ODA3NjA4OWFhOWM=|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=January 4, 2010|title=Newseum's Bias Discussion|date=April 16, 2008|first=Kevin D.|last=Williamson[/tpl]
James Bowman of National Review Online criticised the Newseum after its opening for being overly stylistic and superficial, writing that it focuses on headline-based reporting of major world events rather than details of the events themselves. He commented, "all this interacting is supposed to make learning fun, but like most such exercises it does so only by taking away most of what makes it learning." He also stated that the targeted advertising towards children was "squaring the cultural circle" and was unethical.[tpl]Cite news|first=James|last=Bowman|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzMzYzZiOWRlYjBlM2I1NTFjOGEwNDQ0ZGU0Y2MwOTA=|publisher=National Review Online|title=Media Monument|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=January 4, 2009[/tpl]
Journalist Alan Rusbridger of The Guardian stated that visitors would have "a great family day out". He considered some of the exhibits, such as a red dress worn by Helen Thomas, as "faintly ridiculous" while praising others such as a large chunk of the actual Berlin Wall. Although writing that the Newseum displayed "self-glorification, pomposity and vanity" in an "overwhelmingly American-centric" way, he described the building design as "uplifting" and generally commended the features.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2008/apr/02/withasenseoftiming|title=Washington DC's Newseum opens its doors|date=2 April 2008 |publisher=The Guardian: OrganGrinder|author=Alan Rusbridger|accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl]
Jack Shafer, co-editor of Slate, has criticized the Newseum's exhibit about the career of the late NBC reporter Tim Russert. He argued that Russert's "mundane" work-space was not worthy of preservation in a museum and that Russert's accomplishments "begin at being a pretty good interviewer and end at having a lot of celebrity friends." He concluded that the Newseum is "a place where journalist celebrities begin to be worshipped as miracle-producing saints."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2231910/|publisher=Slate|date=October 8, 2009|title=The Newseum's Tim Russert Shrine|accessdate=January 5, 2010|author=Jack Shafer[/tpl]
Bonnie Wach writing for SFGate praised the Newseum's content and interactivity. 
"The Newseum, which opened in 2008, is a soaring glass-and-marble edifice devoted to 500 years of news and the people who made it. It takes us all of about five minutes inside to figure out that the "world's most interactive" title is no boast. To say that this place is a marvel of technological innovation is like saying teenage girls found Elvis attractive. Seven floors of touch-screens, theaters, film and video, state-of-the-art studios, computer games, interactive kiosks, documentary footage and hands-on multimedia exhibits are enough to give even my iPod-obsessed son, Rowan, a cramp in his very limber index finger."[tpl]cite news |first=Bonnie |last=Wach |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=SFGate |date=July 4, 2010 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/04/TRPU1DH7JS.DTL |title=D.C. in the Digital Age[/tpl]

==Hamas journalist controversy==

In the May 2013 rededication ceremony of the Journalist Memorial, the Newseum first decided to honor two Al Aqsa TV members as part of the memorial, and then withdrew them after criticism from pro-Israeli organizations.[tpl]cite web|title=Spotlight On Al Aqsa Television|url=http://blog.adl.org/international/spotlight-on-al-aqsa-television|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]
In May 2013, the Newseum announced that it would honor Hussam Salama and Mahmoud Al-Kumi, cameramen for Al-Aqsa TV, among the 84 journalists who lost their lives in 2012 and add them to the Newseum Journalists Memorial. Ilene Prusher, columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said that the Newseum stepped into the "minefield" of the Arab-Jewish conflict. Al-Aqsa TV is affiliated with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and they were killed by Israeli fire in a car marked "TV". Israeli Defense Forces spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, said that they were killed deliberately, not accidentally, because they "have relevance to terror activity.”Using War as Cover to Target Journalists, By DAVID CARR, New York Times, November 25, 2012 After pro-Israel groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, said that they were not journalists but terrorists, the Newseum first defended the decision and then reversed itself and eliminated them from the ceremony and the wall. Nearly all journalistic organizations hold that the men were killed in the line of duty, including The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, the International Federation of Journalists and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers. Human Rights Watch said that their investigation in Gaza showed no evidence that the men were involved in militant activity. Richard Engel, NBC’s chief foreign correspondent, said at the Newseum’s dedication ceremony that it was difficult to draw the line, and several reporters on the list were Syrians who were also activists who were trying to topple Bashar al-Assad's government.One man’s terrorist, another man’s freedom fighter - or journalist, by Ilene Prusher, Haaretz, May.17, 2013 David Carr, of the New York Times, said that "the evidence so far suggests that they were journalists, however partisan.”David Carr Defends Slain Journalists Claim; Israeli accounts challenged the Times columnist’s criticism of Israel for strikes that killed two men he described as journalists.
