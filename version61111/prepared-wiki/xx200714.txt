==Career==

Gabriel Cowan was originally a musician.  At 18, he worked with Robbie Robertson to score the film Jimmy Hollywood and signed a contract with Geffen Records.  He later formed a band with David Arquette that helped score Scream 2 and Scream 3.  After an unfulfilling career in which he scored television commercials, Cowan returned to school and graduated with a master's degree in film directing.  While at CalArts, he co-wrote and co-directed Breathing Room with John Suits, whom he met at film school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/40064/indie-filmmakers-watch-gabriel-cowan-talks-growth|title=Indie Filmmakers to Watch: Gabriel Cowan Talks Growth|last=Wixson|first=Heather|work=Dread Central|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2014-04-04[/tpl]  He also directed, shot, and produced Flower in the Gun Barrel, a documentary that explores the complexities of forgiveness and reconciliation in post genocide Rwanda.
