Ippolit Shpazhinsky's play The Enchantress was first produced in 1884 at the Maly Theatre in Moscow, and soon it had seen more performances than any other play being staged in Moscow or St Petersburg.  The actresses Maria Yermolova and Maria Savina were prominent in the title role of Nastasya ("Kuma").Bolshoi Press Office, 26 June 2012, Bolshoi to return "forgotten" Tchaikovsky's masterpiece, The Enchantress  Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky admired The EnchantressHenry Zajaczkowski, An Introduction to Tchaikovsky’s Operas and one scene in particular.  He pointed it out to his brother the composer, who proceeded to write a duet based on that scene.  Pyotr saw the play himself in January 1885, after which he wrote to Shpazhinsky, asking him to convert the drama to an opera libretto.  Shpazhinsky agreed, and the two men met that month to discuss the project,Tchaikovsky Research but the librettist's work was delayed by his divorce proceedings.  When the libretto was finally completed in August, it was far too long and Tchaikovsky had to radically cut it.  Even so, this opera was still the longest work he ever wrote.David Brown, Tchaikovsky: The Man and His Music

==Synopsis==

Time: The last quarter of the 15th century
Place: Nizhny Novgorod and its vicinity
The action takes place at the last quarter of the 15th century at a tavern and brothel near Nizhny Novgorod. Nastasia (Kuma), the charming owner of the inn, has made herself an enemy in rejecting the devious Mamyrov, the right-hand man of the local governor Nikita Danilovich Kurliatev. He spreads the gossip that Nastasia is an enchantress, and every man whom she meets falls for her. Yuri, Nikita's son, begins to frequent the inn, as does his father, who falls madly in love with Nastasia (without any success), who threatens her that he will reach his goal by whatever means. Mamyrov confronts Nikita's wife, Evpraksia, with the truth, while her son – not yet personally involved with Nastasia – swears to avenge his mother. While confronting Nastasia he learns that it is he whom she loves. They both plan to flee during the night not knowing that, by now, Mamyrov has worked out an elaborate plot to wreak his revenge on Nastasia as well as on Nikita and his family with devastating effect.
