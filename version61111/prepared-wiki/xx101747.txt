</ref> There have been no large [[seismic]] events centered close to Kaikoura since written records of the area began in about 1840 AD, but lichen-dating of rock-falls suggests that there may have been a major earthquake in the vicinity 175 years ago. This correlates with the estimated amount of time it would have taken to accumulate the present sediment deposits seen at the canyon head. Therefore the conclusion can be drawn that sediment in the canyon head gully failed and flowed down the canyon as a major [[turbidity current]] released by this earthquake.
A landslide-generated tsunami represents a large potential hazard to the area from South Bay to Oaro. An extreme event has been modelled incorporating failure of the entire landslide mass identified by [tpl]Harvcolnb|Lewis & Barnes|1999[/tpl]. These simulations indicate the potential for large tsunami runup heights along this section of coast. The effects could be more severe here if such an event coincided with storm activity or high tides.
It is estimated to take approximately a century to accumulate enough sediment in the canyon head to generate a major mass failure. Therefore there is already enough sediment to pose a significant hazard. Evidence of tensional cracks at the head of the modern deposit  indicate that it is likely to fail as a result of shaking associated with a major earthquake. Failure would result in the collapse of an estimated quarter of a cubic kilometre of unconsolidated sediment. 
The canyon-head gully of the Kaikoura Canyon faces northwards, obliquely towards the shore. Consequently the initial motion of a debris avalanche in the gully, and the resulting tsunami, is towards the shore of South Bay and the southern side of the Kaikoura Peninsula.
