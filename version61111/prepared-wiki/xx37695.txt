[[Power rule]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus, Articles containing proofs

In calculus, the power rule is one of the most important differentiation rules. Since differentiation is linear, polynomials can be differentiated using this rule.

==Power rule==

The power rule for integration 

===Proof===

Using this, we can see that 
Since the division has been eliminated and we have a continuous function, we can freely substitute to find the limit:

==Differentiation of arbitrary polynomials==

To differentiate arbitrary polynomials, one can use the linearity property of the  differential operator to obtain:
Using the linearity of integration and the power rule for integration, one shows in the same way that 

==Generalizations==

One can prove that the power rule is valid for any exponent [tpl]mvar|r[/tpl], that is
as long as [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] is in the domain of the functions on the left and right hand sides and [tpl]mvar|r[/tpl] is nonzero. Using this formula, together with
one can differentiate and integrate linear combinations of powers of [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl] which are not necessarily polynomials.
