West Credit Secondary School is a high school in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. It is a workplace destination for the Peel District School Board. Its cousin school, North Peel Secondary School is a high school in Brampton, Ontario, Canada that offers a similarity in trades courses. West Credit and North Peel are currently the only two vocational schools in the Peel District School Board that offer students more choices in trades courses than most other regular high schools. It is aimed for students who want to pursue a career in the trades, or sometimes it is recommended for those with learning developmental disabilities such as Attention-Deficit Disorder and other learning problems that are influenced in the students. The 'special' kind students are thought to learn more visually, and by learning more with hands-on training. Both high schools offer applied and academic courses that are usually more simple and easier to learn than most regular high schools. Students can right away earn apprenticeships and start working right away in their respected workplace destinations upon completing and graduating to earn their high school diplomas. 
West Credit School has been criticized for lack of action by school administrators with regard to bullying incidents. A Grade 10 student, Lindsay Hyde, was forced to transfer to another school after her bullying ordeal was reported on torontosun.com and canoe.ca."I am going through Hell", retrieved 27 February 2008
