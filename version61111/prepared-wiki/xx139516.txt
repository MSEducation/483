===Toponymy===

Deane's name comes from the Old English word "denu" - meaning valley.Billington(1982), In earlier times Deane was written without the final "e".  The stream running in the valley to the west of the present church was given the Saxon name of Kirkbroke - meaning Church Brook.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.deaneparish.co.uk/history/historyM1.asp|title=Deane Parish |publisher=deaneparish.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] The valley is also referred to as Deane Clough, "cloh" was Old English for a ravine or deep valley.Mills(1998),p.402

===George Marsh===

Protestant martyr, George Marsh, a farmer's son, was born in Deane in 1515. When Edward VI became King in 1547, Marsh's study of the New Testament led to his appointment as a preaching minister. When Edward VI died in 1553, his half-sister Mary I became Queen. She sought to re-establish Roman Catholicism, Marsh became victim to her persecution of the reformers. He appeared before Justice Barton at Smithills Hall accused of preaching false doctrines. However he made a stand for his beliefs, he was tried and convicted. He was imprisoned at Chester and finally burnt at the stake April 24, 1555.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.deaneparish.co.uk/history/history315.asp|title=George Marsh |publisher=deaneparish.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/main/11_1563_1122.jsp|title=George Marsh, martyr |publisher=hrionline.ac.uk |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] A memorial was erected in the churchyard in 1893, it is a Grade II listed structure.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=476085|title=George Marsh Memorial|publisher=Images of england|accessdate=30 January 2010[/tpl]

==Governance==

Lying within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire since the early 12th century, the Parish of Deane was subdivided into townships in 1660. The ten townships were Horwich, Halliwell, Heaton, Rumworth (where Deane Parish Church is situated), Westhoughton, Over Hulton, Middle Hulton, Little Hulton, Farnworth and Kearsley.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=52988&filename=fig1.gif&pubid=485|title=Deane Map |publisher=british-history.ac.uk |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] 
In 1837 Rumworth along with neighbouring townships (or civil parishes) became part of the Bolton Poor Law Union which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Bolton/Bolton.shtml | title =BoltonPLU| publisher = workhouses.org.uk| accessdate = 28 November 2009[/tpl] In the 19th century many of the Deane townships became independent civil parishes and were merged into Bolton Borough. In 1872 part of Rumworth township became part of Bolton Borough, the remainder of Rumworth (which included Deane Parish Church) was renamed Deane township in 1894 and in 1898 it too was merged into the County Borough of Bolton.
