==Corporate history==

Evergreen Investments traced its history to the brand name of Keystone Investments, which was first founded in 1932.http://www.wellsfargoadvantagefunds.com/wfweb/wf/portal/overview/history.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&sel=/portal/portaloverview/portalhistory  
Keystone Investments: 1932-1996
Keystone Investments created one of the first mutual fund families in 1932.  It was employee-owned and operated until its merger with, First Union owned, Evergreen Funds.  Keystone offered more than 25 retail mutual funds. 
Keystone-Evergreen Merger: 1996-1998
First Union Corporation, the parent company of the legacy Evergreen Funds, acquired the Keystone Fund Family and began the Evergreen-Keystone merger in 1996. The merger brought together the strengths of two industry leaders and by 1997 the Evergreen and Keystone funds were integrated under the surviving Evergreen brand name that would offer over 80 retail and institutional mutual funds.  
The full merger was completed by January 1998.  In that same year Evergreen Funds begins to operate with two sub divisions: the Retail Company and the Institutional Company.
Tattersall Advisory Group
In 1999, Evergreen acquired the Tattersall Advisory Group (TAG), an investment advisory firm specializing in fixed income management, as wholly owned, freestanding subsidiary of Evergreen Funds 
First Union – Wachovia, Merger of Equals
On August 3, 2001, legacy Wachovia Corporation shareholders approved a "merger of equals" deal with Evergreen Fund's umbrella company, First Union Corporation, to create the new Wachovia Corporation, of which Evergreen remains a subsidiary.  The new entity shed the name of First Union and assumed the Wachovia identity and stock ticker. Analysts said this move was most likely to help First Union acquire a new identity, as Wachovia's reputation was far better with consumers than First Union. 
Due to the "merger of equals" Evergreen Funds and the legacy Wachovia mutual funds were merged to form and operate as the current existing Evergreen Funds. 
Evergreen Investments
In 2002 Evergreen Retail and Institutional companies form and begin to operate under the umbrella asset management organization named Evergreen Investment Management Company, LLC.  Evergreen mutual funds are now distributed by Evergreen Investment Services, Inc. and Evergreen Service Company, LLC is the transfer agent for the Evergreen Funds.
