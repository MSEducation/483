[[Mahlo cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In mathematics, a Mahlo cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number.  Mahlo cardinals were first described by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink= Paul Mahlo|first=Paul|last=Mahlo|year1=1911|year2=1912|year3=1913[/tpl].  As with all large cardinals,  none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proved to exist by ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent).
A cardinal number κ is called Mahlo if κ is inaccessible and the set U = {λ < κ: λ is inaccessible} is stationary in κ.
A cardinal κ is called weakly Mahlo if  κ is weakly inaccessible and the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ is stationary in κ.

==Minimal condition sufficient for a Mahlo cardinal==

The main difficulty in proving this is to show that κ is regular.  We will suppose that it is not regular and construct a club set which gives us a μ such that:  
If κ were not regular, then cf(κ) κ is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible.
We show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below κ is club in κ.  Let μ0 be the larger of the threshold and ω1.  For each finite n, let μn+1 = 2μn which is less than κ because it is a strong limit cardinal.  Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than κ by its regularity.  The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals.  So the set of them is club in κ.  Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than κ.

==Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals are hyper-inaccessible==

Suppose κ is Mahlo.  We proceed by transfinite induction on α to show that κ is α-inaccessible for any α ≤ κ.  Since κ is Mahlo, κ is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing.
If κ is α-inaccessible, then there are β-inaccessibles (for β If λ ≤ κ is a limit ordinal and κ is α-inaccessible for all α To show that κ is a limit of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need to show that the diagonal set of cardinals μ 0.  Then pick an α0-inaccessible, call it α1.  Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it μ.  Then μ has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of α-inaccessibles for all α The rest of the proof that κ is α-hyper-inaccessible mimics the proof that it is α-inaccessible.  So κ is hyper-hyper-inaccessible, etc..

==More than just Mahlo==

A cardinal κ is α-Mahlo for some ordinal α if and only if κ is Mahlo and for every ordinal βThe properties of being inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly Mahlo, α-Mahlo, greatly Mahlo, etc. are preserved if we replace the universe by an inner model.
