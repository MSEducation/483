==History==

Cleburne County was established on December 6, 1866, by an act of the state legislature.  The county was made from territory in Benton (now Calhoun), Randolph, and Talladega counties.  In 1867, Edwardsville was made the county seat.http://www.archives.state.al.us/counties/cleburne.html  An election was held in 1905 to move the county seat to Heflin.  The result of that election, which agreed to move the seat, was appealed to the Supreme Court, who decided on July 1, 1906, to uphold the election results.  Heflin is still the county seat.http://www.cityofheflin.org/
