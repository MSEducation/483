CATEGORIES: Sturgeons, Commercial fish

 
Sturgeon is the common name used for some 25 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae, including the genera Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. The term includes over 20 species commonly referred to as sturgeon and several closely related species that have distinct common names, notably sterlet, kaluga and beluga. Collectively, the family is also known as the true sturgeons. Sturgeon is sometimes used more exclusively to refer to the species in the two best-known genera, Acipenser and Huso.
One of the oldest families of bony fish in existence, sturgeon are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. They are distinctive for their elongated bodies, lack of scales, and occasional great size: sturgeons ranging from 7–12 feet (2-3½ m) in length are common, and some species grow up to [tpl]convert|18|ft|m|1[/tpl]. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders, spawning upstream and feeding in  river deltas and estuaries. While some are entirely freshwater, a very few venture into the open ocean beyond near coastal areas.
Several species of sturgeons are harvested for their roe, which is made into caviar — a luxury food which makes some sturgeons pound for pound the most valuable of all harvested fish. Because they are slow-growing and mature very late in life, they are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and to other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation. Most species of sturgeons are currently considered to be at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.

==Evolution==

Acipenseriform fishes appeared in the fossil record approximately 200 million years ago, around the very end of the Triassic, making them among the most ancient of actinopterygian fishes. True sturgeons appear in the fossil record during the Upper Cretaceous.  In that time, sturgeons have undergone remarkably little morphological change, indicating their evolution has been exceptionally slow and earning them informal status as living fossils.B. G. Gardiner (1984) Sturgeons as living fossils. Pp. 148–152 in N. Eldredge and S.M. Stanley, eds. Living fossils. Springer-Verlag, New York.J. Krieger and P.A. Fuerst. (2002) Evidence for a Slowed Rate of Molecular Evolution in the Order Acipenseriformes Molecular Biology and Evolution 19:891-897.  This is explained in part by the long generation  interval, tolerance for wide ranges of temperature and salinity, lack of predators due to size, and the abundance of prey items in the benthic environment. 
Despite the existence of a fossil record, full classification and phylogeny of the sturgeon species has been difficult to  determine, in part due to the high individual and ontogenic variation, including geographical clines in certain features, such as rostrum shape, number of scutes and body length.  A further confounding factor is the peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids, even between species assigned to different genera.  The wide range of the acipenserids and their endangered status have made collection of systematic materials difficult.  These factors have led researchers in the past to identify over 40 additional species that were rejected by later workers.W. E. Bemis, E. K. Findeis, and L. Grande. (1997). An overview of Acipenseriformes. Environmental Biology of Fishes 48:25–71.  It is still unclear whether the species in the Acipenser and Huso genera are monophyletic (descended from one ancestor) or paraphyletic (descended from many ancestors)—though it is clear that the morphologically motivated division between these two genera is not supported by the genetic evidence.  There is an ongoing effort to resolve the taxonomic confusion using a continuing synthesis of systematic data and molecular techniques.F. Fontana, J. Tagliavini, L. Congiu (2001) Sturgeon genetics and cytogenetics: recent advancements and perspectives.  Genetica 111: 359–373

==Physical characteristics==

Along with other members of the subclass Chondrostei, sturgeon are primarily cartilaginous, lack vertebral centra, and are partially covered with bony plates called scutes rather than scales.  They also have four barbels—tactile organs that precede their toothless mouth and are dragged along often murky river bottoms. Sturgeon are distinctly and immediately recognizable for their elongated bodies, flattened rostra, distinctive scutes and barbels, and elongated upper tail lobes.
They are primarily benthic feeders.  With their projecting, wedge-shaped snouts, they stir up the soft bottom, and use the barbels to detect shells, crustaceans and small fish, on which they feed. Having no teeth, they are unable to seize prey, though larger specimens can swallow very large prey items, including whole salmon.Sergei F. Zolotukhin and Nina F. Kaplanova. (2007) Injuries of Salmon in the Amur River and its Estuary as an Index of the Adult Fish Mortality in the Period of Sea Migrations.  NPAFC Technical Report No. 4. http://www.npafc.org/new/publications/Technical%20Report/TR4/page%2067-69(Zolotukhin).pdf
Sturgeon have been referred to as both the Leviathans and Methuselahs of freshwater fish. They are among the largest fish: some beluga (Huso huso) in the Caspian Sea reportedly attain over 5.5 m (18 ft) and 2000 kgFrimodt, C., (1995). Multilingual illustrated guide to the world's commercial coldwater fish. Fishing News Books, Osney Mead, Oxford, England. 215 p. (4400 lbs.) while for kaluga (H. dauricus) in the Amur River, similar lengths and over 1000 kg (2200 lb) weights have been reported.Krykhtin, M.L. and V.G. Svirskii (1997). Endemic sturgeons of the Amur River: kaluga, Huso dauricus, and Amur sturgeon, Acipenser schrenckii. Environ. Biol. Fish. 48(1/4):231-239. They are also among the longest lived of the fishes, some living well over 100 years and attaining sexual maturity at 20 years or more.Berg, L.S. (1962). Freshwater fishes of the U.S.S.R. and adjacent countries. volume 1, 4th edition. Israel Program for Scientific Translations Ltd, Jerusalem. (Russian version published 1948).  The combination of slow growth and reproductive rates and the extremely high value placed on mature, egg-bearing females make sturgeon particularly vulnerable to overfishing.
Sturgeons are polyploid; some species have four, eight, or 16 sets of chromosomes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://biology.mcgill.ca/undergra/c465a/biodiver/2000/shortnose-sturgeon/shortnose-sturgeon.htm |title=Shortnose Sturgeon|author=Anderson, Rachel|accessdate=2007-08-23 |year=2004 |publisher=McGill University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024153413/http://biology.mcgill.ca/undergra/c465a/biodiver/2000/shortnose-sturgeon/shortnose-sturgeon.htm  |archivedate = 2007-10-24[/tpl]

==Range and habitat==

Sturgeon range from subtropical to subarctic waters in North America and Eurasia.  In North America, they range along the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of Mexico to Newfoundland, including the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as along the West Coast in major rivers from California to British Columbia.  They occur along the European Atlantic coast, including the Mediterranean basin, in the rivers that flow into the Black, Azov and Caspian Seas (Danube, Dnepr, Volga and Don), the north-flowing rivers of Russia that feed the Arctic Ocean (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma), in the rivers of Central Asia (Amu Darya and Syr Darya) and Lake Baikal.  In the Pacific Ocean, they are found in the Amur River along the Russian-Chinese border, on Sakhalin island, and in the Yangtze and other rivers in northeast China.
Throughout this extensive range, almost all species are highly threatened or vulnerable to extinction due to a combination of habitat destruction, overfishing and pollution.
No species are known to naturally occur south of the equator, though attempts at sturgeon aquaculture are being made in Uruguay, South Africa and other places.LA. Burtzev (1999) The History of Global Sturgeon Aquaculture.  Journal of Applied Ichthyology 15 (4-5), 325–325. [tpl]doi|10.1111/j.1439-0426.1999.tb00336.x[/tpl]
Most species are at least partially anadromous, spawning in fresh water and feeding in nutrient-rich, brackish waters of estuaries or undergoing significant migrations along coastlines.  However, some species have evolved purely freshwater existences, such as the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and the Baikal sturgeon (A. baerii baicalensis), or have been forced into them by anthropogenic or natural impoundment of their native rivers, as in the case of some subpopulations of white sturgeon (A. transmontanus) in the Columbia RiverS.

==Conservation status==

Because of their long reproductive cycles, long migrations, and sensitivity to environmental conditions, many species are under severe threat from overfishing,Clover, Charles. 2004.

ISBN 0-09-189780-7 poaching, water pollution and damming of rivers.Pallid Sturgeon - Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks  According to the IUCN, over 85% of sturgeon species are classified as at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.iucn.org/?4928|title=Sturgeon more critically endangered than any other group of species |author= |date= 18 March 2010 |work= |publisher= IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl]Species, status and population trend of Sturgeon on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (pdf)

==Uses==

Globally, sturgeon fisheries are of great value, primarily as a source for caviar, but also for flesh.
Before 1800, swim bladders of sturgeon (primarily Beluga sturgeon from Russia) were used as a source of isinglass, a form of collagen used historically for the clarification of beer, as a predecessor for gelatin, and to preserve parchments.[tpl]cite book | last = Davidson | first = Alan | title = Oxford Companion to Food | year = 1999  | isbn = 0-19-211579-0 | pages = 407 | chapter = "Isinglass"[/tpl]
The Jewish law of kashrut, which only permits the consumption of fish with scales, forbids sturgeon, as they have ganoid scales instead of the permitted ctenoid and cycloid scales. While all Orthodox groups forbid the consumption of sturgeon, some conservative groups do allow it.http://cor.ca/en/15#12http://www.bluethread.com/kashrut/sturgeon.html  The theological debate over its kosher status can be traced back to such 19th-century reformers as Aron Chorin, though its consumption was already common in European Jewish communities.[tpl]cite book | last = Lupovich | first = Howard | title = Jews and Judaism in World History | year = 2010  | isbn = 0-203-86197-3 | pages = 258 | chapter = 7[/tpl]  It remains a high-end staple of many Jewish delicatessen and some speciality food shops.
In England and Wales, the sturgeon, along with whales and porpoises, is a royal fish, and every sturgeon caught in those countries is the property of the Crown.

==Classification==

In currently accepted taxonomy, the family Acipenseridae is subdivided into two subfamilies, Acipenserinae, including the genera Acipenser and Huso, and Scaphirhynchinae, including the genera Scaphirhynchus and Pseudosaphirhynchus.[tpl]FishBase order | order = Acipenseriformes | year = 2007 | month = 12[/tpl]
