[[Principle of least motion]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry

In organic chemistry, the principle of least motion is the hypothesis that when multiple species with different nuclear structures could theoretically form as products of a given chemical reaction, the more likely to form tends to be the one requiring the least amount of change in nuclear structure or the smallest change in nuclear positions.[tpl]Cite journal| author =Hine J | title = The principle of least nuclear motion | journal = Advances in Physical Organic Chemistry | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 1â€“61 | year = 1977 | pmid = | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3160(08)60117-3| url =  [/tpl]
