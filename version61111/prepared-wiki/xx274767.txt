Gilmore College, formerly known as Kwinana Senior High School, is a public co-educational high school in Western Australia. The school is located on Dargin Place in the suburb of Orelia.
The school was established in 1956[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/schoolsonline/main_page.do?displayURL=overview.do&schoolID=4031|title=Department of Education Schools online|year=2010|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] and caters for students in Year 7 to 12. 
The number of student enrolments have been erratic over the last five years. The school enrolled 780 students in 2007, then 1204 in 2008, to 1075 in 2009, then fell to 986 in 2010 and to 957 in 2011. The fall in student numbers from 2010 is a result of the enrolment age changing for students entering high school in Western Australia.
In 2003, the minister of education of the day, Alan Carpenter, announced a [tpl]AUD[/tpl]26 million plan to improve educational opportunities for Kwinana youth.
The school was renamed from Kwinana Senior High School to Gilmore College in 2006 following a poll in the local community in 2005. The school's name is taken from the road the school was once located on, Gilmore Avenue. This in turn was taken from the boat that the early settlers arrived in the area aboard in 1892.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gilmorecollege.det.wa.edu.au/news.html|title=Gilmore College - Latest News|year=2010|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl]

A fire began in the school under suspicious circumstances in February 2008 causing extensive damage to the school, estimated at [tpl]AUD[/tpl]500,000. Three classrooms and part of a hallway were engulfed and smoke damage occurred in other areas.
