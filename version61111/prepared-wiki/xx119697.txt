CATEGORIES: Welsh folk songs, Year of song unknown

Dafydd y Garreg Wen is a traditional Welsh air and folk song.
David Owen, the famous harper and composer, lived near Porthmadog in Caernarfonshire, Wales in the first half of the 18th century, who was known locally as Dafydd y Garreg Wen, ([tpl]Lang-en|David of the White Rock[/tpl]). The epithet Y Garreg Wen ([tpl]Lang-en|The White Rock[/tpl]) was the name of the farm near Morfa Bychan in which he lived.
Tradition has it that as Owen lay on his death bed, he called for his harp and composed the haunting air. He died at the age of 29 and was buried at St Cynhaearn's Church near Porthmadog.Befriend a church, BBC North Wales, accessed 5 August 2010
The words were added nearly a hundred years later in by the poet John Ceiriog Hughes.
A more literal translation would be:-
Another version of this song begins with the line, "David, the Bard, on his bed of death lies", and continues with the second line of the verse being, "Pale are his features, and dim are his eyes". Owen is also well known for his air Codiad yr Ehedydd ([tpl]Lang-en|Rising of the lark[/tpl]).
In 1923 the British Broadcasting Company made its first broadcast in Wales, from "Station 5WA" in Cardiff. Mostyn Thomas opened the programme, singing Dafydd y Garreg Wen, and so it became the very first Welsh language song to play on the air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21426191|title=Broadcasting in Wales: 90 years since BBC went on air|first=Neil|last=Prior|date=13 February 2013|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl]
