Blue Shield of California, then known as California Physicians' Service, was created by the California Medical Association on December 18, 1938,https://www.blueshieldca.com/bsc/newsroom/newsroom_02.jhtml and was incorporated on February 2, 1939.  The organization began offering coverage on March 6 of that same year.  In 1946, the organization was among a founder of the National Association of Blue Shield Plans, which later became the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.  Today, Blue Shield of California is an independent licensee of the national association.
The Blue Shield of California health plan was the first in the nation to offer catastrophic coverage in 1950, provide coverage for a heart transplant in 1984, offer online benefit and enrollment information in 1996, and offer an online enrollment system for agents in 1998.  In 2006, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, commonly referred to as NCQA, recently recognized Blue Shield as an "excellent" health plan for service and clinical quality.http://hprc.ncqa.org/resultdetails.asp?Plan=Blue+Shield+of+California&PL=Commercial&RP=HMO%2FPOS+Combined&ID=163&ST=MCO&txtPageNo=1&From=R
