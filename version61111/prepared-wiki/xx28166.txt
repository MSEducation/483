Sosthenes (Greek, "safe in strength") was the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth, who, according to the New Testament, was seized and beaten by the mob in the presence of Gallio, the Roman governor, when he refused to proceed against Paul at the instigation of the Jews (Acts 18:12-17). The motives of this assault against Sosthenes are not recorded. Some manuscripts insert the mob was composed of "Greeks" others read "Jews". Both are interpolations, since the oldest manuscripts do not specify or identify the attacking group.
Some identify him with one whom Paul calls "Sosthenes our brother," a convert to the faith and co-author of the First Epistle to the Corinthians ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|1:1-2[/tpl]). It is not clear whether this identification is tenable. It has also been alleged that Sosthenes is a later name of Crispus, who is mentioned in Acts 18:8 and 1 Corinthians 1:14. http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/corpus-paul/20021207/003367.html
He is listed among the Seventy Disciples.
