Good Shoes are a four-piece English indie rock band, hailing from Morden, London.

==Biography==

Good Shoes was formed by lead singer Rhys Jones and guitarist Steve Leach who often wrote and played music together as a hobby. Rhys and Steve appeared as a two piece under the Good Shoes name for a friend's charity gig (Tom-Fest) at a venue in Kingston called The Peel in early January 2004. Eventually, they decided to formalise their hobby into a fully-fledged band, bringing in Rhys's brother Tom and then later Joel Cox (who was friends with Jones and Leach from secondary school - Raynes Park High School).
The band started looking for gigs in January 2005, their first gig was put on by a friend at Fitzwilliam College Cambridge University on 1 February.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] Their second was at a secret party on Eel Pie Island with Mystery Jets and from then on they played as many gigs as possible in and around London. This led to them playing the Artrocker clubnight in August put on by Artrocker Magazine. At this gig, the band were recommended to their current label, Brille Records, by a member of the band FC Kahuna, and after playing In The City music festival in Manchester they signed with Brille in November 2005. John Kennedy (a DJ at London-based radio station Xfm) started to give the band airtime based on a demo which was recorded in the band's shed[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl], and a new demo, recorded at Southern Studios started to get the band recognition from stations like Radio 1, 6 Music and other mainstream radio stations, with both Steve Lamacq and Zane Lowe playing the demo.
The band travelled to Malmö, Sweden to record their first album, called Think Before You Speak, with Per Sunding at Tambourine Studios. It was released 26 March 2007.
On 28 May 2007, the band performed a secret free gig at Morden Park bandstand. The bandstand and other landmarks from the local area are featured in the video for their single "Morden", which was released on 11 June 2007.On October 23, 2011 this band has performed at BITS Pilani campus.
The band toured during 2007 with Kaiser Chiefs and The Rakes (other support bands included The Pigeon Detectives, Little Ones and We Are Scientists). In November 2007, they headlined a tour with support from Lightspeed Champion, also the band supported Maxïmo Park at their homecoming arena show on 15 December 2007.
The band stayed relatively low during 2008. They appeared for a small number of live shows, including a secret supporting slot to friends The Maccabees. Their main debut of new material was at their only UK festival appearance, Boring by the Sea Festival, which took place in Weymouth. They ended the year with two gigs at The Watershed in Wimbledon on 13 December, followed by an appearance at New Slang in Kingston upon Thames on 18 December 2008.
Cox left the band as the band started writing their second album, and for the recording of the album their friend, Bob Matthews, recorded the bass parts on the album.
Matthews is another South West Londoner. Born in Kingston, he played in various bands (Evil Twin, Iris) in local venues including the Peel, before becoming a founder of Right Turn Left while at Exeter University. After the recording sessions finished he went back to playing for Right Turn Left.
The band released a free download of "The Way My Heart Beats" on 18 August 2009, as a first taste of the second album due for release in January 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/97455/good_shoes|title=Good Shoes - The Way My Heart Beats - Music-News.com|accessdate=2009-08-28|date=2009-08-24|publisher=idiomag[/tpl] On the same weekend they played Dockville Festival in Germany which saw the second appearance of their new bass player Will Church.
