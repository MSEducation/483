==Automobile in duties==

In December 1905, Smith, health officer of Syracuse, "runs a gasoline runabout" in the discharge of his duties. The machine was owned by the doctor, but he used it "about as much for the city as for himself." In the epidemic of scarlet fever which swept over the city in the spring and summer of 1904, the automobile "played a prominent part." Before the city officials knew it, there were hundreds of cases of the fever in the city and "strenuous efforts were in order to check the spread of the disease." Hundreds of homes were visited by Smith in his automobile and he "may be ascribed much of the progress which the city officials made in stamping out the disease."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-goAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA855&lpg=PA855&dq=%22majestic+automobile+company%22&source=bl&ots=McyTIyXXxj&sig=TyV312kLH-PxaNtK0Bjg0t80SXo&hl=en&ei=v7BaTq33DtHfsQL7j-SNDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=syracuse&f=false |title=Pierce-Racine |accessdate=August 28, 2011|work=|publisher=E.
