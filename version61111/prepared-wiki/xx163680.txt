Gazelle Valley is named for a herd of about 17 gazelles of the subspecies Gazella gazella gazella that live in this area, bounded by urban development. Real estate developers have sought building rights in the area, but the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI) and local activists have fought to preserve the natural surroundings.http://www.sustainable-jerusalem.org/old_site/jerusaleme/envir3.html Sustainable Jerusalem Coalition After lengthy court battles, the Jerusalem Municipality has drawn up plans to turn the area into a public park and nature reserve.
