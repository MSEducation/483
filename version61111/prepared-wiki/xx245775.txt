[[Yang–Mills–Higgs equations]]

CATEGORIES: Partial differential equations

In mathematics, the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations are a set of non-linear partial differential equations for a Yang–Mills field, given by a connection, and a Higgs field, given by a section of a vector bundle. These equations are 
with a boundary condition 
These equations are named after Chen Ning Yang, Robert Mills, and Peter Higgs.
