Dick's Picks Volume 5 is the fifth live album in the Dick's Picks series of releases by the Grateful Dead. It was recorded on December 26, 1979 at the Oakland Auditorium Arena in Oakland, California. It was released in May 1996.
This concert was a benefit for the Seva Foundation, an organization started by Ram Dass and Wavy Gravy.  Bob Weir still sits on the advisory board today.
Volume 5 was the first of the Dick's Picks to contain a complete concert.  It was also the first to feature keyboardist Brent Mydland.
Another Grateful Dead album that was recorded at the December 1979 run of concerts at the Oakland Auditorium is Road Trips Volume 3 Number 1.

==Caveat Emptor==

Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording.  The label for Volume 5 reads:
"This compact disc has been digitally remastered directly from the original half track stereo analog tape. It is a snapshot of history, not a modern professional recording, and may therefore exhibit some technical anomalies and the unavoidable effects of the ravages of time."
