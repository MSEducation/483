He starred in both theatre and film productions, mainly before World War II.

Dymsza was born Adolf Bagiński on 7 April 1900 in Warsaw, then in Russian Empire, to Adolf Sr. and Matylda née Połądkiewicz. At the age of 15 he worked as a busboy in some of Warsaw's cabarets. He graduated from a local II Gymnasium and then studied at the Hipolit Wawelberg's Trade School. During World War I and the subsequent Polish-Bolshevik War he started his career as a dancer in cabarets and theatres of Warsaw, Minsk and Grodno. He returned to Warsaw after the war, but no theatre would hire him and he spend several years giving dance lessons and occasionally singing in cabarets. It is speculated that he might have appeared in a number of silent films in that period, none of them survive to our times however. 
His debut came in 1925, when he was hired by the famous Qui Pro Quo cabaret as a singer and dancer,[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Mercury House | last = Nowicki | first = Ron | title = Warsaw: the cabaret years | year = 1992 | pages = 70–81[/tpl] "immediately conquering the audience with his natural juvenile wit and temperamental performances of Warsaw street types." He remained part of Qui Pro Quo's crew until 1931, appearing on stage along such stars of contemporary Polish cabaret and cinema as Marian Hemar, Eugeniusz Bodo, Hanka Ordonówna, Mieczysław Fogg, Mira Zimińska, Zula Pogorzelska and Fryderyk Jarosy. 
Initially rarely seen on screen, Dymsza first made a name for himself as an excellent comedian in Warsaw's cabarets in the 1920s.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = |date=May 1958 | title =Polish cinema | journal =Polish perspectives | volume =1 | issue = | page =81 | issn =0032-2962 | url = | publisher = Polski Instytut Spraw Międzynarodowych [/tpl] In 1930 he starred in the first of his films: the Wiatr od morza and Niebezpieczny romans. Altogether, in the inter-war period, Dymsza appeared in 24 feature sound films, acting the leads for the most part.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Polonia Publishing House | last = Banaszkiewicz | first = Władysław | title = Contemporary Polish cinematography | year = 1962 | page = 11[/tpl] Many of them were cheap comedies and farces, replete with songs and music and a few excellent actors such as Adolf Dymsza.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-20617-5 | last = Berend | first = Tibor Iván | title = Decades of crisis: Central and Eastern Europe before World War II | year = 1998 | page=385[/tpl] Modern critics consider some of those films remarkable only because of the performance of Dymsza.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 978-0-253-33813-6 | author = Bolesław Michałek|author2= Frank Turaj | title = The modern cinema of Poland | date = September 1988 | page = 15[/tpl] A popular actor in film comedies, he recorded very few of the great hits from his cabaret and film performances. 
After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland, Dymsza ignored the Polish actors' boycott and worked in the Nazi-administered cabarets of Warsaw.
 "Yet, after 1945 when Second World War was over, his disloyal attitude to the patriotic attitude was quickly forgotten by Polish fans of his talent. Perhaps, need to laugh again was strong enough in the society so deeply traumatised by the atrocities of war, and Dymsza's talent in evoking happy-go-lucky air of the past Warsaw street was highly desirable. Also, rather proletaryan style of his roles was a helpful circumstance in revival of his career in a postwar communist Poland. After few years of being banned from public performing in Warsaw, in 1951 Dymsza was back on stage of the Warsaw comedy theatre "Syrena" and in the movies." 
In 1958 he toured USA and Canada with Kabaret Wagabunda.[tpl]pl[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal|journal=Przekrój|date=February 1959|issue=724[/tpl]
Late in his years he retired to a care house in Góra Kalwaria, where he died on 20 August 1975. He is buried at Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery.
