Since 2002, online independent media and tabloids have played an important role in political discourse within Chinese society. Many Chinese intellectuals have used the Internet to discuss the possible evolution of Chinese politics. The OCI is a group of such intellectuals whose website contained essays about constitutional issues and the protection of citizen's rights. One notable lawyer who is part of the group is Xu Zhiyong.
On 8 June 2004, Chinese internet authorities shut down its web site without specifying a precise reason.Chinese rule-of-law website shut down, lawyer says. AFP, June 7, 2004
The crackdown came during a time of heightened political tension regarding the Taiwan Straits and the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and also during events symbolic of China's increasing international interdependence, such as the visit of the Greek Olympian envoy.
In 2009, the organization published a report criticising the Chinese government's policy towards Tibet, alleging that propaganda is being used to mask failings in its Tibet policy, such as ethnic inequality and creating "an aristocracy of corrupt and abusive government officials".Chinese tell of Tibet failures, The Age, May 22, 2009EDITORIAL: The KMT and Chinese democracy, Taipei Times, May 23, 2009 It has been regarded as a more balanced view of the situation in Tibet and has had approval circulating through discussion websites in China, though the Chinese government has yet to comment.Chinese report on Tibet reveals the roots of unrest, The Daily Telegraph, May 22, 2009
