===Watergate Hotel and Office Building===

The Watergate Hotel and Office Building is the best-known of the five buildings in the Watergate development.

====Hotel====

Management and ownership of the hotel has fluctuated since the mid-1980s. Cunard Line, the cruise ship company, took over management of the hotel in 1986 and began redecorating and refurbishing the property."Cunard to Manage Watergate." The Washington Post. April 17, 1986. The British Coal Board pension fund sold the hotel portion of the building to a British-Japanese consortium in 1990 for $48 million. Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, the real estate affiliate of the Blackstone Group, bought the hotel for $39 million in July 1998. For a few years in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the Watergate Hotel was operated by the Swissôtel hotel group. But the hotel underperformed other Swissôtel operations of similar size, location, and price. Jean-Louis Palladin's eponymous restaurant in the building closed in 1996.Asimov, Eric. "Jean-Louis Palladin, 55, a French Chef With Verve, Dies." The New York Times. November 26, 2001. The hotel subsequently underwent a renovation in 2000. Swissôtel was purchased by Raffles Hotels and Resorts, and Raffles' management contract ended in May 2002. Blackstone began managing the hotel, and put it up for sale in the fall of 2002 (with an asking price of $50 million to $68 million). Monument Realty bought the hotel for $45 million in 2004 and planned to turn it into luxury apartment co-ops.Rein, Lisa. "No Buyer for Watergate at Auction." The Washington Post. July 22, 2009.Rein, Lisa and Ricard, Martin. "A Wilted Watergate Awaits Highest Bidder at Auction." The Washington Post. July 19, 2009. But many residents in other parts of the complex (some of whom owned the 25 percent of the hotel not sold to Blackstone) argued that a hotel would better enhance the livability of the area and challenged the conversion in court.Hart, Kim. "Watergate Hotel May Not Go Co-Op After All." The Washington Post. February 26, 2007.Lengel, Allan. "Watergate Hotel Shuts Down to Spruce Up." The Washington Post. August 6, 2007. The hotel closed on August 1, 2007, for a $170 million 18-month renovation, during which the hotel rooms were intended to be roughly doubled in size to [tpl]convert|650|sqft|m2[/tpl]. But the renovation never occurred, and the building sat empty—consuming $100,000 to $150,000 a month in security, heating, electricity, water, and other costs. Lehman Brothers, Monument Realty's financing partner, went bankrupt in 2008 and Monument was forced to attempt to sell the property. No buyer emerged and the Blackstone Group regained ownership of the hotel.
The Blackstone Group transferred the Watergate Hotel to its Trizec Properties subsidiary. Trizec did not pay the hotel's property taxes for 2008 (which amounted to $250,000), and estimated that it would take $100 million to make the hotel habitable due to the stalled 2007 renovation. The hotel was put on the market in May 2009, but once again no buyer emerged. The hotel was auctioned off on July 21, 2009 (with the minimum bid beginning at $1 million), but there were no buyers and Deutsche Postbank, which held the $40 million mortgage on the property, took over ownership. The bank began marketing the property for sale, and Monument Realty submitted a bid in October 2009 to buy the hotel back.Rein, Lisa. "Monument Realty Will Buy Back Foreclosed Watergate Hotel." Washington Post. December 18, 2009. Monument was outbid by developer Robert Holland and the Jumeirah Group (a luxury hotel chain based in Dubai), but the deal collapsed in November 2009 when financing fell through. Euro Capital Properties purchased the hotel in May 2010 for $45 million, with plans to rehabilitate it over the next two years.Rein, Lisa. "Watergate Hotel Sold." Washington Post. May 27, 2010. Accessed 2011-11-25.
Euro Capital announced its year-long, $85 million renovation of the hotel in January 2013. Among the improvements it wished to make were the addition of six outdoor "summer gardens" where liquor may be served. The plan would require the approval of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which voted to protest the liquor licenses unless the company reached an agreement with all the tenant associations in the Watergate condominiums.Sernovitz, Daniel J. "Watergate Hotel Owners Estimate Spring 2014 Reopening." Washington Business Journal. January 24, 2013. Accessed 2013-02-04. A year later, the company said its design team, led by the architectural firm BBGM, had completed a plan to increase the number of luxury hotel rooms to 348 from 251, renovate the lobby to add a bar and lounge, add a restaurant with some outdoor seating, and add a rooftop bar with a small water feature. Euro Capital also said it would seek a hotel management company to continue to operate the Watergate Hotel as an independent hotel. Construction on the new interior elements is planned to start in March 2014.Cooper, Rebecca. "Watergate Hotel Renovation to Include Nearly 100 More Luxury Rooms." Washington Business Journal. January 14, 2014. Accessed 2014-01-14.

====Office building====

The office building portion of the building contains [tpl]convert|198000|sqft|m2[/tpl].  
In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) occupied the entire sixth floor of the 11-story building at 2600 Virginia Avenue.Lewis, Alfred E. "5 Held in Plot to Bug Democrats' Office Here." The Washington Post. June 18, 1972.Kessler, Pamela. Undercover Washington: Where Famous Spies Lived, Worked, and Loved. Sterling, Va.: Capital Books, 2005. ISBN 1-931868-97-2 The DNC had occupied the space since the building opened in 1967. On May 28, 1972, a team of burglars working for President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign bugged the phones of and took photos in and near the DNC chairman's office.Emery, Fred. Watergate. Paperback ed. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995. ISBN 0-684-81323-8 The phone taps were monitored from the burglars' rooms (first Room 419, later Room 723) at the Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge across the street at 2601 Virginia Avenue NW.As of 2005, the hotel was owned by The George Washington University and used as a dormitory for graduate students. See: Kessler, Undercover Washington: Where Famous Spies Lived, Worked, and Loved, 2005. During a second burglary on June 17, 1972, to replace a malfunctioning phone tap and collect more information, five of the burglars were arrested and the Watergate scandal began to unfold.Szulc, Tad. "Democratic Raid Tied to Realtor." The New York Times. June 19, 1972. A plaque on the sixth floor of the office building portion of the Watergate Hotel commemorates the break-in.Carrier, Thomas J. Washington, D.C.: A Historical Walking Tour. Mt. Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-7385-0049-6
The break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters was not the first break-in at the Watergate. The first break-in, however, shares a remarkable connection with the DNC burglary. The first break-in at the complex was the burglary of a residential unit in 1969."Nixon Secretary Reports Looting." The Washington Post. March 3, 1969. The victim was Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's personal secretary. The burglars took jewelry and some personal items. Woods would later be accused of erasing 18 and a half minutes from President Nixon's secret Oval Office audio taping system—specifically, the tape from June 20, 1972, that proved central to the Watergate scandal.
In 1993, the British coal board pension fund sold the office portion of the building (as well as the land under two of the three Watergate apartment buildings) to The JBG Companies (an American firm) and Buvermo Properties Inc. (a Dutch company). In 1997, JBG Cos. and Buvermo Properties sold the office building to the Blackstone Group's Trizec Properties division.Haggerty, Maryann. "JBG Selling 21 Buildings to Canadian Company." The Washington Post. September 30, 1997. Trizec put the office building up for sale for $100 million in 2005 and sold it to BentleyForbes Acquisitions LLC, a private firm owned by C. Frederick Wehba and members of the Los Angeles-based Webha family. BentleyForbes put the office tower up for sale on March 12, 2009.Hedgpeth, Dana. "Real Estate Firm Puts Watergate Office Tower Up for Sale." The Washington Post. March 13, 2009. In November 2011, after 20 months on the market, the office building sold for $76 million to the Penzance Cos.O'Connell, Jonathan. "Source: Penzance Lands Watergate Offices for $76 Million." Washington Post. November 22, 2011.
In mid-2012, the office building's new owner began a multi-million dollar upgrade to the Watergate Office Building's lobby, common areas, and Virginia Avenue entrance. The modernization was complete in December 2012, and the building began leasing space again in January 2013.Sernovitz, Daniel J. "Penzance Signs First Tenant to Watergate Building." Washington Business Journal. January 18, 2013.

===Watergate South===

The Watergate South has been the home to a number of notable individuals.  As of 2009, perhaps its most famous resident is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice."BentleyForbes takes Watergate office property off the market", Washington Business Journal, May 29, 2008. Like the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building, but there is no urgency as the lease on the land does not expire until 2070.

===Watergate West===

Construction problems and leaks at Watergate West led the press to ridicule this building, like others in the complex, as the "Potomac Titanic." On March 2, 1971, residents of the Watergate West filed a lawsuit against SGI in which they claimed their units had defective stoves, faulty air conditioning, leaky windows and balconies, and deficient plumbing. SGI said the problems were similar to those with any new building, and that it had already spent $300,000 fixing things.
Like the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building but do not need to do so until the land lease expires in 2070.

===Watergate Office Building===

Britain's National Coal Board Pension Fund sold the Watergate Office Building to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in the early 1990s. The building underwent a renovation of its office spaces in 1994."Watergate Building Sold to BentleyForbes Group." Los Angeles Times. October 11, 2005. The Atlantic Monthly magazine owner David G. Bradley purchased the office building in 2003.
