[[Stephen King short fiction bibliography]]

CATEGORIES: Bibliographies by writer, Short stories by Stephen King

This is a list of short fiction by Stephen King. This includes short stories, novelettes, and novellas, as well as poems. It is arranged chronologically by first publication. Major revisions of previously published pieces are also noted. Stephen King is sometimes erroneously credited with "nearly 400 short stories" (or a similarly large number).http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/King2-t.html?_r=1 However, all the known published pieces of short fiction are tabulated below. In all, 191 works are listed. Most of these pieces have been collected in King's five short story collections: Night Shift (1978), Skeleton Crew (1985), Nightmares & Dreamscapes (1993), Everything's Eventual (2002), and Just After Sunset (2008); and in King's four novella collections: Different Seasons (1982), Four Past Midnight (1990), Hearts in Atlantis (1999), and Full Dark, No Stars (2010). Some of these pieces, however, remain uncollected.
