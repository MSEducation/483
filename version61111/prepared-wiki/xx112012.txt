Nenad Jestrović (Serbian Cyrillic: Ненад Јестровић; born May 9, 1976 in Obrenovac) is a retired Serbian football forward.

==Club career==

Jestrović's career at Anderlecht was blighted by injury, but, in his last season at the club, he was the top scorer in the 2004-05 Belgian First Division with 18 goals, many of which were scored from free kicks and penalties.
Jestrović was excluded from a UEFA Champions League game by Kim Milton Nielsen in November 2005 for racist remarks against Mohamed Sissoko. He was subsequently fined by Anderlecht.
In January 2006, he joined Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, where he scored the UAE league's 10,000th goal in his first match.
In July 2008, he joined Turkish side Kocaelispor on a free transfer. He then returned to his former club Metz in January 2009. He retired professionally later that year.

Jestrović also played for the Serbia and Montenegro national football team.
