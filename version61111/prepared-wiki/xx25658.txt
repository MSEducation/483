[[False consciousness]]

CATEGORIES: Marxist theory

False consciousness is term used by some Marxists for the way in which material, ideological and institutional processes in capitalist society mislead members of the proletariat. These processes are said to hide the true relations of forces between classes and the real state of affairs regarding the development of pre-socialist society (relative to the secular development of human society in general).

==Engels==

Although Marx frequently denounced ideology in general, there is no evidence that he ever actually used the phrase "false consciousness." It appears to have been used — at least in print — only by Friedrich Engels.[tpl]cite book |location=London|publisher=Verso|title=Ideology: An Introduction|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|year=1991|pages=89|isbn=84-493-1797-5[/tpl]
Engels wrote:[tpl]cite web |title=Letter to Mehring|year=1893|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm[/tpl]
Here Engels expresses semantic baggage associated with the term Ideology, i.e. that it implies a lack of objectivity, which the term had at the time of its introduction from German (due in no small part to a reaction to Hegelianism). This has somewhat substantially been lost over the nearly two centuries since then as Ideology has come to be equated with World View or Philosophy. False consciousness is theoretically linked with the concepts of the dominant ideology and cultural hegemony, and to a lesser extent with cognitive dissonance. The idea of false consciousness has also been used by Marxist feminists and radical feminists in regard to women's studies.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Later development==

Some Marxist academics have argued that members of the proletariat disregard the true nature of class relations because of their belief in the probability or possibility of upward mobility.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Sociological Perspectives|title=Upward Mobility of Low-Paid Workers: A Multivariate Model for Occupational Changers|author=Marshall I.
