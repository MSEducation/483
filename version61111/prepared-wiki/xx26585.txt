Carrie is an American epistolary novel and author Stephen King's first published novel, released on April 5, 1974, with an approximate first print-run of 30,000 copies.Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work, George W. Beahm, pg. 29 Set in the then-future year of 1979, it revolves around the eponymous Carrietta N. "Carrie" White, a shy high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who tease her—in the process, causing one of the worst disasters in American history. King has commented that he finds the work to be "raw" and "with a surprising power to hurt and horrify." It is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.cfm |title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 |work=www.ala.org |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=2008-07-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080721233042/http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.cfm |archivedate = 2008-07-21[/tpl](dead link) Much of the book is written in an epistolary structure, using newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her bullying classmates.
Several adaptations of Carrie have been released, including a  1976 feature film, a  1988 Broadway musical, a  1999 feature film sequel, a  2002 television movie, and a 2013 feature film remake.

==Synopsis==

===Lead-up to the Prom===

Part I – Blood Sport		
Ever since grade school, Carrietta "Carrie" N. White has been the subject of abuse from her unstable fundamentalist mother, Margaret White, who broke away from mainstream Christianity and found her own religion (of which she and Carrie are apparently the only adherents).  Carrie doesn't fare much better at school; she has been a social outcast since first grade. At the beginning of the novel, Carrie, a senior at Thomas Ewen Consolidated High School in fictional Chamberlain, Maine, has her first period while showering after gym class. Carrie is terrified, having no concept of menstruation, and believes she is bleeding to death. Instead of sympathizing with the frightened Carrie, her classmates taunt her and throw tampons and sanitary napkins at her. As Carrie is aided by her gym teacher, Rita Desjardin, a light bulb in the shower explodes. When Margaret finds out about the incident, she beats Carrie, claiming that this is God's way of punishing her, and locks her in a closet for hours to pray for "forgiveness."
The next day, Miss Desjardin orders the children who taunted Carrie to serve a week's detention in the gym. One of the bullies, Chris Hargensen, refuses to attend and is suspended for three days.  She is also banned from Ewen High's prom. However, another girl, Sue Snell, feels remorse for her prior actions and offers to become Carrie's friend. Meanwhile, Carrie gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, and learns how to keep them under control. With prom fast approaching, Sue convinces her handsome boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to prom, as a way for her to finally fit in. Margaret forbids her from attending, but Carrie uses her powers to help stand up for herself.
Smarting from being banned from the prom, Chris and her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, hatch a plan to humiliate Carrie in front of the entire school. Chris has Billy kill two pigs at a nearby farm and drain their blood into two buckets. Billy then rigs the buckets over the stage on a rafter hidden out of sight. On prom night, Carrie is tormented by Margaret begging for her not to leave the house. Margaret begins hurting herself, trying to convince Carrie to stay home and pray with her, but Carrie leaves anyway and arrives with Tommy. She is nervous at first, but everyone begins treating her equally. Soon, Carrie begins enjoying herself and Tommy becomes romantically attracted to her. Meanwhile, Sue is at home, continually worrying about what's happening at the prom. At the same time, she wonders if she is pregnant with Tommy's baby.

===The Catastrophe===

Part II – Prom Night
May 27, 1979: Carrie and Tommy are elected prom king and queen after Chris' friends, Tina Blake and Norma Watson, slip fake ballots into the ballot box as part of Chris' plan. Once on stage, Carrie and Tommy are drenched with the pig blood by Chris; one of the buckets falls on Tommy's head, fatally wounding him. Carrie again becomes the subject of her classmates' ridicule, and decides to use her telekinetic abilities to exact revenge upon Ewen High. She locks the gym's doors and turns on the sprinkler system, electrocuting two students; she then sets fire to the gym, leaving everyone inside to die. Carrie walks home, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake. Sue rushes to Ewen High and watches it explode, which destroys a portion of the town.
Carrie returns home and confronts a crazed Margaret, who claims that she had conceived Carrie due to marital rape. When Margaret stabs Carrie, she kills her mother by telekinetically stopping her heart. Mortally wounded, Carrie makes her way to the local roadhouse where her mother was raped and she was conceived. Chris and Billy, who happen to be making love inside, receive word from Billy's friend of what has happened to Chamberlain; Billy plans on leaving town with Chris. They exit the roadhouse just as Carrie arrives, and attempt to run her down with Billy's car. However, Carrie telekinetically sends the car crashing into the roadhouse, killing Chris and Billy. Carrie then collapses in the parking lot from blood loss.
Sue arrives on the scene and finds Carrie in the parking lot. Carrie, weak and dying from blood loss, speaks telepathically with Sue, blaming her for the prank. After scanning Sue's mind, she realizes that Sue had nothing to do with it and set her up with Tommy to make amends for the locker room incident. Carrie cries out for her mother and dies, which Sue experiences personally due to their brief psionic connection. She screams as blood runs down her leg and realizes that she has miscarried her unborn child.

===The Aftermath===

Part III – Wreckage
Four months later, Chamberlain has become a virtual ghost town. By then, 440 people—including 67 people who were Ewen High Seniors—are confirmed dead and 18 are still missing. The "Black Prom" incident is one of the worst disasters in American history and is considered a national tragedy worse than the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After interviewing the survivors of the prom, scientists begin to take telekinesis seriously, and schools across the country start to crack down more on bullying. Miss Desjardin and Principal Henry Grayle, who had managed to escape from the prom, are consumed with regret, sadness and guilt over not reaching out to Carrie sooner and resign their positions (with Desjardin stating that she would rather commit suicide than teach again). In 1986, Sue writes a memoir of her traumatic experience, My Name Is Susan Snell, which warns the reader not to forget about the events that took place in Chamberlain or else something like it may happen again. The book closes with a letter written by a woman in Tennessee whose daughter is developing incredibly strong advanced telekinetic abilities as well.

==Publication History==

Carrie was actually King's fourth novel"I had written three other novels before Carrie…" Stephen King, (2000) On Writing. Scribner Books. p. 77 but the first to be published. It was written while he was living in a trailer, on a portable typewriter (on which he also wrote Misery) that belonged to his wife Tabitha. It began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage."I did three single-spaced pages of a first draft, then crumpled them up in disgust and threw them away." King, Stephen. (2000) On Writing. Scribner Books. p. 76 Of King's published short stories at the time, he recalled,
His wife fished the pages out of the garbage and encouraged him to finish the story; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.Introduction to "Carrie" (Collector's Edition) King, Tabitha Plume 1991 King said, "I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas… my considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser."[tpl]Cite journal |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen King |date=February 1980 |title=On Becoming a Brand Name |journal=Adelina Magazine |pages=44 |postscript= [/tpl]
Carrie is based on a composite of two girls Stephen King observed while attending grade school and high school.On Writing, Stephen King
King says he wondered what it would have been like to have been raised by such a mother, and based the story itself on a reversal of the Cinderella fairy tale. He also told biographer George Beahm that the girl later "married a man who was as odd as her, had kids, and eventually killed herself."[tpl]cite book |title=Stephen King From A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work |last= Beahm |first=George |date=1998-09-01 |publisher= Andrews McMeel Pub. |location=Kansas City |isbn= 0-8362-6914-4 [/tpl]
Carrie’s telekinesis resulted from King’s earlier reading about this topic. At the time of publication, King was working as a high school English teacher at Hampden Academy and barely making ends meet. To cut down on expenses, King had the phone company remove the telephone from his house. As a result, when King received word that the book was chosen for publication, his phone was out of service. Doubleday editor William Thompson (who would eventually become King's close friend), sent a telegram to King's house which read: "Carrie Officially A Doubleday Book. $2,500 Advance Against Royalties. Congrats, Kid - The Future Lies Ahead, Bill." It has been presumed that King drew inspiration from his time as a teacher. New American Library bought the paperback rights for $400,000, which, according to King's contract with Doubleday, was split between them."The Stephen King Companion" Beahm, George Andrews McMeel press 1989 pp. 171–173 King eventually quit the teaching job after receiving the publishing payment. The hardback sold a mere 13,000 copies; the paperback, released a year later, sold over 1 million copies in its first year. In King's book, On Writing, he mentions that he wrote all of Carrie in only about two weeks.
King recalls, "Carrie was written after Rosemary's Baby, but before The Exorcist, which really opened up the field. I didn't expect much of Carrie. I thought, 'Who'd want to read a book about a poor little girl with menstrual problems?' I couldn't believe I was writing it.""From Textbook to Checkbook" Wells, Robert W. Milwaukee Journal September 15, 1980 In a talk at the University of Maine, King said of Carrie, "I'm not saying that Carrie is shit, and I'm not repudiating it. She made me a star, but it was a young book by a young writer. In retrospect, it reminds me of a cookie baked by a first grader — tasty enough, but kind of lumpy and burned on the bottom."
The book went on to sell four million copies.
