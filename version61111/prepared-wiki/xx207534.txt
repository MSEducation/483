Argo Racing Cars Ltd. is a British racing constructor founded by Swiss designer Jo Marquart and British mechanic Nick Jordan as part of their Anglia Cars racing team in the 1980s.  The company initially constructed a variety of open-wheel cars for national and international Formula Three as well as the Formula Atlantic and Formula Super Vee series.  The company later built sports prototypes for the World Sportscar Championship's C2 class and the North American IMSA GT Championship's IMSA Lights category, winning several championships.  
Argo Racing Cars was later purchased by David Sears, and their former headquarters now houses his Super Nova Racing team.  The Argo Racing Cars name was resurrected in recent years for use in the A1 Grand Prix championship, where they currently support A1 Team Lebanon and A1 Team India.
