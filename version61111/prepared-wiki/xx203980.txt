==History==

In 2005, she wrote and starred in her first play, Grady Hot Potato, at the Bedlam Theatre. It was also selected for the National Student Drama Festival.
The following year she took two productions of her second play, Geronimo to the Edinburgh Fringe, under the title The Umbilical Project. The two plays, Cut and Uncut, were an experiment in cutting the cord between writer and production. Uncut was directed by Kirkwood herself and Cut by a completely separate company under the direction of Matt Addicott. No contact was made between the two companies during the rehearsal period, prompting the tag line "Two casts, two crews, two directors, two venues, one new play... no communication".[tpl]cite news| last =Smith | first =Rebecca | coauthors =| title =The Umbilical Project: Cut & Uncut Reviews| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =The Edinburgh Guide| date =2007-08-07| url =http://www.edinburghguide.com/festival/2006/fringe/review_theatre.php?page=u| accessdate =2008-05-23[/tpl]
