Marshall Clement "Mark" Sanford, Jr. (born May 28, 1960) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party. He currently serves as the U.S. Representative for South Carolina's 1st congressional district after winning a special election on May 7, 2013.AP: Sanford wins 1st District race, beats Colbert BuschSullivan, Sean. Mark Sanford wins Republican runoff in South Carolina, Washington Post, April 4, 2013. He previously represented the same district from 1995 to 2001, before being elected Governor of South Carolina, a position he held from 2003 to 2011.
First elected to Congress in 1994, Sanford pledged to serve no more than three terms and did not seek re-election in 2000. He left office in 2001 and was elected as the 115th Governor of South Carolina in 2002, defeating Democratic incumbent Jim Hodges, and was re-elected in 2006. As Governor, Sanford had a contentious relationship with the South Carolina legislature: notably, he made public statements that he would reject stimulus funds for his state from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Following a subsequent battle in the South Carolina Supreme Court, he was forced to accept the funds.
On June 24, 2009, Sanford resigned as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, after he publicly revealed that he had engaged in an affair with María Belén Chapur, an Argentine woman to whom he is now engaged.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/us/27maria.html | work=The New York Times | title=Argentine Man Is Said to Be Source of Sanford E-Mail | first=Vinod | last=Sreeharsha | date=June 27, 2009 | accessdate=April 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=22457D54-40D7-49A5-BA78-FD615E3299A1 |title=Mark Sanford faces family-values contrast in runoff |author=Isenstadt, Alex |date=March 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |work=Politico[/tpl] He was later censured by the South Carolina General Assembly following a State Ethics Commission investigation into allegations that he had misused state travel funds to conduct his affair.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

In 1994, Sanford entered the Republican primary for the Charleston-based 1st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. The seat had come open after four-term Republican incumbent Arthur Ravenel declined to seek re-election in his ultimately unsuccessful run for Governor. Despite having never run for office before, Sanford finished second in a crowded primary behind Van Hipp, Jr, a former George H. W. Bush administration official and former Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Sanford defeated Van Hipp in the runoff and easily defeated State Representative Robert A. Barber, Jr. in the November general election, winning by 66.3% to 32.4%.
Sanford was unopposed by Democratic candidates in 1996 and 1998. In 1996, he beat Joseph Innella of the Natural Law Party by 96.36% to 3.55%. He beat Innella again in 1998, this time by 91% to 8.9%.

===Tenure===

While in Congress, Sanford was recognized as its most fiscally conservative member by the Cato Institute. He was also recognized by Citizens Against Government Waste, as well as the National Tax Payers Union, for his efforts to rein in government spending and reduce the national deficit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337753/mark-sanford-i-m-running-congress-jim-geraghty# |title=Mark Sanford: I’m Running for Congress - Jim Geraghty - National Review Online |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 1, 2013[/tpl] He garnered a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union,.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.acuratings.org/ratingsarchive/1996/rhotex.html|title=1996 House Ratings|publisher=American Conservative Union|date=January 1, 1996|accessdate=June 24, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612060738/http://www.acuratings.org/ratingsarchive/1996/rhotex.html |archivedate = June 12, 2008[/tpl]

===Committee assignments===

==Governor of South Carolina==

===2002 election===

He entered the gubernatorial election of 2002; he first defeated Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler in the Republican primary and then defeated the Democratic incumbent, Jim Hodges, in the general election, by a margin of 53% to 47% to become the 115th Governor of South Carolina. In accordance with South Carolina law, Sanford was elected separately from the state's Republican lieutenant governor, Andre Bauer. Sanford and Bauer's wins gave the Republicans full control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction.

===First term===

In 2003, just after becoming governor, Sanford joined the Air Force Reserve and attended two week’s training in Alabama with his unit, the 315th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron. While in training, Sanford did not transfer power to Bauer, saying he would be in regular contact with his office, and would transfer authority in writing only if he were called to active duty.[tpl]cite news |work=The State |url=http://www.thestate.com/2009/06/23/836552/previous-coverage-sanford-back.html |date=June 22, 2009 |title=Sanford, missing since Thursday, reportedly located|author= John O'Connor and Clif LeBlanc [/tpl]
Sanford sometimes had a contentious relationship with the South Carolina General Assembly, even though it was dominated by his party for his entire tenure. The Republican-led state House of Representatives overrode 105 of Sanford's 106 budget vetoes on May 26, 2004.[tpl]cite web|author=Bauerlein, Valerie|title=S.C.

Sanford protests pork with pork at Statehouse Thurs. |publisher=WIS-TV |date=May 27, 2004|accessdate=May 8, 2013[/tpl]
Sanford rejected the Assembly's entire budget on June 13, 2006. Had this veto stood, the state government would have shut down on July 1. He explained his veto as being the only way to get the cuts he desired, and that using the line item veto would have been inadequate as well as impossible. However, in a special session the following day, both houses dismissed Sanford's call for reform by overriding his veto–-effectively restoring their original budget[tpl]Cite news|title=South Carolina Showdown Is Set Up by a Budget Veto|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0DD1031F936A25755C0A9609C8B63|date=June 15, 2006|accessdate=June 24, 2009|first=Brenda|last=Goodman|publisher=The New York Times[/tpl]
Sanford professed to be a firm supporter of limited government. Later in his tenure, he embarked on a plan to reform methods of funding the state's public education system, including measures such as school vouchers– aimed at introducing more competition into the school system as a means of fostering improvement. The plan, known as "Put Parents In Charge," proposed to provide around $2,500 per child to parents who chose to withdraw their children from the state's public school system and instead send them to independent schools. Sanford framed this plan as a necessary market-based reform.
In 2003, Sanford sought to reform the state's public college system. Sanford has criticized these schools as focusing too much on separately creating research institutions and not on educating the young adults of South Carolina. Sanford also suggested that they combine some programs as a means of curbing tuition increases. The schools did not respond positively to this suggestion, however, causing Sanford to remark that "if any institution ultimately feels uncomfortable with our push toward coordination, they can exit the system and go private."[tpl]cite web|title=Sanford urges privatization|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2003/12/06/met_388896.shtml|work=The Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=May 8, 2013|date=December 6, 2003[/tpl]
Sanford also indicated a desire to increase the powers of the executive branch. Under the South Carolina Constitution, the governor is somewhat weaker than many of his counterparts. For instance, many of his appointment powers are shared with the South Carolina General Assembly.
Sanford's first term included other controversies. A Time Magazine article in November 2005, critical of Sanford, said that some "fear his thrift has brought the state's economy to a standstill."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1129549,00.html |title=Mark Sanford / South Carolina |work=TIME magazine |date=November 13, 2005 |author=Tim Padgett[/tpl]

===2006 election===

His campaign for re-election in 2006 began by Sanford winning the June 13 Republican Primary over Oscar Lovelace, a family physician from Prosperity, with 65% of the vote to Lovelace's 35%. His Democratic competitor in the November elections was state senator Tommy Moore, whom Sanford beat by 55%–45%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/SC/G/00/ |title=– Elections 2006 |publisher=Cnn.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl]
On election day, Sanford was not allowed to vote in his home precinct because he did not have his voter registration card. He was obliged to go to a voter registration office to get a new registration card. "I hope everybody else out there is as determined to vote as I was today," he said. Sanford's driver's license had a Columbia address, but Sanford was trying to vote at his home precinct in Sullivan's Island.[tpl]cite web|author=Associated Press|title=Sanford wins re-election|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/101/story/8824.html|work=The Herald|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061108162849/http://www.heraldonline.com/101/story/8824.html|archivedate=November 8, 2006|date=November 8, 2006|location=Rock Hill, South Carolina[/tpl] According to WAGT in Augusta, Georgia (whose service area includes part of South Carolina) Sanford declared that it would be his last campaign.[tpl]cite web|author=Asociated Press|url=http://www.nbc26news.com/news/local/4582991.html |title=South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford Not Allowed To Vote At His Home Precinct |work=NBC26news.com|date=November 7, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061122230253/http://www.nbc26news.com/news/local/4582991.html|archivedate=November 22, 2006[/tpl]

===Second term===

In dissent with the Republican Party of South Carolina, Sanford, an Episcopalian, opposed the faith-based license plates his state offers, marketed largely to the state's conservative evangelical citizens. After allowing the law to pass without his signature, he wrote "It is my personal view that the largest proclamation of one's faith ought to be in how one lives his life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/06/gov-sanford-on/ |title=Gov.

After the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Sanford strongly opposed and publicly criticized before and after its passage by Congress and presidential signing, Sanford initially indicated he might not accept all of the funds allotted by the spending law to South Carolina.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/21/nation/na-mark-sanford21 |title=South Carolina's governor may turn down stimulus money |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |author=Fausset, Richard[/tpl] He was criticized by many Democrats and some moderate Republicans both in his state and outside who noted South Carolina's 9.5% unemployment rate (one of the highest in the country) and complained that Sanford wasn't doing enough to improve economic conditions in his state which he was intentionally trying to worsen, which could be alleviated by the stimulus money.[tpl]cite web|last=Goodman |first=Josh |url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/Should-Mark-Sanford-Reject.html |title=Should Mark Sanford Reject the Stimulus Money? |publisher=Ballotbox.governing.com |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/16/begala.carolina/index.html |title=Commentary: If you oppose stimulus, don't take the money |publisher=CNN|date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |author=Begala, Paul[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Davenport|first=Jim|title=Jobless benefits part of SC gov's stimulus blur|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/02/19/ap6071552.html|work=forbes.com|publisher=Associated Press|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090222101428/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/02/19/ap6071552.html|archivedate=February 22, 2009|date=February 19, 2009[/tpl] Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican Governor of California, suggested that if Sanford or other governors rejected their portion of stimulus funds, he would be happy to take them instead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/19121.html |title=Arnold: I'll take govs' money |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl]

==Disappearance and extramarital affair==

From June 18 until June 24, 2009, the whereabouts of Sanford were unknown to the public, as well as to his wife and the State Law Enforcement Division, which provides security for him, garnering nationwide news coverage.

====Impeachment proceedings====

On August 25, state representatives Nathan Ballentine and Gary Simrill met with Sanford and warned him that the state legislature would impeach him if he did not resign. Ballentine, an ally of Sanford's, said afterward, "I told him the writing is on the wall. ...he could put an end to it all, but if he doesn't, members of the House will take things into their hands." Sanford still declined to resign.[tpl]cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/25/first-on-the-ticker-the-writing-is-on-the-wall-ally-tells-sanford/|title= First on the Ticker: 'The writing is on the wall,' ally tells Sanford|publisher=CNN|date=August 25, 2009|first=Peter|last=Hamby[/tpl]
On August 28, The Washington Times reported that Republican lawmakers in South Carolina were "laying plans" for a special legislative session on whether to impeach Sanford.

==Presidential elections==

===Role in 2008 election===

In 2006, before the midterm elections, some commentators discussed the possibility of Sanford running for president.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] He said that he would not run, and claimed that his re-election bid would be his last election, win or lose. After Super Tuesday in 2008, Sanford received some mention as a potential running mate for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, John McCain.Holmes, Elizabeth. Delicate Proposal: McCain-Sanford. The Wall Street Journal. March 29, 2008. Page A4. Retrieved April 10, 2008.'Meet the Press' transcript for Feb 17, 2008. NBC. MSNBC. February 17, 2008. Retrieved April 10, 2008.Cooper, Michael. McCain Considering Vice President Picks. The New York Times. April 2, 2008. Retrieved April 10, 2008.
Sanford publicly aligned himself with McCain in a March 15, 2008, piece in the Wall Street Journal. Likening the presidential race to a football game at halftime, Sanford noted that he "sat out the first half, not endorsing a candidate...But I'm now stepping onto the field and going to work to help John McCain. It's important that conservatives do the same."[tpl]cite news |first=Mark |last=Sanford |coauthors= |title=The Conservative Case for McCain |date=March 15, 2008 |publisher= |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120553936399438277.html |work=Wall Street Journal |pages=A10 |accessdate=March 16, 2008 |language=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
On January 11, 2008, shortly before the South Carolina presidential primaries (R Jan 19, D Jan 26), Sanford published a guest column in the Columbia newspaper The State.The State | 01/11/2008 | Obama's symbolism here[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] In the article, "Obama's Symbolism Here", Sanford wrote, "I won't be voting for Barack Obama for president," but noted the "historical burden" borne by South Carolinians on the topic of race. He advised voters in South Carolina to take note of the symbolism of Obama's early success, with the knowledge that South Carolina was a segregated state less than fifty years earlier, and discouraged voting either for or against Obama on the basis of his race.
On a January 18, 2008 interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer,[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0801/18/sitroom.03.html |title=CNN.com – Transcripts |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl] Sanford discussed his Obama article. Wolf Blitzer asked, "Give us your mind-set. Why did you think it was so important to write this piece right now at this critical moment?" Sanford responded, "Well, it plays into a larger conversation that we're having as a family of South Carolinians on, in fact, the constitutional structure of our government." Also, Wolf Blitzer showed Sanford clips of recent comments made by John McCain and Mike Huckabee about the Confederate battle flag and asked Sanford, "All right, two different positions, obviously. Who's right in this?" Sanford responded, "Well, it depends who you talk to." Sanford elaborated that "if you were to talk to the vast majority of South Carolinians, they would say that we do not need to be debating where the Confederate flag is or is not."
Sanford attracted derision in the liberal blogosphere and among pundits and analysts on the left for a gaffe during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on July 13, 2008, when he had difficulty answering a question about differences between Senator McCain and incumbent President George W. Bush on economic policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/jul/15/sanford_fumbles_on_cnn47478/ |title=Sanford fumbles on CNN |publisher=Charleston.net |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] "I'm drawing a blank, and I hate when I do that, especially on television," joked Sanford.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/13/mark-sanford-draws-a-blan_n_112391.html |title=Mark Sanford Draws A Blank On McCain/Bush Economics |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= July 13, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2012 |first=Nico |last=Pitney[/tpl]

===Possible 2012 candidacy===

As early as January 2008, there had been anticipation that Sanford would run for President in 2012, and online support groups had sprung up on virtual social networks like Facebook in support of a Sanford ticket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7511542695 |title=Mark Sanford for President 2012 |publisher=Facebook.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]Mark Sanford President 2012[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]

On January 4, 2010, Sanford admitted that, "If there's anything that's abundantly clear, it's that I ain't running for president." In the same Republican meeting, he also indicated that he would enter the private sector after his last 11 months as governor.[tpl]cite web|last=McCann|first=Josh|url=http://www.islandpacket.com/2010/01/04/1089142/sanford-welcomed-monday-by-friendly.html|title=Sanford welcomed Monday by friendly crowd on Hilton Head Island|publisher=The Island Packet|location=Hilton Head Island; S.C.|date=January 4, 2010|accessdate=January 6, 2010[/tpl]

===2013 Congressional special election===

In December 2012, CNN reported that Sanford was considering a bid to retake his congressional seat.

Sanford formally launched his bid for Congress in early 2013.

On April 17, 2013, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled support from the Sanford campaign in the wake of revelations that Jenny Sanford had filed a trespassing complaint against him on February 4.Isenstadt, Mark. Republicans pull plug on Mark Sanford. Politico, April 17, 2013. According to the complaint, Jenny Sanford had caught her former husband sneaking out of her home in Sullivan's Island, using his cellphone as a flashlight. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, neither Mark nor Jenny Sanford may come to the other's house without permission—a condition Jenny Sanford alleged that Mark Sanford had flouted on numerous occasions despite Jenny Sanford filing a "no trespass" letter with the Sullivan's Island Police Department.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/136497668/Sanford-legal-documents |title=Trespassing complaint against Sanford |publisher=Scribd.com |date=April 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 1, 2013[/tpl] In a statement, Mark Sanford admitted that he'd gone to the house to watch the second half of Super Bowl XLVII with his son. He claimed to have tried to contact Jenny beforehand, but was unable to do so. Jenny Sanford filed the complaint the next morning. Several Republican operatives said that they were upset Sanford had known about this complaint for some time and failed to disclose it.
