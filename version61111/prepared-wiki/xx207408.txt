The term Israeli outpost ([tpl]lang-he|מאחז[/tpl], Ma'ahaz lit. "a handhold") usually refers to an unauthorized or illegal Israeli settlement within the West Bank, constructed without the required authorization from the Israeli government in contravention of Israeli statutes regulating planning and construction. In Israeli law, outposts are distinguished from settlements authorized by the Israeli government. This distinction between illegal outposts and "legal" settlements is not endorsed by international law, which considers both a violation of the norms, governing belligerent occupations, applicable to the West Bank.[tpl]cite book| author=Asʻad Ġānim| title=Palestinian Politics After Arafat: A Failed National Movement| publisher=Indiana University Press| year= 2010| page= 32|quote= all forms of settlement in the occupied territories are considered prohibited under international law, Israel considers only settlement 'outposts' illegal.[/tpl]
Outposts appeared after the 1993 Oslo I Accord, when the Israeli government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements.[tpl]cite book| author=Eyal Benvenisti| title=The International Law of Occupation| publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2012 | page=236| quote= outposts were settlements that sprouted without formal authorization by the military administration due to commitments given by the Israeli government during the Oslo process not to built new settlements.[/tpl] Although outposts were not officially supported by the government, Israeli public authorities and other government bodies played a major role in establishing and developing them, according to the 2005 Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements, while neighborhoods are attached to an existing settlement.
In July 2002, the Israeli government acknowledged that 69 outposts had been established since 1996.[tpl]cite web| author=Geoffrey Aronson | publisher=Foundation for Middle East Peace | title=New "Outposts" Lead Settlement Expansion.

In 2012, ten unauthorized outposts were retroactively legalised by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, according to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, by redesignating them as a neighbourhood of nearby settlements.  
Outposts often are provided with security by the Israel Defense Forces.[tpl]cite web| author=Gili Cohen| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-troops-provide-security-for-all-west-bank-outposts-regardless-of-legal-status.premium-1.513112 | title=IDF troops provide security for all West Bank outposts - regardless of legal status| work= Haaretz |date= 3 April 2013| accessdate= 16 April 2013[/tpl] The term "outpost" may also refer to a military outpost.

==Background==

In 1993, the Rabin Government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements. After then, however,  settlers built new settlements without governmental decision, but often with the involvement of Israeli public authorities and other government bodies and government ministries, such as the Ministry of Housing and Construction, the Settlement Division of the World Zionist Organization and the Israeli Civil Administration. The Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon found that the proliferation of outposts was a continuation of the Israeli settlement enterprise and makes it clear that “an unauthorized outpost is not a “semi legal” outpost. Unauthorized is illegal.”[tpl]Cite web |  author= Talia Sasson | authorlink =  | title = Summary of the Opinion Concerning Unauthorized Outposts  | work = Sasson Report | publisher = Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs  | date = 10 March 2005 | url = http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+and+Rulings/Summary+of+Opinion+Concerning+Unauthorized+Outposts+-+Talya+Sason+Adv.htm  | accessdate = 6 March 2011[/tpl]

==Characteristics of an outpost==

The population of outposts generally numbers between a few and some 400 people and they are usually composed of modular homes, such as caravans. However, they can also be further developed, having more permanent housing as well as "paved roads, bus stops, synagogues and playgrounds."[tpl]cite news |author=Tovah Lazaroff |coauthors= |title=Settler Affairs: Running for the hilltops |work=The Jerusalem Post |page= |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate= 6 March 2011 |quote= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/FrontLines/Article.aspx?id=146752[/tpl]
According to the 2005 Sasson Report, there are four principal characteristics of an unauthorized outpost:
Sasson defines an outpost as a (unauthorized) settlement not attached to an existing settlement. If attached, it is regarded as an unauthorized neighborhood. Moreover, outposts can be built either within or beyond the officially determined municipal boundaries. Although the Israeli government acknowledges that settlements built on land privately owned by Palestinians are illegal, it usually provides them with military defense, access to public utilities, and other infrastructure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=AWNB&p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%2013B2E9379EDD69B8%20%29&p_docid=13B2E9379EDD69B8&p_theme=aggdocs&p_queryname=13B2E9379EDD69B8&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=X4BN4BIBMTM0NzIxNTI2My41MzIxNzg6MToxMzoxOTIuMTYwLjIxNi4w&&p_multi=TNS1|title=New Commander Should Protect Palestinians From Settler Violence|publisher=Targeted News Service|date=22 November 2011|accessdate= 9 September 2012[/tpl]

===Outposts versus neighborhood===

Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements. Like outposts, neighborhoods such as Ulpana in Beit El still can be built without authorization. Because the difference is obscure, often disputes rise whether new houses are expansion (thickening) of an existing settlement or the start of a new outpost. According to Peace Now, the Israeli government is playing a trick by legalizing outposts as a neighborhood of an existing settlementPeace Now, For the First Time Since 1990 – the Government is to Approve the Establishment of New Settlements, section The Trick that failed: Legalization as a neighborhood of an existing settlement. 19 April 2012

==Types of outposts==

===Outposts on state land and on private lands===

Israel distincts outposts built on state land and those built on privately owned lands. Since the Elon Moreh case in 1979 before the Israeli Supreme Court, the Government formally follows the policy not to allow new settlements on private Palestinian lands.Peace Now, Settlements in Focus - Behind the Barrier: A Profile of Elon Moreh, Settlement in Focus: Vol. 1, Issue 10, Section Why was Elon Moreh's establishment particularly significant?; 16 September 2005[ref]Nir Shalev, Under the Guise of Legality – Israel's Declarations of State Land in the West Bank (4,6 MB), pp. 12-15, 56-60. B'Tselem, February 2012.

(p.13) Government Decision No. 145 of 1 November 1979: "On 11 November 1979, about one month after the ruling in the Elon Moreh case, the government decided "to expand the settlement in Judea, Samaria, the Jordan Valley, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights by increasing the population of the existing communities and by establishing new communities on state-owned land."

(p.59): "International law, which forbids the occupying power to change the local law in force in the occupied area on the eve of its occupation, unless such a change is necessary for security needs or for the benefit of the local population."[/ref]
The Netanyahu government seeks to legalize outposts on state land and dismantle those on private lands.[tpl]cite web| work=Haaretz|  author=Chaim Levinson and Barak Ravid | date= 1 March 2011 | url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-vows-to-raze-all-illegal-outposts-built-on-private-palestinian-land-1.346329 | title=Israel vows to raze all illegal outposts built on private Palestinian land | accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] As this state land is part of the Occupied Territories, authorization can only make them legal according to Israeli law; it does not change their illegal status under international law.
In the West Bank, there are two types of state land: 
Most of the state land belongs to the latter type. According to B'Tselem, the declaration as state land was doubtful in many instances.B'Tselem, LAND GRAB – Israel's Settlement Policy in the West Bank, pp. 40,51-54, Chapter 3, B Declaration of Land as State Land. May 2002. Summary: Israel pretends to apply Ottoman land laws, but uses an interpretation of law that differs from the Ottoman/British Mandate/Jordanian rule. The latter never used declaration of state land as a method to take over lands.Peace Now, June 2009, Methods of Confiscation International law forbids the occupying power to change the local law in force in the occupied area (in force on the eve of its occupation), unless such a change is necessary for security needs or for the benefit of the local population.

==="Dummy" outposts===

"Dummy" outposts are uninhabited outposts. Apparently, some of them were used to distract the IDF in order to prevent evacuation of occupied outposts.Akiva Eldar, The defense minister and the case of the disappearing outposts. Haaretz, 11 July 2002 Others are destined to improve negotiation positions by offering extra outposts to remove and show the world that the State is dismantling outposts,Haaretz, Focus / Yesha sacrifices trailers in a larger game. 1 July 2002 The idea of the "dummy" outposts is attributed to Ze'ev Hever, a former leader of the Jewish Underground. The Sasson Report found that most of the evacuated outposts were unpopulated.

===Military outposts===

In theory, military outposts are temporary occupations for military strategic purposes, not for settlement of civilians. In the Occupied Territories, however, they became a principal way to start civilian settlements.Christian Science Monitor, Israel plans 16 outposts in West Bank and Golan. 3 February 1982 In Palestine, this were typically Nahal settlements.

==Number of outposts==

Currently, some hundred outposts exist. The Sasson Report gave a provisional figure of 105 unauthorized outposts by March 2005, although Sasson did not have the disposal of all the necessary information. It found that 26 outposts were on state lands, 15 on private Palestinian lands and 7 on survey lands. The definition of outposts, neighborhoods and authorized settlements may differ between concerned parties. Due to different interpretation, the number of outposts (and of settlements as well) may differ in statistics.
In 2012, four new outposts were established with 317 new housing units built without building permits: Tzofin Tzafon (Tzofin North) outside the Tzofim settlement near Qalqilyah, Nahlei Tal outside the Talmon settlement near Ramallah, Nahalat Yosef near Nablus and Hill 573 as part of the expansion of the settlement Itamar, according to Peace Now.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/approval-for-settlement-plans-jumped-300-in-2012-says-peace-now-1.494316| title=Approval for settlement plans jumped 300% in 2012, says Peace Now| author=Chaim Levinson | date=16 January 2013| work=Haaretz| accessdate= 22 April 2013[/tpl]

==Roadmap for Peace==

In the framework of the 2003 Roadmap for Peace, Israel committed itself under Prime Minister Sharon to evacuate outposts, erected from March 2001, the start of the Sharon government. The Israeli government gave the U.S. a list of 28 unauthorized outposts erected in the West Bank since that date,The list and a map on:Outposts: the Unripe Settlements. ARIJ, 17 January 2004 of which 12 were ordered to be removed, "while some of the remaining 16 outposts were in the process of being approved and planned," according to the Israeli daily Haaretz.[tpl]cite web| work=Haaretz| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-gives-u-s-list-of-unauthorized-outposts-1.127260 | title=Israel gives U.S. list of unauthorized outposts| date=1 July 2004| author=AP and Aluf Benn[/tpl] However, the Israeli NGO Peace Now claimed that there are 45 unauthorized outposts erected in the West Bank after March 2001. Israel did not meet the commitment under the Roadmap. It dismantled few manned outposts and none of the larger ones.[tpl]cite web| url= http://peacenow.org.il/eng/content/least-70-outposts-are-located-private-palestinian-land| title=At least 70 outposts are located on private Palestinian land| date= 2 March 2011 | author= Hagit Ofran and Lara Friedman | publisher= Peace Now[/tpl][tpl]cite web| author=Ami Isseroff| url=http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000274.htm | title=Israel's outpost hutzpah| work=Mid East Web| date= 2 July 2004[/tpl]

==Legalising outposts==

In the "Blue Line"-plan, written in January 2011, at least 26 outposts were included in areas defined as "state lands". Left-wing activist Dror Etkes said, this means the state has started a process to legitimize these outposts.Akiva Eldar, IDF Civil Administration pushing for land takeover in West Bank Haaretz, 22 July 2011 In March 2011, the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu declared that it intended to legalise outposts that were built on state land, and to evict the outposts that are on private Palestinian lands.[tpl]cite web| title=Israel vows to raze all illegal outposts built on private Palestinian land| author=Chaim Levinson and Barak Ravid | date= 1 March 2011| work=Haaretz| url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-vows-to-raze-all-illegal-outposts-built-on-private-palestinian-land-1.346329| accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl]
According to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, the Israeli government under Netanyahu legalised ten illegal outposts in 2012, being the only Israeli government to ever authorize outposts. In February 2012, approval was quietly granted to the outpost Shvut Rachel by redesignating it as a “neighborhood” of the nearby settlement of Shilo, in April of the same year, legal status was conferred on the three outposts Bruchin, Rechelim and Sansana.Tovah Lazaroff, IDF signs injunction legalizing Bruchin outpost. The Jerusalem Post, 12 August 2012. The Minister of Defense also approved the promotion of plans that will legalize the outposts Nofei Nehemia, Mitzpe Eshtemoa, and El Matan as “neighborhoods” of other settlements or outposts,[tpl]cite web| title=The Government Secretly Approved another Outpost: Nofei Nehemia| url=http://peacenow.org.il/eng/Nofei-Nehemia| date= 1 August 2012| publisher=Peace Now| accessdate= 22 April 2013[/tpl] and in June 2012, the outpost Givat Salit in the northern Jordan Valley was retroactively legalised by redesignating it as a neighbourhood of the nearby Mehola settlement, from which it is separated by a major inter-city highway.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hE0rVejDibWLn9T3Ow797lzZSyqQ?docId=CNG.70570bf855b93efb7f4ebbbab4640559.171| title= Watchdog says Israel 'legalises' another settler outpost| publisher=AFP| date=17 July 2012| accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl]

===Levy Report===

In late January 2012, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed a three member committee headed by former Israeli Supreme Court justice Edmund Levy, dubbed the “outpost committee”, to investigate the legal status of unauthorized West Bank Jewish settlements.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=276749| title= Legal report on outposts recommends authorization | work= The Jerusalem Post| author= Tovah Lazaroff | date= 9 July 2012| accessdate= 10 July 2012[/tpl] The Levy Report published in July 2012, which comes to the conclusion that Israel's presence in the West Bank is not occupation, recommends state approval for unauthorized outposts,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/world/middleeast/israeli-panel-says-west-bank-presence-is-not-occupation-and-recommends-approval-of-jewish-settlements.html| title= Validate Settlements, Israeli Panel Suggests | work= The New York Times| author= Isabel Kershner| date= 9 July 2012 | accessdate= 10 July 2012[/tpl] and provides proposals for new guidelines for settlement construction.
As of April 2013, the report was not brought before the Israeli cabinet or any parliamentary or governmental body which would have the power to approve it.
