Umar Makram ([tpl]lang-ar|عمر مكرم بن حسين السيوطي[/tpl]) (1750-1822) was an Egyptian political leader at the time of the 1798 French invasion and in the subsequent political disorders.

==Biography==

Makram was born in 1750 in Asyut. He was educated at Al-Azhar University, and became a leader of the nobles of Egypt. He was prominent in resistance to the 1798 invasion of Egypt by France (led by Napoleon).
After the French withdrew in 1801, control of Egypt was nominally restored to the Ottoman Empire, but in fact was disputed between the old Mamluk elite, Egyptian Arab nobles, and the Ottomans.
Makram allied with Muhammad Ali, the Albanian commander of the army sent by the Empire to restore control.
In May 1805, Egyptians led by Makram forced the Ottomans to replace the Wali {governor) Ahmad Khurshid Pasha with Muhammad Ali. Makram soon discovered that Muhammad Ali planned to rule Egypt himself. Makram objected to a foreign ruler. Muhammad Ali exiled Makram to Damietta on 9 August 1809, where he stayed for four years. Makram then moved to Tanta, where he died in 1822.

==Legacy==

A mosque named for him stands in Tahrir Square in Cairo. An exhibition on his life was recently celebrated at the Louvre in Paris, France.
