RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. In 2010 it resulted in about 49,000 deaths globally.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Lozano|first=1R|last2=Naghavi|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=Stephanie Y|last11=Almazroa|first11=Mohammad A|last12=Alvarado|first12=Miriam|last13=Anderson|first13=H Ross|last14=Anderson|first14=Laurie M|last15=Andrews|first15=Kathryn G|last16=Atkinson|first16=Charles|last17=Baddour|first17=Larry M|last18=Barker-Collo|first18=Suzanne|last19=Bartels|first19=David H|last20=Bell|first20=Michelle L|last21=Benjamin|first21=Emelia J|last22=Bennett|first22=Derrick|last23=Bhalla|first23=Kavi|last24=Bikbov|first24=Boris|last25=Abdulhak|first25=Aref Bin|last26=Birbeck|first26=Gretchen|last27=Blyth|first27=Fiona|last28=Bolliger|first28=Ian|last29=Boufous|first29=Soufiane|last30=Bucello|first30=Chiara|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|display-authors=8[/tpl]
Onset is uncommon under the age of 15 and from then on the incidence rises with age until the age of 80. Women are affected three to five times as often as men.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Some Native American groups have higher prevalence rates (5–6%) and people from the Caribbean region have lower prevalence rates.
The age at which the disease most commonly starts is in women between 40 and 50 years of age, and for men somewhat later.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alamanos Y, Voulgari PV, Drosos AA |title=Incidence and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, based on the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria: a systematic review |journal=Semin.

==History==

The first known traces of arthritis date back at least as far as 4500 BC. A text dated 123 AD first describes symptoms very similar to RA. It was noted in skeletal remains of Native Americans found in Tennessee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-05txt.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120202085715/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-05txt.htm|archivedate=2012-02-02|author=Rothschild, Bruce M. |title=Tennessee Origins of Rheumatoid Arthritis |publisher=Mcclungmuseum.utk.edu |accessdate=March 3, 2011[/tpl] In the Old World, the disease is vanishingly rare before the 17th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arc.org.uk/newsviews/arctdy/104/bones.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030219095659/http://www.arc.org.uk/newsviews/arctdy/104/bones.htm |archivedate=2003-02-19 |title=Bones of contention|work= Arthritis Research UK |date=April 1999|accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] and on this basis investigators believe it spread across the Atlantic during the Age of Exploration. In 1859 the disease acquired its current name.
An anomaly has been noticed from investigation of Pre-Columbian bones. The bones from the Tennessee site show no signs of tuberculosis even though it was prevalent at the time throughout the Americas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rothschild BM, Rothschild C, Helbling M |title=Unified theory of the origins of erosive arthritis: conditioning as a protective/directing mechanism? |journal=J. Rheumatol. |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=2095–102 |year=2003 |pmid=14528501[/tpl] Jim Mobley, at Pfizer, has discovered a historical pattern of epidemics of tuberculosis followed by a surge in the number of RA cases a few generations later.Patel, Sunil (1 February 2005). Scientist finds surprising links between arthritis and tuberculosis. Michigan Daily. Mobley attributes the spikes in arthritis to selective pressure caused by tuberculosis. A hypervigilant immune system is protective against tuberculosis at the cost of an increased risk of autoimmune disease.
The art of Peter Paul Rubens may possibly depict the effects of RA.  In his later paintings, his rendered hands show, in the opinion of some physicians, increasing deformity consistent with the symptoms of the disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Appelboom T, de Boelpaepe C, Ehrlich GE, Famaey JP |title=Rubens and the question of antiquity of rheumatoid arthritis |journal=JAMA |volume=245 |issue=5 |pages=483–6 |year=1981 |pmid=7005475| doi = 10.1001/jama.245.5.483[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/538251 |title=Did RA travel from New World to Old? The Rubens connection |publisher=Medscape|author=Kelly, Janis |date=14 June 2005 |accessdate=March 3, 2011[/tpl] RA appears to some to have been depicted in 16th-century paintings.[tpl]cite journal |author= Dequeker J. and Rico H.|title=Rheumatoid arthritis-like deformities in an early 16th-century painting of the Flemish-Dutch school |journal= JAMA|volume= 268|pages=249–251|year=1992|pmid=1608144 | doi = 10.1001/jama.268.2.249 |issue= 2[/tpl] However, it is generally recognised in art historical circles that the painting of hands in the 16th and 17th century followed certain stylised conventions, most clearly seen in the Mannerist movement. It was conventional, for instance to show the upheld right hand of Christ in what now appears a deformed posture. These conventions are easily misinterpreted as portrayals of disease.
The first recognized description of RA was in 1800 by the French physician Dr Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (1772–1840) who was based in the famed Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris.[tpl]cite book | author=Landré-Beauvais AJ | title=La goutte asthénique primitive (doctoral thesis) | year=1800 | location=Paris[/tpl] reproduced in [tpl]cite journal |author=Landré-Beauvais AJ |title=The first description of rheumatoid arthritis.

Historic treatments for RA have also included: rest, ice, compression and elevation, apple diet, nutmeg, some light exercise every now and then, nettles, bee venom, copper bracelets, rhubarb diet, extractions of teeth, fasting, honey, vitamins, insulin, magnets, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).[tpl]cite journal |author=Hart FD |title=History of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=6012 |pages=763–5 |year=1976|pmid=177148|pmc=1639217 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.6012.763[/tpl] Most of these have either had no effect at all, or their effects have been modest and transient, while not being generalizable.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The Prosorba column blood filtering device (removing IgG) was approved by the FDA in 1999 for treatment of RAFresenius HemoCare, Inc., "New Hope for Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients," press release, September 17, 1999.
