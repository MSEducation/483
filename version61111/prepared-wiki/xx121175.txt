==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was largely Norman until the Oxford Diocesan architect, the Gothic Revivalist G.E. Street almost completely rebuilt it in 1854.[tpl]sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=749[/tpl] The font and parts of two doorways are among the few Norman features that Street retained.[tpl]sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=749[/tpl] Street probably rebuilt the bell tower, but its Decorated Gothic bell openings survive.[tpl]sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=749[/tpl]
The tower has a ring of five bells, all of which were cast in 1687 by Matthew I Bagley and Henry II Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire.[tpl]cite web |url= http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Salford&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=SALFORD+OX |title=Salford S Mary V |last=Davies |first=Peter |date=14 December 2006 |work=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers |publisher= |accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl]
