The Gallup Amtrak station is located at 201 East Highway 66 in Gallup, New Mexico. The station was built in 1918 as the El Navajo Hotel, one of a series of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway railroad station hotels built across the southwestern and central United States by Fred Harvey. The hotel was closed in 1957, but was later reopened as an unstaffed Amtrak station. 
The station is unique in that a fence guards the platform from the rest of the station. This is to prevent people getting on the tracks of the triple tracked, high speed main line.
