==Music video==

The video shows the band playing outside at night, surrounded by fans. It shows James' girlfriend going into his house with another man and kissing him. Members of the band frequently appear next to the couple unnoticed, in reference to the line, "I was there but you didn't see me." Near the end, the two kiss in the bedroom, but the song stops, and the girl goes over to the cupboard, presumably hearing a noise. The song then starts again, as numerous fans come out of the cupboard and rush out the room. The cheat also runs downstairs, embarrassed, but it is shown when he leaves the band were playing outside the house the whole time, and he runs away when fans come out the house. The girlfriend then comes to the door, only to see the band looking accusingly at her, and it ends with the lights dimming.
