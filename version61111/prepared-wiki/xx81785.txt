==Distribution==

Adiantum capillus-veneris is native to the southern half of the United States from California to the Atlantic coast, through Mexico and Central America, to South America. It is also native to Eurasia, the Levant in Western Asia, and Australasia.The University of the West Indies, Cave HillCundall. P., (2004) Native Plants:The definitive guide to Australian plants, Global Book Publishing Lane Cove, N.S.W, p.298, ISBN 978-1-74048-027-7 There are two disjunct occurrences in the northern part of North America: at Cascade Springs in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia. In both instances, the warm microclimate created by hot mineral springs permits the growth of the plant far north of its normal range.
It is found in temperate climates from warm-temperate to tropical, where the moisture content is high but not saturating, in the moist, well-drained sand, loam or limestone many habitats, including rainforests, shrub and woodlands, broadleaf and coniferous forests, and desert cliff seeps, and springs. It often may be seen growing on moist, sheltered and shaded sandstone or limestone formations, generally south-facing in the southern hemisphere, north-facing in the north, or in gorges. It occurs throughout Africa in moist places by streams.[tpl]cite book | last = Sim | first = Thomas Robertson | title = The Ferns of South Africa| publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = London & Edinburgh | year = 1915 [/tpl] On moist sandstone cliffs it grows in full or partial shade, even when unprotected.[tpl]cite book | last = Roux | first = J.P. | title = Cape Peninsula Ferns | publisher = National Botanic Gardens of South Africa | location = Kirstenbosch | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-620-03775-X [/tpl]
