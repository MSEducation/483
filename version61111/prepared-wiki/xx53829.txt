[[Media circus]]

CATEGORIES: Criticism of journalism, News media manipulation, Public opinion

Media circus is a colloquial metaphor, or idiom, describing a news event where the media coverage is perceived to be out of proportion to the event being covered, such as the number of reporters at the scene, the amount of news media published or broadcast, and the level of media hype. The term is meant to critique the media, usually negatively, by comparing it to a circus, and is considered an idiom as opposed to a literal observation.  Usage of the term in this sense became common in the 1970s.[tpl]cite news | title=Gilmore case turning into a circus for media | work=Milwaukee Journal | quote=The worldwide attention that condemned killer Gary Gilmore is receiving has turned his case into a media circus Utah residents are saying | date=1976-12-03 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Only in America - the Gary Gilmore Circus has everything but dancing bears | work=The Evening Independent | date=1976-12-08 | quote=There is most appallingly, an only-in-America spectacle wherein a quest for justice becomes an extravaganza for the fast buck.

==History==

Although the idea is older, the term media circus began to appear around the mid-1970s. An early example is from the 1976 book by author Lynn Haney, in which she writes about a romance in which the athlete Chris Evert was involved: "Their courtship, after all, had been a 'media circus.'"Lynn Haney (1976). Chris Evert, the Young Champion. A few years later The Washington Post had a similar courtship example in which it reported, "Princess Grace herself is still traumatized by the memory of her own media-circus wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956."Washington Post B1, June 29, 1978. This is the oldest quote the Oxford English Dictionary has listed, although obviously there are older occurrences. The term has become increasingly popular with time since the 1970s.
Reasons for being critical of the media are as varied as the people who use the term. However, at the core of most criticism is that there may be a significant opportunity cost when other more important news issues get less public attention as a result of coverage of the hyped issue.
Media circuses make up the central plot device in the 1951 movie Ace in the Hole about a self-interested reporter who, covering a mine disaster, allows a man to die trapped underground. It cynically examines the relationship between the media and the news they report. The movie was subsequently re-issued as The Big Carnival, with "carnival" referring to what we now call a "circus".
