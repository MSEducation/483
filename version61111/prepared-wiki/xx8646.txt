Nerd (adjective: nerdy) is a descriptive term, often used pejoratively, indicating that a person is overly intellectual, obsessive, or socially impaired. They may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, obscure, or non-mainstream activities, which are generally either highly technical or relating to topics of fiction or fantasy, to the exclusion of more mainstream activities."Nerd | Define Nerd at Dictionary.com", "Dictionary.com, LLC" 2011, accessed May 13, 2011.nerd, n.

Though originally derogatory, "Nerd" is a stereotypical term, but as with other pejoratives, it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity.

==Etymology==

The first documented appearance of the word "nerd" is as the name of a creature in Dr. Seuss's book If I Ran the Zoo (1950), in which the narrator Gerald McGrew claims that he would collect "a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too" for his imaginary zoo.American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition, p. 1212, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston - New York - London, 1992Geisel, Theodor Seuss, If I Ran the Zoo, p. 47, Random House Books for Young Readers, New York, 1950 The slang meaning of the term dates back to 1951, when Newsweek magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for "drip" or "square" in Detroit, Michigan.Newsweek 'Jelly Tot, Square Bear-Man!' (1951-10-8), p. 28 By the early 1960s, usage of the term had spread throughout the United States, and even as far as Scotland.Gregory J. Marsh in Special Collections at the Swarthmore College library as reported in Humanist Discussion Group (1990-6-28) Vol. 4, No. 0235.Glasgow, Scotland, Sunday Mail (1957-2-10) At some point, the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude.
An alternate spelling, as nurd, also began to appear in the mid-1960s or early 1970s.Current Slang: A Quarterly Glossary of Slang Expressions Currently In Use (1971), Vol. V, No. 4, Spring 1971, p. 17 Author Philip K. Dick claimed to have coined this spelling in 1973, but its first recorded use appeared in a 1965 student publication at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Personal Correspondence (1973-9-4) reported on the webRPI Bachelor (1965), V14 #1 Oral tradition there holds that the word is derived from "knurd" ("drunk" spelled backwards), which was used to describe people who studied rather than partied. On the other hand, the variant "gnurd" was in wide use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology throughout the first half of the 1970s.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Other theories of the word's origin suggest that it may derive from Mortimer Snerd, Edgar Bergen's ventriloquist dummy,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] or the Northern Electric Research and Development (N.E.R.& D.) Laboratories in Ontario (now Nortel).[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The Online Etymology Dictionary speculates that the word is an alteration of the 1940s term nert (meaning "stupid or crazy person"), which is itself an alteration of "nut".[tpl]OEtymD|nerd[/tpl]
The term was popularized in the 1970s by its heavy use in the sitcom Happy Days.

==Typical stereotype==

Nerds can either be described by their hobbies and interests, or by abstract qualities such as personality, status, social skills, and physical appearance.

==="Nerdy" interests===

Some interests and activities that are likely to be described as nerdy are:
"Weird Al" Yankovic's song "White and Nerdy" states many other stereotypical nerd interests, including the Segway, ten-pin bowling, A.V. Club, the Renaissance Fair, editing Wikipedia, and Dungeons and Dragons. [tpl]cite web|last=Yankovic|first="Weird Al"|title=White and Nerdy|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/white-nerdy-lyrics-weird-al-yankovic.html[/tpl]  
An interest can also be nerdy because of its association with "nerdy" people. For example, the stereotype of a "Band nerd" comes from the opinion that many high school band students are goofy or socially inept (except with other band students), things that would brand a person as a nerd. But, it has been applied to all students that are in band or orchestra, even the ones with little involvement (see School band#Stereotypes and popular culture).
Over time, an activity or subject can become less nerdy. This may be because of availability, because of better applications for the general public, or because of a shifting image of the majority of people taking that interest. Examples of such activities include computers, video games, the internet, and television.

===Personality and physical appearance===

Stereotypical nerds are commonly seen as intelligent but socially and physically awkward.Kids Called Nerds: Challenge and Hope For Children With Mild Pervasive Developmental Disorders, by Nicholas Putnam, M.D. They would typically be perceived as either lacking confidence or being indifferent or oblivious to the negative perceptions held of them by others, with the result that they become frequent objects of scorn, ridicule, bullying, and social isolation. However, many nerds may eventually find a group of similar people to associate with.[tpl]cite web|title=The Well-dressed Geek|url=http://geekstudies.org/papers/mit5-presentation-notes.pdf|publisher=geekstudies.org[/tpl]
Because of the nerd stereotype, many smart people are often thought of as nerdy. This belief can be harmful, as it can cause high school students to "switch off their lights" out of fear of being branded as one of them,[tpl]cite news|last=Anderegg|first=Mr|title=In Praise of Nerds|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10493332|work=The Economist|date=12 January 2008[/tpl] and cause otherwise appealing people to be nerdy simply for their intellect. It was once thought that intellectuals were nerdy because they were envied. However, Paul Graham stated in his essay, "Why Nerds are Unpopular", that intellect is neutral, meaning that you are neither loved or despised for it. He also states that it is only the correlation that makes smart teens automatically seem nerdy, and that a nerd is someone that is not socially adept enough. Additionally, he says that the reason why many smart kids are unpopular is that they "don't have time for the activities required for popularity."[tpl]cite web|last=Graham|first=Paul|title=Why Nerds are Unpopular|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html[/tpl]
Stereotypical "nerd" appearance includes very large glasses, braces, severe acne and pants highly lifted up. In the media, many nerds are white males, portrayed as being physically unfit, either overweight or very thin.Lori Kendall. "OH NO! I'M A NERD!": Hegemonic Masculinity on an Online Forum. Gender Society. 14: 256. (2000)Ron Eglash. Race, Sex, and Nerds. Social Text. 20: 49 (2002)  It has been suggested by some, such as linguist Mary Bucholtz, that being a nerd may be a state of being "hyperwhite" and rejecting African-American culture and slang that "cool" white children use.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/magazine/29wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=1&ref=magazine&oref=slogin|title= Who’s a Nerd, Anyway? |accessdate=2007-07-28 |author=Benjamin Nugent|date=July 29, 2007|work=New York Times Magazine[/tpl] However, after the Revenge of the Nerds movie franchise (with multicultural nerds), and the introduction of the Steve Urkel character on the television series Family Matters, nerds have been seen in all races and colors as well as more recently being a frequent young Asian or Indian male stereotype in North America. Portrayal of "nerd girls", in films such as She's Out of Control, Welcome to the Dollhouse and She's All That depicts that smart but nerdy women might suffer later in life if they do not focus on improving their physical attractiveness.[tpl]Cite book|last=Gateward|first=Frances K.|coauthors=Murray Pomerance|title=Sugar, spice, and everything nice: cinemas of girlhood|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8143-2918-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ywsajx7jqAMC&pg=PA239&dq=nerd+girl|accessdate=2009-07-23|postscript=.[/tpl]
In the United States, a 2010 study indicated that Asian Americans are perceived as most likely to be nerds, followed by White Americans, while non-White Hispanics and Black Americans were perceived as least likely to be nerds. This stereotype may be socially damaging due to exclusion.Qin Zhang. “Asian Americans Beyond the Model Minority Stereotype: The Nerdy and the Left Out”. Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, Vol 3, Issue 1 (2010), pp. 20-37 Among Whites, Jews are perceived as the most nerdy and are stereotyped in similar ways to Asians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/arts-and-culture/how_stereotypes_jews_and_asians_evolved_nerd|title=How Stereotypes of Jews and Asians Evolved into the Nerd - See more at: http://www.jewcy.com/arts-and-culture/how_stereotypes_jews_and_asians_evolved_nerd#sthash.TKN0sbMj.dpuf|author=Benjamin Nugent[/tpl]

===Medical and mental disorders===

Nerdiness is often compared to one or more medical disorders.

==Nerd pride==

The rise of the computer industry has allowed many "nerdy" people (most notably Bill Gates) to accumulate large fortunes. Many stereotypically "nerdy" interests, such as superhero and science fiction works, are now popular culture hits.[tpl]cite news|last=Woyke|first=Elizabeth|title=Celebrity Nerds Come Out|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/09/19/celebrity-geeks-gadgets-tech-personal-cx_ew_0919celeb.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Forbes|date=09/19/08[/tpl]  Some measure of nerdiness are now allegedly considered desirable, as, to some, it suggests a person who is intelligent, respectful, interesting, and able to earn a large salary. Stereotypical nerd qualities are evolving, going from awkwardness and social ostracism to an allegedly more widespread acceptance and sometimes even celebration of their differences.[tpl]cite news|last=Cringely|first=Robert|title=Triumph of the Nerds: A History of the Computer|url=http://www.pbs.org/nerds/timeline/micro.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service[/tpl]
In the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds Robert Carradine worked to embody the nerd stereotype; in doing so, he helped create a definitive image of nerds.[tpl]Cite news | last = Singer | first = Jon | title = Carradine hits the jackpot as Lewis Skolnick | magazine = Lumino | date = 2005-08-28 | url = http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/341/10/ | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] Additionally, the storyline presaged, and may have helped inspire, the "nerd pride" that emerged in the 1990s. American Splendor regular Toby Radloff claims this was the movie that inspired him to become "The Genuine Nerd from Cleveland, Ohio."[tpl]Cite news | last = Hensley | first = Dennis | author-link = | title = Revenge of the nerd: American Splendor's Toby Radloff is out and proud about his sexuality and his nerddom | magazine = The Advocate |date=2003-09-02 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2003_Sept_2/ai_110737685 | format = | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl] In the American Splendor film, Toby's friend, American Splendor author Harvey Pekar, was less receptive to the movie, believing it to be hopelessly idealistic, explaining that Toby, an adult low income file clerk, had nothing in common with the middle class kids in the film who would eventually attain college degrees, success, and cease being perceived as nerds. Many, however, seem to share Radloff's view, as "nerd pride" has become more widespread in the years since. MIT professor Gerald Sussman, for example, seeks to instill pride in nerds:
[tpl]quote|My idea is to present an image to children that it is good to be intellectual, and not to care about the peer pressures to be anti-intellectual. I want every child to turn into a nerd - where that means someone who prefers studying and learning to competing for social dominance, which can unfortunately cause the downward spiral into social rejection.|Gerald Sussman, quoted by Katie Hafner, The New York Times, 29 August 1993[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/business/woman-computer-nerd-and-proud.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Woman, Computer Nerd -- and Proud|publisher=The New York Times|first=Katie|last=Hafner|date=29 August 1993|accessdate=11 June 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Bryan Caplan, a professor of Economics at George Mason University, refers to himself as "an openly nerdy man"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/ and has written of a "Jock/Nerd Theory of History".http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/06/redistribution_1.html  He believes that income redistribution is a tactic by Jocks to prevent Nerds from gaining power over them.
The popular computer-news website Slashdot uses the tagline "News for nerds. Stuff that matters." The Charles J. Sykes quote "Be nice to nerds.

The Green brothers, John Green and Hank Green of the popular YouTube account vlogbrothers have commonly referred to themselves as nerds, and much of their online personas are that of nerdy appeal. In fact, the name their fans have adapted reflects the popularity of this nerdy subculture, "Nerdfighters" or "Nerdfighteria."
An episode from the animated series Freakazoid, titled "Nerdator", includes the use of nerds to power the mind of a Predator-like enemy. Towards the middle of the show, he gave this speech. :
The Danish reality TV show FC Zulu, known in the internationally franchised format as FC Nerds, established a format wherein a team of nerds, after two or three months of training, competes with a professional soccer team.
Nerdcore hip hop is a genre of hip hop music that has risen in popularity over the last few years, often expressing nerd themes with pride and humor. Notable artists include mc chris, MC Plus+, MC Hawking, MC Lars, MC Paul Barman, and MC Frontalot. The term nerdcore has seen wider application to refer to webcomics (most notably Penny Arcade, User Friendly, PvP, and Megatokyo) and other media that express nerd themes without inhibition.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] In addition, many standard hip hop musicians self-identify as nerds including XV, Hopsin, Childish Gambino and Shad. In 2010, Lupe Fiasco and Pharrel Williams started the All City Chess Club, a movement for rappers who would be considered nerdy but do not fit into the nerdcore genre. Among those who self identify as part of the All City Chess Club include B.o.B and J. Cole.
However, those simply adopting the characteristics of nerds are not actually nerds by definition. One cannot be an authentic nerd by imitation alone; a nerd is an outsider and someone who is unable or unwilling to follow trends. Popular culture is borrowing the concept and image of nerds in order to stand out as individuals.Chicago Tribune Some commentators consider that the word is devalued when applied to people who adopt a sub-cultural pattern of behaviour, rather than being reserved for people with a marked ability.[tpl]cite news|last=Westcott|first=Kathryn|title=Are 'geek' and 'nerd' now positive terms?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20325517|work=News Magazine|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=16 November 2012[/tpl]

==Extensions==

A "blerd", a pormanteau of the words "black" and "nerd", is a person of African-descent who identifies with a set of behavioral traits which extend the "nerd" stereotype, being overly intellectual, obsessive, yet conversely in maintenance, whether personally deliberate or culturally accidental, of viable social graces, partly in virtue of the reclamation movement of the larger "nerd" culture, which seeks to reshape perspective and meaning of the term, and due to a lack of empirical-anthropological introspection of Western popular culture into African aesthetics and Diaspora.
"Blerd" was coined by the fictional character Dr. Christopher Turk of the American sitcom Scrubs.[tpl]cite episode |title=My Best Friend's Baby's Baby and My Baby's Baby |series=Scrubs |season=6 |number=2[/tpl]
