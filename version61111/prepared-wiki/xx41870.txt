==Life and career==

===1974–00: Early life and career beginnings===

Nelly was born in Austin, Texas, where his father was serving in the military. When he was seven, his parents divorced.[tpl]cite web|last=Townsel|first=Lisa Jones|title=Heating Up 'Nellyville'|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zdUDAAAAMBAJ|date=September 2002|page=144|volume=57|issue=11|work=Ebony|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Nelly moved with his mother from inner city St. Louis to suburban University City, Missouri as a teenager. While still in high school, Nelly formed the St. Lunatics, who enjoyed local popularity with their single "Gimme What Ya Got". When a major record deal failed to appear, Nelly decided to go solo.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=Nelly - Biography|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p416191/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=2008-04-26[/tpl] He was signed to Universal Music Group by A&R Kevin Law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Kevin_Law_2002_Int.html |title=Interview with Kevin Law |publisher=HitQuarters|date=3 Oct 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl] Law told HitQuarters that very few people at the record company liked Nelly when he was first signed, with the feedback he received from his colleagues on the rapper's music being "extraordinarily negative". Nelly was unusual for being a rapper from the Midwest at a time when the hip-hop scenes were centered around the East Coast, West Coast and the South. The label used this to their advantage by branding Nelly as a star of the Midwest, hoping to inspire pride in the people of St Louis and the surrounding region. Nelly was signed together with St. Lunatics. Kevin Law and Country from Fo'Reel Entertainment decided to do a solo record with Nelly first and then return to St. Lunatics the following year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_KevinLaw.html |title=Interview with Kevin Law |publisher=HitQuarters|date=28 Aug 2000 |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl]

===2000–03: Breakthrough with Country Grammar and Nellyville===

The label released his major label debut Country Grammar in 2000.

==Artistry==

Nelly's rapping style has been described by Peter Shapiro as using "unforgettable hooks based on schoolyard songs, double-dutch chants, and nonsense rhymes" and has a "Missouri twang".Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd edition, Penguin, p. 275. Allmusic suggests Nelly's style is based largely on where he comes from - "Nelly's locale certainly informs his rapping style, which is as much country as urban, and his dialect as well, which is as much Southern drawl as Midwestern twang". Nelly explains his method of writing in the book How to Rap, describing how he freestyles most of the lyrics before going back over them to "make it a little tighter",Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, pp. 151-152. he generally writes in the studio rather than at home,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 153. he normally comes up with a chorus for a song before writing the verses,Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 190. and he likes to write to the music he will be rapping over.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 169. Allmusic also notes his "tongue-twisting" hooks, which are also often sung rather than rapped.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r470821|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Country Grammar - Nelly |publisher=AllMusic |date=2000-06-06 |accessdate=2010-11-16[/tpl]
