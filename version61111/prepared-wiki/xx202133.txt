"Beni beni" is based on an 18th-century Turkish Sufi folk song.
"Ishq" and "Tamana" are based on ghazal by Khwaja Mir Dard.
The words to "Iman" are drawn from two ruba'iyat by different authors: Mirza Salamat Ali Dabir and Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali.
"Molk-e-Divan" is based on the ghazal Khiz tâ bâde dar pyâle konim by Sufi poet Khâju-ye Kermâni (خواجوی کرمانی) with a few alterations, and "Sadrang" draws the lyrics from works by Amir Khusrow (امیر خسرو دهلوی), a 13th-century mystic and poet who, like Niyaz's vocalist Azam Ali, was a Persian raised in India.
