Przekop ([tpl]IPA-pl|ˈpʂɛkɔp[/tpl]), (German: Weichseldurchstich) located in Poland, is a branch of the Vistula river in its delta.  It is also referred to as Przekop Wisły, which translates literally as Vistula Dug-through from Polish.
It was artificially created in 1895 to link the Leniwka branch with Gdańsk Bay near the village of Świbno.http://mdwe70.pl/web/aplikacja/index.php?id=przewodnik&str=22&lang=gb Currently, the main current of the Vistula reaches the sea through Przekop.
