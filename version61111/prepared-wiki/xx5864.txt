Karel Hynek Mácha ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈkarɛl ˈɦɪnɛk ˈmaːxa[/tpl]) (16 November 1810 – 6 November 1836) was a Czech romantic poet.

==Biography==

Mácha grew up in Prague, the son of a foreman at a mill. He learned Latin and German in school. He went on to study law at Prague University; during that time he also became involved in theatre (as an actor he first appeared in Jan Nepomuk Štěpánek's play Czech and German in July 1832 in BenešovAlbert Pražák: Karel Hynek Mácha, Prague 1936, p.21), where he met Eleonora Šomková, with whom he had a son out of wedlock. He was fond of travel, enjoying trips into the mountains, and was an avid walker. Eventually he moved to Litoměřice, a quiet town some 60 km from Prague, to prepare for law school exams and to write poetry. Three days before he was to be married to Šomková, just a few weeks after he had begun working as a legal assistant, Mácha overexerted himself while helping put out a fire and soon thereafter died of pneumonia. The day after his death had been scheduled as his wedding day in Prague.
Mácha was buried in Litoměřice in a pauper's grave. Recognition came after his death: in 1939, his remains were exhumed, and they were given a formal state burial at the Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague. A statue was erected in his honor in Petřín Park, Prague. In 1937 a biographical film, Karel Hynek Mácha, was made by Zet Molas (a pen name of Zdena Smolová). Lake Mácha ([tpl]lang-cz|Máchovo jezero[/tpl]) was named after him in 1961.
Macha was honored on a 50 Haleru and a 1 Koruna stamp on April 30, 1936, Scott Catalog # 213-214.  The stamp depicts a statue of Macha that is found in Prague and was issued by the postal agency of Czechoslovakia ('Ceskoslovensko').   He was again honored on a 43 koruna postage stamp issued by the postal agency of the Czech Republic ('Ceska Posta') on March 10, 2010.  This 43 koruna postage stamp is presented on a miniature souvenir sheet.  The Scott catalog number for this postage stamp honoring Macha is Scott #3446.

His lyrical epic poem "Máj" (May), published in 1836 shortly before his death, was judged by his contemporaries as confusing, too individualistic, and not in harmony with the national ideas.[ref]Marcela Sulak, "Introduction," in
