The Michigan Lake Shore Railroad (MLS) is a defunct railroad which operated in the state of Michigan between 1869 and 1878, and as the Grand Haven Railroad until 1881.
The MLS was formed on October 13, 1869, by the consolidation of the Allegan and Holland Rail Road and the Muskegon and Ferrysburg Railroad. The A&H had been organized on July 29, 1868; the M&F on January 22, 1869. By July 1, 1870 a [tpl]convert|57.5|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] line linked Allegan to Muskegon, on the coast of Lake Michigan. The company carried mostly lumber and had difficulty turning a profit; in 1872 it entered receivership. On October 1, 1878 it was reorganized as the Grand Haven Railroad, which operated the road for another three years until it was consolidated into the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad.Ivey (1919), 236; Michigan Railroad Commission (1879), 289.
