==Events of 2005==

In 2005, after weeks of civil unrest led by Evo Morales, former president Carlos Mesa offered his resignation to Congress. After Hormando Vaca Diez and Mario Cossío, presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, respectively, were forced by protestors to decline the post, Rodríguez — as head of the judiciary and fourth in the line of succession — became the country's new president on June 10, 2005.  Rodríguez was inaugurated with the constitutional mandate to call elections within one year's time.

Rodríguez's time in office ended with the inauguration of Evo Morales in January 2006, following the victory of Morales in the presidential election of the previous month.
