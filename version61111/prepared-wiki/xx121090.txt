[[Severn River (Queensland)]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Queensland, Murray-Darling basin, Darling Downs, Southern Downs Region

The Severn River, in Queensland, is a small river that rises in the Sundown National Park which joins the Dumaresq River near the Tenterfield Creek and Glenlyon Dam road.  The Dumaresq flows into the Macintyre River. The Severn river (Qld) is often noted as the ultimate source of the Darling River.  
The Severn River is one of the Border Rivers and ought not be confused with the nearby New South Wales river of the same name that flows directly into the Macintyre River.
River Red Gums, she-oaks, melaleucas and bottlebrushes can all be found along the river.Rankin, Robert. (1992) Secrets of the Scenic Rim. pp 55 - 74. Rankin Publishers p. 19. ISBN 0-9592418-3-3
