Siebert served in the United States Army and attended Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri. He thereafter relocated to San Antonio and founded American Health Insurance Services and Siebert and Associates. He is a registered lobbyist with expertise on insurance, health care, transportation, and telecommunications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/lobbying/lobbyist/21037/siebert-william-e-bill/|title=William Siebert: Lobbyist Directory|publisher=texastribune.org|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl]
In 1993, Siebert assumed the District 121 House seat when Alan Schoolcraft vacated the post to run unsuccessfully against Jeff Wentworth for the Texas State Senate. In the primary on March 10, 1992, Siebert finished second with 2,552 votes (21.6 percent) to Libba Barnes, who led a five-candidate field with 4,322 votes (36.6 percent). Three other candidates, Judy Sisk Millspaugh, Robert X. Johnson, and Davene Jonas, held the remaining 41 percent of the ballots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Republican primary election returns, March 10, 1992|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl] In the April 14 runoff, Siebert defeated Barnes, 4,877 (58.7 percent) to 3,429 (41.3 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Republican runoff primary election returns, April 14, 1992|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl] Siebert was then unopposed in the 1992 general election.
In 1996, Siebert was named "National Legislator of the Year" by the National Republican Legislators Association.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talhi.com/about.php|title=Bill Siebert|publisher=talhi.com|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl] Though he had been unopposed for the Republican nomination in 1998, Siebert was handily unseated in 2000 in the primary election by Elizabeth Ames Jones, later a member of the Texas Railroad Commission appointed by Governor Rick Perry. Siebert's work as a lobbyist while also serving in the legislature was denounced by the San Antonio Express-News, which urged voters to "clean house and dump Siebert, the local GOP's biggest embarrassment."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/2010-texas-governors-race/primary-races-tend-to-be-bloody/|title=Morgan Smith, "Primary Races Tend to Be Bloody," November 3, 2009|publisher=texastribune.org|accessdate=September 19, 2011[/tpl] The 2000 primary results were 8,053 (66.4 percent) for Jones and 4,082 (33.6 percent) for Siebert.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Republican primary election returns, March 14, 2000|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl]
In 2002, Siebert considered running for Texas's 23rd congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives but deferred to the incumbent, Henry Bonilla, who ran again successfully for Congress in 2002 and 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/texas-political-news/politics-on-hold/|title=Ross Ramsey, "Politics on Hold", September 17, 2001|publisher=texastribune.org|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl] Meanwhile, the District 121 House seat is now held by Joe Straus of San Antonio, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.
