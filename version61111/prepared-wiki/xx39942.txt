[[Western Approaches]]

CATEGORIES: Atlantic Ocean

The Western Approaches is a rectangular area of the Atlantic ocean lying on the western coast of British Isles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The rectangle area is higher than it is wide, with the north and south boundaries defined by the north and south ends of the British Isles, the eastern boundary lying on the western coast, and the western boundary in the Atlantic roughly at Iceland. The area is particularly important to the United Kingdom, because many of its larger shipping ports lie in this area.
The term is most commonly used when discussing naval warfare, notably during the First World War and Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War in which the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) attempted to blockade the United Kingdom using submarines (U-boats) operating in this area. Since almost all shipping to and from the United Kingdom passed through this area, it was an excellent hunting ground and had to be heavily defended.
