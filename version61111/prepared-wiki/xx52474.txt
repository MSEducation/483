 - The ranges denoted By biological stage may be used in closely monitored menstrual cycles in regard to other markers of its biological progression, with the time scale being compressed or stretched to how much faster or slower, respectively, the cycle progresses compared to an average cycle.
 - The ranges denoted Inter-cycle variability are more appropriate to use in non-monitored cycles with only the beginning of menstruation known, but where the woman accurately knows her average cycle lengths and time of ovulation, and that they are somewhat averagely regular, with the time scale being compressed or stretched to how much a woman's average cycle length is shorter or longer, respectively, than the average of the population. 
 - The ranges denoted Inter-woman variability are more appropriate to use when the average cycle lengths and time of ovulation are unknown, but only the beginning of menstruation is given.]]

==Genes==

The gene for the alpha subunit is located on chromosome 6q12.21.
The luteinizing hormone beta subunit gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.32. In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells. It is regulated by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the  hypothalamus. Inhibin, activin, and sex hormones do not affect genetic activity  for the beta subunit production of LH.

==Activity==

In both males and females, LH is essential for reproduction.
LH is released from the pituitary gland, and is controlled by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). When T levels are low, GnRH is released by the hypothalamus, stimulating the pituitary gland to release LH.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.testosteronetherapy.com/low_testosterone_treatment/male-fertility-treatment-hcg-lh-recombinant-fsh.html |accessdate=20 November  2013[/tpl] As the levels of T increase, it will act on the hypothalamus and pituitary through a negative feedback loop and inhibit the release of GnRH and LH consequently.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/mammalian-reproduction/hormones-in-the-male-reproductive-system/role-of-hormones-in-controlling-male-reproductive-system/ |accessdate=20 November  2013[/tpl] However, T must first be aromatized into Estradiol (E2) in order to inhibit LH. E2 decreases pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH from the hypothalamus onto the pituitary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/93/3/784.full|date=March 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl]
Changes in LH and testosterone (T) blood levels and pulse secretions are induced by changes in sexual arousal in human males.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306453093900056|title= LH pulsatile secretion and testosterone blood levels are influenced by sexual arousal in human males| last=Stoleru|first=S.|year=1993|publisher=Psyconeuroendocrinology|accessdate=12 November 2012[/tpl]

==Normal levels==

LH levels are normally low during childhood and, in women,  high after menopause. As LH is secreted as pulses, it is necessary to follow its concentration over a sufficient period of time to get a proper information about its blood level.
During the reproductive years, typical levels are  between 1-20 IU/L. Physiologic high LH levels are seen during the LH surge (v.s.); typically they last 48 hours.
In males over 18 years of age, reference ranges have been estimated to be 1.8-8.6 IU/L.Mayo Medical Laboratories > Test ID: LH, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Serum, retrieved December 2012
LH is measured in International Units (IU). For Human Urinary LH, one IU is defined as the amount of LH that has an activity corresponding to 0.13369 mg of pure Human Urinary LH.World Health Organization Technical Report Series N0. 565.

==Predicting ovulation==

The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending ovulation. LH can be detected by urinary ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nielsen M, Barton S, Hatasaka H, Stanford J |title=Comparison of several one-step home urinary luteinizing hormone detection test kits to OvuQuick |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=384–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11476792 |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(01)01881-7[/tpl]  A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24–48 hours, giving women two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intentions of conceiving.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pinelandpress.com/faq/opk.html|title=Ovulation Predictor Kit Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fertility Plus|accessdate=12 March 2012[/tpl]
Tests may be read manually using a colour-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.
Tests for luteinising hormone may be combined with testing for estradiol in tests such as the Clearblue fertility monitor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://opregnancy.com/how-to-get-pregnant/|title= How to Get Pregnant|year=2009|publisher=OPregnancy.com|accessdate=12 March 2012[/tpl]
The sensitivity of LH tests are measured in milli international unit, with tests commonly available in the range 10–40 m.i.u. (the lower the number, the higher the sensitivity) [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
As sperm can stay viable in the woman for several days, LH tests are not recommended for contraceptive practices, as the LH surge typically occurs after the beginning of the fertile window.

==Disease states==

===Relative elevations===

In children with precocious puberty of pituitary or central origin, LH and FSH levels may be in the reproductive range instead of the low levels typical for their age.
During the reproductive years, relatively elevated LH is frequently seen in patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome; however, it would be unusual for them to have LH levels outside of the normal reproductive range.

===High LH levels===

Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of  both LH and FSH. While this is typical in the menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of:

===Deficient LH activity===

Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, amenorrhea  is commonly observed.
Conditions with very low LH secretions are:

==Availability==

LH  is available mixed with FSH in the form of Pergonal, and other forms of urinary gonadotropins . More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant LH is available as lutropin alfa (Luveris).Luveris information  All these medications have to be given parenterally. They are commonly used in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, the notable one being in IVF therapy.
Often, HCG medication is used as an LH substitute because it activates the same receptor. Medically used hCG is derived from urine of pregnant women, is less costly, and has a longer half-life than LH.
