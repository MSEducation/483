Edlin is a line editor, and the only text editor provided with early versions of MS-DOS. Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen edit command, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems.

==History==

Edlin was created by Tim Paterson in two weeks in 1980, for Seattle Computer Products's 86-DOS (QDOS)A Short History of MS-DOS based on the CP/M line editor ED.ED Utility
Microsoft acquired 86-DOS and sold it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1.0–v5.0 of MS-DOS, after which the only editor included was the new full-screen EDIT.EXE in v6.0–v8.0. 
Early Windows versions ran on top of the later versions of MS-DOS, so Edlin was typically not available. 
However, Edlin is included in the 32-bit versions of Windows NT16-Bit Applications Included with Windows NT, microsoft.com and its derivatives—up to and including Windows 8—because the NTVDM's DOS support in those operating systems is based on MS-DOS version 5.0. However, unlike most other external DOS commands, it has not been transformed into a native Win32 program. It also does not support long filenames, which were not added to MS-DOS and MS-Windows until long after Edlin was written.

==Usage==

There are only a few commands. The short list can be found by entering a ? at the edlin prompt.
When a file is open, typing L lists the contents (e.g., 1,6L lists lines 1 through 6). Each line is displayed with a line number in front of it.
 *1,6L

        3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages
        4: branded with a logo at the bottom:

        6: The things that some people put themselves through. ;-)
 *
The currently selected line has a *.  To replace the contents of any line, the line number is entered and any text entered replaces the original.  While editing a line pressing Ctrl-C cancels any changes. The * marker remains on that line.
Entering I (optionally preceded with a line number) inserts one or more lines before the * line or the line given.  When finished entering lines, Ctrl-C returns to the edlin command prompt.
 *6I
        6:*(...or similar)
