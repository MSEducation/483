==Fictional character biographies==

===Irving Norbett===

Professor Irving Norbert is a scientist who was exposed to the gases of a meteor. The result caused him to develop a Jekyll and Hyde-type personality with the bad one turning to a life of crime. Using his knowledge of astronomy, Norbert became a costumed villain named Planet Master and used weapons based on the nine planets. He managed to outwit Batman and Robin in the first battle. Norbert's unscrupulous assistant Edward Burke discovered the double identity of his boss, and decided to either join forces with Planet Master or to use his equipment on his own. Ultimately, though, the effects of the gas wore off. Norbert's criminal self was erased and Batman brought Burke to justice.Detective Comics #296

===Edward Burke===

When Kobra was creating a strike-force called Strikeforce Kobra to usurp Stagg Enterprises in his goal of world domination, one of the villains he created was patterned after the original Planet Master. What makes this version different from the original is that he can simulate the abilities of the other planets. He alongside the other members of Strikeforce Kobra fought the Outsiders and was defeated.Outsiders #21
Although never stated, it is possible that this Planet Master is Edward Burke (who was the former assistant of the first Planet Master). Even years ago, Burke planned to use the original Planet Master's equipment in crime.
Either way, this Planet Master popped up as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.Infinite Crisis #7

==Powers and abilities==

The first Planet Master uses weapons based on the planets.
The second Planet Master could simulate the conditions typical to any of the nine planets in our solar system. For example, he can use the speed of Mercury, the heat of Mars, the strength of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the cold of Pluto.
