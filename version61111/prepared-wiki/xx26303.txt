Arnold Joseph Toynbee CH (14 April 1889 – 22 October 1975) was a British historian, philosopher of history, research professor of International History at the London School of Economics and the University of London and author of numerous books. Toynbee in the 1918–1950 period was a leading specialist on international affairs.
He is best known for his 12-volume A Study of History (1934–61), through which he  ...examined the rise and fall of 26 civilizations in the course of human history, and he concluded that they rose by responding successfully to challenges under the leadership of creative minorities composed of elite leaders.[tpl]cite web |title=Arnold Toynbee |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601310/Arnold-Joseph-Toynbee |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Academic Edition |publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. |date=6 Apr 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]  With his endless output of papers, articles, speeches and presentations, and numerous books translated into many languages, Toynbee was perhaps the world’s most read and discussed scholar in the 1940s and 1950s. Yet Toynbee's work lost favor among both the general public and scholars by the 1960s, due to the religious and spiritual outlook that permeates the largest part of his work. His work is considered today controversial and is seldom read or cited.[tpl]cite book |last=Perry |first=Marvin |title=Arnold Toynbee and the Western Tradition |series=American University Studies—5—Philosophy |volume=169|location=New York |publisher=Peter Lang |year=1996.XII |isbn=978-0820426716[/tpl]

==Biography==

Toynbee (born in London on 14 April 1889) was the grandson of Joseph Toynbee, nephew of the 19th-century economist Arnold Toynbee (1852–1883) and descendant of prominent British intellectuals for several generations. He was educated at Winchester College, Balliol College, Oxford (classics, 1911), and studied briefly at the British School at Athens, an experience that influenced the genesis of his philosophy about the decline of civilizations. In 1912 he became a tutor and fellow in ancient history at Balliol College, and in 1915 he began working for the intelligence department of the British Foreign Office. After serving as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 he was appointed professor of Byzantine and modern Greek studies at the University of London. From 1921 to 1922 he was the Manchester Guardian correspondent during the Greco-Turkish War, an experience that resulted in the publication of The Western Question in Greece and Turkey.[tpl]cite book |last=Toynbee |first=Arnold J. |title=The Western Question in Greece and Turkey: A Study in the Contact of Civilisations |url=http://louisville.edu/a-s/history/turks/WesternQuestion.pdf |year=1922 |location=London |publisher=Constable and Company Ltd.[/tpl] In 1925 he became research professor of international history at the London School of Economics and director of studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
His first marriage was to Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), daughter of Gilbert Murray, in 1913; they had three sons, of whom Philip Toynbee was the second. They divorced in 1946; Toynbee then married his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, in the same year.[tpl]cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

==Academic and cultural influence==

Michael Lang says that for much of the twentieth century: 
A Study of History was both a commercial and academic phenomenon. In the U.S. alone, more than seven thousand sets of the ten-volume edition had been sold by 1955. Most people, including scholars, relied on the very clear one-volume abridgement of the first six volumes by Somervell, which appeared in 1947; the abridgement sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. The press printed innumerable discussions of Toynbee's work, not to mention there being countless lectures and seminars. Toynbee himself often participated. He appeared on the cover of Time Magazine in 1947, with an article describing his work as "the most provocative work of historical theory written in England since Karl Marx’s Capital”,[tpl]cite journal |last=Kennan |first=George F. |authorlink=George F.

Canadian historians were especially receptive to Toynbee's work in the late 1940s. The Canadian economic historian Harold Adams Innis (1894 – 1952) was a notable example. Following Toynbee and others (Spengler, Kroeber, Sorokin, Cochrane), Innis examined the flourishing of civilizations in terms of administration of empires and media of communication.[tpl]cite book |last=Massolin |first=Philip Alphonse |title=Canadian Intellectuals, the Tory Tradition, and the Challenge of Modernity, 1939-1970 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8fL-lB1VJ4wC&pg=PA162 |year=2001 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0802035097 |page=162[/tpl]
Toynbee's overall theory was taken up by some scholars, for example, Ernst Robert Curtius, as a sort of paradigm in the post-war period. Curtius wrote as follows in the opening pages of European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages (1953 English translation), following close on Toynbee, as he sets the stage for his vast study of medieval Latin literature. Curtius wrote, "How do cultures, and the historical entities which are their media, arise, grow and decay? Only a comparative morphology with exact procedures can hope to answer these questions. It was Arnold J. Toynbee who undertook the task."[tpl]cite book |last=Curtius |first=Ernst Robert |authorlink=Ernst Robert Curtius|title=European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/European_Literature_and_the_Latin_Middle.html?id=WrSpNfsBcocC |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1953[/tpl]
After 1960, Toynbee's ideas faded both in academia and the media, to the point of seldom being cited today.[tpl]cite book |editor1-last=McIntire |editor1-first=C.

==Political influence in foreign policy==

  While the writing of the Study was under way, Toynbee produced numerous smaller works and served as director of foreign research of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1939–43) and director of the research department of the Foreign Office (1943–46); he also retained his position at the London School of Economics until his retirement in 1956. 
Toynbee worked for the Political Intelligence Department of the British Foreign Office during World War I and served as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He was director of studies at Chatham House, Balliol College, Oxford University, 1924–43. Chatham House conducted research for the British Foreign Office and was an important intellectual resource during World War II when it was transferred to London. With his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, Toynbee was co-editor of the RIIA's annual Survey of International Affairs, which became the "bible" for international specialists in Britain.[tpl]cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Greece and the Middle East===

Toynbee was a leading analyst of developments in the Middle East.  His support for Greece and hostility to the Turks during the World War had gained him an appointment to the Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History at the University of London. However, after the war he changed to a pro-Turkish position, accusing Greece's military government in occupied Turkish territory of atrocities and massacres. This earned him the enmity of the wealthy Greeks who had endowed the chair, and in 1924 he was forced to resign the position. His stance during World War I reflected less sympathy for the Arab cause and a pro-Zionist outlook. He also expressed support for a Jewish State in Palestine, which he believed had "begun to recover its ancient prosperity" as a result. Toynbee investigated Zionism in 1915 at the Information Department of the Foreign Office, and in 1917 he published a memorandum with his colleague Lewis Namier which supported exclusive Jewish political rights in Palestine. In 1922 he was influenced by the Palestine Arab delegation which was visiting London, and he adopted their views. His subsequent writings show the way he changed his outlook on the subject, and in the late 1930s he moved away from supporting the Zionist cause and moved toward the Arab camp. By the 1950s he was an opponent of the state of Israel.[tpl]cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Isaiah |title=Arnold Toynbee: Pro-Arab or Pro-Zionist? |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html |date=Spring 1999 |journal=Israel Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1353/is.1999.0019 |accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]

===Russia===

Toynbee was troubled by the Russian Revolution, for he saw Russia as a non-Western society and the revolution as a threat to Western society.[tpl]cite journal |last=Paquette |first=Gabriel B. |title=The Impact of the 1917 Russian Revolutions on Arnold J. Toynbee's Historical Thought, 1917-34 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546540008575717 |journal=Revolutionary Russia |date=June 2000 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=55-80 |doi=10.1080/09546540008575717 |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl] However in 1952 he argued that the Soviet Union had been a victim of Western aggression. He portrayed the Cold War as  a religious competition that pitted a Marxist materialist heresy against the West's spiritual Christian heritage—a heritage that had already been foolishly rejected by a secularized West. A heated debate ensued; an editorial in the London Times promptly attacked Toynbee for treating communism as a "spiritual force."[tpl]cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Dialogue with Daisaku Ikeda===

In 1972 Toynbee developed communications with Soka Gakkai International's leader Daisaku Ikeda who condemned the "demonic" nature of the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Toynbee had the view that the Atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was an invention that has caused warfare to escalate from a political scale to civilizational proportions and threatens humanity's very existence. He worried that humankind would not be able to strengthen ethical behavior and achieve self-mastery "in spite of the widespread awareness that the price of failing to respond to the moral challenge of the atomic age may be the self-liquidation of our species."  The two men first met on 5 May 1972, and in May 1973, Ikeda again flew to London to meet with the historian for 40 hours over a period of 10 days. Their dialogue and correspondence culminated in the publication of Choose Life, a record of their views on critical issues confronting humanity. The book has been published in 24 languages to date.[tpl]cite web |title=Choose Life--Arnold Toynbee and Daisaku Ikeda" Exhibition Opens in Hiroshima |url=http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |date=23 July 2005 |website=Soka Gakkai International |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]
An exhibition celebrating the 30th anniversary of this encounter was presented in various SGI's centers around the world in 2005, showcasing contents of the dialogues between Toynbee and Ikeda; and Ikeda's discussions for peace with over 1,500 of the world's scholars, intellects, and activists. Original letters the two exchanged were also displayed.[tpl]cite journal |title=Thirtieth Anniversary of Toynbee-Ikeda Dialogue |url=http://www.sgiquarterly.org/news2003Jan-4.html |journal=SGI Quarterly |date=January 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]
In 1984 his granddaughter Polly Toynbee wrote a critical article for The Guardian on meeting Daisaku Ikeda.[tpl]cite news |last=Toynbee |first=Polly |title=The Value of a Grandfather Figure |url=http://www.toride.org/edata/toynbee.html |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |date=19 May 1984 |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]

===Meeting with Adolf Hitler===

While on a visit in Berlin in 1936 to address the Nazi Law Society, Toynbee was invited to have a private interview with Adolf Hitler, at Hitler's request.[tpl]cite book |last=Brody |first=J.

Toynbee was convinced of Hitler's sincerity and endorsed Hitler's message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.[tpl]cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

==Challenge and response==

With the civilizations as units identified, he presented the history of each in terms of challenge-and-response, sometimes referred to as theory about the law of challenge and response. Civilizations arose in response to some set of challenges of extreme difficulty, when "creative minorities" devised solutions that reoriented their entire society. Challenges and responses were physical, as when the Sumerians exploited the intractable swamps of southern Iraq by organizing the Neolithic inhabitants into a society capable of carrying out large-scale irrigation projects; or social, as when the Catholic Church resolved the chaos of post-Roman Europe by enrolling the new Germanic kingdoms in a single religious community. When a civilization responded to challenges, it grew. Civilizations declined when their leaders stopped responding creatively, and the civilizations then sank owing to nationalism, militarism, and the tyranny of a despotic minority. According to an Editor's Note in an edition of Toynbee's A Study of History, Toynbee believed that societies always die from suicide or murder rather than from natural causes, and nearly always from suicide.[tpl]cite book|author=Arnold J.

==Toynbee Prize Foundation==

 Named after Arnold J. Toynbee, the Prize Foundation was chartered in 1987 'to contribute to the development of the social sciences, as defined from a broad historical view of human society and of human and social problems.' In addition to awarding the Toynbee Prize, the foundation sponsors scholarly engagement with global history through sponsorship of sessions at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, of international conferences, of the  journal New Global Studies¸ and of the Global History Forum.[tpl]cite web |title=The Toynbee Prize Foundation |url=http://toynbeeprize.org/toynbee-prize-foundation/ |publisher=Toynbee Foundation |accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl] 
The Toynbee Prize is an honorary award, recognizing social scientists for significant academic and public contributions to humanity. Currently, it is awarded every other year for work that makes a significant contribution to the study of global history. The recipients have been Raymond Aron, Lord Kenneth Clark, Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, Natalie Zemon Davis, Albert Hirschman, George Kennan, Bruce Mazlish, John McNeill, William McNeill, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Barbara Ward, Lady Jackson, Sir Brian Urquhart, and Professor Michael Adas.

==Allusions in popular culture==

Toynbee's ideas also feature in the Ray Bradbury short story named "The Toynbee Convector". He appears alongside T. E. Lawrence as a character in an episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, dealing with the post-World War I treaty negotiations at Versailles.  He also receives a brief mention in the Charles Harness classic, The Paradox Men (a working title was Toynbee 22). Frederick Buechner also mentions him in the 1957 novel The return of Ansel Gibbs. Most versions of the Civilization computer game refer to his work as a historian as well. Toynbee receives mention in Pat Frank's post-apocalyptic novel "Alas, Babylon". A character in the P. Schuyler Miller short story "As Never Was" adopts the name Toynbee "out of admiration for a historian of that name". He is also mentioned in the Tom Robbins novel, Another Roadside Attraction. Toynbee is also the title of a song by the modern rock group Manic Bloom from the album "In Loving Memory", the lyrics of which refer to the inevitability of the fall of society given the opportunity at hand to reclaim the future.
