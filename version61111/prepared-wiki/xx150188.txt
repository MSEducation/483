==Collaborators==

The group's line-up and their album guest lists encompass musicians who’ve played in many well established acts from the experimental side of the indie rock genre. Yet The Flowers of Hell regularly emphasize that it’s mainly side players that they work with and refute any notions of being a super group. Some of those side players are full-time members of larger acts, while a few are people who’ve been brought in by larger acts on a casual basis. Amongst the musicians who’ve played with them on their recordings and/or during their live shows are Pete 'Sonic Boom' Kember (Spacemen 3, Spectrum, E.A.R.), Will Carruthers (Spacemen 3, Spiritualized, Brian Jonestown Massacre), Ray Dickaty (Spiritualized), Ivan Kral (Patti Smith Group, Iggy Pop's band, Blondie, John Cale’s band), Ivo Pospíšil (DG 307, Garáž),Adams, Gregory.

==Albums==

The Flowers of Hell  
Produced with Tim Holmes of Death in Vegas at the Contino Rooms in London, their self-titled debut album was praised in the British music press for building classical tangents from the sound of The Velvet Underground and Spacemen 3/Spiritualized. Sonic Boom  of Spacemen 3/Spectrum/E.A.R. collaborated with the group on ‘Through The F Hole’ and mentored the band during the recording of the album. The album was originally released in 2006 on the now defunct Earworm Records label (Spacemen 3, Yo La Tengo, The Earlies, Bright Eyes, The Apples in Stereo) and was re-released on Starmole Records in Japan in 2007.
Come Hell Or High Water 
The group's 2009 album was recorded in over 40 sessions with 30 musicians in London, Prague, Toronto, Detroit, & Texas. It was conceived of as a celebration of synaesthesia, and Jarvis based the composing, recording, arranging, and preliminary mixing on his synaesthetic visions.[ref]

O 
Released in November 2010 on a double sided CD/DVD with a stereo mix and a 5.1 surround sound mix, O is a 45 minute track that combines improvisations with-in a fixed song structure. Derived from the concept of 'absolute music', Greg Jarvis and The Earlies' Tom Knott co-mixed the record based on their synaesthetic visions (both synaesthetes, Jarvis sees sounds as shapes while Knott sees them as colours). "O" was engineered by Jon Drew. The DVD also includes Live At The Music Gallery, an hour-long concert film for which the audio was recorded by Peter Moore & Perren Baker with the same sole mic that the two had famously produced the Cowboy Junkies Trinity Session album with.[ref]

Odes 
Finished in 2012, their 4th studio album is a covers record and is their first release to feature lyrics and verse-chorus-verse song structures. Its first public airing came when Lou Reed opened his July 20, 2012 radio show premiering three songs from an advance copy of the record, O Superheroin (a marriage of Laurie Anderson's O Superman and Lou Reed's Heroin), Mr. Tambourine Man (re-imagined to sound like The Velvet Underground circa 1967),[ref]
