==History==

Fassuta was built on the ruins of the Crusader castle of Fassove, which was built on the ruins of Mifshata (Mafsheta), a Jewish village established after destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DF1339F93BA2575AC0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4|title=An Arab Voice in Israel|publisher=The New York Times|author=Marzorati, Gerald|date=1988-09-11|accessdate=2008-10-25[/tpl]
In 1596, Fassuta appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Akka of the Liwa of Safad.  It had a population of 12 Muslim households and 3 Muslim bachelors. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit trees, and goats or beehives.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 194
In 1881, Conder and Kitchener described Fassuta as "a village, built of stone, containing about 200 Christians, situated on ridge, with gardens of figs, olives, and arable land. There are two cisterns in the village, and a good spring near."Conder and Kitchener, 1881, p. 197
Between 1922 and 1947, the population of Fassuta increased by 120%. Transformation in Arab Settlement, Moshe Brawer, in The Land that Became Israel: Studies in Historical Geography, Ruth Kark (ed), Magnes Press, Jerusalem 1989, p.177In the 1931 census of Palestine, the combined population of Fassuta and Mansura had a population of 507 Palestinian Christians and 81 Muslims living in 129 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100 
By 1945 the combined population of Fassuta, Mansura and Dayr al-Qasi was 2,300. The population of Fassuta was half Muslim and half Christian. At the end of October 1948 the village was captured by the Israeli army during Operation Hiram. Most of the Muslim population fled or were expelled but many of the Christians remained. In December 1949 the IDF put forward a plan to expel the remaining population of Fassuta and five other villages in order to create a 5-10km Arab-free zone along the Lebanon border. This plan was blocked by the Foreign Ministry which feared international reaction.Morris, 1987, pp. 225, 242, 251 The Arab population remained under Martial Law until 1966.

==Archaeology==

In the 1870s, Guerin found traces of ancient ruins: "Numerous cisterns, a great reservoir, vestiges of many ruined houses, fine cut stones marking out floors, and a dozen of presses nearly perfect. These presses are all on the same model : worked in the rock, they consisted of two compartments, one larger, in which the grapes were placed,
and one smaller and lower down, in which the juice was received. In the humble church of the modern hamlet I remarked a chapter imitating Corinthian, and probably of Byzantine
period. On two of its faces a cross with equal branches has been sculptured. Above the door of the main church has been placed for a lintel a fragment of frieze decorated with
flowers and foliage elegantly executed."Guérin,1880, p. 67 (translation from SWP I, p. 222)
