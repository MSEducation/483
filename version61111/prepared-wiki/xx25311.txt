==History==

===Toponymy===

The name Boston is said to be a contraction of St Botolph's town or of St Botolph's stone. However, fewer people now believe the story, still current, that a settlement in Boston dates from AD 654, when a Saxon monk, named Botolph, established a monastery on the banks of the River Witham. One reason for doubting this is that, in 654, the Witham did not flow near the site of Boston. (The early medieval geography of The Fens was much more fluid than it is today.) Botolph's establishment is most likely to have been in Suffolk. However, he was a popular missionary, to whom many churches between Yorkshire and Sussex, including that of Boston, are dedicated.

===Early history===

The Domesday Book of 1086, does not mention Boston by name. However, nearby settlements, the tenant-of-chief of which was Count Alan Rufus of Brittany, are covered; an example is Skirbeck, part of the very wealthy manor of Drayton, which before 1066 had been owned by Ralph the Staller, Edward the Confessor's Earl of East Anglia. Skirbeck had two churches and one is likely to have been that dedicated to St Botolph, in what was consequently Botolph's town. Skirbeck ([tpl]Gbmapscaled|TF339433|200|map[/tpl]) is now considered part of Boston, but the name remains, as a church parish and an electoral ward.
The order of importance was the other way round, when the Boston quarter of Skirbeck developed at the head of the Haven, which lies under the present Market Place. At that stage, The Haven was the tidal part of the stream, now represented by the Stone Bridge Drain ([tpl]Gbmapscaled|TF347490|200|map[/tpl]), which carried the water from the East and West Fens. The line of the road through Wide Bargate, to A52 and A16, is likely to have developed on its marine silt levees [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]. It led, as it does now, to the relatively high ground at Sibsey ([tpl]Gbmapscaled|TF350500|200|map[/tpl]), and thence to Lindsey.
The reason for the original development of the town, away from the centre of Skirbeck, was that Boston lay on the point where navigable tidal water was alongside the land route, which used the Devensian terminal moraine ridge at Sibsey, between the upland of East Lindsey and the three routes to the south of Boston:
The River Witham seems to have joined The Haven after the flood of September 1014, having abandoned the port of Drayton, on what subsequently became known as Bicker Haven. The predecessor of Ralph the Staller owned most of both Skirbeck and Drayton, so it was a relatively simple task to transfer his business from Drayton, but the Domesday Book of 1086 still records his source of income in Boston under the heading of Drayton, so Boston's name is famously not mentioned. The Town Bridge still maintains the pre-flood route, along the old Haven bank.

===Growth===

After the Norman Conquest, Ralph the Staller's property was taken over by Count Alana. It subsequently came to be attached to the Earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire, and known as the Richmond Fee. It lay on the left bank of The Haven.
During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Boston grew into a notable town and port.[tpl]harvnb|Morris|1979|page=101[/tpl]  The quinzieme was a duty raised on the fifteenth part (6.667%) of the value of merchants' moveable goods at the various trading towns of England. In 1204, when the merchants of London paid £836, those of Boston paid £780b.
Thus by the opening of the thirteenth century, it was already significant in trade with the continent of Europe and ranked as a port of the Hanseatic League.[tpl]cite book|title=Official Guide to Boston|year=no date, probable 1970s|publisher=Ed J Burrow & Co Ltd|author=Borough of Boston|page=13 paragraph 1[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=A Short History Of Boston|year=1986|publisher=Guardian Press of Boston|edition=4th Edition|editor=H. W. Nicholson|page=2[/tpl] It was one of the official "staple towns" of England, authorized to carry on the import and export trade. Much of Boston's trade at this time was in wool, and Boston is said by the locals to have been built on it. Apart from wool, Boston also exported salt, produced locally on the Holland coast, grain, produced up-river, and lead, produced in Derbyshire and brought via Lincoln, up-river. The wool export trade began to decline in the fifteenth century as the industry shifted to the value-adding business of weaving, which was conducted in other parts of the country, the Hansa merchants quit the town, and Boston's wealth declined.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries four orders of friars arrived in Boston: Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Augustinians. As the English Reformation progressed, their friaries were closed by King Henry VIII. The refectory of the Dominican friary was eventually converted into a theatre in 1965, and now houses the Blackfriars Arts Centre.
The town received its charter from Henry VIII in 1545[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZY0NAAAAIAAJ|title=History and Antiquities of Boston|author=Pishey Thompson|year=1856|publisher=Longman|accessdate=14 April 2011[/tpl] and Boston had two Members of Parliament from 1552, but with the Haven silted, the town was then  rather living on memories.

===17th and 18th centuries===

The staple trade made Boston a centre of intellectual influence from the Continent, including the teachings of John Calvin that became known as Calvinism.  This, in turn, revolutionised the Christian beliefs and practices of many Bostonians and residents of the neighbouring shires of England.  In 1607 a group of pilgrims from Nottinghamshire led by William Brewster and William Bradford attempted to escape pressure to conform with the teaching of the English church by going to the Netherlands from Boston. At that time unsanctioned emigration was illegal, and they were brought before the court in the Guildhall. Most of the pilgrims were released fairly soon and the following year, set sail for the Netherlands, settling in Leiden. In 1620, several of these were among the group who moved to New England in the Mayflower.
Boston remained a hotbed of religious dissent. In 1612 John Cotton became the Vicar of St Botolph's and, although viewed askance by the Church of England for his non-conformist preaching, became responsible for a large increase in Church attendance. He encouraged those who disliked the lack of religious freedom in England to join the Massachusetts Bay Company, and later helped to found the city of Boston, Massachusetts (1630) which he was instrumental in naming. Unable to tolerate the religious situation any longer he eventually emigrated himself in 1633.
At the same time, work on draining the fens to the west of Boston was begun, a scheme which displeased many whose livelihoods were at risk. (One of the sources of livelihood obtained from the fen was fowling, supplying ducks and geese for meat and in addition the processing of their feathers and down for use in mattresses and pillows. The feathery aspect of this is still reflected in the presence of the bedding company named Fogarty, located nearby in Fishtoft.) This and the religious friction put Boston into the parliamentarian camp in the Civil War which in England began in 1642. The chief backer of the drainage locally, Lord Lindsey, was shot in the first battle and the fens returned to their accustomed dampness until after 1750.
The later eighteenth century saw a revival when the Fens began to be effectively drained. The Act of Parliament permitting the embanking and straightening of the fenland Witham was dated 1762. A sluice, called for in the Act, was designed to help scour out The Haven. The land proved to be fertile, and Boston began exporting cereals to London. In 1774 the first financial bank was opened, and in 1776 an Act of Parliament allowed watchmen to begin patrolling the streets at night.

===Modern history===

In the nineteenth century, the names of Howden, a firm located near the Grand Sluice and Tuxford, near the Maud Foster Sluice, were respected among engineers for their steam road locomotives, threshing engines and the like. Howden developed his business from making steam engines for river boats while Tuxford began as a miller and millwright. His mill was once prominent near Skirbeck Church, just to the east of the Maud Foster Drain.
The railway reached the town in 1848 and briefly, it was on the main line from London to the North. The area between the Black Sluice and the railway station was mainly railway yard and the railway company's main depôt. The latter facility moved to Doncaster when the modern main line was opened. Boston remained something of a local railway hub well into the twentieth century, moving the produce of the district and the trade of the dock, plus the excursion trade to Skegness and similar places. But it was much quieter by the time of the Beeching cuts of the 1960s.
Boston once again became a significant port in trade and fishing when, in 1884, the new dock with its associated wharves on The Haven were constructed. It continued as a working port, exporting grain, fertilizer, and importing timber although much of the fishing trade was moved out in the inter-war period. During the First World War many of the town's trawlermen, together with those from Grimsby,  were taken prisoner after their ships were sunk by German raiders in the North Sea. Their families did not know what had happened to them till late September 1914. The men were taken to Sennelager camp then on to Ruhleben POW camp where most remained till repatriated in 1918. There is a full report of their homecoming in the Lincolnshire Standard newspaper, January 1918.
The first cinema opened in 1910, and the town was used by film makers during the Second World War to represent the Netherlands when the real thing was not available for filming. In 1913 a new Town Bridge was constructed. Central Park was purchased in 1919, and is now one of the focal points of the town. Electricity came to Boston during the early part of the century, and electrical street lighting was provided from 1924.
The Haven Bridge, which now carries the two trunk roads over the river, was opened in 1966, and the new road built in the early 1970s rather separated Skirbeck from Boston; but the town largely avoided the development boom of the 1960s. A shopping centre, named the Pescod Centre, opened in 2004, bringing many new shops into the town. Further development is planned as of 2012.
The town experienced a decline in the early years of the 21st century, both economically and in terms of its reputation. Exacerbated by the decline of farming, the town's traditional role as a service centre for the surrounding agricultural region was eroded. Many retail businesses in the town struggled in this period, and several closed.
There had been widespread disillusionment with what was perceived as the somewhat apathetic and incompetent running of the local council. In the Local Elections of 2007 this contributed to the overwhelming victory of a small bypass pressure group, over the traditional political parties.  Describing their victory, the new council leader Richard Austin said: "We knew that the mood of the people of Boston was very black and they really do want something to happen to Boston that isn't happening at the moment. "It's only a reflection of this black mood of the people of Boston."[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/6603565.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bypass group wins race for Boston | date=4 May 2007 | accessdate=1 April 2010[/tpl]
The town's economic decline around this time and subsequently was felt more sharply because of a spate of bad news which tarnished the reputation of Boston. Boston United football club was demoted following on from several years of debt and fraud. In a 2006 survey the people of Boston were labelled as being the fattest in the country. Another report, cited in "The Sun" in 2008, highlighted the fact that Boston has the highest number of immigrants per capita of any town in Britain (an estimated 1/4 of the population are immigrants).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1082248.ece | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Oliver | last=Harvey | title=Welcome to Boston Europe | date=24 April 2008[/tpl]
Most immigrants have come from East Europe and Portugal. This has led to some social tension, which came to a head during the 2004 European Football Championship, when something akin to rioting[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/3810213.stm |title=England | Lincolnshire | Three charged after Boston 'riot' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2004 |accessdate=15 March 2009[/tpl] occurred briefly with windows being smashed and shops looted, police cars overturned and set alight. Trouble once again erupted in the town, when England were knocked out of the 2006 world cup by Portugal, and there were clashes between riot police and fans from England and Portugal. Some pubs and bars in the area were vandalised with windows being smashed and tables, chairs and glasses being thrown at rival fans, riot police and shops and bars. The local Portuguese bar called 'The Volunteer', since closed down, was attacked by native youths, who threw missiles, smashed windows and were in possession of petrol bombs. The youths surrounded the bar and trapped the Portuguese supporters inside. Riot police broke the situation up soon after.
However, as a sea port and holder of trade fairs, the town was long accustomed to seamen from the Baltic, Hansa merchants and so on. After the surrounding land was drained, there were influxes of seasonal labourers from other parts of England, from Ireland or other parts of Europe. People occasionally became excited then too – the Hansa merchants finally left after one had been in a fight. But the fights are noticed because of their rarity.

==Transport==

===Railway===

Boston railway station is served by East Midland Trains on the Poacher Line from Grantham to Skegness. It was the southern terminus of the East Lincolnshire Line to Louth and Grimsby until closure in 1970.

==Politics==

===Boston bypass===

In May 2007 a single-issue political party, the Independent Bypass Group, campaigning for a bypass to be built around Boston, Lincolnshire, took control of Boston Borough Council, removing the Labour Party majority.[ref]
</ref>

==Governance==

Boston received its charter in 1545. It is the main settlement in the Boston local government district of Lincolnshire which includes the unparished town of Boston and eighteen other civil parishes.

===Electoral wards===

In the local elections of 2007, many local councillors from the major parties were displaced by independent candidates whose main issue as a group is the construction of a road bypass which they believe is being deliberately denied by the Lincoln-centric members of the Lincolnshire County Council. However in 2011, the Conservative party took control with a majority,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3819|title=How the council works|date=25 February 2013|work=Boston Borough Council|accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl] effectively removing the previous administration.
Nationally Boston is in the East Midlands European Parliament constituency, which elects six members. At the national level, the town is part of the Boston and Skegness parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Conservative Mark Simmonds. The town was previously represented in parliament for 35 years by Conservative Sir Richard Body.

==Demography==

===Population===

According to the 2001 census, there were 35,124 people residing in Boston town, of whom 48.2% were male and 51.8% were female. Children under five accounted for approximately 5% of the population. 23% of the resident population in Boston were of retirement age. In the 2011 census the Borough of Boston had a population of 64,600, mainly due to the growth of the Polish community.
According to a Department of Health report, the population of Boston had the highest rate of obesity in England, with almost one in three residents clinically obese.Rich pickings for labourers of Europe, Daily Telegraph, 23 October 2007

===Religion===

80% of the population are Christians, the next highest religious minority were Muslims making up 0.4%.

==Landmarks==

Some of the most interesting things to be seen in Boston lie not in the usual list of tourist features, but in the area of civil engineering. However, there are remarkable sights of the more usual sort:
The parish church of Saint Botolph is known locally as The Stump and is renowned for its lantern interior and 52 misericords.left|thumb|The Stump, viewed from the Market Place. The statue of Herbert Ingram is in the left foreground.
The Grand Sluice is disguised by  railway and road bridges, but it is there, keeping the tide out of the Fens and twice a day, allowing the water from the upland to scour the Haven. Not far away, in the opposite direction, was the boyhood home of John Foxe, the author of Foxe's Book of Martyrs.
The Town Bridge maintains the line of the road to Lindsey and from its western end, looking at the river side of the Exchange Building to the right, it is possible to see how the two ends of the building, founded on the natural levees of The Haven, have stood firm while the middle has sunk into the infill of the former river.
From 1552, the Bostonians used to have their jail near The Stump (about where the red car in the photograph is located). This is likely to be where the Scrooby Pilgrims were imprisoned in 1607. The lawyers' quarter is still in use, just to the north of the church.
A statue of the founder of The Illustrated London News, Herbert Ingram is now located in front of The Stump (see photograph).  The statue was designed by Alexander Munro and was unveiled in October 1862.  The allegorical figure, at the base of the monument, is a reference to Ingram's efforts to bring the first piped water to the town.  He was also instrumental in bringing the railways to Boston.  Born in nearby Paddock Grove, son of a butcher,The Oxford Book of National Biography – September 2004, quoted on The Early History of The Illustrated London News he was also MP for Boston, from 1856, until his death in 1860, in a shipping accident on Lake Michigan.
The market, held on Saturdays and Wednesdays, in the Market Place and also on Wide Bargate on Wednesday. Market Place and Strait Bargate are the retail hub of the town centre.  Coincidentally, No.1 Market Place and No.1 Strait Bargate are the same building, F. Hinds jewellers.
thumb|right|150px|Maud Foster Mill The seven-storeyed Maud Foster Tower Windmill, completed in 1819, by millwrights Norman & Smithson of Kingston upon Hull for Issac and Thomas Reckitt, is currently the tallest operating windmill in England (80 ft/24.4 metres to the top of the cap), following extensive restoration during the 1980s and early 1990s and is now a working museum. The tall mill, without the usual tar coating in Lincs, stands on the dyke above the drain it is named after and is unusual in having an odd number (five) of sails.
The Boston Guildhall in which the Pilgrim Fathers were tried, on the first floor, by the magistrates, was converted into a museum in 1929. The American Room was opened by the U.S. Ambassador, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., in 1938. The cells in which the pilgrims are said to have been held at the time of their trial are on the ground floor. In 2005 it is closed for repair and refurbishment. – The Pilgrim Fathers Memorial is located on the north bank of The Haven a few miles outside the town. It was here at Scotia Creek, that the pilgrims made their first attempt to leave for the Dutch Republic in 1607.
The ruined Hussey Tower is all that remains of a medieval brick fortified house.[tpl]cite web |title=Hussey Tower |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-486443-hussey-tower-boston |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=8 March 2011[/tpl]  Two miles east, Rochford Tower is another medieval tower house.[tpl]cite web |title=Rochford Tower |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=353869 |publisher=Pastscape |accessdate=14 June 2011[/tpl]
In Skirbeck Quarter, on the right bank of The Haven, is the Black Sluice, the outfall of the South Forty-Foot Drain.
The Prime Meridian passes through the eastern side of Boston, marked by the fairly modern, suburban Meridian Road ([tpl]mmukpc|PE21|0NB[/tpl]), which straddles the line the road was named after.
The oldest landmark is the Boston May Fair which has been held in the town every year since at least 1125. This fair is held during the first week of May, and is one of the largest outdoor fairs in the country. By tradition, the fair was officially opened by the incumbent mayor at 11 am on the May Day bank holiday. However this is now not the case.
The Haven Gallery, opened in 2005, was closed to the public in 2010 in a costcutting measure by Boston Borough Council.
Frampton Marsh and Freiston Shore are two nature reserves, managed by the RSPB, which lie on The Wash coast on either side of the mouth of The Haven.

==In popular culture==

==Local economy==

There is a Tesco on New Hammond Beck Road, near Swineshead Road (A52) to the west of the town. There is an Asda on Lister Way[tpl]cite web |url=http://storelocator.asda.com/store/boston |title=Asda Boston |deadurl=no |accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl] close to the railway station. There are Co-ops on Argyle Street (A1137), on West Street and on Eastwood Road, heading east out of the town. Wetherspoons have a pub, the Moon Under Water, close to the bridge over the river on the High Street. Bingo is played at The Gliderdrome Bingo Hall, Boston's original bingo. The Gliderdrome was famous in the 1960s for attracting top Motown acts as well as various other artists including, in the 1970s, Elton John and Marc Bolan & T.Rex and in the early 1980s "Yam Hologram". It is one of the very few English venues at which soul legend Otis Redding has performed. Up until 2009, the Gliderdrome still held various dances in "The Starlight Room", usually during the Christmas period. Marc Bolan & T.Rex recorded a live album at the Gliderdrome named 'Live at the Boston Gliderdrome' in 1972 which was released on CD in 2001.
Within the centre of Boston there are plenty of National retailers these include a large Marks and spencer's, Boots, Clarks, Waterstone's, Ryman's, TKmaxx, Sports Direct, Tresspass, New look, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Officers club, Wilkinson's, all the major phone brands, Bright house, Dunelm Mill and much more. As is the current situation in all towns across the UK there are plenty of discount stores across the Centre of town. these include, Poundland, Home Bargains, Pound stretcher, QD and B and M Bargains. There is also a large Range Superstore off London Road as you enter the town from Spalding and King's Lynn.
Boston has one Department store, Oldrid's were established in the town in 1804 and continue to be the main draw for shoppers to the town today. although the Oldrid's of today is heavily franchised out (QUIZ, Wallis, Phase 8, White Stuff, Moda, Thornton's to name a few) it provides the people of Boston with that little something extra at an affordable price. the store is set out over 3 floors the ground floor has home wares, perfumes, cards and cutlery, the first floor has women's wear, children's wear and Shoes and the second floor has men's wear, Toys, Sports wear, The coop travel, the restaurant, hairdressers and toilets. Oldrid's Downtown located out of town Near Maplins and Homebase sells larger white goods and furniture as well as some of the items sold in town.
Because of the recession several national chains have closed outlets in Boston Be this because of administration, whole company liquidation or companies pruning back there number of outlets. These Names include, HMV, Burtons, Clinton Cards, Millets, JJB sport, Julian Graves, Adams, Thornton's, Past times, Subway, Comet and Dreams. However there is good news as  Thornton's opened a franchise in Boston's Oldrid's Department store and  Clintons are due to open a smaller outlet in January 2014 in the former JJB sports store. Boston also has one of the lowest Shop vacancy rates in Lincolnshire.
The towns main Crown post office is also Due to close in February 2014 and be relocated into the Towns Branch of W.H. Smiths. This decision was met with anger from the people of Boston who signed petitions and attended a public consultation in a good turnout. However this it seems is a done deal much to the distaste of the majority of people in Boston. This move will leave one of Boston's most iconic buildings empty hopefully not for long though.
In 2004 a new Shopping precinct opened in the town Centre. Pescod square (Named after Pescod Hall which is the centrepiece of the precinct and was moved as a whole building in 2003) brought several multi national chains to the town. these included Next, Costa coffee, Peacocks, The Works, Julian Greaves, HMV and Game station. The square won the Gold award by the British Council of Shopping centres.
A new shopping park opened in January 2007 on Horncastle Road. This new development has brought several large companies to the town for the first time. These include T.K. Maxx, Bathstore, Netto, SportsDirect.com and Gala Bingo. Dynamic Cassette International (Jet Tec) is one of the biggest manufacturing employers in the town.
Following the buy out of the Netto company by Asda (WalMart company) in 2011, the Netto store in the Boston shopping park became a small Morrisons outlet.
Work is due to commence in 2014 on a new marina of the river Witham which will offer moorings, a restaurant and other facilities. The town is also set to be a major part of the Fens waterway project which will be an equivalent of the Norfolk Broads. This is scheduled to be completed in 2018 and may bring new business to the town.
In late 2013, a £100 million development was announced for the outskirts of town on the A16 towards Kirton. this development Named the Quadrant is split in two phases. Phase one consists of a new Football ground for Boston United, 500 new homes, retail and business outlets and a possible supermarket. This development also includes the beginning of the much needed relief road or 'bypass' for Boston and would eventually link the A52 Grantham Road and the A16 together making traffic flow easier. When constructed the Quadrant will be the biggest development in Boston since Pescod Square in 2003. Phase two consists of a possible second new marina, More new homes and retail units. However this phase is in the development phase so is subject to change.
