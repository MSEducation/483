[[Efficient-market hypothesis]]

CATEGORIES: 1900 introductions, Behavioral finance, Economic efficiency, Economic theories, Financial economics, Financial markets

In finance, the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), or the joint hypothesis problem, asserts that financial markets are "informationally efficient". In consequence of this, one cannot consistently achieve returns in excess of average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis, given the information available at the time the investment is made.
There are three major versions of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong". The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information. The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly  available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even  hidden or "insider" information.
Critics have blamed the belief in rational markets for much of the late-2000s financial crisis.[tpl]cite book | title=Myth of the Rational Market | last=Fox | first=Justin | year=2009 | publisher=Harper Business | isbn=0-06-059899-9[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/business/06nocera.html?scp=1&sq=efficient%20market&st=cse|title=Poking Holes in a Theory on Markets|work=New York Times |accessdate=8 June 2009 |date=5 June 2009 | first=Joe | last=Nocera[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Roger |last=Lowenstein |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060502053.html |title=Book Review: 'The Myth of the Rational Market' by Justin Fox |work=Washington Post |accessdate=5 August 2011 |date=7 June 2009[/tpl]  In response, proponents of the hypothesis have stated that market efficiency does not mean having no uncertainty about the future, that market efficiency is a simplification of the world which may not always hold true, and that the market is practically efficient for investment purposes for most individuals.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.indexingblog.com/2011/03/27/efficient-market-hypothesis/ |title=Efficient Market Hypothesis |accessdate=2 June 2011 |date=27 March 2011 | first=Sameer |last=Desai [/tpl]

==Historical background==

Historically, there was a very close link between EMH and the random walk hypothesis and then the Martingale model. The random character of stock market prices was first modelled by Jules Regnault, a French broker, in 1863 and then by Louis Bachelier, a French mathematician, in his 1900 PhD thesis, "The Theory of Speculation".Kirman, Alan. "Economic theory and the crisis." Voxeu. 14 November 2009. http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4208 His work was largely ignored until the 1950s; however, beginning in the 1930s scattered, independent work corroborated his thesis. A small number of studies indicated that US stock prices and related financial series followed a random walk model.See Working (1934), Cowles and Jones (1937), and Kendall (1953), and later Brealey, Dryden and Cunningham. Research by Alfred Cowles in the ’30s and ’40s suggested that professional investors were in general unable to outperform the market.
The efficient-market hypothesis was developed by Professor Eugene Fama at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business as an academic concept of study through his published Ph.D. thesis in the early 1960s at the same school. It was widely accepted up until the 1990s, when behavioral finance economists, who had been a fringe element, became mainstream.Fox J. (2002). Is The Market Rational? No, say the experts. But neither are you—so don't go thinking you can outsmart it. Fortune. Empirical analyses have consistently found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis, the most consistent being that stocks with low price to earnings (and similarly, low price to cash-flow or book value) outperform other stocks. Alternative theories have proposed that cognitive biases cause these inefficiencies, leading investors to purchase overpriced growth stocks rather than value stocks. Although the efficient-market hypothesis has become controversial because substantial and lasting inefficiencies are observed, Beechey et al. (2000) consider that it remains a worthwhile starting point.Beechey M, Gruen D, Vickrey J. (2000). The Efficient Markets Hypothesis: A Survey. Reserve Bank of Australia.
The efficient-market hypothesis emerged as a prominent theory in the mid-1960s. Paul Samuelson had begun to circulate Bachelier's work among economists. In 1964 Bachelier's dissertation along with the empirical studies mentioned above were published in an anthology edited by Paul Cootner.[tpl]cite book| last = Cootner (ed.)| first = Paul| title = The Random Character of StockMarket Prices| publisher = MIT Press| year = 1964[/tpl] In 1965, Eugene Fama published his dissertation arguing for the random walk hypothesis,[tpl]cite journal | last = Fama | first = Eugene | title = The Behavior of Stock Market Prices | journal = Journal of Business | volume = 38 | pages =34–105 | year = 1965 | doi=10.1086/294743[/tpl] and Samuelson published a proof for a version of the efficient-market hypothesis. In 1970, Fama published a review of both the theory and the evidence for the hypothesis. The paper extended and refined the theory, included the definitions for three forms of financial market efficiency: weak, semi-strong and strong (see below).[tpl]cite journal | last = Fama | first = Eugene | title = Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = 25| pages = 383–417| year = 1970 | doi = 10.2307/2325486 | jstor = 2325486 | issue = 2[/tpl]
It has been argued that the stock market is “micro efficient” but not “macro efficient”. The main proponent of this view was Samuelson, who asserted that the EMH is much better suited for individual stocks than it is for the aggregate stock market. Research based on regression and scatter diagrams has strongly supported Samuelson's dictum.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jung, Jeeman; Shiller, Robert | title = Samuelson's Dictum And The Stock Market | journal = Economic Inquiry | volume = 43 | pages = 221–228| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1093/ei/cbi015 | issue = 2[/tpl]
Further to this evidence that the UK stock market is weak-form efficient, other studies of capital markets have pointed toward their being semi-strong-form efficient.  A study by Khan of the grain futures market indicated semi-strong form efficiency following the release of large trader position information (Khan, 1986). Studies by Firth (1976, 1979, and 1980) in the United Kingdom have compared the share prices existing after a takeover announcement with the bid offer.  Firth found that the share prices were fully and instantaneously adjusted to their correct levels, thus concluding that the UK stock market was semi-strong-form efficient.  However, the market's ability to efficiently respond to a short term, widely publicized event such as a takeover announcement does not necessarily prove market efficiency related to other more long term, amorphous factors. David Dreman has criticized the evidence provided by this instant "efficient" response, pointing out that an immediate response is not necessarily efficient, and that the long-term performance of the stock in response to certain movements are better indications.

==Theoretical background==

Beyond the normal utility maximizing agents, the efficient-market hypothesis requires that agents have rational expectations; that on average the population is correct (even if no one person is) and whenever new relevant information appears, the agents update their expectations appropriately. Note that it is not required that the agents be rational. EMH allows that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact. All that is required by the EMH is that investors' reactions be random and follow a normal distribution pattern so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit, especially when considering transaction costs (including commissions and spreads). Thus, any one person can be wrong about the market—indeed, everyone can be—but the market as a whole is always right. There are three common forms in which the efficient-market hypothesis is commonly stated—weak-form efficiency,
semi-strong-form efficiency and strong-form efficiency, each of which has different implications for how markets work.

===Weak-form efficiency===

In weak-form efficiency, future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing prices from the past. Excess returns cannot be earned in the long run by using investment strategies based on historical share prices or other historical data. Technical analysis techniques will not be able to consistently produce excess returns, though some forms of fundamental analysis may still provide excess returns. Share prices exhibit no serial dependencies, meaning that there are no "patterns" to asset prices. This implies that future price movements are determined entirely by information not contained in the price series. Hence, prices must follow a random walk. This 'soft' EMH does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to systematically profit from market 'inefficiencies'. However, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock markets to trend over time periods of weeks or longer[tpl]cite journal | author = Saad, Emad W., Student Member, IEEE; Prokhorov, Danil V.

studied (but note that over long time periods, the trending is sinusoidal in appearance).[tpl]cite journal | author = Granger, Clive W.

The problem of algorithmically constructing prices which reflect all available information has been studied extensively in the field of computer science.[tpl]cite book | year = 2005 | author = Kleinberg, Jon; Tardos, Eva | title = Algorithm Design | publisher = Addison Wesley | isbn = 0-321-29535-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | author = Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, Vazirani | title = Algorithmic Game Theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-87282-0[/tpl]  For example, the complexity of finding the arbitrage opportunities in pair betting markets has been shown to be NP-hard.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chen, Y; Fortnow, L; Nikolova, E; Pennock, D | title = Betting on permutations | journal = Proceedings of the 8th ACM conference on Electronic commerce | volume = 8 | pages = 326–335   | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-59593-653-0 | doi=10.1145/1250910.1250957[/tpl]

===Semi-strong-form efficiency===

In semi-strong-form efficiency, it is implied that share prices adjust to publicly available new information very rapidly and in an unbiased fashion, such that no excess returns can be earned by trading on that information. Semi-strong-form efficiency implies that neither fundamental analysis nor technical analysis techniques will be able to reliably produce excess returns. To test for semi-strong-form efficiency, the adjustments to previously unknown news must be of a reasonable size and must be instantaneous.  To test for this, consistent upward or downward adjustments after the initial change must be looked for.  If there are any such adjustments it would suggest that investors had interpreted the information in a biased fashion and hence in an inefficient manner.

===Strong-form efficiency===

In strong-form efficiency, share prices reflect all information, public and private, and no one can earn excess returns. If there are legal barriers to private information becoming public, as with insider trading laws, strong-form efficiency is impossible, except in the case where the laws are universally ignored. To test for strong-form efficiency, a market needs to exist where investors cannot consistently earn excess returns over a long period of time.  Even if some money managers are consistently observed to beat the market, no refutation even of strong-form efficiency follows: with hundreds of thousands of fund managers worldwide, even a normal distribution of returns (as efficiency predicts) should be expected to produce a few dozen "star" performers.
