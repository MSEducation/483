==History==

According to Coffey, when he was a child, he would tell his parents when the phone was about to ring and who was calling; referring to his ability to read the past, present and future as a "God given talent"[tpl]cite web | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10696635DFD8ADE1&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title = 'God-given talent' is channeled in mysterious ways | accessdate = 2012-12-13 | date = 25 Nov 2004 | work = Atlanta Journal-Constitution[/tpl]  Coffey said that when he reached adulthood, he began to see full-body apparitions.  He also defines what he feels is the difference between a ghost and a spirit is that "the latter has completed the journey between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Ghosts, on the other hand, are souls that, for whatever reason, have chosen to stick around. They may not know they're dead, or they may fear judgment on the other side."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/rare-medium-93182394.html | title = Rare Medium Psychic Chip Coffey can communicate with the dead, but he has a degree of skepticism about paranormal activity | accessdate = 2012-12-13 | last = Vesely | first = Carolin | date = 8 May 2010 | work = Winnipeg Free Press[/tpl]
