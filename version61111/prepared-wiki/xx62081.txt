Reroute to Remain (Subtitled: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Insanity & on The Reissue: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Madness) is the sixth studio album by the Swedish heavy metal band In Flames. The album saw a major change in musical style and was In Flames' first considerable step in the direction of mainstream music, and was met with rejection among many of their fanbase. It is sometimes viewed as a transitional album between Clayman and Soundtrack to Your Escape.  The album's more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames' name within the US metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. The album peaked at #13 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Billboard Independent charts|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=in flames|chart=Independent Albums[/tpl]|accessdate=27 May 2013[/tpl]  This was the band's first album to present singles which were "Trigger" and "Cloud Connected".
