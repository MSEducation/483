Political tension continued during the spring of 1945 but the elections held on 5 May 1945, were peaceful and orderly, with approximately 110000 voters participating (women voted in the national election for the first time). These elections showed a heavy vote for liberal elements and a coalition of the Liberal Renewal Party of Francisco Arias Paredes, the Liberal Democratic Party of Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, elements of the Liberal Doctrinaire Party of Domingo Díaz Arosemena, and elements of the National Revolutionary Party (the "official" party of the de la Guardia administration) united and, controlling 30 of the 46 delegates to the Constitutional Assembly, elected Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, former Panamanian Ambassador to Washington, Provisional President of the Republic to hold office during the life of the Constitutional Assembly and until a new President, elected in accordance with the provisions of the new Constitution, would assume office. This election took place on 15 June 1945. Former President de la Guardia retired from public office to become Director and General Manager of the newspaper La Nacion.
