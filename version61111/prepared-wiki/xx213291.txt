==Melodifestivalen 2009==

Melodifestivalen 2009 was a Swedish song contest held between February and March 2009. It was the selection for the 49th song to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest, and was the 48th Melodifestivalen. Five semi-finals were held in the Swedish cities of Gothenburg, Skellefteå, Leksand and Malmö, with Norrköping hosting the final Andra Chansen (Second Chance) round. The final of the contest was contested in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, at the Globe Arena, where 11 songs competed to win the contest and represent Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia.
The 2009 edition of Melodifestivalen implemented a number of new rules which changed the dynamics of the contest, including more people, pre-recorded backing vocals and a new international jury who selected an 11th finalist.

===Final===

The final was held on 14 March at Globen in Stockholm. 11 songs competed, with the winner being decided by a mix of televoting/SMS voting and jury voting. The final winner was Malena Ernman with the pop/opera song "La voix", composed by Ernman and last year's winning composer Fredrik Kempe, and was sung in both English and French. Ernman received top marks from the televoting public, and only came 8th with the juries. Second place went to Caroline af Ugglas with "Snälla snälla", while third place went to boyband E.M.D. with "Baby Goodbye".
