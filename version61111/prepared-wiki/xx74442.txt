[[Bolide]]

CATEGORIES: Meteoroids, Planetary geology

Bolide is a term related to meteors and meteorites. There is no consensus on the definition of a bolide, so there are specific definitions used by several groups and fields.
One definition describes a bolide as a fireball reaching an apparent magnitude of −14 or brighter.[ref]
:156</ref> Another definition describes a bolide as any generic large crater-forming impacting body whose composition (for example, whether it is a rocky or metallic asteroid, or an icy comet) is unknown.<ref name="WoodsHoleUSGS">[tpl]cite web |url= http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/epubs/bolide/introduction.html |title= Introduction: What is a Bolide? |publisher= Woodshole.er.usgs.gov |date= 1 April 1998 |accessdate= 16 September 2011[/tpl]</ref>
The word bolide comes from Greek βολίς bolis, which means missile.[tpl]OED|bolide[/tpl]

==Astronomy==

The IAU has no official definition of bolide, and generally considers the term synonymous with "fireball". However, the term generally applies to fireballs reaching an apparent magnitude −14 or brighter. Astronomers tend to use bolide to identify an exceptionally bright fireball, particularly one that explodes (sometimes called a detonating fireball). It may also be used to mean a fireball that is audible.

==Geology==

Geologists use the term bolide more often than astronomers do;[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] in geology it indicates a very large impactor. For example, the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center of the USGS uses bolide as a generic term that describes any large crater-forming impacting body of which its composition (for example, whether it is a rocky or metallic asteroid, or an icy comet) is unknown.

===Superbolide===

If the apparent magnitude of a bolide reaches −17 or brighter, it is known as a superbolide.[ref]
