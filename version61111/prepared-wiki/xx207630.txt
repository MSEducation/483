The Wherry Yacht Charter Charitable Trust (WYC) is a waterway society and registered charity number 1096073, on the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads in East Anglia, England, UK. The Trust was established in 2002 and aims to restore, protect and sail the three Norfolk trading wherries Hathor, Olive and Norada, and to keep them together as the only fleet of wherries left. 
Hathor was built in 1905 at Reedham, Norfolk for the Colman's Mustard and Boardman families. She was purchased by WYC in 1985, and, after 2 years of restoration work, she was at first used for charter work, but now only for promotional tours, pending an extensive refit.
Norada was built in 1912 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1950. She was bought in 1964 and underwent extensive restoration. Since 1984 she has been working as a charter boat. As of 2008, Norada is out of the water for restoration of the hull.
Olive was built in 1909 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1958. She had four more owners until she was restored by the Trust and used for educational charters. In 2005 she sank at her moorings and is awaiting repair and restoration.
The Trust obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to purchase the wherries, to give the public access to the boats, and to run environmental education programmes.
