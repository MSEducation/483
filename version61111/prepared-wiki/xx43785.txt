Castor oil is the preferred lubricant for bicycle pumps, most likely because it does not dissolve natural rubber seals.[tpl]Cite book|author=Older, Jules |title=Backroad and offroad biking |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year=2000 |page=37 |isbn=0-8117-3150-2 |quote=Here's a good tip: Instead of lubricating your pump with petroleum oil, which will rot the pump's rubber parts, use castor oil, available at your local drugstore[/tpl]

=====Early aviation and aeromodelling=====

Castor oil was the preferred lubricant for radial engines, such as the Gnome engine after that engine's widespread adoption for aviation in Europe in 1909. It was used almost universally by the radial engined Allied aircraft in World War I. Germany had to make do with inferior ersatz oil for its radial engines, which resulted in poor reliability.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The methanol-fuelled two-cycle glow plug engines used for aeromodelling, since their adoption by model airplane hobbyists in 1948, have used varying percentages of castor oil as a dependable lubricant. It is highly resistant to degradation when the engine has its fuel-air mixture leaned for maximum engine speed. Gummy residues can still be a problem for aeromodelling powerplants lubricated with castor oil, however, usually resulting in eventual ball bearing replacement when the residue accumulates within the engine's bearing races.  One British manufacturer of sleeve valved four-cycle model engines has stated the "varnish" created by using castor oil in small percentages can improve the pneumatic seal of the sleeve valve, improving such an engine's performance over time.

====Derivatives====

Castor oil is the raw material for the production of a number of chemicals, notably sebacic acid, undecylenic acid, and nylon-11. A review listing numerous chemicals derived from castor oil is available.Castor oil as a renewable resource for the chemical industry[tpl]Cite journal|last=Ogunniyi |first=D.S.  |date=June 2006 |title=Castor oil: A vital industrial raw material |journal=Bioresource Technology |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=1086–91 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V24-4G7NSTG-3&_user=432163&_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000020718&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=432163&md5=fb81fe7480f87cd089cc1ff182a001fb |doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2005.03.028 |pmid=15919203 [/tpl] The production of lithium grease consumes a significant amount of castor oil. Hydrogenation and saponification of castor oil yields 12-hydroxystearic acid which is then reacted with lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate to give high performance lubricant grease.[tpl]Cite book|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/30116043/Castor-Oil |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Other derivatives are produced first by transesterification of the castor oil to methyl ricinoleate, followed by steam cracking to methyl undecylenate and n-heptaldehyde.Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, page 6162

=====Turkey red oil=====

Turkey red oil, also called sulphonated (or sulfated) castor oil, is made by adding sulfuric acid to vegetable oils, most notably castor oil.Turkey Red Oil – A defoaming & wetting agent  It was the first synthetic detergent after ordinary soap. It is used in formulating lubricants, softeners, and dyeing assistants.CastorOil.in – Home of Castor Oil Online

====Biodiesel====

Castor oil, like currently less expensive vegetable oils, can be used as feedstock in the production of biodiesel. The resulting fuel is superior for cold winters, due to its exceptionally low cloud and pour points.Biodiesel from Castor Oil: A Promising Fuel for Cold Weather (PDF) by Carmen Leonor Barajas Forero, 2004-10-12. Retrieved 2012-01-24.
Initiatives to grow more castor for energy production, in preference to other oil crops, are motivated by social considerations. Tropical subsistence farmers would gain a cash crop.The Promise of the Castor Bean by Elizabeth Johnson, Biodiesel Magazine, 2004-12-01. Retrieved 2012-01-24.

In Fascist Italy under the regime of Benito Mussolini, castor oil was one of the tools of the Blackshirts.[ref]
