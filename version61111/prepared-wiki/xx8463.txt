Nauru ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|audio=en-us-Nauru.ogg|n|ɑː|ˈ|u:|r|uː[/tpl] [tpl]respell|nah|OO|roo[/tpl]), officially the Republic of Nauru and formerly known as Pleasant Island, is an island country in Micronesia in the South Pacific. Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati, [tpl]convert|300|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the east. With 9,378 residents in a [tpl]convert|21|km2[/tpl] area, Nauru is the smallest nation in the South Pacific and 2nd smallest nation by population on the planet, behind only Vatican City.
Settled by Micronesian and Polynesian people, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into trusteeship again. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.
Nauru is a phosphate rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allow easy strip mining operations. It has some phosphate resources which, as of 2011, are not economically viable for extraction.[tpl]cite web|author=Hogan, C Michael|year=2011|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557|title=Phosphate|work=Encyclopedia of Earth|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|accessdate=17 June 2012[/tpl] Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign state in the world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru detention centre.
The president of Nauru is Baron Waqa, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Asian Development Bank and the Pacific Islands Forum. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

==History==

Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian people at least 3,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|author=Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment|year=2003|url=http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110722013720/http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |title=First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|publisher=UNCCD|accessdate=25 June 2012[/tpl] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the 12-pointed star on the country's flag.[tpl]cite journal|last=Whyte|first=Brendan|title=On Cartographic Vexillology|journal=Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization|year=2007|volume=42|issue=3|pages=251–262|doi=10.3138/carto.42.3.251[/tpl] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile ibija fish, acclimatised them to fresh water, and raised them in the Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable source of food.

The British sea captain John Fearn, a whale hunter, became the first Westerner to visit Nauru in 1798, naming it "Pleasant Island".

==Politics==

Nauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government. The president is both head of state and head of government. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years.Matau, Robert (6 June 2013) "President Dabwido gives it another go". Islands Business. The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[tpl]cite journal|last=Levine|first=Stephen|coauthors=Roberts, Nigel S|title=The constitutional structures and electoral systems of Pacific Island States|journal=Commonwealth & Comparative Politics|date=November 2005|volume=43|issue=3|pages=276–295|doi=10.1080/14662040500304866[/tpl] Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Anckar|first=D|coauthors=Anckar, C|title=Democracies without Parties|journal=Comparative Political Studies|year=2000|volume=33|issue=2|pages=225–247|doi=10.1177/0010414000033002003[/tpl]
From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hassell, Graham; Tipu, Feue|date=May 2008|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ComJlLocGov/2008/3.html|title=Local Government in the South Pacific Islands|journal=Commonwealth Journal of Local Governance|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–30[/tpl] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.
Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/nauru/nauru_brief.html|title=Republic of Nauru Country Brief|date=November 2005|accessdate=2 May 2006[/tpl] Bernard Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president, later being re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004. Following a vote of no confidence on 19 December 2007, Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen. Stephen resigned in November 2011, and Freddie Pitcher became President. Sprent Dabwido then filed a motion of no confidence in Pitcher, resulting in him becoming president.[tpl]cite journal|last=Connell|first=John|title=Nauru: The first failed Pacific State?|journal=The Round Table|date=January 2006|volume=95|issue=383|pages=47–63|doi=10.1080/00358530500379205[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15433901|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 June 2012|date=24 October 2011|title=Nauru profile[/tpl] Following parliamentary elections in 2013 Baron Waqa was elected president.
Nauru has a complex legal system. Its Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia.[tpl]cite web|title=Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act (Australia) 1976|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ncaa1976254|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 August 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Dale|first=Gregory|title=Appealing to Whom?

Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm|title=Background Note: Nauru|publisher=State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs|date=September 2005|accessdate=11 May 2006[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Nauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies.

Nauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control. Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries. The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed. Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.
Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (ROC) and China (PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting $130 million from the PRC for this action.[tpl]Cite news|author=Harding, Luke|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/14/nauro-recognises-abkhazia-south-ossetia |title=Tiny Nauru struts world stage by recognising breakaway republics |newspaper=Guardian |date= 14 December 2009|accessdate=22 June 2010[/tpl] In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later.

In 2008, Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru $50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition. On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9 million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54715|title=Nauru expects to earn more from exports after port upgrade with Russian aid|date=15 July 2010|publisher=Radio New Zealand International|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
A significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the MV Tampa, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as the Tampa affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS Manoora and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MarStudies/2002/2.html|author=White, Michael|title=M/V Tampa Incident and Australia's Obligations – August 2001|year=2002|journal=Maritime Studies|accessdate=18 June 2012[/tpl] By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal, remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,[tpl]cite news|author=Gordon, M|date=5 November 2005|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/naurus-last-two-asylum-seekers-feel-the-pain/2005/11/04/1130823401609.html|title=Nauru's last two asylum seekers feel the pain|newspaper=The Age|accessdate=8 May 2006[/tpl] with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007.

==Geography==

Nauru is a [tpl]convert|21|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, [tpl]convert|42|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of the Equator. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[tpl]cite web|page=234|url=http://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Countries/Nauru/11.pdf|author=Thaman, RR; Hassall, DC|publisher=South Pacific Regional Environment Programme|title=Nauru: National Environmental Management Strategy and National Environmental Action Plan[/tpl] A fertile coastal strip [tpl]convert|150|to|300|m|ft[/tpl] wide lies inland from the beach.
Coral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is [tpl]convert|71|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite book|title=Geology and hydrogeology of carbonate islands|year=1997 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-81520-0 |editors=Vacher, H Leonard; Quinn, Terrence M|chapter=24: Geology and Hydrogeology of Nauru Island|author=Jacobson, Gerry; Hill, Peter J; Ghassemi, Fereidoun|page=716[/tpl] The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land surrounding Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree.
Nauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others were Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia). The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to [tpl]convert|15|m|ft[/tpl] high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, and has also affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.[tpl]cite web|author=Republic of Nauru|year=1999|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf|title=Climate Change – Response|work=First National Communication|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl]
There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Rooftop storage tanks collect rainwater, but the islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency. Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February, but does not typically experience cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts.[tpl]cite book|title=Affaire de certaines terres à phosphates à Nauru|year=2003|publisher=International Court of Justice|isbn=978-92-1-070936-1|pages=107–109[/tpl] The temperature on Nauru ranges between [tpl]convert|26|and|35|°C|°F[/tpl] during the day and between [tpl]convert|22|and|34|°C|°F[/tpl] at night.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf|title=Pacific Climate Change Science Program |accessdate=10 June 2012|publisher=Government of Australia[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Economy==

The Nauruan economy peaked in the early 1980s, as it was dependent almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds. There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm|title=Big tasks for a small island|accessdate=10 May 2006[/tpl] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/oceania/ae26ah01.html|accessdate=19 June 2012|title=Nauru turns to dust|newspaper=Asia Times|author=Seneviratne, Kalinga|date=26 May 1999[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] However, because of mismanagement, the Trust's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably, and many never fully recovered.

The value of the Trust is estimated to have shrunk from A$1.3 billion in 1991 to $138 million in 2002. Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent.

In the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/magazine/the-billion-dollar-shack.html | title=The Billion Dollar Shack | accessdate=19 July 2011 | date=10 December 2000 | newspaper=New York Times[/tpl] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 "non-cooperative" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only $25,000 with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[tpl]cite web|publisher=FATF|date=13 October 2005|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/13/36/35497629.pdf |title=Nauru de-listed|accessdate=11 May 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
From 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country.

We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited.

==Demographics==

Nauru had 9,378 residents as of July 2011. The population was previously larger, but in 2006 some 1,500 people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. The official language of Nauru is Nauruan, a distinct Pacific island language, which is spoken by 96 percent of ethnic Nauruans at home. English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce, as Nauruan is not common outside of the country.
The top ethnic groups of Nauru are Nauruan (58%), other Pacific Islander (26%), European (8%), and Chinese (8%). The main religion practised on the island is Christianity (two-thirds Protestant, one-third Roman Catholic). There is also a sizeable Bahá'í population (10%) – the largest proportion of any country in the world[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_bahai.html |title=Adherent.com's Largest Baha'i Communities |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=22 June 2010[/tpl] – and Buddhist (9%) and Muslim (2.2%) populations. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. However, the government has restricted the religious practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[tpl]cite web|publisher=US Department of State|year=2003|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24314.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2003 – Nauru|accessdate=2 May 2005[/tpl]

==Culture==

Nauruans descended from Polynesian and Micronesian seafarers who believed in a female deity, Eijebong, and a spirit land, an island called Buitani. Two of the 12 original tribal groups became extinct in the 20th century.

==Wildlife==

Fauna is sparse on the island due to a combination of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat.NAURU Information on Government, People, History, Economy, Environment, Development There are only about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru Reed Warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Birdlife-Pacific/Important%20Bird%20Area%20Coverage%20by%20Country.htm|accessdate=18 June 2012|author=BirdLife International|title=Important Bird Areas in Nauru|publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme[/tpl] The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkeling.Nauru Ecotourism Tours – Sustainable Tourism & Conservation Laws
