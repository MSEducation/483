==History==

===Origin of name===

The Native Americans who originally inhabited Salem, the Kalapuyans called the area Chemeketa, which means "meeting or resting place" in the Central Kalapuya language (Santiam). The original Kalapuya pronunciation of the word is Chim-i-ki-ti.Johnson, Tony, Language Education Supervisor, CTGR Cultural Resources Division When the Methodist Mission moved to the Chemeketa plain, the new establishment was called Chemeketa, but was more widely known as the Mill because of its situation on Mill Creek. When the Oregon Institute was established, the community was known as the Institute.
When the Institute was dissolved, the trustees decided to lay out a townsite on the Institute lands.  Some possible sources for the name "Salem" include William H. Willson, who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plats for the main part of the city, and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the Biblical word "Shalom", meaning peace.[tpl]cite web | title = How Salem Got its Name | publisher = Salem Public Library, Salem, Oregon | url = http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/salem_name.htm | accessdate = April 2014[/tpl]  The Reverend David Leslie, President of the town's Trustees, also wanted a Biblical name, and suggested using the last five letters of "Jerusalem".  Or, the town may be named after Salem, Massachusetts, where Leslie was educated.  There were many names suggested and even after the change to Salem, some people, such as Asahel Bush (editor of the Oregon Statesman), believed the name should be changed back to Chemeketa.Salem Online.net Salem name  The Vern Miller Civic Center which houses the city offices and library has a public space dedicated as the Peace Plaza in recognition of the names by which the city has been known.

===Native Americans===

It is estimated that the Willamette Valley area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years. The Kalapuya peoples would gather on the plateau east and south of the current downtown area in the winter and establish camps. They fished and harvested in the streams and fields of the area. One staple of life was the camas root and periodically the Kalapuya would set fires that would clear and fertilize the meadows where it grew.Salem History.net In the early 1850s the Kalapuya, along with the other native peoples west of the Cascade Mountains, were removed by the US government through a combination of treaties and force.  Most Kalapuya people were moved to the Grande Ronde Reservation somewhat to the west of Salem, with smaller numbers ending up at Siletz Reservation and other Oregon and Washington reservations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ctsi.nsn.us/chinook-indian-tribe-siletz-heritage/our-history/part-i/ |title=Siletz Indian Tribe History |accessdate=2009-10-14 |publisher=Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians[/tpl]

===Europeans===

The first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in Astoria, Oregon.
The first permanent American settlement in the area was the Jason Lee Methodist mission (1840) located in the area north of Salem known as Wheatland.Salem Online.net Brief history of Salem  In 1842, the missionaries established the Oregon Institute (the forerunner of Willamette University) in the area that was to become the site of Salem. In 1844, the mission was dissolved and the town site established.
In 1851, Salem became the territorial capital after it was moved from Oregon City. The capital was moved briefly to Corvallis in 1855, but was moved back to Salem permanently that same year. Salem incorporated as a city in 1857 and with the coming of statehood in 1859 became the state capital.

===Capitol buildings===

Oregon has had three capitol buildings in Salem. A two-story state house, which had been occupied for only two months, burned to the ground in December 1855. Oregon's second capitol building was completed in 1876 on the site of the original. The revival-style building was based in part on the U.S. Capitol building. The building received its distinctive copper dome in 1893. On April 25, 1935, this building was also destroyed by fire. The third and current Oregon State Capitol was completed on the same site in 1938. It is recognizable by its distinctive pioneer statue atop the capitol dome that is plated with gold-leaf and officially named the Oregon Pioneer.

===State fair and cherry festival===

Agriculture has always been important to Salem and the city has historically recognized and celebrated it in a number of ways. In 1861, Salem was chosen as the permanent site of the Oregon State Fair by the Oregon State Agricultural Association.Heine, Steven Robert The Oregon State Fair Images of America Arcadia Publishing 2007-08-20 Salem is nicknamed the "Cherry City", because of the past importance of the local cherry-growing industry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/cherries.htm |title=The Cherry City |accessdate=2007-08-05 |author=Lucas,Bill [/tpl]   The first cherry festival in Salem was held in 1903 and was an annual event, with parades and the election of a cherry queen, until sometime after World War I. The event was briefly revived as the Salem Cherryland Festival for several years in the late 1940s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/culture/cherry_festival.htm |title=Salem's Cherry Festival |accessdate=2007-08-05 |author=Hermann, Shirley [/tpl]

Salem is located in the north-central Willamette Valley, in Marion and Polk counties. The 45th Parallel (the halfway point between the North Pole and the Equator) passes through Salem's city limits.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|48.45|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|47.90|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.55|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl]
Although the Willamette River flows through Salem, the North Santiam River watershed is Salem's primary drinking water source. Other important streams that pass through Salem are Mill Creek, the Mill Race, Pringle Creek, and Shelton Ditch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/salems_creeks.htm |title=The Creeks of Salem |publisher=Salem Online History |accessdate=2008-01-31[/tpl] Smaller streams in eastern part of the city include Clark Creek, Jory Creek, Battle Creek, Croisan Creek, and Claggett Creek, while Glen Creek and Brush Creek flow through West Salem.
Elevation within the city limits ranges about [tpl]convert|120|to|800|ft|m[/tpl]. Salem contains the volcanic Salem Hills in the south and is sandwiched by the [tpl]convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Eola Hills directly to the West and the [tpl]convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Waldo Hills to the east.
