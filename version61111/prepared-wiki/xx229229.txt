==Government==

The purpose of village development committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.scspeb.sdnpk.org/village_development_committee.htm|title=Village Development Committee|magazine=Society for Community Support for Primary Education in Balochistan|accessdate=2008-11-25 [/tpl].
