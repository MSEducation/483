==History==

WHCJ was established in 1975 as a non-commercial, educational public radio facility under the auspices of Savannah State. 

==Format and playlist==

The station’s primary mission is to educate the listening audience through selective programming and to promote and enhance the image of Savannah State University. The goal of WHCJ, like other public radio stations is to present quality alternative programming that is not available on other outlets. Known as "the Voice of Savannah State University" the station plays jazz, reggae, gospel, blues, salsa, hip hop, and alternative soul music.  Additionally the station broadcasts a lineup of talk shows, commentary, cultural enrichment and African-American educational programs.
As a public radio station located on the campus of an historically Black university, WHCJ has become the principal source of cultural programming for Savannah’s African-American community, but the station's audience is considerable and diverse; not limited to any one ethnic group.
WHCJ also provides a professional environment for SSU students who wish to receive hands on experience and practical training in various aspects of broadcast production. The experience of working at WHCJ, along with a traditional classroom education, makes our students better prepared to enter the job market.
