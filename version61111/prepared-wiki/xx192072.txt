[[Find It in You]]

CATEGORIES: 2007 albums, This Condition albums

Find It in You is the name of This Condition's first demos, recorded in 2007.
The band's first effort has been recognized to be a "catchy-as-hell debut", featuring and overpoweringly optimistic message in its lyrics.  Frontman Nate Cyphert's chops have been lauded by most of the reviews; in particular, James Viscardi of pop.is.dead:
"Lead singer Nate Cyphert has the makings to be a quintessential front man ala Freddie Mercury. This is fresh, original, inspirational and fun! You canâ€™t go wrong with ingredients like that. Find It in You is full of infectious melodies and singalongable lyrics."
