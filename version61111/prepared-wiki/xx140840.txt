The Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres (in Haitian Creole Batay Ravin Koulèv, sometimes in English Battle of Snake Gully) was a major battle of the Haitian Revolution. A French division under General Donatien de Rochambeau was advancing down a ravine (the Ravine-à-Couleuvres), towards the city of Lacroix, Haiti. The leader of the Haitian revolutionary forces, Toussaint Louverture, temporarily stopped his advance toward the city of Gonaïves after a bloody struggle, which was a short distance from Lacroix. That gave the commander of Gonaïves, general Vernet[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl], time to burn and evacuate the city with his troops.
