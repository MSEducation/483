[[Amasai]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people

There were four biblical characters called Amasai ([tpl]lang-he|עֲמָ‏שַׂ‏י[/tpl] "burdensome", [tpl]IPA-he|ˈamasai|pron[/tpl]).
The name is rarely used in modern Hebrew. Its only known contemporary appearance is in the first name of the poet and translator Amasai Levin. It is used less rarely as a Hebrew family name.
