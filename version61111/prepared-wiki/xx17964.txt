==History==

With rich and varied wildlife, the area has long been a favoured hunting ground of the Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib Dene) people. The North West Company established a trading post there in 1793, and many natives began settling there permanently, while they continued to hunt and fish in the area. With the establishment of a trading post at Fort Rae on Great Slave Lake in the late 19th century, most regional trading was accomplished at the HBC and free traders posts there. A trading post at Lac La Martre was not again established until the 1920s. Free Traders in Northland Start Again, The Edmonton Bulletin, May 6, 1922
