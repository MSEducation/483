Swass is the debut album by Sir Mix-a-Lot. It was released in 1988 on NastyMix and re-released on CD by Def American Recordings.

According to Sir Mix-a-Lot, the word "swass" originally was an inside joke with no meaning in itself.  After the album's release, the word came to mean "Some Wild Ass Silly Shit".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/06/22/qa-with-sir-mix-a-lot/|title=Q&A with Sir Mix-a-Lot|work=Magnet|last=duBrowa|first=Corey|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl]
