In linguistics, syntax (from Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|σύνταξις[/tpl] "coordination" from [tpl]lang|grc|σύν[/tpl] syn, "together," and [tpl]lang|grc|τάξις[/tpl] táxis, "an ordering") is "the study of the principles and processes by which sentences are constructed in particular languages."[tpl]cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title=Syntactic Structures |page=11[/tpl]
In addition to referring to the discipline, the term syntax is also used to refer directly to the rules and principles that govern the sentence structure of any individual language. Modern research in syntax attempts to describe languages in terms of such rules. Many professionals in this discipline attempt to find general rules that apply to all natural languages.
The term syntax is also used to refer to the rules governing the behavior of mathematical systems, such as formal languages used in logic. (See logical syntax.)

==Early history==

Works on grammar were written long before modern syntax came about; the Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.[tpl]cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=1405188960 |isbn= 978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=Aṣṭādhyāyī is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar…it remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.[/tpl] In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of Dionysius Thrax.
For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as [tpl]lang|fr|grammaire générale[/tpl], first expounded in 1660 by Antoine Arnauld in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought. (That natural way, coincidentally, was exactly the way it was expressed in French.)
However, in the 19th century, with the development of historical-comparative linguistics, linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore logic could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.
The Port-Royal grammar modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the Port-Royal Logic were copied or adapted from the Grammaire générale.[tpl]cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-57444 |quote=Nous avons emprunté…ce que nous avons dit…d'un petit Livre…sous le titre de Grammaire générale. |pages=137[/tpl]) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "Subject – Copula – Predicate." Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as Franz Bopp.
The central role of syntax within theoretical linguistics became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001).)[tpl]cite book |last=Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title=200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing[/tpl]

==Modern theories==

There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of Derek Bickerton,See [tpl]cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9[/tpl] and, for more recent advances, [tpl]cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor=Derek Bickerton; Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7[/tpl] sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human mind. Other linguists (e.g. Gerald Gazdar) take a more Platonistic view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract formal system.Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, Interview with Gerald Gazdar. Retrieved 2008-06-04. Yet others (e.g. Joseph Greenberg) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

===Generative grammar===

The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as i-language). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the grammaticality of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by Noam Chomsky. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.
Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:

===Categorial grammar===

Categorial grammar is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the syntactic categories themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g. the phrase structure rule S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the head word itself. So the syntactic category for an intransitive verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a function word requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of transitive verb is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."
Tree-adjoining grammar is a categorial grammar that adds in partial tree structures to the categories.

===Dependency grammar===

Dependency grammar is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:
Lucien Tesnière (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of all phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).

===Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories===

Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon probability theory are known as stochastic grammars. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a neural network or connectionism. Some theories based within this approach are:

===Functionalist grammars===

Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e. its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
