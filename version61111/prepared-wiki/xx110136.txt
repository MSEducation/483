The Beira Railroad Corporation (CCFB) is a railway company formed by a lease from the Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM) to the Indian Rites and Ircon International consortium to operate a railroad that originates from the port of Beira, Mozambique as a terminal.  The [tpl]RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge Beira line is important as it provides port access for landlocked states such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Katanga Province.

==History==

Originally the Beira railroad already established a connection to Salisbury, now Harare, in 1899 and had been a link in the rail system of southern Africa.
Building of The Beira railway started in 1892,http://www.memoriesofrhodesia.com/Memories/Memories/Railways.html during the Portuguese rule of the territory of Mozambique. First, a [tpl]RailGauge|2ft|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge railway was constructed from Beira to the border city Mutare (Umtali) in Zimbabwe, in total 222 miles http://utahrails.net/articles/central-africa-railroads.php long and opened on 4 Februari 1898.http://www.memoriesofrhodesia.com/Memories/Memories/Railways.html
In 1893 work started in Vryburg, Cape Province, South Africa, to construct a [tpl]RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge railway to the north, later to be connected to the Beira Railway. In 1898 a [tpl]RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge line from Salisbury to Mutare was opened, with subsequent conversion of the connecting [tpl]RailGauge|2ft[/tpl] narrow gauge stretch to Beira in 1900.
In 1905 the railway was completed after opening of the Victoria Falls Bridge at the border of Zambia.
The [tpl]RailGauge|2ft[/tpl] narrow gauge locomotives were later acquired by the South African Railways http://www.sandstone-estates.com/index.php/sandstone-inventory/72-unlisted-railway-inventory/1122-33106falcon1895sandstone to be designated to SAR Class NG6

==Routes==

The Beira railway has two major segments, the Machipanda line to Zimbabwe, and the Sena line to the coal fields of Moatize with further connection to Malawi.

==War damage==

After independence of Mozambique in 1975, both segments suffered during the guerrilla fighting in the 1980s when RENAMO sabotaged the railroad.

==Reconstruction==

Operational activity has been regained on the Machipanda line, and rehabilitation of the Sena line has been completed to Moatize, a town in Central Mozambique, and the first coal train from there to the port of Beira, operated by the Brazilian-based firm Vale, operated in August 2011.
