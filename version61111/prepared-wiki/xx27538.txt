Peter Williston Shor (born August 14, 1959) is an American professor of applied mathematics at MIT, most famous for his work on quantum computation, in particular for devising Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring exponentially faster than the best currently-known algorithm running on a classical computer.

==Education==

While attending Tamalpais High School, in Mill Valley, California, he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad.[ref]Murray Klamkin (Editor).

He earned his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from MIT in 1985.Shor, Peter Williston, "Random Planar Matching and Bin Packing", Ph.D. thesis, MIT, September 1985 His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton, and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.

==Career==

After graduating, he spent one year in a post-doctoral position at the University of California at Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Laboratories. It was there he developed Shor's algorithm, for which he was awarded the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998. Shor always refers to Shor's Algorithm as "the Factoring Algorithm."
Shor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT, he also is affiliated with CSAIL and the Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP).
He received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.
On October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[tpl]cite book|title=Academy Members: 1780-present|year=2011|publisher=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=502|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/news/alphalist2011.pdf|title=2011 Members and Their Affiliations|publisher=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
