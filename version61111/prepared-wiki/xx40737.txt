Cecil Adams is a name, possibly a pseudonym, designating the American author of The Straight Dope, a popular question and answer column published in The Chicago Reader since 1973. The Chicago Reader's 1986 trademark filing for the name "Cecil Adams" states that "Cecil Adams does not identify any particular individual but was devised as a fanciful name."[tpl]cite web |url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4810:wllijm.2.1 |title = Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) |publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate= 30 Aug 2013 [/tpl] Ed Zotti is Adams' current editor.Advance Publication Newsletter;  Volume Seventeen, Number 3 Penguin Group (USA)
The column has since been syndicated in 30 newspapers in the United States and Canada and is available online. Billed as the "World's Smartest Human," Adams responds to often unusual inquiries with abrasive humor (often directed against the questioner), and at times exhaustive research into obscure and arcane issues, urban legends, and the like. On more than one occasion, Adams has been forced to retract or modify an answer when confronted by "the Teeming Millions" (Adams's term for his readers), often claiming overwork and staff shortages. On rare occasions, Adams has made appearances on the Straight Dope's Message Board.
A subsidiary column concerning questions of local interest in Adams's home city of Chicago has been added.

==Published works==

Adams has published five collections of his The Straight Dope columns, and Zotti has published a children's collection in The Straight Dope style entitled Know It All.  Adams' columns are archived at the Straight Dope website. In 1996, the A&E Network briefly aired a show hosted by comedian Mike Lukas based on the column also called The Straight Dope.
Over 600 articles have been posted to the site's online archive; some of these contain multiple questions-and-answers. Also included with the columns are quirky illustrations.  Slug Signorino, in addition to a successful commercial art career, has been the regular illustrator for The Straight Dope for the past twenty years.  In his illustrations, Cecil Adams is often depicted as a large turkey wearing a mortar board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/pages/faq/slug|title=The Slug Signorino FAQ|accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl]
