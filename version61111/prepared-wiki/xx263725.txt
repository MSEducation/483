The Nimoo Bazgo power project is a run-of-the-river power project on the Indus River situated at village Alchi, 70 kilometers from Leh in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The project was conceived on July 1, 2001 and approved on June 8, 2005, and construction began on June 9, 2005. The project involves construction of a 57-metre-high concrete dam with five spillway blocks of 13 m each having ogee profile. The Nimoo Bazgo power project envisages utilizing a rated net head of 34 m to generate 239.30 GWh (million units) in a 90% dependable year. The project has three surface power units of 15 MW each with an total installed capacity of 45 MW. Every unit has a 3.3 m dia, each 63 m long Penstocks. Each operating unit will be designed for a discharge of 48.7 cubic metres per second and also have transformer yard and switch yard. The project will be connected to the northern grid through a 220 kV transmission line from Leh to Srinagar (the line is scheduled for commissioning with project commissioning). The dam diverts water from the river by a 372 m long diversion channel and involves a flooding of only 3.42 km². Thus the power density is 45 MW per 3.42 km², i.e. 13.16 W/m². The project is being developed by M/s National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd. BHEL is doing the ElectroMecahncial works with Mr. Bijaya Kumar Das as the Construction Manager under the able guidance of Sh. Vivek Gupta,Commissioning Expert Hydro,& Mr. N Kumar (GM Hydro) has brilliantly supervises the project & had gifted a great project to the Nation of India.
Unit # 3 of Nimoo Bazgo HEP was spun on 27/09/2012.
Unit# 2 was commissioned on 21/01/2013. All effort is now on Unit#1 to be commissioned by June 2013.
