===Home Recording Rights Coalition===

Shapiro is chairman of the Home Recording Rights Coalition (HRRC).
The HRRC is a nonprofit advocacy organization in the United States whose mission is to protect the right of consumers to view, listen to and record radio and television broadcasts. Founded in 1981 in response to the Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. case, the group more recently has urged the U.S. Congress and Federal Communications Commission to prevent for-profit corporations and their trade organizations (like the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America) from eroding or even destroying the private, in-home "fair use" recording of new digital audio and video technologies.
While Shapiro was at Georgetown, J. Edward Day, the inventor of the ZIP code and a senior partner at Squire, began to mentor Shapiro. He instructed Shapiro to begin monitoring developments in the Sony case. The case was filed to prevent Sony and retailers from making and selling video cassette recorders. Movie studios claimed the exclusive right to copy their works and said Sony was contributing to copyright infringement by allowing consumers to record broadcast television using VCRs. In 1979, a federal district court rejected the movie industry's claims. This decision was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the VCR was an illegal product. Sony and the other defendants then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.[tpl]cite news |title=Shapiro Outlines CEA's Copy Protection View|author=Steve Smith |newspaper=This Week In Consumer Electronics |date=28 October 2002 |accessdate=4 June 2012[/tpl]
The decision by the Ninth Circuit against Sony spurred a group of retailers, consumer groups and manufacturers, such as 3M, General Electric and RCA, to start weekly meetings in order to coordinate their fight against the verdict. These meetings quickly resulted in the creation of the HRRC.
As chairman of the coalition, Shapiro has testified often before Congress and has helped ensure the growth of the video rental market, VCRs, home computers, and audio-recording equipment, including MP3 technology.
