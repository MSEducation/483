Lambda (uppercase [tpl]lang|el|Λ[/tpl], lowercase [tpl]lang|el|λ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Λάμ(β)δα[/tpl] lam(b)da) is the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals lambda has a value of 30. Lambda is related to the Phoenician letter Lamed 15px|Lamedh. Letters in other alphabets that stemmed from lambda include the Latin L and the Cyrillic letter El (Л, л). The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as [tpl]IPA-el|laːbdaː|[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|λάβδα[/tpl]) in Classical Greek times.Herbert Weir Smyth. A Greek Grammar for Colleges. I.1.c In Modern Greek the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced [tpl]IPA-el|lamða|[/tpl]; the spoken letter itself has the sound of [tpl]IPA|l[/tpl] as with Latinate "L".
In early Greek alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied.[tpl]cite web|url=http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/browseGlyphs.shtml |title=Epigraphic Sources for Early Greek Writing |publisher=Poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] Most variants consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at their ends.  The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left ("Western" alphabets), or top ("Eastern" alphabets). Other variants had a vertical line with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. With the general adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the Romans put the angle at the lower-left.
