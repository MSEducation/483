==2007 Mayor Re-election Campaign==

In 2007, Bell was challenged by Republican Thomas Stith, III.newsobserver.com | Local election season cranks up Fridaynewsobserver.com | Durham councilman takes on mayor Thomas Stith attacked Bell over several city issues including violence. During the weekend of October 13 and October 14, two people were murdered in Durham. On October 15, Bell tried to calm the public about the murders, claiming the city was safe and the weekend murders were not random. The next day, Stith went after Bell, pointing out that Durham's murder rate was up nearly 50 percent over the previous year. Stith and Bell continued to argue over how to deal with Durham crime. Stith consistently claimed that he would fight crime more consistently than Bell had, while Bell said that Stith had six years on the town council to do that. Stith said he wanted to see more police officers on the streets, while Bill Bell said the current police officers are well equipped.abc11.com: Recent Durham murders at the center of mayoral race 10/16/07newsobserver.com | Mayor's race locked in on crime
In late October 2007, after lead was found in Durham drinking water, Stith sent out a campaign mailer that said in bold letters: "Bill Bell knew and didn't tell us our water was dangerous to drink." Bell responded to this by saying, "That mailer sent out by Thomas Stith was a complete lie." Bell also said that Stith had no leadership experience.newsobserver.com | Durham mayoral candidates tangle

==Controversy==

It was later revealed that Bell endorsed and donated money to now-disgraced, former district attorney Mike Nifong during his reelection campaign surrounding the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case.http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A165525
Bell also has been accused of being anti-preservation, as his company, UDI, gets many Durham contracts to demolish historic structures.
