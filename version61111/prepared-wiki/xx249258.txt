==Family==

Louise Amelia was the eldest of five children born to Karl, Grand Duke of Baden by his wife Stéphanie de Beauharnais (adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte). Her paternal grandparents were Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden and Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.
Her only two surviving siblings were Josephine, Princess of Hohenzollern (mother of Carol I of Romania and Queen Stephanie of Portugal) and Marie, Duchess of Hamilton.

==Marriage==

On 9 November 1830 in Karlsruhe, Louise Amelie married her first cousin Gustavus in Karlsruhe. He was the only son of the deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden (who had been overthrown in favor of his uncle Charles in 1808), and thus had a titular claim to the Swedish throne. Prince Gustavus took the title Prince of Vasa, making Louise Princess of Vasa upon their marriage. Some still viewed Prince Gustavus as the legitimate heir to the Swedish throne, thus referring to Louise as the Crown Princess[tpl]Who|date=October 2010[/tpl]. Their marriage, like most alliances of the time, was politically arranged and was unhappy. They lived in Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and had two children before they divorced in 1843.
Princess Louise died on 19 July 1854 in Karlsruhe.
