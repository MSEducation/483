==History and influences==

In the 1750s and 1760s, the rich and frivolous Rococo was going out of fashion, and there was a growing desire to return to the simple, yet elegant classicism of architecture in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and to a lesser extent Renaissance architecture. In its purest form it is this new style principally derived from the architecture of Classical Greece and the architecture of Italian Andrea Palladio. Since it was widely based on Classicism, the movement was named Neo-Classicism. Neoclassical did not particularly evolve in any particular nation, but the founders were France, England, Italy, Germany and Spain. Everything from villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes, and buildings were also widely themed on the Villa Capra "La Rotonda", the masterpiece by Andrea Palladio.

==Buildings and edifices==

Before the discoveries of the lost cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, buildings were themed on Ancient Rome and Classical Athens, but were later inspired by these archaeological sites.Cartage.org.lb Examples of Neoclassical architecture in Italy include Luigi Cagnola's Arco della Pace, the San Carlo Theatre (Naples, 1810),Encyclopedia.farlex.com San Francesco di Paolo (Naples, 1817), Pedrocchi Caf√© (Padua, 1816), Canova Temple, (Posagno, 1819), Teatro Carlo Felice (Genoa, 1827) and the Cisternone (Livorno, 1829).
