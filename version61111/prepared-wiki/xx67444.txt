[[Roi Et Province]]

CATEGORIES: Isan, Roi Et Province, Provinces of Thailand

Roi Et ([tpl]lang-th|ร้อยเอ็ด[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-th|rɔ́ːj ʔèt|pron[/tpl]) is one of the provinces (changwat) of Thailand, located in the North-East of Thailand. Neighboring Provinces are (from north clockwise) Kalasin, Mukdahan, Yasothon, Sisaket, Surin and Maha Sarakham.
The name Roi Et translates to 101, which refers to the original 11 satellite cities around the main city as well as the 11 city gates. To express the importance of the city the number was exaggerated.

==Geography==

Most part of the province is covered by plains about 130–160 meters above sea level, drained by the Chi River. In the north of the province are the hills of the Phu Phan mountain range, with the Yang River as the major river. In the south is the Mun River, which also forms the boundary to the province of Surin. At the mouth of the Chi River, where it enters the Mun River, a big flooded basin provides a good rice farming area.

==History==

The area was already settled during the times of the Khmer empire, as several ruins show. However, the main history of the province began when Lao people from Champasak settled near Suwannaphum during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In the late 18th century, King Taksin moved the city to its present site, then called Saket Nakhon.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows the shrine of the city pillar, which is located in the artificial lake Bueng Phlan Chai. The spirit of the shrine, Mahesak, is highly revered by the local people.
The provincial tree is Lagerstroemia macrocarpa.

==Administrative divisions==

The province is subdivided into 20 districts (amphoe). The districts are further subdivided into 193 subdistricts (tambon) and 2311 villages (muban).
