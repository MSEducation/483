He was arrested and charged with treason by the newly independent Burmese government in 1950.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821364,00.html He chose to stand trial rather than be perceived as fleeing. He was sentenced in January 1951 to six years at hard labor, on charges that he wrote a letter that helped Karen rebels arrest a government commissioner, and that he gave medical help to the Karen rebels. The sentence was later reduced to six months, and in November 1951 the verdict was overturned by Burma's three-man Supreme Court and he was declared not guilty. He suffered dysentery and malaria in part from his time in jail.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821447,00.htmlhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857040,00.html
