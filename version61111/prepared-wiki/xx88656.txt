The swimming program for 2000 was expanded from 1996, with the inclusion of the semifinal phase in each of the events except for some special cases. Long-distance swimming events (400 m freestyle, 800 m freestyle, 1500 m freestyle, and 400 m individual medley) and all relays still maintained the old format with only two phases: heats and final. Because of the radical changes in the competition format, it was extended into an eight-day program and thereby continued into the present era.[tpl]cite web|title=Sydney 2000: Swimming – Competition Description|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/Masters/sw/SWresults.pdf|format=PDF|work=Sydney 2000|publisher=LA84 Foundation|page=10|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/olympics/2000/SWIMMING/about/format.htm|title=Format: Men and women each compete in 16 events on the Olympic program|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 September 2000|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]
