[tpl]nihongo|World Trade Center Building|世界貿易センタービル|[/tpl] is a 40-story commercial skyscraper located in Hamamatsuchō, Minato, Tokyo. Completed in 1970, the building is one of Japan's earliest skyscrapers. Upon its completion, the 163-meter-tall WTC Building took the title of Japan's tallest skyscraper from the Kasumigaseki Building; it retained this title until Keio Plaza Hotel's North Tower was completed one year later.[tpl]cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=2870 |title=Tokyo World Trade Center Building |accessdate=2009-10-16 |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com[/tpl]
The building is home to World Trade Center Tokyo, a member of the World Trade Centers Association. It is primarily used for office space, but it also includes retail stores and restaurants. The building's top floor is a visitor observatory. The building is connected to the Toei Subways's Daimon Station and Hamamatsuchō Station, which is serviced by two JR East lines and the Tokyo Monorail.
