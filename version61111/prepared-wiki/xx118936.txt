The area was originally inhabited by the Wanaruah Aboriginal people who called it Erringhi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/new-south-wales/clarence-town/2005/02/17/1108500193304.html|title=Clarence Town|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-02-08|accessdate=2008-05-13[/tpl] There is a hotel in the main street of Clarence Town built in 1913 called The Erringhi Hotel.
The township is most famous for building and launching the William IV paddle steamer in 1831, although the town was still called Erringhi at this time. It was later renamed in 1832 after the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV in 1830.[tpl]NSW GNR|id=JPqwoesEJP|title=Clarence Town|accessdate=2008-05-13[/tpl]
