==Physical description==

As its name obviously implies, an invisible stalker is invisible, resembling a completely see-through, completely silent, and highly undetectable and stealthy humanoid made of a wispy, shimmering essence.
Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A see invisibility spell only reveals a dim outline of a vaguely humanoid cloud, while a true seeing spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.

==Society==

Invisible stalkers live predominantly on the Elemental Plane of Air, but are sometimes summoned by mages to perform various tasks. A summoned invisible stalker does whatever task its master, the summoner, commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. It makes an ideal spy or assassin. The creature follows a command until it is completed and obeys only its summoner. It, however, resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert the instructions accordingly. 
While invisible stalkers can only speak Auran, they do understand Common. 
Invisible stalkers are usually neutral in alignment, and could be regarded as good or evil if given a task or summoned by a master of such an alignment.

==Combat==

An invisible stalker uses stealth to attack. It sneaks up to the enemy and then creates a single blast of wind which pounds the enemy, intended to weaken it. Then it starts pummeling the opponent with its own strength. As the creature can remain invisible even in combat, fighting back against it is difficult. Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the Elemental Plane of Air; if they take enough damage to kill them elsewhere, they teleport back.

==Trivia==

When it comes to a miniature of the invisible stalker, the developers of the Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures game have often joked about using just the base with nothing on it, because the creature itself is invisible.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] Furthermore, the 2nd Edition picture of an invisible stalker was, in fact, a blank picture. This "picture" was credited as a joke to Doug Stewart and Tim Beach in the 2nd Edition Monstrous Manual book.
