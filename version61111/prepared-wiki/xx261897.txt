The Bernard 82 was a French single-engined long-range  monoplane bomber designed and built by Société des Avions Bernard. Only two prototypes were built and the type did not enter production.

==Design and development==

The Bernard 82 was developed from the long-range Bernard 80 GR which had been built to make attempts on some long-distance aircraft records. The all-metal Bernard 82 was three-seat long-range bomber, known at the time as a bombardier de represaillies or reprisal bomber. The cantilever mid-wing monoplane powered by a [tpl]convert|860|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs inline piston engine. The first prototype flew from Le Bourget on 11 December 1933 and in March 1932 was joined by a second aircraft. During test flying the twin lateral radiators had to be replaced by frontal radiators but the biggest problem was the landing gear. The retractable landing gear regularly failed with the resultant wheels up landing, the problem was never resolved and testing was stopped in the middle of 1935. The production contract for ten aircraft was cancelled.
In August 1936 the second prototype was re-engined with a [tpl]convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] CLM Lille 6AS, a licence built Junkers Jumo diesel engine. The diesel powered aircraft, redesignated Bernard 86,  was entered into the Paris-Saigon air race which was run in September 1936 but was not ready in time and was scrapped.
