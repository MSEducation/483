Homage ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|m|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl]) is a show or demonstration of respect or dedication to someone or something, sometimes by simple declaration but often by some more oblique reference, artistic or poetic.
It was originally a declaration of fealty in the feudal system (see Homage (medieval))—swearing that one was the man (French: homme) of the feudal lord.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&pg=PA686 |title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages |volume=2 |chapter=Homage[/tpl]  The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority.  For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces.  In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a festschrift dedicated to him.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ESFS7XXhujAC&pg=PA75 |title=An author's guide to scholarly publishing |author=Robin M. Derricourt[/tpl]
The concept now often appears in the arts where one author shows respect to a topic by calling it a homage, such as Homage to Catalonia.  Alternatively, creative artists may show respect to a veteran of the field or to an admired practitioner by alluding to their work.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H4q8ZosSvB8C&pg=PA88 |title=The limits of interpretation |author=Umberto Eco[/tpl]  In rock music this can take the form of a tribute album or of a sample.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&pg=PA616 |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World |author=John Shepherd |chapter=Rock Homage[/tpl]  [tpl]As of | 2010[/tpl], the digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works and this remediation may be used in homage to them.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&pg=PA497 |title=Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory |author=Richard Grusin[/tpl]
