==Childhood and amateur career==

Sörenstam was born in Bro near Stockholm, Sweden.Annika Sörenstam with the editors of Golf Magazine: Golf Annika's Way, Gotham Books, 2004, ISBN 1-59240-076-0 Her father Tom is a retired IBM executive, her mother Gunilla worked in a bank and her younger sister Charlotta is a professional golfer who coaches at her sister's academy.[ref]

</ref> Annika and Charlotta Sörenstam are the only two sisters to have both won $1&nbsp;million on the LPGA.
As a child, Sörenstam was a talented all-round sportsgirl. She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played football (soccer) in her hometown team Bro IK and was such a good skier that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to Northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.Claes Lind with Annika Sörenstam, Våga bli bäst or Dare to be the Best, Sportförlaget i Europa AB, 2003, ISBN 91-88541-56-8[ref]
</ref> At the age of 12, she switched to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54.<ref name="Golf Annika's Way"/> She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech.<ref name="ACAD3">

</ref> The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.<ref name="Golf Annika's Way"/>
Her successful amateur career included a win in the St. Rule Trophy played at St. Andrews and a runner-up finish in the Swedish national mother/daughter golf tournament.[ref]
