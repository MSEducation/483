==Life==

Brought up a Protestant, he embraced the Catholic faith at the age of twenty, and shortly afterwards went from England to the English College, Douai. Here he was received into the Franciscan Order and became lector of philosophy and later professor of theology in the convent of the Friars Minor.
Having returned to England, he worked for the spread of the Catholic faith and was chosen by the Catholics to defend their cause against Edward Stillingfleet.

==Works==

Canes's ability as a controversialist was strengthened by the absence of bitterness or animosity towards his opponents, while his elegant style made his writings effective.
