John Baker Hollister (November 7, 1890 - January 4, 1979) was a U.S. Representative from Ohio.
Born in Cincinnati, Hollister attended the local schools and St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He graduated from Yale University in 1911, and next studied at the University of Munich, Germany for a year. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1915. Hollister was admitted to the bar the same year and began his practice in Cincinnati, Ohio.
