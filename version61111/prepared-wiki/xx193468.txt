==Cinematic style==

Mania Akbari's style in filmmaking is consisted of long takes, hand-held camera and almost painting-like control of color which is called "a cross between fiction and documentary." In an interview, discussing her style, Akbari pointed to "architecture and mise-en-scène within a space" as the most important elements in her filmmaking. "When I’m creating my frame, I really want it so that when each frame is seen the audience can imagine the space surrounding it themselves. The way that I’m creating the mise-en-scène within each frame, I’m trying to, every second, break the theatrical boundaries that people are seeing. In my view, I actually feel that it’s more like performance art than a theatrical performance. It’s as if I create a space for every single character and they come and perform within that space and share something with their audience, and then they leave."http://www.theskinny.co.uk/film/film_festivals/305341-one_on_one_filmmaker_mania_akbari_in_conversation
