[[Net neutrality in Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Net neutrality, Internet in Canada

Net neutrality in Canada is a hotly debated issue.  In Canada, Internet service providers (ISPs) generally provide Internet service in a neutral manner, some notable exceptions being Bell Canada's, Eastlink's, Shaw, and Rogers Hi-Speed Internet's throttling of certain protocols and Telus' censorship of a specific website critical of the company.

==History of net neutrality in Canada==

In 2005, when Telus blocked access to labour union blogs during an employee strike, the question of net neutrality became more prominent.[tpl]cite web| title=Interpreting Network Discrimination in the CRTC and FCC | author=Perry&Margoni |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1504707|publisher = ssrn.com |accessdate=2011-09-07[/tpl]
In March 2006, the federal government updated the Telecommunications Policy Objectives and Regulation with new objectives to focus on three broad goals:
In November 2008, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) scheduled a review of the internet traffic management of ISPs and is still in the review process. The CRTC took comments from the public until Monday, February 23, 2009.

==Types of net control==

===Bandwidth throttling===

Typically an ISP will allocate a certain portion of bandwidth to a neighbourhood, which is then sold to residents within the neighbourhood.  It is common practice for ISP companies to oversell the amount of bandwidth as typically most customers will only use a fraction of what they're alloted.[tpl]cite web| title=Unlimited Bandwidth and Overselling | author=iNetPublication.com |url=http://www.inetpublication.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?aid=26&category=Hosting&title=Unlimited%20Bandwidth%20and%20Overselling&skill_level=Beginner|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] By overselling, ISP companies can lower the price of service to their customers per gigabit alloted. On some ISPs, however, when one or a few customers use a larger amount than expected, the ISP company will purposely reduce the speed of that customer's service for certain protocols,[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/tech/internet/netneutrality-faq.html |title=Net neutrality: FAQ The battle over whether the Internet will remain open in Canada has begun in earnest|publisher = CBC News|date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] thus throttling their bandwidth. This is done through a method called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), which allows an ISP to detect the type of traffic being sent and throttle it if it is not high priority and using a large fraction of the bandwidth.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2800/135/ | title=Michael Geist - Bell's 'Throttling' Plan a Threat to a Competitive Net |publisher = Michael Geist |date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl] Bandwidth throttling of certain types of traffic (i.e. peer-to-peer file sharing) can be scheduled during specific times of the day to avoid congestion at peak usage hours. As a result, customers should all have equal internet speeds.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2800/135/ | title=Michael Geist - Bell's 'Throttling' Plan a Threat to a Competitive Net |publisher = Michael Geist |date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl]
Encrypted data may be throttled or filtered causing major problems for businesses that use Virtual Private Networks (VPN)s and other applications that send and receive encrypted data.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/article/203408 | title=ISP must come clean on `traffic shaping' |publisher = The Toronto Star |date=April 16, 2007|accessdate=2009-02-22 | first=Michael | last=Geist[/tpl]

===IP blocking===

IP blocking by an ISP company is purposely preventing its Internet service customers access to a specific website or IP address. In Canada, certain ISP companies have been found to block certain websites.  While some blocking (e.g., of child pornography sites) is considered acceptable or requiredhttp://www.protectchildren.ca/app/en/ and is even stated in an ISP company's acceptable Internet use policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shaw.ca/en-ca/AboutShaw/TermsofUse/AcceptableUsePolicyInternet.htm |title=Acceptable Use Policy Internet | author=Shaw Communications| date = June 18, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] ISP companies have absolute control over the content transmitted over their wires, without adequately informing service subscribers,[tpl]cite web| title=Interpreting Network Discrimination in the CRTC and FCC | author=Perry&Margoni |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1504707|publisher = ssrn.com |accessdate=2011-09-07[/tpl]

==Cases==

===Telus vs. Telecommunications Workers Union===

In July 2005, while its union workers were striking, Telus blocked its subscribers access to 'Voices for Change'—a community website run by and for Telecommunications Workers Union (TWU) members.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/24/telus-sites050724.html |publisher=CBC News|title=Telus cuts subscriber access to pro-union website|date=July 24, 2005 |accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] Telus claimed that the site suggested striking workers to jam Telus phone lines, and posted pictures of employees crossing the union picket lines. A Telus spokesperson said advocating jamming lines hurts the company (and its customers), and access to those kinds of pictures threatened the privacy and safety of employees.
Telus said in news release that it would unblock access to the website only when all postings, including photographs, posted with the intent of intimidating or threatening Telus employees had been removed as ordered in an Alberta court injunction.[tpl]cite web|publisher=TELUS media relations |title=Alberta court grants interim injunction against posting TELUS employee photos |date=July 28, 2005| url=http://about.telus.com/cgi-bin/news_viewer.cgi?news_id=605&mode=2&news_year=2005 |accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl]

===Bell Canada traffic shaping===

On April 3, 2008, the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) requested that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) require Bell Canada to immediately cease its traffic shaping and Internet traffic throttling.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|title=2008-04-03 - #: 8622-C51-200805153 - Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) - Application requesting certain orders directing Bell Canada to cease and desist from throttling its wholesale ADSL Access Services|date=April 3, 2008|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/PartVII/eng/2008/8622/c51_200805153.htm|accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=eCanadaNow|title=Canadian CAIP Cries Internet Foul|date=April 14, 2008|url=http://www.ecanadanow.com/news/technology/canadian-caip-cries-internet-foul-20080414.html|accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] On November 20, 2008, the CRTC ruled that Bell's traffic shaping was not discriminatory, as they were applied to both wholesale and retail customers. The CRTC also called for public to ensure that that network management practices are administered fairly in the future.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Telecommunications Industry News|title=CRTC Allows BCE Traffic Shaping, Calls for Further Debate on Net Neutrality|date=November 22, 2008|url=http://www.teleclick.ca/2008/11/crtc-allows-bce-traffic-shaping-calls-for-further-debate-on-net-neutrality/|accessdate=2008-11-24[/tpl]

==Current legal status==

On May 28, 2008, the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) introduced a private member's bill, C-552,[tpl]cite web| title=C-552 Private Member's Bill| publisher=House of Commons of Canada | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3524372&Language=e&Mode=1&File=24#1 | accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl] to the House of Commons that would entrench the principle of "net neutrality" and enact rules to keep the Internet free from interference by service providers.[tpl]cite news|publisher = CBC News| date=May 27, 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/05/27/net-neutrality-ndp.html |title=NDP to introduce 'net neutrality' private member's bill | accessdate = 2008-07-26[/tpl]
This bill died on the order paper at 1st reading on September 7, 2008, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor-General for the dissolution of the 39th Session of Parliament.
On June 8, 2008, a private member's bill, C-555,[tpl]cite web| title=C-555 Private Member's Bill| publisher=House of Commons of Canada | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3535409&File=9[/tpl] entitled "The Telecommunications Clarity and Fairness Act" was introduced by Liberal MP David McGuinty (Ottawa South) that sought to undertake, among other things, "an assessment of network management practices that favour, degrade or prioritize any packet transmitted over a broadband network based on source, ownership or destination". Like the NDP bill, this proposed legislation fell after the 39th Parliament was dissolved by the Prime Minister.
A new decision on January 25 of 2011, the CRTC (Canadian Radio, Television, Telecommunications Commission) ruled that usage-based billing could now be introduced. CRTC
Prime Minister Harper signaled that the government may be looking into such a ruling: "We're very concerned about CRTC's decision on usage-based billing and its impact on consumers. I've asked for a review of the decision".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/pm-orders-review-of-internet-billing/article1890567/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first1=Steven | last1=Chase | first2=Iain | last2=Marlow | title=Harper steps into Web dispute - The Globe and Mail | date=2011-02-01[/tpl] Some have suggested that this adversely affects net neutrality, since it discriminates against media that is larger in size, such as audio and video.[tpl]cite web|last=Pinto|first=Lindsey|title=What does Usage-Based Billing mean for Net Neutrality?|url=http://www.saveournet.ca/content/what-does-usage-based-billing-mean-net-neutrality|accessdate=4 July 2011[/tpl] The new ruling significantly throttles the availability of access by small business owners as they would have to pay for services.

==Arguments for and against==

===Proponents===

====Wholesale Internet Service Providers====

TekSavvy Solutions Inc., Velcom, Acanac Inc. argue that throttling by Bell Canada at the ISP level makes it difficult to differentiate their services against Bell Canada, concerning issues about Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and security, and the quality of service.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2800/135/ | title=Michael Geist - Bell's 'Throttling' Plan a Threat to a Competitive Net |publisher = Michael Geist |date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl] According to TekSavvy Solutions Inc., Bell Canada’s congestion report to the CRTC shows that the “data suggests no congestion problems for at least 95 percent of the network in Ontario and Quebec.”[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.neutrality.ca/index.php?option=com_extcon&task=view&eid=1&cid=3105 | title=Bell’s Congestion Problem |publisher = neutrality.ca|date=June 25, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl]
Wholesale ISPs do not throttle bandwidth,[tpl]cite web|url = http://fixppp.org/index.php?p=about | title=Tomato/MLPPP - About |publisher = fixppp.org |accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl] but since wholesalers do not have a full network infrastructure, they rely on Bell Canada’s network for the last stretch of cabling to customers. When Bell Canada receives packets on the network, it may be throttled, slowing down the connection between the wholesale ISP and the customer.
TekSavvy Solutions Inc. and Velcom support MLPPP which circumvents Bell Canada's throttling.[tpl]cite web|url = http://fixppp.org/index.php | title=Tomato/MLPPP |publisher = fixppp.org |accessdate=2009-02-22[/tpl]

====Content providers====

Yahoo! and Microsoft argue that net neutrality law is necessary because without such a law ISPs will destroy the free and open nature of the Internet and also create a tiered, dollar-driven net that favours the wealthiest corporations over everyone else.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2006/11/02/tech-neutrality.html | title=Battle over 'net neutrality' arrives in Canada|publisher = CBC News|date=November 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl]

====Michael Geist====

Michael Geist has been writing about net neutrality in The Toronto Star.
When he had an interview with CARTT.CA, he said that "from a policy and law perspective, we ought to be thinking about what kind of rules the government might consider to help facilitate some of that."[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.mhgoldberg.com/blog/2007/09/michael-geist-on-net-neutrality.html | title=Michael Geist on Net Neutrality |publisher = cartt.ca|date=September 11, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl]

===Political parties===

The federal NDP has been a vocal advocate of the principles behind net neutrality, with MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay) whose role of digital spokesperson[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2008/04/21/tech-angus.html | title=NDP calls for net neutrality|publisher = CBC News|date=2008-04-21[/tpl] for his party has drawn attention to this and other related issues, such as copyright reform. Mr. Angus has raised this issue many times in the House of Commons and in committee.
On June 18, 2009, federal Liberal Party MP Marc Garneau (Westmount—Ville-Marie), the Official Opposition critic for Industry, Science and Technology,[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.liberal.ca/en/team/mp/16182_marc-garneau | title=Monsieur Marc Garneau Westmount--Ville-Marie|publisher = liberal.ca |year=2009[/tpl] declared Liberal support for Network Neutrality during Question Period by asking the Conservative Government to do the same.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.liberal.ca/en/newsroom/media-releases/15947_liberals-speak-out-in-support-of-net-neutrality| title=Liberals speak out in support of net neutrality (Press release)|publisher = liberal.ca|date=2009-06-19[/tpl] Until this point, the Liberals had been mostly silent on the issue.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/04/28/tech-neutrality.html | title=Liberals called on to support net neutrality|publisher = CBC News|date=2008-04-28[/tpl]
As of June 18, 2009, the ruling federal Conservative Party under Stephen Harper (Calgary Southwest) remains non-committal, contending that free market competition is more favourable than regulation.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.thestar.com/article/180608 | title=Bernier's troubling stand on net neutrality|publisher = Toronto Star|date=2007-02-12 | first=Michael | last=Geist | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]
While the current position of the Bloc Québecois remains unclear, former Bloc MP Paul Crête (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup) has come out in support of net neutrality.[tpl]cite web| title=Edited Hansard, No. 105| publisher=House of Commons of Canada | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2673637#Int-1884158[/tpl]
The Green Party of Canada states its support for net neutrality in its policy statement.[tpl]cite web|url = http://greenparty.ca/node/134081 | title = Supporting the free flow of information|publisher = greenparty.ca|accessdate =2010-06-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Bell Canada====

A spokeswoman for Bell Canada, Jacqueline Michelis said "Our position on network diversity/neutrality is that it should be determined by market forces, not regulation"[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2006/11/02/tech-neutrality.html | title=Battle over 'net neutrality' arrives in Canada|publisher = CBC News|date=November 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] in an e-mail to The Canadian Press.
