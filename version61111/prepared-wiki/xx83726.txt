[[First River]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Newark, New Jersey, Passaic River, Rivers of New Jersey

The First River, in the state of New Jersey in the United States, is the first main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay.
The First River was also known as Mill Brook, having supported several mills, including grist mills for the earliest settlers of Newark in the 17th century.
From 1863 to 1890 the brook was culvertised and now flows underground through two culverts, each six feet nine inches high (205.74 cm) by nine feet three inches (281.94 cm) wide until discharging into the Passaic.  The brook once flowed through, and now flows under, what is now Branch Brook Park in the city of Newark.
