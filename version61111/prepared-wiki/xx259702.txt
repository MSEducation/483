Sir Francis Blake Delaval KB (16 March 1727 – 7 August 1771) was a British actor, soldier and Member of Parliament.
He was the eldest son of Captain Francis Blake Delaval RN of Seaton Delaval Hall, and succeeded to the estate in 1752.
Francis was an actor in a group of Samuel Foote. He was a gambler but could not afford that lifestyle. He married the wealthy (and much older) Isabella, daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet and widow of Lord Nassau Powlett, but it was not a happy marriage. His wife filed a lawsuit against him because of adultery with an actress, Miss La Roche, for which Isabelle unknowningly forked out ₤1500.
His military career was of short duration. He took part in the Raid on St Malo, and received a knighthood for his bravery when storming the Brittany beach, although there were no French troops present to offer resistance.
He represented Hindon in Parliament from 1751 to 1754 and Andover from 1754 to 1768.
He suffered a stroke, and was memorized by his obituarist as "'the very soul of frolic and amusement (who) overbalanced a few foibles by a thousand amiable qualities". He died without issue and was succeeded by his younger brother John Hussey Delaval, later Baron Delaval.
