The Lesser Flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor) is a species of flamingo occurring in sub-Saharan Africa with another population in India. Birds are occasionally reported from further north, but these are generally considered vagrants.

==Characteristics==

The Lesser Flamingo is the smallest species of flamingo, though it is a tall and largish bird by most standards. The species can weigh from [tpl]convert|1.2|to|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.arkive.org/lesser-flamingo/phoeniconaias-minor/#text=Facts The standing height is around [tpl]convert|80|to|90|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/flamingo/physical-characteristics.htmhttp://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-flamingo.html The total length (from beak to tail) and wingspan are in the same range of measurements, from [tpl]convert|90|to|105|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|author=Ali, S.|year=1993|title=The Book of Indian Birds|publisher=Bombay Natural History Society|location=Bombay|isbn=0-149-563731-3[/tpl]
Most of the plumage is pinkish white. The clearest difference between this species and the Greater Flamingo, the only other Old World species of flamingo, is the much more extensive black on the bill. Size is less helpful unless the species are together, since the sexes of each species also differ in height.
The Lesser Flamingo may be the most numerous species of flamingo, with a population that (at its peak) probably numbers up to two million individual birds. This species feeds primarily on Spirulina, algae which grow only in very alkaline lakes. Presence of flamingo herds near water bodies is indication of sodic alkaline water which is not suitable for irrigation use.  Although blue-green in colour, the algae contain the photosynthetic pigments that give the birds their pink colour. Their deep bill is specialised for filtering tiny food items. The lesser flamingo also feeds on shrimp.
Lesser Flamingos are prey to a variety of species, including Marabou Storks, Baboons, African Fish Eagles, and Wildcats.

==Breeding==

In Africa, where they are most numerous, the Lesser Flamingos breed principally on the highly caustic Lake Natron in northern Tanzania. Their other African breeding sites are at Etosha Pan, Sua Pan and Kamfers Dam. The last confirmed breeding at Aftout es Saheli in coastal Mauritania was in 1965. Breeding occurred at Lake Magadi in Kenya in 1962 when Lake Natron was unsuitable due to flooding. In the early 20th century, breeding was also observed at Lake Nakuru.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink = Mark D. Anderson|title = A Vision in Pink, Lesser Flamingo Breeding Success|journal = Africa - Birds & Birding|volume = 13|pages = 42–49|date = April–May 2008 | issue=2[/tpl]
The species also breeds in southwestern and southern Asia. In 1974, they bred at the Rann of Kutch, but since then only at the Zinzuwadia and Purabcheria salt pans in north-western India.
Like all flamingos, they lay a single chalky white egg on a mound they build of mud. Chicks join creches soon after hatching, sometimes numbering over a hundred thousand individuals. The creches are marshalled by a few adult birds who lead them by foot to fresh water, a journey that can reach over [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl].

==Conservation==

Despite being the most numerous species of flamingo, it is classified as near-threatened due to its declining population and the low number of breeding sites, some of which are threatened by human activities.[tpl]cite web|last = Anderson |first = Mark D|title = Save the Flamingo|url= http://www.savetheflamingo.co.za/|accessdate = 2008-08-20[/tpl]
The population in the two key east African lakes, Nakuru and Bogoria, have been adversely affected in recent years by suspected  heavy metal poisoning, while its primary African breeding area in Lake Natron is currently under threat by a proposed soda ash plant by Tata Chemicals.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink = BirdLife International|title = TA-TA to Lake Natron's flamingos|journal = Africa - Birds & Birding|volume = 12|pages = 16|date = August–September 2007 | issue=4[/tpl] The only breeding site in South Africa, situated at Kamfers Dam, is threatened by pollution and encroaching development.[tpl]cite news|last = Macleod|first = Fiona|title = Flamingo row: Officials 'under house arrest'|page = |publisher = Mail&Guardian|date = 20 August 2008|url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-08-20-flamingo-row-officials-under-house-arrest|accessdate =2008-08-20[/tpl]
The Lesser Flamingo is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.
