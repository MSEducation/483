[[Demographics of India]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of India

The demographics of India are inclusive of the second most populous country in the world, with over 1.21 billion people (2011 census), more than a sixth of the world's population. Already containing 17.5% of the world's population, India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2025, surpassing China, its population reaching 1.6 billion  by 2050.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3575994.stm |title=India's population 'to be biggest' in the planet |publisher=BBC News |date=18 August 2004 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=US Census Bureau, Demographic Internet Staff |url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/informationGateway.php |title=United States Census Bureau - International Data Base (IDB) |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Its population growth rate is 1.41%, ranking 102nd in the world in 2010. Indian population reached the billion mark in 2000.
India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio should be just over 0.4.[tpl]cite news|last=Basu |first=Kaushik |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6911544.stm |title=India's demographic dividend |publisher=BBC News |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
India has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[tpl]cite web|title=Background Note: India|author=US Department of State|date=17 April 2012|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3454.htm[/tpl] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages) as well as two language isolates (the Nihali language[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90087| title=Ethnologue report for Language Isolate| author=SIL International| accessdate=2007-10-11[/tpl] spoken in parts of Maharashtra and the Burushaski language spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir).
Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.India, a Country Study United States Library of Congress, Note on Ethnic groups

===Neonatal and infant demographics===

The table below represents the infant mortality rate trends in India, by gender, in the last 15 years. In the urban areas of India, average male infant mortality rates are slightly higher than the female infant mortality rates.
Some activists believe India's 2011 census shows a serious decline in the number of girls under the age of seven - activists fear eight million female foetuses may have been aborted between 2001 and 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Pandey|first=Geeta|title=India's unwanted girls|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13264301|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=23 May 2011[/tpl] These claims are controversial. Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that birth sex ratio between 1.08 to 1.12 can be because of natural factors, such as the age of mother at baby's birth, age of father at baby's birth, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, etc.[tpl]cite journal|author=James W.H.|title=Hypothesis:Evidence that Mammalian Sex Ratios at birth are partially controlled by parental hormonal levels around the time of conception|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|volume=198|pages=3–15|date=July 2008|doi= 10.1677/JOE-07-0446|url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/198/1/3.full.pdf+html|issue=1|pmid=18577567[/tpl] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to 870-930 girls to 1000 boys birth sex ratios observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 to 2005.

==Population projections==

India is projected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. India's population growth has raised concerns that it would lead to widespread unemployment and political instability.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2011/03/indias_census_the_good_and_bad_news.html |title=Soutik Biswas's India: India's census: The good and bad news |publisher=BBC |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1371996/India-set-overtake-China-worlds-populated-country-adding-180m-people-decade.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=India set to overtake China as world's most populated country after adding 180m people in a decade | date=31 March 2011[/tpl] Note that these projections make assumptions about future fertility and death rates which may not turn out to be correct in the event.

==Ethnic groups==

The national Census of India does not recognize racial or ethnic groups within India,Kumar, Jayant. Census of India. 2001. 4 September 2006. Indian Census but recognizes many of the tribal groups as Scheduled Castes and Tribes (see list of Scheduled Tribes in India). Nevertheless, modern anthropologists classify Indians as belonging to one of four major ethno-racial groups, which significantly overlap because of racial admixture between populations: Caucasoids, Australoids, Mongoloids and Negritos. The Caucasoids are found in the north, central and south-western regions of India and generally speak Indo-Aryan languages; Australoids are found in the south and generally speak Dravidian languages; Mongoloids are largely confined to the Northeastern region of the country and for the most part, speak Tibeto-Burman languages; and Negritos are found on the Andaman Islands located on the southeastern side of the country. These speak a language known simply as Great Andamanese, a linguistic isolate not related to any known language. And finally, Austroasiatic languages are spoken by only tribals or Adivasis, who can be of either Australoid or Mongoloid racial stock.http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/reprints/IGVdb.pdf
According to a 2009 study published by Reich et al., the modern Indian population is composed of two genetically divergent and heterogeneous populations which mixed in ancient times (about 1,200-3,500 BC), known as Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI). ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[tpl]cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html |title=Reconstructing Indian population history : Abstract |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ichg2011.org/cgi-bin/showdetail.pl?absno=20758 |title=Abstract/Presentation |publisher=Ichg2011.org |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl]

===Autosomal DNA===

Numerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.
