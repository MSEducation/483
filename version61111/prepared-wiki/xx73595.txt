[[Neustadt]]

Neustadt (German for new town or new city) is the name of various locations in German-speaking countries. The name indicates that at its foundation the town was considered new as compared with earlier communities - however, the name might be retained also when it is quite old. Similar names exist in other languages, such as Newton or New Town in English, Novgorod in Russian and Neapolis in Greek.
