The city of Cardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan (and later South Glamorgan). Cardiff is part of the Eurocities network of the largest European cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurocities.org/|title=Eurocities|accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] The Cardiff Urban Area covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary, and includes the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city.
Cardiff was made a city in 1905, and proclaimed the capital of Wales in 1955. Since the 1990s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at Cardiff Bay contains the Senedd building, home to the Welsh Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the Cardiff International Sports Village, a BBC drama village,[tpl]cite web|title=Proposed BBC Drama Village at Media Capital, Roath Basin|url=http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=14 December 2009[/tpl] and a new business district in the city centre.[tpl]cite news|title=Cardiff Business District 'needs skills and transport'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=30 March 2011[/tpl]
Sporting venues in the city include the Millennium Stadium (the national stadium for the Wales national rugby union team and the Wales national football team), SWALEC Stadium (the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club), Cardiff City Stadium (the home of Cardiff City football team), Cardiff International Sports Stadium (the home of Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club) and Cardiff Arms Park (the home of Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC rugby union teams). The city is also HQ of the Wales Rally GB and was awarded with the European City of Sport in 2009 due to its role in hosting major international sporting events. It has been announced that Cardiff will again be the European City of Sport in 2014.[tpl]cite news|title=City takes European sports capital title for 2014|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/04/01/city-takes-european-sports-capital-title-for-2014-91466-28440348/|accessdate=6 April 2011|newspaper=South Wales Echo|date=1 April 2011[/tpl] The Millennium Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics, including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match.[tpl]cite news|title=Olympic football in Cardiff|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=Visit Cardiff|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=30 March 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Caerdydd (the Welsh name of the city) derives from the earlier Welsh form Caerdyf. The change from -dyf to -dydd shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh f [tpl]IPA-cy|v|[/tpl] and dd [tpl]IPA-cy|ð|[/tpl], and was perhaps also driven by folk etymology (dydd is Welsh for 'day' whereas dyf has no obvious meaning). This sound change had probably first occurred in the Middle Ages; both forms were current in the Tudor period. Caerdyf has its origins in post-Roman Brythonic words meaning "the fort of the Taff". The fort probably refers to that established by the Romans. Caer is Welsh for fort and -dyf is in effect a form of Taf (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the [tpl]angle bracket|t[/tpl] showing consonant mutation to [tpl]angle bracket|d[/tpl] and the vowel showing affection as a result of a (lost) genitive case ending.Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales. University of Wales Press, 2007, ISBN 1-84323-901-9, p. 70.
The anglicised form Cardiff is derived from Caerdyf, with the Welsh f [tpl]IPA-cy|v|[/tpl] borrowed as ff [tpl]IPAc-en|f[/tpl], as also happens in Taff (from Welsh Taf) and Llandaff (from Welsh Llandaf). As English does not have the vowel [tpl]IPA-cy|ɨ|[/tpl] the final vowel has been borrowed as /ɪ/.
The antiquarian William Camden (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from "Caer-Didi" ("the Fort of Didius"), a name supposedly given in honour of Aulus Didius Gallus, governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor Gwynedd Pierce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff|title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff|last=Pierce|first=Gwynedd O|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=17 July 2008[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

Archaeological evidence from sites in and around Cardiff—the St Lythans burial chamber, near Wenvoe (about four miles (6.4 km) west, south west of Cardiff city centre), the Tinkinswood burial chamber, near St Nicholas (about six miles (10 km) west of Cardiff city centre), the Cae'rarfau Chambered Tomb, Creigiau (about six miles (10 km) north west of Cardiff city centre) and the Gwern y Cleppa Long Barrow, near Coedkernew, Newport (about eight and a quarter miles (13.5 km) north east of Cardiff city centre)—shows that Neolithic people had settled in the area by at least around 6,000 BP (Before Present), about 1,500 years before either Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed.[tpl]cite web|title=St Lythans Chambered Long Cairn, Maesyfelin; Gwal-y-Filiast, site details|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/227289/details/ST+LYTHANS+CHAMBERED+LONG+CAIRN%2C+MAESYFELIN%3B+GWAL-Y-FILIAST/|accessdate=9 June 2009|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|date=26 July 2007|work=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales website[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=TINKINSWOOD CHAMBERED CAIRN, site details|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/94510/details/TINKINSWOOD+CHAMBERED+CAIRN/|accessdate=9 June 2009|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|date=29 January 2003|work=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales website[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Your guide to Stonehenge, the World's Favourite Megalithic Stone Circle|url=http://www.stonehenge.co.uk/history.htm|accessdate=9 June 2009|publisher=Longplayer SRS Ltd (trading as www.stonehenge.co.uk)|year=2009|work=Stonehenge.co.uk website[/tpl] A group of five Bronze Age tumuli is at the summit of The Garth ([tpl]lang-cy|Mynydd y Garth[/tpl]), within the county's northern boundary.[tpl]cite web|title=GARTH HILL, BARROW I|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/pls/portal/coflein.w_details?inumlink=6060351|accessdate=30 September 2008|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|year=2008|work=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales website[/tpl] Four Iron Age hill fort and enclosure sites have been identified within Cardiff's present-day county boundaries, including Caerau Hillfort, an enclosed area of [tpl]convert|5.1|ha|m2|0[/tpl].
Until the Roman conquest of Britain, Cardiff was part of the territory of the Silures – a Celtic British tribe that flourished in the Iron Age – whose territory included the areas that would become known as Breconshire, Monmouthshire and Glamorgan.[tpl]cite book|last=Davies|first=John|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales|publisher=Penguin|year=1994|location=London|pages=17–18|isbn=0-14-014581-8[/tpl] The [tpl]convert|3.2|ha|acre|0|adj=on[/tpl] fort established by the Romans near the mouth of the River Taff in 75 AD, in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Silures in the 50s AD. The fort was one of a series of military outposts associated with Isca Augusta (Caerleon) that acted as border defences. The fort may have been abandoned in the early 2nd century as the area had been subdued, however by this time a civilian settlement, or vicus, was established. It was likely made up of traders who made a living from the fort, ex-soldiers and their families. A Roman villa has been discovered at Ely. Contemporary with the Saxon Shore Forts of the 3rd and 4th centuries, a stone fortress was established at Cardiff. Similar to the shore forts, the fortress was built to protect Britannia from raiders. Coins from the reign of Gratian indicate that Cardiff was inhabited until at least the 4th century; the fort was abandoned towards the end of the 4th century, as the last Roman legions left the province of Britannia with Magnus Maximus.
Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. Historian William Rees suggests that the settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, Meurig ap Tewdrig emerged as the local king in Glywysing (which later became Glamorgan). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.

===Norman occupation to the Middle Ages===

In 1081 William I, King of England, began work on the castle keep within the walls of the old Roman fort. Cardiff Castle has been at the heart of the city ever since.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcardiff.com/About-Cardiff/Cardiff-History.html|publisher=Visit Cardiff|title=Cardiff history|accessdate=29 February 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080208165613/http://www.visitcardiff.com/About-Cardiff/Cardiff-History.html| archivedate = 8 February 2008[/tpl] The castle was substantially altered and extended during the Victorian period by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, and the architect William Burges. Original Roman work can, however, still be distinguished in the wall facings.
A small town grew up in the shadow of the castle, made up primarily of settlers from England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiffians.co.uk/timeline.html|publisher=Cardiffians|title=Cardiff Timeline|accessdate=29 February 2008[/tpl] Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/Cardiff.html|publisher=Tim Lambert|title=A short history of Cardiff|accessdate=29 February 2008[/tpl] By the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, but it was relatively small compared with most notable towns in the Kingdom of England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Campbell122.pdf|title=Benchmarking medieval economic development: England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, circa 1290|first=Bruce M S|last=Campbell|date=25 August 2006|accessdate=20 May 2008|format=PDF[/tpl]
In the early 12th century a wooden palisade was erected around the city to protect it. Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages, and was declared a Staple port in 1327.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/BobSanders/CDFF1.html|publisher=Bob Sanders|title=A Cardiff & Vale of Glamorgan Chronology up to 1699|accessdate=29 February 2008[/tpl]
Henry II travelled through Cardiff on his journey to Ireland and had a premonition against the holding of Sunday markets at St Piran's Chapel, which stood in the middle of the road between the castle entrance and Westgate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
In 1404 Owain Glyndŵr burned Cardiff and took Cardiff Castle. As the town was still very small, most of the buildings were made of wood and the town was destroyed. However, the town was soon rebuilt and began to flourish once again.

===County town of Glamorganshire===

In 1536, the Act of Union between England and Wales led to the creation of the shire of Glamorgan, and Cardiff was made the county town. It also became part of Kibbor hundred.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] Around this same time the Herbert family became the most powerful family in the area. In 1538, Henry VIII closed the Dominican and Franciscan friaries in Cardiff, the remains of which were used as building materials. A writer around this period described Cardiff: "The River Taff runs under the walls of his honours castle and from the north part of the town to the south part where there is a fair quay and a safe harbour for shipping."
Cardiff had become a Free Borough in 1542. In 1573, it was made a head port for collection of customs duties, and in 1581, Elizabeth I granted Cardiff its first royal charter. Pembrokeshire historian George Owen described Cardiff in 1602 as "the fayrest towne in Wales yett not the welthiest.", and the town gained a second Royal Charter in 1608.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.googobits.com/articles/2181-a-history-lovers-guide-to-cardiff.html|publisher=GoogoBits.com|title=A History Lovers Guide to Cardiff|accessdate=31 December 2007[/tpl]
A disastrous flood of the Bristol Channel on 30 January 1607 (now believed to be a tsunami)[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6311527.stm|title=Anniversary of 1607 killer wave|publisher=BBC News|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=8 May 2013[/tpl] led to a change in the course of the River Taff and the ruining of St Mary's Parish Church, which was replaced by its chapel of ease, St John the Baptist.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
During the Second English Civil War, St Fagans just to the west of the town, played host to the Battle of St Fagans. The battle, between a Royalist rebellion and a New Model Army detachment, was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and allowed Oliver Cromwell to conquer Wales. It is the last major battle to occur in Wales, with about 200 (mostly Royalist) soldiers killed.
In the ensuing century Cardiff was at peace. In 1766, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute married into the Herbert family and was later created Baron Cardiff, and in 1778 he began renovations on Cardiff Castle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/BobSanders/CDFF2.html|publisher=Bob Sanders|title=A Cardiff & Vale of Glamorgan Chronology 1700–1849|accessdate=4 March 2008[/tpl] In the 1790s a racecourse, printing press, bank and coffee house all opened, and Cardiff gained a stagecoach service to London. Despite these improvements, Cardiff's position in the Welsh urban hierarchy had declined over the 18th century. Iolo Morgannwg called it "an obscure and inconsiderable place", and the 1801 census found the population to be only 1,870, making Cardiff only the 25th largest town in Wales, well behind Merthyr and Swansea.[tpl]cite book|coauthors=John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines, Peredur I.

===Building of the docks===

In 1793, John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff". A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and Bristol was established in 1815, and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.
After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of Dic Penderyn in 1831.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the Marquess of Bute built a dock, which eventually linked to the Taff Vale Railway. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the Cynon, Rhondda, and Rhymney valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to migration from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.[tpl]cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Paul|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2004|page=14|isbn=978-0-85323-858-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qkCmYNMVMxwC&printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1|accessdate=2 October 2008[/tpl] By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|first=Francis Michael Longstreth|title=The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=311|isbn=978-0-521-43816-2|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eozO2RzSAVUC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311[/tpl] Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the University College South Wales and Monmouthshire in 1893.
Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when David Davies of Llandinam and the Barry Railway Company promoted the development of rival docks at Barry. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all tides, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its Coal Exchange, where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907. The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the Dowlais Ironworks in Merthyr (who would later form part of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds) to build a new steelworks close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand=|title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival)|date=1 February 2006|publisher=Glamorgan Records Office|accessdate=2 October 2008[/tpl]

===City and capital city status===

King Edward VII granted Cardiff city status on 28 October 1905,[tpl]cite book|last=Beckett|first=J.V.|title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=2005|page=2|isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&pg=PP8&lpg=PP1|accessdate=2 October 2008[/tpl] and the city acquired a Roman Catholic Cathedral in 1916. In subsequent years an increasing number of national institutions were located in the city, including the National Museum of Wales, Welsh National War Memorial, and the University of Wales Registry Building—however, it was denied the National Library of Wales, partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population".
After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the interwar period. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for Welsh coal. Bomb damage during the Cardiff Blitz in World War II included the devastation of Llandaff Cathedral, and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.
The city was proclaimed capital city of Wales on 20 December 1955, by a written reply by the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George. Caernarfon had also vied for this title.[tpl]cite news|title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government|publisher=The Times|date=21 December 1955[/tpl] Cardiff therefore celebrated two important anniversaries in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have". Although the city hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency, most of which were based in Cardiff.
The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10150530&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Cardiff Wales Through Time – Population Statistics|accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] consistent with a wider pattern of counter urbanisation in Britain. However, it recovered and was one of the few cities (outside London) where population grew during the 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/cbcb/census1.pdf|title=The Growth and Decline of Cities and Regions|date=1 July 2004|accessdate=20 May 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] During this period the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was promoting the redevelopment of south Cardiff; an evaluation of the regeneration of Cardiff Bay published in 2004 concluded that the project had "reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff" and "contributed to a massive improvement in the quality of the built environment", although it had failed "to attract the major inward investors originally anticipated".Esys Consulting Ltd, Evaluation of Regeneration in Cardiff Bay. A report for the Welsh Assembly Government, December 2004
In the 1997 devolution referendum, Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a 'British' rather than exclusively 'Welsh' identity.Balsom, Denis.

The city was county town of Glamorgan until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now Vale of Glamorgan together as the new county of South Glamorgan. Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's district council becoming a unitary authority, the City and County of Cardiff, with the addition of Creigiau and Pentyrch.

==Geography==

The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its geographic features were influential in its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys. The highest point in the authority is Garth Hill [tpl]convert|307|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level.
Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of Triassic stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from Chepstow to the Ely Estuary,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004|title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=1 October 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying which accounts and explains the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.[tpl]cite journal|year=2008|title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|publisher=Geological Society of London|volume=165|issue=5|pages=988–992|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988|accessdate=1 October 2008|doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014|last1=Radley|first1=J. D.|last2=Twitchett|first2=R. J.|last3=Mander|first3=L.|last4=Cope|first4=J.C.W[/tpl] The classic Triassic marl, sand and conglomerate rocks are used predominantly throughout Cardiff as building materials. Many of these Triassic rocks have a purple complexion, especially the coastal marl found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is "Radyr Stone", a freestone which as it name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html|title=Triassic building sandstone resources|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl] Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: Devonian sandstones (the Old Red Sandstone) from the Brecon Beacons has been used. Most famously, the buildings of Cathays Park, the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of Portland stone which was imported from Dorset.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf|format=PDF|title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park|publisher=Geologists Association South Wales|accessdate=22 October 2008[/tpl] A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey Liassic limestone rock of the Vale of Glamorgan, including the very rare "Sutton Stone", a conglomerate of lias limestone and carboniferous limestone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html|title=Castell Morgraig|last=Iowerth|first=Dylan|publisher=Castle Studies Group|year=1998|accessdate=22 October 2008[/tpl]
Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan—also known as The Garden of Cardiff—[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/|title=The Garden of Cardiff|accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] to the east by the city of Newport, to the north by the South Wales Valleys and to the south by the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel. The River Taff winds through the centre of the city and together with the River Ely flows into the freshwater lake of Cardiff Bay. A third river, the Rhymney flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Severn Estuary.
Cardiff is situated near the Glamorgan Heritage Coast, stretching westward from Penarth and Barry—commuter towns of Cardiff—with striped yellow-blue Jurassic limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the Celtic Sea that has exposed Jurassic (blue lias) geology. This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a ship graveyard; ships sailing up to Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as many were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Consequently, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were common.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html|title=Smuggling Around Kenfig|publisher=Kenfig.org|accessdate=19 April 2008[/tpl]

===Cityscape===

"Inner Cardiff" consists of the following wards: Plasnewydd, Gabalfa, Roath, Cathays, Adamsdown and Splott ward on the north and east of the city centre, and Butetown, Grangetown, Riverside and Canton to the south and west.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardifflife.net/cardiffwheretolive.html|title=Places to live in Cardiff|publisher=cardifflife.net|accessdate=1 June 2009[/tpl] The inner-city areas to the south of the A4161 road (known as the "Southern Arc") are, with the exception of Cardiff Bay, some of the poorest districts of Wales with low levels of economic activity.[tpl]cite book|author1=Alan Hooper|author2=John Punter|title=Capital Cardiff 1975–2020: Regeneration, Competitiveness and the Urban Environment|publisher=University of Wales Press|location=Cardiff|year=2006|page=63|isbn=0-7083-2063-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hvud9bNwTisC&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=%22southern+arc%22+cardiff[/tpl] On the other hand Gabalfa, Plasnewydd and Cathays north of the 'arc' have very large student populations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/prospective/pg/life/accommodation/areasofcardiff/index.html|title=Areas of Cardiff|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=18 April 2008[/tpl] and Pontcanna (situated north of Riverside and alongside Canton) is a favourite for students and young professionals. Penylan, which lies to the north east side of Roath Park, is an affluent area popular with those with older children and the retired.
To the west lie Ely, Caerau and Fairwater which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom. With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at Michaelston Super Ely and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households. Culverhouse Cross is a more affluent western area of the city. Heath, Birchgrove, Gabalfa, Mynachdy, Llandaff North, Llandaff,  Llanishen, Radyr, Whitchurch & Tongwynlais, Rhiwbina, Thornhill, Lisvane and Cyncoed lie in an arc from the north west to the north east of the centre. In particular, Lisvane, Cyncoed, Radyr and Rhiwbina contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales. Further to the east lie the wards of Pontprennau & Old St Mellons, Rumney, Pentwyn, Llanrumney and Trowbridge. The latter three are again largely of public housing stock, although new private housing is being built in Trowbridge in considerable number. Pontprennau is the newest 'suburb' of Cardiff, whilst Old St Mellons has a history going back to the Norman Conquest in the 11th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldstmellons.co.uk/history/|title=Old St Mellons History|accessdate=18 April 2008[/tpl]

Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3418&Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 1|format=PDF|accessdate=28 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3419&Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 2|format=PDF|accessdate=28 December 2007[/tpl]
Cardiff has an ethnically diverse population due to its past trading connections, post-war immigration and the large numbers of foreign students who attend university in the city. The ethnic make-up of Cardiff's population at the time of the 2011 census was: 84.7% White, 1.6% mixed White and Black African/Caribbean, 0.7% mixed White and Asian, 0.6% mixed other, 8% Asian, 2.4% Black, 1.4% Arab and 0.6% other ethnic groups.[tpl]cite web|last=Statistics|first=Neighbourhood|title=Demography: Cardiff Ethnicity|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6275349&c=Cardiff&d=13&e=62&g=6497663&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1359926795372&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2477|work=2011 Census Key Statistics|publisher=ONS (Office for National Statistics)|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl]  This means that almost 53,000 people from a non-white ethnic group reside in the city. This diversity, and especially that of the city's long-established African and Arab communities, has been celebrated in a number of cultural exhibitions and events, along with a number of books which have been published on this subject.[tpl]cite book|last=Lee|first=Brian|title=Butetown and Cardiff Docks|publisher=The History Press|date=15 April 1999|isbn=978-0-7524-1582-6[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bhac.org/black_history.html|title=Black History in Butetown|publisher=Butetown History & Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2008[/tpl]

===Language===

Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with Welsh, English, Latin, Norse and Norman preponderant at different times. Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the Victorian era.[tpl]cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Geraint H.|title=The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution|location=Cardiff|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7083-1418-0[/tpl] As late as 1850, five of the 12 Anglican churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in the Welsh language, while only two worshipped exclusively in English. By 1891, the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only Lisvane, Llanedeyrn and Creigiau remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities.[tpl]cite book|title=Language and Community in the Nineteenth Century|first=Geraint H.|last=Jenkins|isbn=0-7083-1467-8|year=1998|publisher=Univ. of Wales Press|location=Cardiff[/tpl] The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of chapels and churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemorate the new millennium. Following the establishment of the city's first Welsh School (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) in the 1950s, Welsh has slowly regained some ground.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm|title=Census shows Welsh language rise|date=14 February 2003|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=19 April 2008[/tpl] Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from other parts of Wales, the number of Welsh speakers in Cardiff rose by 14,451 between 1991 and 2001; Welsh is now spoken by 11% of Cardiffians. The highest percentage of Welsh speakers is in Pentyrch, where 15.9% of the population speak the language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pentyrch.cc/dogfennau/Policies/WelshLanguagePolicy.doc|format=DOC|title=Welsh Language Scheme|date=11 February 1999|accessdate=2 April 2013|publisher=Pentyrch Community Council[/tpl]
In addition to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population (including foreign students) means that a large number of languages are spoken within the city. One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with Somali, Urdu, Bengali and Arabic being the most commonly spoken foreign languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf|title=Positively Plurilingual|format=PDF|accessdate=3 January 2008[/tpl]

====Language schools====

Due to its diversity, large student population, and convenient size and location, Cardiff has seen a rise in the number of people coming to the city to learn English. Foreign students are a common sight on the streets of Cardiff with a large percentage coming from Arabic and other European countries. The British Council has an office in the city centre and there are six accredited schools in the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/accreditation-az-list.htm|title=A-Z list of accredited centres[/tpl]

===Religion===

Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral 'village' of Llandaff, whose bishop is also Archbishop of Wales since 2002. There is also a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city. Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 less than in 1980.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats|title=Archdiocese of Cardiff – Statistics|accessdate=18 April 2008[/tpl] Likewise, the Jewish population of the city also appears to have fallen—there are two synagogues in Cardiff, one in Cyncoed and one in Moira Terrace, as opposed to seven at the turn of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/Cardiff.htm|title=JCR-UK – Cardiff Community|date=14 October 2005|accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl] There are a significant number of nonconformist chapels, an early-20th century Greek Orthodox church and 11 mosques.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html|title=Cardiff, Llandaff & Roath chapels database|accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nostos.com/church/|title=The Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain|accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&businesstype=1&orgtype=&country=UK&city=Cardiff|title=Muslim Directory – Mosques in Cardiff|accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl] In the 2001 census 66.9% of Cardiff's population described itself as Christian, a percentage point below the Welsh and UK averages.

The city's newest hospital, St. David's Hospital (built behind the former building) is located in the Canton area and provides services for the elderly and children. Cardiff Royal Infirmary is located on Newport Road, near the city centre. The majority of this hospital was closed in 1999 but with the West Wing remaining open for clinic services, genitourinary medicine and rehabilitation treatment.

==Economy==

As the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy. Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city’s workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&_Local_Area_GDP.pdf|title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product|last=Clifton-Fearnside|first=Alex|coauthors=Adam Douglas|date=14 May 2002|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=18 April 2008|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl|title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales|date=5 December 2007|publisher=Statistics for Wales|accessdate=18 April 2008[/tpl]
Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by packhorse from Merthyr Tydfil. This was first achieved by the construction of a [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm|title=The Glamorganshire Canal|accessdate=19 April 2008[/tpl] Eventually the Taff Vale Railway replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.
At its peak, Cardiff's port area, known as Tiger Bay, became the busiest port in the world and—for some time—the world's most important coal port.[tpl]cite news |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |title = Cardiff's millennium makeover, Cardiff – Travel – The Guardian |accessdate =2 June 2010 |date = 9 June 2009 |publisher = The Guardian |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |title = BBC News – Wales – Capital claims – A city's struggle |accessdate =2 June 2010 |date = 22 April 2003 |publisher = BBC News[/tpl] In the years leading up to the First World War, more than 10 million tonnes of coal was exported annually from Cardiff Docks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50|title=Cardiff – Coal and Shipping Metropolis of the World|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=19 April 2008[/tpl] In 1907, Cardiff's Coal Exchange was the first host to a business deal for a million pounds Sterling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html|title=Why Did Cardiff Grow?|publisher=Glamorgan record Office|accessdate=19 April 2008[/tpl] After a period of decline, Cardiff's port has started to grow again – over 3 million tonnes of cargo passed through the docks in 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7414502.stm|title=Ports' resurgence as imports grow|date=22 May 2008|publisher=BBC News Wales|accessdate=28 May 2008[/tpl]

Cardiff is the major transport hub in Wales and is the focus for many arterial road and rail routes that connect the city with the rest of Wales, and with England.

===Rail===

Cardiff Central railway station is the largest railway station in Wales with seven platforms, through which over 10 million passengers a year pass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529|title=Station usage|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation|accessdate=13 October 2008[/tpl] It provides direct services to nearby Bridgend and Newport, long distance 'Cross-Wales' services to Wrexham and Holyhead, and other major cities such as Birmingham, London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

It is located at the eastern end of the city centre, and also provides services to Cardiff Bay.
Cardiff has a suburban rail system known as Valley Lines, which is operated by Arriva Trains Wales. There are eight lines which serve 20 stations in the city, 26 in the wider urban area (including Taffs Well, Penarth and Dinas Powys) and more than 60 in the South Wales valleys and the Vale of Glamorgan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=4776|title=Network Map – Valleys & Cardiff local routes|publisher=Arriva Trains Wales|accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl]

===Air===

Domestic and international air links to Cardiff and South & West Wales are provided from Cardiff Airport (CWL), the only international airport in Wales.

There are regular bus services linking the airport with the Cardiff Central Bus Station as well as a train service from Rhoose Cardiff International Airport railway station to Cardiff Central.

===Road and bus===

The M4 is the principal motorway in the region that connects Cardiff with Swansea to the west, and Newport and London to the east. Cardiff is served by three junctions of the M4, plus A48(M), which leads onto the M4. The A470 is another major road within the city that provides an important link to the north with the Heads of the Valleys road, mid and north Wales. The A4232 (also known as the Peripheral Distributor Road or PDR) when completed, will form part of the Cardiff ring-road system along with the M4 motorway between junctions 30 and 33.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pberry.plus.com/ukroads/ring_roads/|publisher=Paul Berry|title=Ring Roads|accessdate=8 March 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109114828/http://www.pberry.plus.com/ukroads/ring_roads/| archivedate = 9 November 2007[/tpl]
Cardiff has a comprehensive bus network, with municipal bus company Cardiff Bus providing the vast majority of routes in the city and to Newport, Barry and Cardiff International Airport, its hub is Cardiff Central Bus Station. National Express and Megabus provides direct services to major cities such as Swansea, London, Newcastle upon Tyne and Manchester

===Cycle===

The Taff Trail is a walking and cycle path running for [tpl]convert|55|mi|km|1[/tpl] between Cardiff Bay and Brecon in the Brecon Beacons National Park. It runs through Bute Park, Sophia Gardens and many other green areas within Cardiff. It is possible to cycle the entire distance of the Trail almost completely off-road, as it largely follows the River Taff and many of the old disused railways of the Glamorganshire valleys. On Sundays in summer the Beacons Bike Bus enables cyclists to take their bikes into the Beacons and then ride back to Cardiff along the Trail.

==Water==

The Aquabus runs every hour between the city centre (Taff Mead Embankment) and Cardiff Bay (Mermaid Quay), and between Cardiff Bay and Penarth (Cardiff Bay barrage). Throughout the year Cardiff Waterbus
sail between the Pierhead on Cardiff's Waterfront and the Penarth end of the Cardiff Bay Barrage with short sightseeing cruises. Between March and October boats also depart from Cardiff Bay to take visitors to Flat Holm Island. The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral sail from Britannia Quay (in Roath Basin) to various destinations in the Bristol Channel.

The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area, with it being possible to dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit local number.
Prior to the Big Number Change on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222 (with 0222 preceding this, prior to May 1995). There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, despite the existence of newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.

==Landmarks and attractions==

Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the Millennium Stadium, Pierhead Building the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd, the home of the National Assembly for Wales. Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, St David's Hall, Llandaff Cathedral and the Wales Millennium Centre.
Cardiff Castle is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the city centre. The National History Museum at St Fagans in Cardiff is a large open air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in Cathays Park comprises a collection of Edwardian buildings such as the City Hall, National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff Crown Court, and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings surround a small green space containing the Welsh National War Memorial and a number of other smaller memorials.
In addition to Cardiff Castle, Castell Coch (Red Castle) is located in Tongwynlais, in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian folly designed by William Burges for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by Ifor Bach, a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.

Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of castles of any city in the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html|title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides – Cardiff|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=19 April 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html| archivedate = 5 April 2008[/tpl] As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, the remains of Twmpath Castle,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html|title=Twmpath Castle|year=2002|accessdate=21 March 2008[/tpl] the Llandaff Bishop's Palace and Saint Fagans Castle are still in existence, whilst the site of Treoda (or Whitchurch Castle) has now been built over.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html|title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch|date=8 October 2007|accessdate=28 December 2007[/tpl]
