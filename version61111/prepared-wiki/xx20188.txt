Instead, Lexington has two beltways: inner New Circle Road (KY 4) and outer Man o' War Boulevard (southern semi-circle), then numerous arterial highways/U.S. routes radiate from downtown to the surrounding suburbs and small towns.
Lexington suffers considerable traffic congestion for a city of its size due to the lack of freeways, the proximity of the University of Kentucky to downtown, and the substantial number of commuters from outlying towns. For traffic relief on northern New Circle Road, Citation Boulevard is planned[tpl]cite news|last=Aretakis|first=Rachel|title=Citation Boulevard extension begins|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2013/07/07/2707027/construction-underway-on-citation.html|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=Herald-Leader|date=August 7, 2013[/tpl] to connect Leestown Road and Russell Cave Road.
