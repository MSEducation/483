CATEGORIES: Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics

Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics was the first appearance of the sport as an official medal event.  The tournament was played between 7 August and 14 August 1936 in Berlin, Germany.  23 nations entered the competition, making basketball the largest tournament of the team sports. 
The International Basketball Federation, which is the governing body of international basketball, used the 1936 tournament to experiment with outdoor basketball.  Lawn tennis courts were used for the competition.  This caused problems when the weather was adverse, especially during the final game.
The medals were awarded by James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.  All went to North American teams.

Due to the quagmire, the teams could not dribble and the score was held to a minimum. High scorer in the game was Joe Fortenberry for the United States with 7 points. In addition, there were no seats for spectators and the nearly 1,000 in attendance had to stand in the rain throughout the entire game.
