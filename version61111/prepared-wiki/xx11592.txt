Victoria Bitter is a lager produced by Carlton & United Breweries, a subsidiary of Foster's Group in Melbourne, Victoria. It was first brewed by renowned Melbourne brewers Thomas C. Moore and Henry F. Baxter in the early 1900s. It is one of the highest selling beers in Australia.

==History==

The origins of Victoria Bitter date back to Victoria Brewery founder Thomas C. Moore, who developed the recipe in the early 1900s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,15106634-28957,00.html|title=An oldie coldie|publisher=Herald Sun|date=28 April 2005|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The beer began to gain wide popularity in the mid 1960s with an innovative television advertising campaign featuring a very similar recording of the theme from the film The Magnificent Seven, images of working-class Australians at work and play, and a voice-over by notable Australian actor John Meillon. The campaign was used until quite recently. Paul Hester, late drummer of Crowded House, once appeared in a VB advert.
Like most Australian Lagers, VB is made using a wortstream brewing process, and uses a portion of cane sugar to thin out the body of the beer.
Currently one third of the packaged beer sales in Australia are of VB.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] It is available in 375 ml cans ("tinnies"), short-necked 375 ml bottles ("stubbies"), 750 ml bottles ("Long Necks", "King Browns" or "Tallies") and "Twisties", "Throwies", "Throwdowns" or "Grenades" (250 ml bottles in the State of New South Wales). As of 2005 VB also comes in 500 ml tinnies ("Lunch Greens"), which are commonly drunk by trade workers on lunch, being just enough to quench their thirst and maintain maximum retention of their precious bodily fluids.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] It used to be available in the Northern Territory in a 1 litre tinnie nicknamed a 'Killer can' (Kilo can). As with all packaged beer sold in Australia it was for many years only available in 750 ml or 26 2/3 fl oz (1/6 imperial gallon) bottles, until the introduction of "stubbies" and smaller cans.
On the 6th of July, 2011, VB released the product packaged in limited edition, 1958 heritage cans. The packaging had the original artwork of the 1958 VB product, but also included a standard ring pull on each can, something which was lacking on the original can. The alcohol strength remained at the standard 4.6%, as with normal packaged VB cans.VB launches limited edition 1958 heritage can - Campaign Brief, 06 July 2011
On the 3rd of September, 2012, CUB announced VB would be going back to its original recipe of 4.9% and its original packaging. CUB had received many complaints since it was changed to 4.6% in 2009, and the beer had lost a large amount of market share. The updated VBs began rolling out in late October 2012.Aussie beer favourite victoria bitter back to full strength

==Brand==

Despite its name, Victoria Bitter is a standard commercial lager rather than a bitter. Since late 2012, Victoria Bitter has been sold at a strength of 4.9% ABV after an interim period of producing the same product at an ABV of 4.6% (equal to virtually every other major Australian lager).Victoria Bitter to be sold with less alcohol - news.com.au, 1 July 2009 The VB sold commercially in New Zealand is both 4.9% and 4.6% available in 375ml quantities in either bottles or cans.
