Chris Donald (born 25 April 1960 in Newcastle, England) is the founder of, and one of the principal contributors to, the British comic magazine Viz. He attended West Jesmond Primary School,http://www.communitychannel.org/content/view/2666 and then Heaton Comprehensive School, where he failed his A-levels, and in 1978 he began work as a clerical officer at the DHSS central office in Longbenton, Newcastle.
Chris, together with his brother Simon and a schoolfriend Jim Brownlow, set-up Viz in December 1979 from a bedroom in Newcastle. He was editor (or head of the "editorial cabinet") for many years but retired from day-to-day duties in 1999, and now only contributes occasional cartoons. He has since written a personal history of Viz magazine entitled Rude Kids.
In an interview on Channel 4 News, Chris Donald paid tribute to Spike Milligan on his death. He cited him and Monty Python as the two major influences on the comic.
