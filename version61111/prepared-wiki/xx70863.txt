The Burmese language ([tpl]lang-my|မြန်မာဘာသာ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|mjəmà bàðà|pron[/tpl][tpl]my|မြန်မာ[/tpl] mranma can be pronounced [tpl]IPA-my|mjəmà|[/tpl] or, more colloquially, [tpl]my|ဗမာ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|bəmà|[/tpl]. MLCTS: myanma bhasa) is the official language of Burma. Burmese is the native language of the Bamar and related sub-ethnic groups of the Bamar, as well as that of some ethnic minorities in Burma like the Mon.
Burmese is spoken by 32 million as a first language and as a second language by 10 million, particularly ethnic minorities in Burma and those in neighboring countries. (Although the Constitution of Burma officially recognizes the English name of the language as the Myanmar language,Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2008), Chapter XV, Provision 450 most English speakers continue to refer to the language as Burmese.)
Burmese is a tonal, pitch-register, and syllable-timed language,[tpl]sfn|Chang|2003[/tpl] largely monosyllabic and analytic language, with a subject–object–verb word order. It is a member of the Tibeto-Burman language family, which is a subfamily of the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. The language uses the Burmese script, derived from the Old Mon script and ultimately from the Brāhmī script.

==Classification==

Burmese is a Sino-Tibetan language belonging to the Southern Burmish branch of the Tibeto-Burman languages. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the Tibeto-Burman languages and among the Sino-Tibetan languages, the second most widely spoken, after the Sinitic languages.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147[/tpl] Burmese was the fourth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after Chinese, Tibetan, and Tangut.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147[/tpl]

===Dialects===

The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River valley, use a number of largely uniform dialects, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the  peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include:
Arakanese (Rakhine) in Rakhine State and Marma in Bangladesh are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese, sometimes as a separate language.
Despite vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among Burmese dialects, as for the most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters and the writing system. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.

====Irrawaddy River valley====

The standard dialect of Burmese (the Mandalay-Yangon dialect continuum) comes from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from Upper Burma (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called anya tha [tpl]my|အညာသား[/tpl], and speakers from Lower Burma (e.g., Yangon dialect), called auk tha [tpl]my|အောက်သား[/tpl], occur in vocabulary choice, not in pronunciation. Minor pronunciation differences do exist within the Irrawaddy River valley. For instance, for the term [tpl]my|ဆွမ်း[/tpl] "food offering a monk", Lower Burmese speakers use [tpl]IPA|sʰʊ́ɴ[/tpl] instead of [tpl]IPA|sʰwáɴ[/tpl], which is used in Upper Burma.
The standard dialect is represented by the Yangon dialect, because of the city's media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its use of the first person pronoun [tpl]my|ကျွန်တော်[/tpl] kya.nau [tpl]IPA-my|tɕənɔ|[/tpl] for both males and females, whereas in Yangon, the said pronoun is used only by males, while [tpl]my|ကျွန်မ[/tpl] kya.ma. [tpl]IPA-my|tɕəma̰|[/tpl] is used by females. Moreover, with regard to kinship terminology, Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not.
Spoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers,[tpl]sfn|Barron|Okell|Yin|VanBik|2007|p=16-17[/tpl] particularly those living in the Irrawaddy River valley, who all use variants of Standard Burmese. The first major reason for the uniformity is the traditional Burmese Buddhist monastic education system, which encouraged education and uniformity in language throughout the Upper Irrawaddy valley, the traditional homeland of the Burmans.According to the 1891 British census conducted five years after the annexation of the entire country, Konbaung Burma had an "unusually high male literacy" rate where 62.5% of age 25 and over in Upper Burma could read and write. The figure would have been much higher if non-Burmans (e.g., Chins, Kachins, etc.) were excluded. For the whole country, the literacy rate was 49% for males and 5.5% for females.[tpl]sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=189[/tpl] Secondly, the migration of Burmese speakers (of Burman descent) to Lower Burma is relatively recent. As late as the mid-1700s, Mon was the principal language of Lower Burma. After the Burmese-speaking Konbaung dynasty's victory over the Mon-speaking Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1757, the shift to Burmese language began throughout Lower Burma. By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in the region identified themselves as Burman (and as such, Burmese sepakers), due the influx of Burmese speakers from Upper Burma, assimilation, and intermarriage.[tpl]sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=202-206[/tpl] In the British colonial era, British incentives, particularly geared toward rice production, as well as political instability in Upper Burma accelerated this migration.

====Outside the Irrawaddy basin====

More distinctive non-standard dialects emerge as one moves farther away from the Irrawaddy River valley toward peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include Yaw, Palaw, Merguese (Myeik), Tavoyan (Dawei), Intha, Danu, Arakanese (Rakhine) and Marma. Despite substantial vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among most Burmese dialects.
The most pronounced feature of the Arakanese (Rakhine) is its retention of the [tpl]IPA-my|ɹ|[/tpl] sound, which has become a [tpl]IPA-my|j|[/tpl] sound in standard Burmese. Also, Arakanese features a variety of vowel differences, including the merger of the [tpl]my|ဧ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|e|[/tpl] and [tpl]my|ဣ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|i|[/tpl] vowels. Hence, a word like "blood" [tpl]my|သွေး[/tpl] is pronounced [tpl]IPA-my|θwé|[/tpl] in standard Burmese and [tpl]IPA-my|θwí|[/tpl] in Arakanese.
Dialects in Tanintharyi Region, including Palaw, Merguese (Myeik), Tavoyan (Dawei), are especially conservative in comparison to Standard Burmese. The Dawei and Intha dialects have preserved the [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl] medial, which is only found in Old Burmese inscriptions. They also often reduce the intensity of the glottal stop. Merguese has 250,000 speakers while Tavoyan (Dawei) has 400,000 speakers.[tpl]sfn|Lewis|2009[/tpl][tpl]e16|mya[/tpl]

==Registers==

Burmese is a diglossic language with two distinguishable registers (or diglossic varieties), used in various settings:[tpl]sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99[/tpl]
The literary form of Burmese retains archaic and conservative grammatical structures and modifiers (including particles, markers and pronouns) no longer used in the colloquial form.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99[/tpl] In most cases, the corresponding grammatical markers in the literary and spoken forms are totally unrelated to each other.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|1996|p=746[/tpl] Examples of this phenomenon include the following lexical items:
In the mid-1960s, some Burmese writers, who asserted that the vernacular, spoken form ought to be used, spearheaded efforts to abandon the literary form, which was historically the preferred form of written Burmese, as "the spoken style lacks gravity, authority, dignity."[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989|p=5–21[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Aung Bala|1981|p=81–99[/tpl] Some Burmese linguists such as Minn Latt, a Czech academic, proposed moving away from high form of Burmese altogether.[tpl]sfn|Aung Zaw|2010|p=2[/tpl] Although the literary form is still heavily utilized in written contexts (literary and scholarly works, radio news broadcasts, and novels), the recent trend has been to accommodate the spoken form in informal written contexts.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl] Nowadays, television news broadcasts, comics, and commercial publications use the spoken form, or a combination of the both spoken and a simpler, less ornate formal forms.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99[/tpl]
The following sample sentence reveals that differences between literary and spoken Burmese mostly occur in grammatical particles:
Spoken Burmese has various politeness levels and honorifics that take the speaker's status and age in relation to the audience into account. The particle [tpl]my|ပါ[/tpl] pa is frequently used after a verb to express politeness.[tpl]sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=39[/tpl] Moreover, Burmese pronouns relay varying degrees of deference or respect.[tpl]sfn|Taw Sein Ko|1924|p=68-70[/tpl] In many instances, polite speech (e.g., addressing teachers, officials, or elders) employs feudal-era third person pronouns or kinship terms in lieu of first and second person pronouns.[tpl]sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=48-49[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=26[/tpl] Furthermore, with regard to vocabulary choice, spoken Burmese clearly distinguishes the Buddhist clergy (monks) from the laity (householders), especially when speaking to or about Buddhist monks.[tpl]sfn|Houtman|1990|p=135-136[/tpl] The following are examples of varying vocabulary used for Buddhist clergy and for laity :

==Vocabulary==

Burmese vocabulary is primarily monosyllabic and of Tibeto-Burman stock. Nonetheless, many words, especially loanwords from Indo-European languages like English, are polysyllabic, and others, from Mon, a Mon-Khmer language, are disyllabic.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|2013[/tpl] Burmese loanwords are overwhelmingly in the form of nouns.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|2013[/tpl]
Historically, Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, has been of profound influence to the Burmese language, especially in enriching the Burmese vocabulary. Burmese has readily adopted words of Pali origin because of phonotactic similarities between two languages, alongside the fact that the Burmese script can reproduce Pali spellings with complete accuracy.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=64[/tpl] Pali loanwords are often related to religion, government, arts, and science.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=64[/tpl]
Burmese loanwords from Pali primarily take four forms:
Burmese has also adapted a great deal of words from the Mon language, traditionally spoken by the Mon people, who until recently, formed the majority in Lower Burma. Most Mon loanwords are so well assimilated that they are not distinguished as loanwords because they were more often borrowed from speech rather than writing, since Burmese and Mon were used interchangeably for several centuries in pre-colonial Burma.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999[/tpl] Mon loans are often related to flora, fauna, administration, textiles, foods, boats, crafts, architecture, and music.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl]
English, as a natural consequence of British colonization of Burma, has been a major source of vocabulary, especially with regard to technology, measurements and modern institutions. English loanwords tend to take one of three forms:
To a lesser extent, Burmese has also imported words from Sanskrit (religion), Hindi (food, administration, and shipping), and Chinese (games and food).[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl] Burmese has also imported a handful of words from other European languages such as Portuguese.
Here is a sample of loan words found in Burmese:
Since the end of British rule, the Burmese government has attempted to limit usage of Western loans (especially from English) by coining new words (neologisms). For instance, for the word "television," Burmese publications are mandated to use the term [tpl]my|ရုပ်မြင်သံကြား[/tpl] (lit. "see picture, hear sound") in lieu of [tpl]my|တယ်လီဗီးရှင်[/tpl], a direct English transliteration.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=68[/tpl] Another example is the word "vehicle", which is officially [tpl]my|ယာဉ်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|jɪ̀ɴ|[/tpl] (derived from Pali) but [tpl]my|ကား[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|ká|[/tpl] (from English "car") in spoken Burmese. Some previously common English loanwords have fallen out of usage with the adoption of neologisms. An example is the word "university", formerly [tpl]my|ယူနီဗာစတီ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|jùnìbàsətì|[/tpl], from English "university", now [tpl]my|တက္ကသိုလ်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|teʔkəðò|[/tpl], a Pali-derived neologism recently created by the Burmese government and derived from the Pali spelling of Taxila ([tpl]my|တက္ကသီလ[/tpl] Takkasila), an ancient university town in modern-day Pakistan.[tpl]sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=68[/tpl]
Some words in Burmese may have many synonyms, each having certain usages, such as formal, literary, colloquial, and poetic. One example is the word "moon", which can be [tpl]my|လ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|la̰[/tpl] Tibeto-Burman), [tpl]my|စန္ဒာ/စန်း[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|sàɴdà]/[sáɴ|[/tpl] (Pali derivatives of chanda), or [tpl]my|သော်တာ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|θɔ̀ dà|[/tpl] (Sanskrit).[tpl]sfn |MLC|1993[/tpl]

==Phonology==

The transcriptions in this section use the International Phonetic Alphabet.

===Consonants===

The consonants of Burmese are as follows:
Burmese exhibits two distinct types of voicing sandhi, which occurs in the consonant phones:

In the first type, the initial consonant of the second syllable becomes voiced:[tpl]sfn|Nishi|30 October 1998|p=253-260[/tpl]
In the second type, the initial consonants of both syllables become voiced:[tpl]sfn|Nishi|30 October 1998|p=253-260[/tpl]
In some compound works, the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/dʑ/[/tpl], when following the nasalized final [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl], can shift to a [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl] sound: 
The phonemes [tpl]IPA|/p, pʰ, b, t, tʰ, d/[/tpl], when following the nasalized final [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl], can become [tpl]IPA|/m/[/tpl] in compound words:
The placeless nasal [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl] is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel or as a nasal homorganic to the following consonant; thus [tpl]IPA|/mòʊɴdáɪɴ/[/tpl] "storm" is pronounced [tpl]IPA-my|mõ̀ũndã́ĩ|[/tpl].
In many Burmese verbs, pre-aspiration and post-aspiration distinguishes the causative and non-causative forms of verbs, whereby the aspirated initial consonant indicates active voice or a transitive verb, while an unaspirated initial consonant indicates passive voice or an intransitive verb:[tpl]sfn|Yanson|2012|p=17[/tpl]

===Vowels===

The vowels of Burmese are:
The monophthongs [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|/ɔ/[/tpl] occur only in open syllables (those without a syllable coda); the diphthongs [tpl]IPA|/ei/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ou/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ai/[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|/au/[/tpl] occur only in closed syllables (those with a syllable coda). [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl] only occurs in a minor syllable, and is the only vowel that is permitted in a minor syllable (see below).
The close vowels [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl] and the close portions of the diphthongs are slightly centered to [tpl]IPA|ɪ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ʊ[/tpl] in closed syllables, i.e. before [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ʔ/[/tpl]. Thus [tpl]lang|my|နှစ်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/n̥iʔ/[/tpl] "two" is phonetically [tpl]IPA|n̥ɪʔ[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|my|ကြောင်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/tɕàuɴ/[/tpl] "cat" is phonetically [tpl]IPA|tɕàʊɴ[/tpl].

===Tones===

Burmese is a tonal language, which means phonemic contrasts can be made on the basis of the tone of a vowel. In Burmese, these contrasts involve not only pitch, but also phonation, intensity (loudness), duration, and vowel quality. However, some linguists consider Burmese a pitch-register language like Shanghainese.[tpl]sfn|Jones|1986|p=135-136[/tpl]
There are four contrastive tones in Burmese. In the following table, the tones are shown marked on the vowel [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] as an example.
For example, the following words are distinguished from each other only on the basis of tone:
In syllables ending with [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl], the checked tone is excluded:
In spoken Burmese, some linguists classify two real tones (there are four nominal tones transcribed in written Burmese), "high" (applied to words that terminate with a stop or check, high-rising pitch) and "ordinary" (unchecked and non-glottal words, with falling or lower pitch), with those tones encompassing a variety of pitches.[tpl]sfn|Taylor|1920|p=91–106[/tpl] The "ordinary" tone consists of a range of pitches. Linguist L. F. Taylor concluded that "conversational rhythm and euphonic intonation possess importance" not found in related tonal languages and that "its tonal system is now in an advanced state of decay."[tpl]sfn|Taylor|1920[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Benedict|1948|p=184–191[/tpl]

===Syllable structure===

The syllable structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which is to say the onset consists of a consonant optionally followed by a glide, and the rime consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong with a consonant. The only consonants that can stand in the coda are [tpl]IPA|/ʔ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɴ/[/tpl]. Some representative words are:
A minor syllable has some restrictions:
Some examples of words containing minor syllables:

==Alphabet==

The Burmese alphabet consists of 33 letters and 12 vowels, and is written from left to right. It requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability. Characterized by its circular letters and diacritics, the script is an abugida, with all letters having an inherent vowel [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] a. [tpl]IPA-my|a̰|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-my|ə|[/tpl]. The consonants are arranged into six consonant groups (called [tpl]my|ဝဂ်[/tpl] based on articulation, like other Brahmi scripts. Tone markings and vowel modifications are written as diacritics placed to the left, right, top, and bottom of letters.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl]
The development of the script followed that of the language, which is generally divided into Old Burmese, Middle Burmese and modern Burmese. Old Burmese dates from the 11th to the 16th century (Pagan and Ava dynasties); Middle Burmese from the 16th to the 18th century (Toungoo to early Konbaung dynasties); modern Burmese from the mid-18th century to the present. Orthographic changes followed shifts in phonology (such as the merging of the [tpl]IPA|-l-[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|-ɹ-[/tpl] medials) rather than transformations in Burmese grammatical structure and phonology, which has not changed much from Old Burmese to modern Burmese.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl] For example, during the Pagan era, the medial [tpl]IPA|-l-[/tpl] [tpl]my|္လ[/tpl] was transcribed in writing, which has been replaced by medials [tpl]IPA|-j-[/tpl] [tpl]my|ျ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|-ɹ-[/tpl] [tpl]my|ြ[/tpl] in modern Burmese (e.g. "school" in old Burmese [tpl]my|က္လောင်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|klɔŋ|[/tpl] → [tpl]my|ကျောင်း[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|tɕáʊɴ|[/tpl] in modern Burmese).[tpl]sfn|Khin Min|1987[/tpl] Likewise written Burmese has preserved all nasalized finals [tpl]IPA|-m, -ŋ[/tpl], which have merged to [tpl]IPA|-ɴ[/tpl] in spoken Burmese. (The exception is [tpl]IPA|-ɲ[/tpl], which, in spoken Burmese, can be one of many open vowels [tpl]IPA|e, ɛ[/tpl]. Likewise, other consonantal finals [tpl]IPA|-p, -t, -k[/tpl] have been reduced to [tpl]IPA|-ʔ[/tpl]. Similar mergers are seen in other Sino-Tibetan languages like Shanghainese, and to a lesser extent, Cantonese.)
Written Burmese dates to the early Pagan period. The script was developed from either the Mon script in 1058[tpl]sfn|Harvey|1925|p=307[/tpl] or the Pyu script in the 10th century.[tpl]sfn|Aung-Thwin|2005|p=167–178, 197–200[/tpl] (Both Mon and Pyu scripts are derivatives of the Brāhmī script.) Burmese orthography originally followed a square format but the cursive format took hold from the 17th century when popular writing led to the wider use of palm leaves and folded paper known as parabaiks [tpl]my|ပုရပိုက်[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=136[/tpl] Much of the orthography in written Burmese today can be traced back to Middle Burmese. Standardized tone marking was not achieved until the 18th century. From the 19th century onward, orthographers created spellers to reform Burmese spelling, because ambiguities arose over spelling sounds that had been merged.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl] During colonial rule under the British, Burmese spelling was standardized through dictionaries and spellers. The latest spelling authority, named the Myanma Salonpaung Thatpon Kyan [tpl]my|မြန်မာစာလုံးပေါင်းသတ်ပုံကျမ်း[/tpl], was compiled in 1978 at the request of the Burmese government.[tpl]sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989[/tpl]

==Grammar==

The basic word order of the Burmese language is subject-object-verb. Pronouns in Burmese vary according to the gender and status of the audience. Burmese is monosyllabic (i.e., every word is a root to which a particle but not another word may be prefixed).[tpl]sfn|Taw|1924|p=viii[/tpl] Sentence structure determines syntactical relations and verbs are not conjugated. Instead they have particles suffixed to them. For example, the verb "to eat," [tpl]my|စား[/tpl] ca: [tpl]IPA-my|sà|[/tpl] is itself unchanged when modified.

===Adjectives===

Burmese does not have adjectives per se. Rather, it has verbs that carry the meaning "to be X", where X is an English adjective. These verbs can modify a noun by means of the grammatical particle [tpl]my|တဲ့[/tpl] tai. [tpl]IPA-my|dɛ̰|[/tpl] in colloquial Burmese (literary form: [tpl]my|သော[/tpl] sau: [tpl]IPA-my|θɔ́|[/tpl], which is suffixed as follows:
Adjectives may also form a compound with the noun (e.g. [tpl]my|လူချော[/tpl] lu hkyau: [tpl]IPA-my|lù tɕʰɔ́|[/tpl] "person" + "be beautiful").
Comparatives are usually ordered: X + [tpl]my|ထက်ပို[/tpl] htak pui [tpl]IPA-my|tʰeʔ pò|[/tpl] + adjective, where X is the object being compared to. Superlatives are indicated with the prefix [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] a. [tpl]IPA-my|ʔə|[/tpl] + adjective + [tpl]my|ဆုံး[/tpl] hcum: [tpl]IPA-my|zóʊɴ|[/tpl].
Numerals follow the nouns they modify. Moreover, numerals follow several pronunciation rules that involve tone changes (low tone → creaky tone) and voicing shifts depending on the pronunciation of surrounding words. A more thorough explanation is found on Burmese numerals.

===Verbs===

The roots of Burmese verbs are almost always suffixed with at least one particle which conveys such information as tense, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these particles also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no particle is attached to a verb is in imperative commands. However, Burmese verbs are not conjugated in the same way as most European languages; the root of the Burmese verb always remains unchanged and does not have to agree with the subject in person, number or gender.
The most commonly used verb particles and their usage are shown below with an example verb root [tpl]my|စား[/tpl] ca: [tpl]IPA-my|sá|[/tpl] "to eat". Alone, the statement [tpl]my|စား[/tpl] is imperative.
The suffix [tpl]my|တယ်[/tpl] tai [tpl]IPA-my|dɛ̀|[/tpl] (literary form: [tpl]my|သည်[/tpl] sany [tpl]IPA-my|ðì|[/tpl] can be viewed as a particle marking the present tense and/or a factual statement:
The suffix [tpl]my|ခဲ့[/tpl] hkai. [tpl]IPA-my|ɡɛ̰|[/tpl] denotes that the action took place in the past. However, this particle is not always necessary to indicate the past tense such that it can convey the same information without it. But to emphasize that the action happened before another event that is also currently being discussed, the particle becomes imperative. Note that the suffix [tpl]my|တယ်[/tpl] tai [tpl]IPA-my|dɛ̀|[/tpl] in this case denotes a factual statement rather than the present tense:
The particle [tpl]my|နေ[/tpl] ne [tpl]IPA-my|nè|[/tpl] is used to denote an action in progression. It is equivalent to the English '-ing'"
This particle [tpl]my|ပြီ[/tpl] pri [tpl]IPA-my|bjì|[/tpl], which is used when an action that had been expected to be performed by the subject is now finally being performed,  has no equivalent in English. So in the above example, if someone had been expecting you to eat and you have finally started eating, the particle [tpl]my|ပြီ[/tpl] is used as follows:
The particle [tpl]my|မယ်[/tpl] mai [tpl]IPA-my|mɛ̀|[/tpl] (literary form: [tpl]my|မည်[/tpl] many [tpl]IPA-my|mjì|[/tpl] is used to indicate the future tense or an action which is yet to be performed:
The particle [tpl]my|တော့[/tpl] tau. [tpl]IPA-my|dɔ̰|[/tpl] is used when the action is about to be performed immediately when used in conjunction with [tpl]my|မယ်[/tpl]. Therefore it could be termed as the "immediate future tense particle".
When [tpl]my|တော့[/tpl] is used alone, however, it is imperative:
Verbs are negated by the particle [tpl]my|မ[/tpl] ma. [tpl]IPA-my|mə|[/tpl], which is prefixed to the verb. Generally speaking, other particles are suffixed to that verb, along with [tpl]my|မ[/tpl].
The verb suffix particle [tpl]my|နဲ့[/tpl] nai. [tpl]IPA-my|nɛ̰|[/tpl] (literary form: [tpl]my|နှင့်[/tpl] hnang. [tpl]IPA-my|n̥ɪ̰ɴ|[/tpl] indicates a command:
The verb suffix particle [tpl]my|ဘူး[/tpl] bhu: [tpl]IPA-my|bú|[/tpl] indicates a statement:

===Nouns===

Nouns in Burmese are pluralized by suffixing the particle [tpl]my|တွေ[/tpl] twe [tpl]IPA-my|dè|[/tpl] (or [tpl]IPA-my|tè|[/tpl] if the word ends in a glottal stop) in colloquial Burmese or [tpl]my|များ[/tpl] mya: [tpl]IPA-my|mjà|[/tpl] in formal Burmese. The particle [tpl]my|တို့[/tpl] (tou. [tpl]IPA-my|to̰|[/tpl], which indicates a group of persons or things, is also suffixed to the modified noun. An example is below:
Plural suffixes are not used when the noun is quantified with a number.
|+"five children"
|-
| [tpl]my|ကလေး[/tpl] || [tpl]my|၅[/tpl] || [tpl]my|ယောက်[/tpl]
|-
| hka.le: || nga: || yauk
|-
| [tpl]IPA|/kʰəlé[/tpl] || [tpl]IPA|ŋá[/tpl] || [tpl]IPA|jaʊʔ/[/tpl]
|-
| child || five || classifier
|-
|}
Although Burmese does not have grammatical gender (e.g. masculine or feminine nouns), a distinction is made between the sexes, especially in animals and plants, by means of suffix particles. Nouns are masculinized with the following particles: [tpl]my|ထီး[/tpl] hti: [tpl]IPA-my|tʰí|[/tpl], [tpl]my|ဖ[/tpl] hpa [tpl]IPA-my|pʰa̰|[/tpl], or [tpl]my|ဖို[/tpl] hpui [tpl]IPA-my|pʰò|[/tpl], depending on the noun, and feminized with the particle [tpl]my|မ[/tpl] ma. [tpl]IPA-my|ma̰|[/tpl]. Examples of usage are below:

====Numerical classifiers====

Like its neighboring languages such as Thai, Bengali, and Chinese, Burmese uses numerical classifiers (also called measure words) when nouns are counted or quantified. This approximately equates to English expressions such as "two slices of bread" or "a cup of coffee". Classifiers are required when counting nouns, so [tpl]my|ကလေး ၅[/tpl] hka.le: nga: [tpl]IPA-my|kʰəlé ŋà|[/tpl] (lit. "child five") is ungrammatical, because the measure word for people [tpl]my|ယောက်[/tpl] yauk [tpl]IPA-my|jaʊʔ|[/tpl] needs to suffix the numeral.
The standard word order of quantified words is: quantified noun + numeral adjective + classifier, except in round numbers (numbers that end in zero), in which the word order is flipped, where the quantified noun precedes the classifier: quantified noun + classifier + numeral adjective. The only exception to this rule is the number 10, which follows the standard word order.
Measurements of time, such as "hour," [tpl]my|နာရီ[/tpl] "day," [tpl]my|ရက်[/tpl] or "month," [tpl]my|လ[/tpl] do not require classifiers.
Below are some of the most commonly used classifiers in Burmese.

===Particles===

The Burmese language makes prominent usage of particles (called [tpl]my|ပစ္စည်း[/tpl] in Burmese), which are untranslatable words that are suffixed or prefixed to words to indicate level of respect, grammatical tense, or mood. According to the Myanmar–English Dictionary (1993), there are 449 particles in the Burmese language. For example, [tpl]my|စမ်း[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|sáɴ|[/tpl] is a grammatical particle used to indicate the imperative mood. While [tpl]my|လုပ်ပါ[/tpl] ("work" + particle indicating politeness) does not indicate the imperative, [tpl]my|လုပ်စမ်းပါ[/tpl] ("work" + particle indicating imperative mood + particle indicating politeness) does. Particles may be combined in some cases, especially those modifying verbs.
Some particles modify the word's part of speech. Among the most prominent of these is the particle [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|ə|[/tpl], which is prefixed to verbs and adjectives to form nouns or adverbs. For instance, the word [tpl]my|ဝင်[/tpl] means "to enter," but combined with [tpl]my|အ[/tpl], it means "entrance" [tpl]my|အဝင်[/tpl]. Also, in colloquial Burmese, there is a tendency to omit the second [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] in words that follow the pattern [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] + noun/adverb + [tpl]my|အ[/tpl] + noun/adverb, like [tpl]my|အဆောက်အအုံ[/tpl], which is pronounced [tpl]IPA-my|əsʰaʊʔ ú|[/tpl] and formally pronounced [tpl]IPA-my|əsʰaʊʔ əòʊɴ|[/tpl].

===Pronouns===

Subject pronouns begin sentences, though the subject is generally omitted in the imperative forms and in conversation. Grammatically speaking, subject marker particles [tpl]my|က[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|ɡa̰|[/tpl] in colloquial, [tpl]my|သည်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|θì|[/tpl] in formal) must be attached to the subject pronoun, although they are also generally omitted in conversation. Object pronouns must have an object marker particle [tpl]my|ကို[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|ɡò|[/tpl] in colloquial, [tpl]my|အား[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|á|[/tpl] in formal) attached immediately after the pronoun. Proper nouns are often substituted for pronouns. One's status in relation to the audience determines the pronouns used, with certain pronouns used for different audiences.
Polite pronouns are used to address elders, teachers and strangers, through the use of feudal-era third person pronouns in lieu of first and second person pronouns. In such situations, one refers to oneself in third person: [tpl]my|ကျွန်တော်[/tpl] kya. nau [tpl]IPA-my|tɕənɔ̀|[/tpl] for males, and [tpl]my|ကျွန်မ[/tpl] kya. ma. [tpl]IPA-my|tɕəma̰|[/tpl] for females, both meaning "your servant" and refer to the addressee as [tpl]my|မင်း[/tpl] min [tpl]IPA-my|mɪ́ɴ|[/tpl] "your highness", [tpl]my|ခင်ဗျား[/tpl] khang bya: [tpl]IPA-my|kʰəmjá|[/tpl] "master, lord"From Burmese [tpl]my|သခင်ဘုရား[/tpl], lit. "lord master" or [tpl]my|ရှင်[/tpl] hrang [tpl]IPA-my|ʃɪ̀ɴ|[/tpl] "ruler/master".[tpl]sfn|Bradley|1993|p=157–160[/tpl] So ingrained are these terms in the daily polite speech that people use them as the first and second person pronouns without giving a second thought to the root meaning of these pronouns.
When speaking to a person of the same status or of younger age, [tpl]my|ငါ[/tpl] nga [tpl]IPA-my|ŋà|[/tpl] "I/me" and [tpl]my|နင်[/tpl] nang [tpl]IPA-my|nɪ̀ɴ|[/tpl] "you" may be used, although most speakers choose to use third person pronouns.[tpl]sfn|Bradley|1993[/tpl] For example, an older person may use [tpl]my|ဒေါ်လေး[/tpl] dau le: [tpl]IPA-my|dɔ̀ lé|[/tpl] "aunt" or [tpl]my|ဦးလေး[/tpl] u: lei: [tpl]IPA-my|ʔú lé|[/tpl] "uncle" to refer to himself, while a younger person may use either သား sa: [tpl]IPA-my|θá|[/tpl] "son" or [tpl]my|သမီး[/tpl] sa.mi: [tpl]IPA-my|θəmí|[/tpl] "daughter".
The basic pronouns are:
Other pronouns are reserved for speaking with Buddhist monks. When speaking to a monk, pronouns like [tpl]my|ဘုန်းဘုန်း[/tpl] bhun: bhun: (from [tpl]my|ဘုန်းကြီး[/tpl] phun: kri: "monk"), [tpl]my|ဆရာတော်[/tpl] chara dau [tpl]IPA-my|sʰəjàdɔ̀|[/tpl] "royal teacher", and [tpl]my|အရှင်ဘုရား[/tpl] a.hrang bhu.ra: [tpl]IPA-my|ʔəʃɪ̀ɴ pʰəjá|[/tpl] "your lordship" are used depending on their status [tpl]my|ဝါ[/tpl] when referring to oneself, terms like [tpl]my|တပည့်တော်[/tpl] ta. pany. tau "royal disciple" or [tpl]my|ဒကာ[/tpl] da. ka [tpl]IPA-my|dəɡà|[/tpl], "donor" are used. When speaking to a monk, the following pronouns are used:
In colloquial Burmese, possessive pronouns are contracted when the root pronoun itself is low toned. This does not occur in literary Burmese, which uses ၏ [tpl]IPA-my|ḭ|[/tpl] as postpositional marker for possessive case instead of [tpl]my|ရဲ့[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|jɛ̰|[/tpl]. Examples include the following:
The contraction also occurs in some low toned nouns, making them possessive nouns (e.g. [tpl]my|အမေ့[/tpl] or [tpl]my|မြန်မာ့[/tpl], "mother's" and "Burma's" respectively).

====Family terms====

Minor pronunciation differences do exist within regions of Irrawaddy valley. For example, the pronunciation [tpl]IPA|sʰʊ́ɴ[/tpl] of [tpl]my|ဆွမ်း[/tpl] "food offering a monk" is preferred in Lower Burma, instead of [tpl]IPA|sʰwáɴ[/tpl], which is preferred in Upper Burma. However, the most obvious difference between Upper Burmese and Lower Burmese is that Upper Burmese speech still differentiates maternal and paternal sides of a family:
1 The youngest (paternal or maternal) aunt may be called [tpl]my|ထွေးလေး[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|lé[/tpl], and the youngest paternal uncle [tpl]my|ဘထွေး[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|dwé[/tpl].
In a testament to the power of media, the Yangon-based speech is gaining currency even in Upper Burma. Upper Burmese-specific usage, while historically and technically accurate, is increasingly viewed as countrified speech, or at best regional speech. In fact, some usages are already considered strictly regional Upper Burmese speech, and are likely dying out. For example:
In general, the male-centric names of old Burmese for familial terms have been replaced in standard Burmese with formerly female-centric terms, which are now used by both sexes. One holdover is the use of [tpl]my|ညီ[/tpl] (younger brother to a male) and [tpl]my|မောင်[/tpl] (younger brother to a female). Terms like [tpl]my|နောင်[/tpl] (elder brother to a male) and [tpl]my|နှမ[/tpl] (younger sister to a male) now are used in standard Burmese only as part of compound words like [tpl]my|ညီနောင်[/tpl] (brothers) or [tpl]my|မောင်နှမ[/tpl] (brother and sister).

===Reduplication===

Reduplication is prevalent in Burmese and is used to intensify or weaken adjectives' meanings. For example, [tpl]my|ချော[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|tɕʰɔ́|[/tpl] "beautiful" is reduplicated, the intensity of the adjective's meaning increases. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives with two syllables, such as [tpl]my|လှပ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|l̥a̰pa̰|[/tpl] "beautiful", when reduplicated ([tpl]my|လှပ[/tpl] → [tpl]my|လှလှပပ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|l̥a̰l̥a̰ pa̰pa̰|[/tpl]) become adverbs. This is also true of some Burmese verbs and nouns (e.g. [tpl]my|ခဏ[/tpl] "a moment" → [tpl]my|ခဏခဏ[/tpl] "frequently", which become adverbs when reduplicated.
Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, [tpl]my|ပြည်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|pjì|[/tpl] "country", but when reduplicated to [tpl]my|အပြည်ပြည်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|əpjì pjì|[/tpl] "country", means "many countries," as in [tpl]my|အပြည်ပြည်ဆိုင်ရာ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|əpjì pjì sʰàɪɴ jà|[/tpl] "international". Another example is [tpl]my|အမျိုး[/tpl], which means "a kind," but the reduplicated form [tpl]my|အမျိုးမျိုး[/tpl] means "multiple kinds."
A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate "one or the other":

==Romanization and transcription==

There is no official romanization system for Burmese. There have been attempts to make one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese sounds in the Latin script is complicated. There is a Pāli-based transcription system in existence, MLC Transcription System, which was devised by the Myanmar Language Commission (MLC). However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese and is based on the orthography rather than the phonology.
Several colloquial transcription systems have been proposed, but none is overwhelmingly preferred over others.
Transcription of Burmese is not standardized, as seen in the varying English transcriptions of Burmese names. For instance, a Burmese personal name like [tpl]my|ဝင်း[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|wɪ́ɴ|[/tpl] may be variously romanized as Win, Winn, Wyn, or Wynn, while [tpl]my|ခိုင်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|kʰàɪɴ|[/tpl] may be romanized as Khaing, Khine, or Khain.

==Computer fonts and standard keyboard layout==

The Burmese script can be entered from the standard QWERTY keyboard. The most popular Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not Unicode-compliant though a number of Unicode-compliant fonts are available. The national standard keyboard layout for Unicode-compliant font shown here. It is known as the Myanmar3 layout as it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the Myanmar NLP Research Center, has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.
