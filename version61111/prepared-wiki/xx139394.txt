The Tristan rock lobster, Jasus tristani, is a species of rock lobster endemic to the Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Vema Seamount, [tpl]convert|1680|km|mi[/tpl] north-east of Tristan.[tpl]cite book |url=http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/bis/lobsters.php?menuentry=soorten&id=133 |chapter=Jasus lalandii (Cape rock lobster) |title=Marine Lobsters of the World |author=Lipke Holthuis |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |year=1991 |pages=103–104 |isbn=92-5-103027-8[/tpl] It is very closely related to J. paulensis and these two may represent a single species.[tpl]cite journal |title=Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny of red and green rock lobsters (genus Jasus) |author=J.

Until 1950, the Tristan rock lobster was only fished for local consumption, but after that time, companies such as the South Atlantic Islands Development Corporation have  exploited the rock lobster population. Production peaked in the 1970s, with over 800 tonnes being collected in some years, but the industry has since waned, with less than 400 t being caught most years since 1992.[tpl]cite web |title=Global Capture Production 1950-2004 |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/TabLandArea?tb_ds=Capture&tb_mode=TABLE&tb_act=SELECT&tb_grp=COUNTRY |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization[/tpl]
