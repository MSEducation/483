Ricardo Elvio Pavoni Cúneo (born July 8, 1943 in Montevideo) is an Uruguayan former football defender who played the majority of his career for Club Atlético Independiente in the Argentine First Division.

==Career==

===Club===

Pavoni began his footballing career with the Montevidean club Defensor. Disillusioned with life as a footballer, he was on the point of abandoning the game completely and going to work in a casino as a croupier until he was convinced to play football for Independiente of Argentina. Undeniably one of Independiente's all-time stars, the left-sided full-back has been described as a natural leader and the perfect man-marker. He was also responsible for scoring 57 goals.
He arrived to Independiente at age 21 to replace Tomás Rolan, another Uruguayan who had suffered a serious injury. No-one could have predicted that Pavoni would make people forget about Rolan and would be part of one of the most memorable periods in the club's history. His first match for Independiente was on March 24, 1965 in a Copa Libertadores match. Independiente beat Boca Juniors by two goals to nil.
For twelve seasons (1965–1976) he was idolised by the Independiente fans. He was particularly remembered for his powering runs along the left wing, putting away free kicks with his left foot and for his frequent last-ditch efforts to clear the ball from the goal-line. He is considered by many to be the archetypal Uruguayan footballer.
Pavoni (affectively known as "el Chivo") won many honours during his career, including the Argentine first division championships three times, the Copa Libertadores 5 times, the Copa Interamericana on three occasions and one Copa Intercontinental. He was also a member of the Uruguayan squad that took part in the World Cup of 1974, in West Germany. Since retirement, he has been involved with the club as a trainer with reserve and youth teams. He has also been caretaker manager of the first team on several occasions.
