[[Dublin City Cup]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct association football cup competitions in the Republic of Ireland

The Dublin City Cup is a defunct Irish football tournament which was played for by all League of Ireland sides (and not just those from Dublin city as the name suggests).  It ran from 1933 and ran uninterrupted until 1973.  In season 1975/76 it was revived and played for by sides who did not reach the League of Ireland Cup quarter finals.  In 1983/84 it was revived again but only 8 teams were invited to play, the 6 Dublin sides (Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers, Shelbourne, St Patrick's Athletic, UCD and Home Farm) along with Drogheda United and Dundalk.
It was played in a variety of formats; from complete round robin series to straight knock out tournaments. From the 1951/52 season it was played as a knockout tournament. It was traditionally seen as the fourth most important competition for League of Ireland sides (after the League, FAI Cup and League of Ireland Shield or League Cup).
In 1956/57 and 1959/60 Shamrock Rovers beat Drumcondra in the final on corners after drawing the game itself.
