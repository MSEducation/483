The island plays an important role in Swedish folklore, where it is viewed as an evil and magical place. The name Blå Jungfrun was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island.

Oskarshamn yearly receives stone shipments from people, often with an accompanying letter of warning describing the misfortunes and disasters which happened to them after removing a stone.

The destruction led to efforts to protect the island. A donation from the Swedish entrepreneur Torsten Kreuger made it possible to acquire the island and stop the quarrying.
