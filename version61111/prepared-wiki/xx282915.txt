The Cactus Motor Lodge, now known as the Cactus RV Park, is a motel located along historic U.S. Route 66 in Tucumcari, New Mexico. I.E. and Edna Perry built the lodge in 1941. The motel included three wings of units forming a "U" shape and an office, the latter of which was a dance hall when the motel opened. In 1952, Norm Wegner purchased the motel; Wegner added an artificial stone exterior to the buildings and converted the dance hall to an office. After Route 66 was decommissioned, the motel lost much of its business, and by the 1990s it became an RV park; the motel units are currently unused. The motel's neon sign was restored in 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=2008: Cactus Motel Neon Sign Restored|url=http://www.rt66nm.org/new/preservation/cactus.html|publisher=New Mexico Route 66 Association|accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl]
The motel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 21, 2006.
