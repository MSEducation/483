[[Eta]]

CATEGORIES: Greek letters, Vowel letters

Eta (uppercase Η, lowercase η; [tpl]lang-el|Ήτα[/tpl] Ēta) is the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet. Originally denoting  a consonant /h/, its sound value in the classical Attic dialect of Ancient Greek was a long vowel [tpl]IPA|ɛː[/tpl], raised to [tpl]IPA-el|i|[/tpl] in medieval Greek, a process known as iotacism.
In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 8. It was derived from the Phoenician letter heth 20px. Letters that arose from Eta include the Latin H and the Cyrillic letter И.

==History==

===Consonant h===

The letter shape 'H' was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the sound /h/, a voiceless glottal fricative. In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets, which were based on the Euboean form of the Greek alphabet. This ultimately gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter H.

===Long e===

In the East Ionic dialect, however, the sound /h/ disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long vowel [tpl]IPA|/aː/[/tpl], which later merged in East Ionic with  [tpl]IPA|/ɛː/[/tpl] instead. In 403 BC, Athens took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the /h/ sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.
Other regional variants of the Greek alphabet (epichoric alphabets), in dialects that still preserved the sound /h/, employed various glyph shapes for consonantal Heta side by side with the new vocalic Eta for some time. One of them was a tack-like shape, looking like the left half of an H. This system was first used in the southern Italian colonies of Heracleia and Tarentum. When Greek orthography was codified by grammarians in the Hellenistic era, they used a diacritic symbol derived from this half-H shape to signal the presence of /h/, and added as its counterpart a reverse-shaped diacritic to denote absence of /h/. These symbols were the origin of the rough breathing and smooth breathing diacritics that became part of classical Greek orthography.Nick Nicholas (2003), "Greek /h/" The tack symbol has been reintroduced into modern scholarly representation of archaic Greek writing under the name of Heta.

===Iotacism===

During the time of post-classical Koiné Greek, the [tpl]IPA|/ɛː/[/tpl] sound represented by eta was raised and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels (iotacism). Thus in Modern Greek, Eta is pronounced [tpl]IPA|ˈita[/tpl] and represents the sound /i/ (a close front unrounded vowel). It shares this function with several other letters (ι, υ) and digraphs (ει, οι), which are all pronounced alike (see iotacism).

===Cyrillic script===

Eta was also borrowed with the sound value of i into the Cyrillic script, where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter И.

==Uses==

===Letter===

In Modern Greek the letter, pronounced [tpl]IPA-el|ˈita|[/tpl], represents a close front unrounded vowel, [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl]. In Classical Greek, it represented a long open-mid front unrounded vowel, [tpl]IPA|/ɛː/[/tpl].

===Symbol===

====Upper case====

The upper-case letter Η is used as a symbol in textual criticism for the Alexandrian text-type (from Hesychius, its once-supposed editor).
In chemistry, the letter H as symbol of enthalpy sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from ἐνθάλπος, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin H for 'heat'.

====Lower case====

The lower-case letter η is used as a symbol in:
