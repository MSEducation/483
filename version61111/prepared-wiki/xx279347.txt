WISE J0457-0207 is a nearby brown dwarf of spectral type T2, located in constellation [tpl]constel|Ori[/tpl] at approximately 12.5 pc (40.8 ly) from Earth.[tpl]r|Bihain2013[/tpl]

==History of observations==

WISE J0457-0207 was discovered by Bihain et al. by selection of sources with colours typical for T dwarfs from WISE All-Sky source catalogue and checking them for high proper motion using older surveys: 2MASS, DENIS, SDSS, SSS, DSS and UKIDSS. Three objects  among about ten candidates, including WISE J0457-0207, were selected for spectroscopic follow up with Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). October 8, 2012 Bihain et al. carried out follow up observations of WISE J0457-0207 with near-Infrared spectrograph LUCI 1 on LBT. June 25, 2013 Astronomy & Astrophysics received the discovery paper, which was accepted for publication 10 July 2013.[tpl]r|Bihain2013[/tpl]

==Distance==

Distance of WISE J0457-0207 was estimated by Bihain et al. using mean absolute magnitudes of single T1/T2 dwarfs, derived by Dupuy & Liu (2012) from trigonometric parallaxes:[tpl]r|Dupuy & Liu2012[/tpl] 12.5 ± 3.1 pc (40.8 ± 10.1 ly).[tpl]r|Bihain2013[/tpl]
