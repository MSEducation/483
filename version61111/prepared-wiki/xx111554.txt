The White Songbook is the fifth studio album by Joy Electric, and the first in the band's ongoing Legacy series. The album has a "book" theme, with the songs logically divided into "chapters," which are also songs. These chapters are "The White Songbook," "Hunter Green and Other Histories," "As Children We Are Growing Younger," and "A Frog in the Pond." The introductions to these chapters are relatively short instrumentals, with the exception of "The White Songbook," which is much longer and features spoken text.
The White Songbook marked the beginning of Joy Electric's practice of recording entire albums using only one synthesizer. The White Songbook was created entirely on the Roland System 100 synthesizer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
The White Songbook almost completely leaves the more recognizably "pop" sound of Joy Electric's previous works, both revealing a much more layered and complex sound, as well as a much more progressive musical style with many songs exceeding the five minute mark.
