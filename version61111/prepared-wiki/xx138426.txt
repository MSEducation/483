Emly or Emlybeg ([tpl]Irish place name|Imleach Iubhair|Border of lake of yews[/tpl]) is a village in South Tipperary, Ireland. It is a civil parish in the historical barony of Clanwilliam. It is also an Ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly.
It is situated on the R515 Regional Road which goes west from Tipperary Town to Abbeyfeale, County Limerick. Emly lies 14 km west of Tipperary town and had a population of 278 in the 2002 census (the parish has a population of about 1,000 as it includes the surrounding countryside). Emly gained national recognition in September, 2009 when the village won the prestigious Irish Tidy Towns Competition.

==Community==

In 2013, Emly came first in Ireland for the Energy Neighbourhoods competition. The community achieved a 37% reduction in home energy consumption. Just to put this into context, the average Irish community spends about €1,000,000 on home energy. Instead of making its way into the hands of international oil exporters, a 37% energy saving translates into a €370,000 annual saving for an Irish community. If all Irish homes made a 37% reduction, the country could become a leader in the environmental economy.

==History==

===Ancient times===

The yew tree references pre-Christian history of Emly. Emly is one of the oldest centres of Christianity in Ireland and pre-dates the coming to Ireland of the National Apostle, St. Patrick.  Up until the early Middle Ages Emly was the premier diocese in the south of Ireland. St. Ailbe is Patron Saint of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly.  Tradition tells us that he preached Christianity in Munster before the arrival of St. Patrick and he is also associated with the founding of a monastery at Emly which remained a Cathedral city until the 16th century. The Protestant cathedral functioned with a Chapter until the mid - 19th century when it was dismantled and its materials sold for construction purposes.
The site of Emly was in ancient times known as Medón Mairtine, as it was the capital of an Érainn people called the Mairtine. After they appear to vanish from the Irish landscape, the powerful Eóganachta are later found using the site for their chief church in early historical times.

===St. Ailbe's church===

The large Catholic St. Ailbe's church was built in the 1880s and replaced the older church (built early 19th century) which is now used as the village hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emly.ie/parish/index.htm|title=The Parish|publisher=Emly Parish Homepage|accessdate=2009-07-20[/tpl]

===Monastery===

Emly was the site of a monastery founded by Saint Ailbe,[tpl]cite book|last=D'Alton|first=John|title=The history of Ireland ... to the year 1245, with notices of the barony of Boyle |year=1845|pages=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KRYHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA77&dq=emly&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3|accessdate=2009-07-21[/tpl] which became famous for its school and was also the episcopal see of a Roman Catholic bishopric, but this has been merged in 1715 with the Archbishopric of Cashel, its former Metropolitan, hence also known under the name of Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. The name  persists in the Church of Ireland United Diocese of Limerick, Ardfert, Killaloe, Kilfenora, Clonfert, Kilmacduagh and Emly.
