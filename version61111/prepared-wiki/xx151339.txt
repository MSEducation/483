==Background==

Brooks commented on the album by saying:
"I'm proud, I'm excited, I'm nervous, and it feels good to be back in the game again. This is a very personal album. I only wrote six of the songs, but there are many that are so 'me' that people I work with every day thought I wrote them".http://www.planetgarth.com/albums/sevens.php
