==Club career==

===Real Madrid===

Born in Madrid, Núñez started his career with CD San Federico, before joining Tercera División side CD Las Rozas. In 2001 he moved to Real Madrid, his favourite club growing up.
Courtesy of manager Carlos Queiroz, Núñez was promoted to the first team for the 2003–04 season. On 2 September 2003, in his La Liga debut, he came on as a substitute for Javier Portillo 15 minutes from time in an away game against Villarreal CF and scored the 1–1 equalizer after just seven minutes;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2003/09/02/liga/1062536285.html|title=La cantera le da al Madrid un punto ante el Villarreal|trans_title=Cantera gives Madrid one point against Villarreal|publisher=El Mundo|language=Spanish|date=3 September 2003|accessdate=25 February 2014[/tpl] during the remainder of the campaign, however, in which the Merengues came up totally empty, he only amassed a further ten league appearances, all from the bench.

===Liverpool===

In August 2004 Núñez was transferred to Liverpool, becoming Rafael Benítez's second signing as club manager – after compatriot Josemi – as part of an exchange deal that saw Michael Owen go in the opposite direction for £8 million.Owen spreads his wings; UEFA.com, 17 August 2004 He injured his knee in his first day of training for his new club, and was out of action for three months; he made his Reds debut as a starter in a Premier League match against Portsmouth, a 1–1 home draw on 14 December.
Núñez scored his first and only goal for Liverpool in the 2–3 loss against Chelsea for the season's Football League Cup final,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/4279679.stm|title=Liverpool 2–3 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 February 2005|accessdate=25 November 2009[/tpl] therefore becoming the only player in the club's history to score his only goal for the team in a major cup final. In his only season, he also won a UEFA Champions League medal, as he was one of the substitutes in the final against A.C. Milan (although he did not play), appearing in five matches during the campaign, four as a reserve.

===Celta / Later years===
