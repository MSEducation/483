==History==

In 1900, Arthur H. Lowe of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, formed Lowe Manufacturing Company, and began the building of Huntsville's fifth textile mill. Lowe Mill opened in 1901 with 25,000 spindles that helped to turn locally-grown cotton into woven cloth.[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief Look at a Century of Lowe Mill|url=http://www.lowemill.net/about.php|publisher=Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment|accessdate=19 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/612eymZt3|archivedate=19 August 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl]  In 1902, Eastern Manufacturing Company built the final large mill in Huntsville, a weaving mill across from Lowe Mill. Lowe Mill and Eastern Manufacturing merged their companies and the two buildings in 1904. The spinning mill supplied yarns for the weaving mills, where the highest grade ginghams and shirtings were made to supply large clothing manufacturers throughout the nation.
In December 1932, Lowe Manufacturing declared bankruptcy, and the factory started back up again under Lowe Mills, Inc. in January 1933, with Donald Comer, head of Birmingham's Avondale Mills, as majority stock holder. In 1936, Lowe Mill changed hands again when Edwin Greene of New York became majority stock holder of the renamed Lowe Corporation. In March 1937, Lowe Corporation was dissolved and the plant was sold to Walter Laxson and became a cotton warehouse.
At the end of World War II, in December 1945, Nashville-based General Shoe Co. opened a shoe factory in Lowe Mill, employing up to 800 people. In 1959, General Shoe Co. became Genesco, Inc.  Many US soldiers in Vietnam wore boots made at Genesco's Huntsville factory.  In 1978, Genesco closed and Martin Industries turned Lowe Mill into a warehouse for residential and commercial heating systems.  In 1999, realtor Gene McLain bought Lowe Mill and then in 2001, sold it to Research Genetics founder, Jim Hudson, who is the current owner of Lowe Mill.[tpl]cite web|title=Historic Lowe Mill|url=http://www.tvaresearch.com/project_lowemill.html|publisher=Tennessee Valley Archaeological Research|accessdate=July 13, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I5emFbCG|archivedate=July 13, 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]  The mill currently houses Lowe Mill Arts & Entertainment, which provides art studio and exhibition space for over 100 artists.[tpl]cite news|last=Busdeker|first=Jon|title=Huntsville's Lowe Mill to add 30 first floor art studios by end of 2010|url=http://blog.al.com/entertainment-times/2010/07/huntsvilles_lowe_mill_to_add_3.html|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=The Huntsville Times|date=July 5, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I5gHTNJf|archivedate=July 13, 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]  The mill and surrounding neighborhood were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowman Wade|first=Bliss|title=Lowe Mill & Mill Village Historic District in Huntsville listed in the National Register|url=http://southhuntsville.waff.com/news/news/lowe-mill-mill-village-historic-district-huntsville-listed-national-register/56894|publisher=WAFF|accessdate=July 13, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I5Ydf6fv|archivedate=July 13, 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
