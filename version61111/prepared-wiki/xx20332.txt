Pseudotsuga [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|sj|uː|d|oʊ|ˈ|t|s|uː|ɡ|ə[/tpl]Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae. Common names include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, and Oregon pine. Pseudotsuga menziesii is widespread in western North America and is an important source of timber. The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged.[tpl]cite web|title=Flora of China: Pseudotsuga|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=127289|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Gymnosperm Database: Pseudotsuga|url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pseudotsuga.php|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl]  Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas-firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and even Sequoia. Because of their distinctive cones, Douglas-firs were finally placed in the new genus Pseudotsuga (meaning "false hemlock") by the French botanist Carrière in 1867.  The genus name has also been hyphenated as Pseudo-tsuga.

==Name==

The common name Douglas-fir honors David Douglas, the Scottish botanist who first introduced Pseudotsuga menziesii into cultivation at Scone Palace in 1827.Trust Walks: "Dunkeld and The Hermitage," a podcast by the National Trust for Scotland; 27 June 2009 Douglas is known for introducing many North American native conifers to Europe. The hyphen in the name indicates that Douglas-firs are not true firs, not being members of the genus Abies.[tpl]cite book|last=Little|first=E. L.|year=1953|title=Check List of native and naturalized trees of the United States (including Alaska)|id=USDA Agricultural Handbook 41|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|location=Washington D.C.[/tpl] Most dictionaries don't recognize this distinction, however, including Merriam-Webster and Webster's New World College Dictionary.

==Description==

Douglas-firs are medium-size to extremely large evergreen trees, [tpl]convert|20|-|120|m|-1[/tpl] tall (although only Coast Douglas-firs reach such great height).[tpl]cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3–4[/tpl] The leaves are flat, soft, linear, [tpl]convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1[/tpl] long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. The female cones are pendulous, with persistent scales (unlike true firs), and are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) bract that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).
The Coast Douglas-fir has attained heights of 393 feet (120 m). That was the estimated height of the tallest conifer ever well-documented, the Mineral Tree (Mineral, Washington), measured in 1924 by Dr. Richard E. McArdle,Forest Giants of the World Past and Present by Al Carder 1995, pg. 3-4. former chief of the U.S. Forest Service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/People/McArdle/McArdle.aspx |title=Richard McArdle Bio, USFS History, Forest History Society |publisher=Foresthistory.org |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl] The  volume of that tree was [tpl]convert|515|m3|cuft|-1[/tpl].

==Species and varieties==

By far the best-known is the very widespread and abundant North American species Pseudotsuga menziesii, a taxonomically complex species[tpl]cite journal|first=Peng|last=Li|coauthors=W. T. Adams|title=Rangewide patterns of allozyme variation in Douglas-fir|journal=Canad. J. Forest Res.|volume=19|pages=149–161|year=1989|doi=10.1139/x89-022|issue=2[/tpl] divided into two major varieties (treated as distinct species or subspecies by some botanists): coast Douglas-fir or "green Douglas-fir", on the Pacific coast; and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or "interior Douglas-fir", in the interior west of the continent.  According to some botanists, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir extends south into Mexico to include all Mexican Douglas-fir populations,[tpl]cite journal|last=Little|first=E.L.|title=The genus Pseudotsuga (Douglas-fir) in North America|journal=Leafl. Western Botany|year=1952|volume=6|pages=181–198[/tpl] whereas others have proposed multiple separate species in Mexico[tpl]cite journal|last=Flous|first=F.|title=Deux espèces nouvelles de Pseudotsuga Américains|journal=Bulletin de la Société d'histoire naturelle de Toulouse|year=1934|volume=66|pages=211–224[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Flous|first=F.|title=Diagnoses d'espèces et variétés nouvelles de Pseudotsuga Américains|journal=Bulletin de la Société d'histoire naturelle de Toulouse|year=1934|volume=66|pages=329–346[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Martínez|first=M.|title=Las Pseudotsugas de México|journal=Anales del Instituto de Biología|year=1949|volume=20|pages=129–184[/tpl] and multiple varieties in the United States.  Morphological and genetic evidence suggest that Mexican Douglas-fir should probably be considered a distinct variety within P. menziesii.[tpl]cite web|last=Earle|first=C.J.|title=The Gymosperm Database: Pseudotsuga lindleyana|url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pseudotsuga_lindleyana.php|accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Reyes-Hernández|first=VJ|coauthors=Vargas-Hernández JJ, López-Upton J, Vaquera-Huerta H|title=Phenotypic similarity among Mexican populations of Pseudotsuga Carr|journal=Agrociencia|year=2006|volume=40|issue=4|pages=545–556|url=http://www.colpos.mx/agrocien/Bimestral/2006/jul-ago/art-13.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gugger|first=Paul F.|coauthors=González-Rodríguez, Antonio, Rodríguez-Correa, Hernando, Sugita, Shinya, Cavender-Bares, Jeannine|title=Southward Pleistocene migration of Douglas-fir into Mexico: phylogeography, ecological niche modeling, and conservation of 'rear edge' populations|journal=New Phytologist|year=2011|volume=189|issue=4|pages=1185–1199|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03559.x|pmid=21118265|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~gugg0030/Gugger_etal2011%20NewPhyt.pdf[/tpl]
All of the other species are of restricted range and little-known outside of their respective native environments, where they are often rare and of scattered occurrence in mixed forests; all those have unfavorable conservation status.  The taxonomy of the Asian Douglas-firs continues to be disputed,[tpl]cite journal|last=Gernandt|first=D.S.|coauthors=Liston, A.|title=Internal transcribed spacer region evolution in Larix and Pseudotsuga (Pinaceae)|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=1999|volume=86|issue=5|pages=711–723|doi=10.2307/2656581[/tpl] but the most recent taxonomic treatment accepts four species: three Chinese and one Japanese.  The three Chinese species have been variously considered varieties of P. sinensis[tpl]cite book|last=Farjon|first=A.|title=Pinaceae: drawings and descriptions of the genera Abies, Cedrus, Pseudolarix, Keteleeria, Nothotsuga, Tsuga, Cathaya, Pseudotsuga, Larix and Picea|year=1990|publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books|location=Königstein[/tpl] or broken down into additional species and varieties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/splist.pl?10022 |title=GRIN Species Records of Pseudotsuga |work=Germplasm Resources Information Network |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl]  In the current treatment, the Chinese species P. sinensis is further subdivided into two varieties: var. sinensis and var. wilsoniana.

==Uses==

Douglas-fir wood is used for structural applications that are required to withstand high loads. It is used extensively in the construction industry. Other examples include its use for homebuilt aircraft such as the RJ.03 IBIS canard. Very often, these aircraft were designed to utilize Sitka spruce, which is becoming increasingly difficult to source in aviation quality grades. Oregon pine is also used in boat building when it is available in long, fairly knot-free lengths. Most timber now comes from plantation forests in North America which are managed to produce faster growing timber with fewer knots. This timber is generally lighter but weaker. Traditionally, Oregon pine was used in mast building due to its ability to resist bending loads without fracturing. This was based on using older native forest wood with a high number of growth rings per inch. This sort of wood is seldom available new but can be sourced from merchants dealing in recycled timber. Native Oregon pine is considerably heavier than Sitka spruce, which is about the same weight as Western red cedar, but with far better bending characteristics than cedar. Large-sized Oregon pine, as used in beams, is inclined to split as it dries, like oak, but this does not reduce its strength.
Douglas-fir is one of the most commonly marketed Christmas tree species in the United States, where they are sold alongside firs like Noble fir and Grand fir. Douglas-fir Christmas trees are usually trimmed to a near perfect cone instead of left to grow naturally like Noble and Grand firs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christmastree.org/trees/douglas.cfm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yQ6wjxqF|archivedate=4 May 2011 |title=National Christmas Tree Association |publisher=Christmastree.org |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl]

==Pests and diseases==

Douglas-firs are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Autumnal Moth, Bordered White, The Engrailed, Pine Beauty and Turnip Moth. The gelechiids Chionodes abella and Chionodes periculella and the tortrix moth Cydia illutana have been specifically recorded on P. menziesii.

==Culture==

A California Native American myth explains that each three-ended bract is the tail and two tiny legs of a mouse that hid inside the scales of the tree's cones during forest fires, and the tree was kind enough to be its enduring sanctuary.
A Douglas-fir species, Pseudotsuga menziesii, is the state tree of Oregon.
In the American television series Twin Peaks, primary character Special Agent Dale Cooper displays a fascination with the firs upon arriving in the titular town.
The Douglas fir is featured at the center of the flag of the Cascadian independence movement.
