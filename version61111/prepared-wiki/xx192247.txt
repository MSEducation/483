[[Hermite–Hadamard inequality]]

CATEGORIES: Inequalities

In mathematics, the Hermite–Hadamard inequality, named after Charles Hermite and Jacques Hadamard and sometimes also called Hadamard's inequality, states that if a function ƒ : a, b → R is convex, then the following chain of inequalities hold: 
One of the most natural extensions of the right side of this classical inequality is due to Zoltán Retkes. For to formulate this result one has to introduce the notion of iterated integrals.

==The concept of the sequence of iterated integrals==

Suppose that −∞ Under the above conditions the following sequence of functions is called the sequence of iterated integrals of f,where a ≤ s ≤ b.:

===Example 1===

Let b = 1 and f(s) ≡ 1. Then the sequence of iterated integrals of 1 is defined on 1, and

===Example 2===

Let a,b = −1,1 and f(s) ≡ 1. Then the sequence of iterated integrals of 1 is defined on 1, and

===Example 3===

Let b = 1 and f(s) = es. Then the sequence of iterated integrals of f is defined on 1, and

===Theorem (Retkes inequality)===

Suppose that −∞ i i ≠ xj, if i ≠ j. Then the following holds:
where
In the concave case ≤ is changed to ≥.
Remark 1.  If f is convex in the strict sense then ≤ is changed to Then the limit of the left side exists and
