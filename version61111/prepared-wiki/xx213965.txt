CATEGORIES: Bonnaroo Music Festival, 2004 in music, 2004 in American music

The festival ran June 11, 2004-June 13, 2004, and more than 90,000 people attended. It was marked by torrential rains, creating an incredibly large amount of mud.  Many vehicles had to be towed out of the parking area.

Willie Nelson was originally scheduled to perform but, shortly before the festival, had to cancel his summer 2004 tour due to carpal tunnel syndrome. Steve Winwood was asked to fill in.
Maroon 5 was also on the bill, but did not appear at their performance time, citing a sore throat by lead vocalist Adam Levine.
