Madonna Acres Historic District is Raleigh, North Carolina’s first subdivision developed by an African American for African Americans. Platted in 1960 by John Winters, it is located in east Raleigh, bordering the historic St. Augustine’s college campus. The thirteen-acre subdivision comprises 40 custom homes built for middle to upper-middle class black families.
Madonna Acres Ranch and Split Level houses are well-preserved and contain Modern architectural elements, a notable difference from the traditional styles and detailing found in white subdivisions of the same period. The typical Madonna Acres Ranch is side-gabled with a living room picture window and an integrated one-car carport, although there are several asymmetrical front-gabled Ranches as well. The Split-Levels have a one-story main level with a living room, dining room, and kitchen aside a split level two-story wing with bedrooms and a den.
Madonna Acres was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.
