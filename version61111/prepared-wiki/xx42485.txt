==Career==

===Early work (1984–88)===

Graham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in Mrs. Soffel (1984).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-evolution-of-heather-graham/mrs-soffel-1984|title=The Evolution Of Heather Graham|first=Matt|last=Maytum|date=May 26, 2011|work=Total Film|accessdate=June 17, 2011[/tpl] Her first credited film appearance was in the television film Student Exchange.

Her first high-profile starring role came in the 1988 Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive, as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year she also had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger's mother in Twins (during the laboratory conception flashback). Graham auditioned for the role of Baby in Dirty Dancing (1987), which went to Jennifer Grey.[tpl]cite web|title=Biography for Heather Graham|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001287/bio|publisher=www.imdb.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012[/tpl]

===Breakthrough (1989–1996)===

In 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young drug-addicted friend of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). The performance earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also rejected a steady role in a TV soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive.[tpl]cite web|last=Lou|first=Linda|title=The more risks, the more rewards|url=http://159.54.226.237/99_issues/990808/990808graham.html|publisher=USA Weekend Magazine|accessdate=December 2, 2012[/tpl] After Drugstore Cowboy she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.
After co-starring with Benicio Del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as former nun Annie Blackburn in his television series Twin Peaks. Following the cancellation of the series, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Regarding her casting process she said: "He's just one of those people — he doesn't really make you audition. He just meets you, and he just thinks you're interesting, and he just sticks you in there ... I remember him telling me that he was doing this art project in his backyard. And that he was putting turkey, and laying it out and having ants crawling on it, and then he was going to, like, I don't know, I think take pictures of it", and stated she was "very excited" to work with Lynch.[tpl]cite web|title=Heather Graham—Gray Matters—02/21/07|url=http://grouchoreviews.com/interviews/204|publisher=http://grouchoreviews.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012[/tpl]

Graham is often cast in sexual roles including those of Felicity Shagwell (Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), porn stars Rollergirl (Boogie Nights) and Sharonna (The Guru), prostitute Mary Kelly (From Hell), porn director Margaret (About Cherry) and stripper Jade (The Hangover and The Hangover, Part III). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that "our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?" and that she likes "the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex". Due to her portrayals of sexual characters and nudity in films she has been described as "completely up for it".[tpl]cite news|title=Heather Graham: I'm a nerd|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/heather-graham-im-a-nerd/story-fnejnq21-1226518061674|publisher=www.news.com.au|accessdate=December 3, 2012|date=November 17, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Heather Graham - Biography|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/heather-graham/biography/38|publisher=www.talktalk.co.uk|accessdate=December 3, 2012[/tpl]

She also expressed dislike towards reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: "I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable?  Other people’s pain and misery – it seems kind of sad".[tpl]cite web|first=Frosty|title=Heather Graham Interviewed – ‘Gray Matters’|url=http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/archive_detail.asp/aid/3630/tcid/1/pg/2|work=Collider.com|accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl]
On September 11, 2001 Graham was due to move into an apartment she had bought in Manhattan. Speaking about that day she said: "I was flying into New York that morning from the Toronto Film Festival. I'd bought an apartment in Manhattan and I was due to move in that day. We were flying towards New York when I could see this huge black cloud over the city. The first plane had hit the Twin Towers but nobody knew what was happening at that stage. We landed and I was in the baggage-claim area when the second plane hit the towers. There was general panic. After going through something like that, you never take anything for granted again."[tpl]cite news|last=Wilde|first=Jon|title=Heather Graham on being  a good Catholic girl (in the way Madonna is)|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1190612/Heather-Graham-good-Catholic-girl-way-Madonna-is.html|publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=December 2, 2012|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Heather Graham—Gray Matters—02/21/07|url=http://grouchoreviews.com/interviews/204|publisher=grouchoreviews.com|accessdate=December 3, 2012[/tpl]
