==Background==

"Us Placers" was produced by Lupe Fiasco, who initially crafted the song for inclusion within his own mixtape. His intention was to create a mashup mixtape entitled, Us Placers, a hip-hop remake of alternative rock musician Thom Yorke's 2006 solo album, The Eraser, along with a few Radiohead songs. Fiasco originally wanted Kanye West—who also deeply enjoyed Yorke's album—and English hip-hop artist The Streets to appear on the track.[tpl]cite web |author=Scaggs, Austin|title=Kanye West: A Genius In Praise of Himself |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/16257550/kanye_west_a_genius_in_praise_of_himself/print|work=Rolling Stone |publisher=RealNetworks, Inc |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2007-09-26[/tpl] However, Streets failed to respond while West sent the song over to Pharrell Williams after laying down a verse. The three enjoyed the collaboration so much that they decided to form their very own group. It was Pharrell who came up with their name, Child Rebel Soldier.[tpl]cite web |author=Collins, Hattie |title=Lupe Dreams|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/apr/12/urbanmusic.culture|work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=2008-04-12 |accessdate=2008-08-03[/tpl] According to Fiasco, "It was Pharrell's idea one day in the studio 'cause we're all similar, same likes and same dislikes, same goals and aspirations."[tpl]cite web |author=Geoghegan, Kev|title=Lupe Fiasco 'Ready to Quit Albums'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7329000/7329261.stm|work=BBC Music |publisher=BBC |date=2008-04-04 |accessdate=2008-06-08[/tpl] Early track-listings for West's third studio album Graduation indicated that he intended to feature the group's song on his album, but it was subsequently not included.[tpl]cite web|author=Spin Staff |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/kanye-unveils-tracklisting-mtvs-vma-noms-announced|title= Kanye Unveils Tracklisting; MTV's VMA Noms Announced |work=Spin| publisher=Spin Media, LLC|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2007-08-14[/tpl]

==Composition==

"Us Placers" is an up-tempo hip-hop song. It is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] It is written in the key of The song contains samples of "The Eraser" by Thom Yorke, incorporating the song's piano loops and a portion of Yorke's vocals for its chorus. It begins with a medium tempo followed by a hesitant piano melody, with chords arranged in the progression of and Lupe uttering, "Yeah, just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit. And it goes..." Lupe, Kanye, and Pharrell then respectively rap the song's three verses over a sparse, pulsating beat.[tpl]cite web | author=Levy, Joe | title=Alternate Takes: Go West to the Future | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/27/alternate-takes-go-west-to-the-future/| work=Rolling Stone| publisher=RealNetworks| | date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-07-27[/tpl] Each verse is organized around a chorus that is provided by the melodic vocal sample. The chorus is coupled with a harmonic hook delivered by Lupe, whose vocals implement overdubbing. During the chorus, the song's chord progression changes to and takes on a more moody, atmospheric sound. The song ends with an echoing reiteration of its piano keys.
Lyrically, "Us Placers" is a meditation on the perils of fame.[tpl]cite web | author=Louis, Justin | title=The Power of Three| url=http://thehoot.net/articles/2173 | work=The Brandeis Hoot | publisher=The Brandeis Hoot | date=2008-02-08 | accessdate=2008-02-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Kot, Greg |title=Kanye, Lupe, Pharrell Collaborate on Thom Yorke Track|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2007/06/kanye_lupe_phar.html|work=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Tribune Company|date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2008-05-28[/tpl] Lupe's verse depics the over-indulgent lifestyles of rich and famous celebrities. In a stoic voice, he rapidly raps an extensive list of materialistic possessions; including a large mansion, a wardrobe full of exorbitant cloths, Mexican floral arrangers, a big-screen television, and a fifty-foot yacht. Lupe brings his verse to a close by making a declaration regarding the emptiness of opelence. Kanye uses his verse to expound the ephemerality of fame.[tpl]cite web |author=Sakamoto, John |title=The Anti-Hit List Top 10|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/288583|work=Toronto Star |publisher=Toronto Star |date=2007-12-29 |accessdate=2007-12-29[/tpl] Citing aspiring participants of reality television programs such as The Real World and American Idol and internet celebrities as examples, he implies the fate of those who become instantly famous if only for a short time. In that once their fifteen minutes of fame are over, they then fade away into obscurity, possibly never to enter the public eye ever again. Pharrell takes a more stream-of-consciousness approach to his verse. He swiftly touches on a series of social issues ranging from greenhouse gases, drug dealers, the will God and troubled youth. Pharrell concludes his verse by exposing the motive behind the Virginia Tech massacre. He states the irony of the suicidal shooter, in that he finally achieved the fame and recognition he sought in life, but isn't alive to see it. After each verse, Yorke's melodious vocals sing a mournful yet defiant chorus that complements the song's concept of the sisyphean pursuit of fame: "The more you try to erase me, the more that I appear."
