The Honourable Anne Poulett (11 July 1711 – 5 July 1785), fourth son of John Poulett, 1st Earl Poulett, was a British Member of Parliament who represented the borough of Bridgwater in the House of Commons for sixteen years until his death in 1785. He received his unusual first name in honour of Queen Anne, who was his sponsor at his baptism.
He initially stood for election at Bridgwater in 1768, and although he was initially declared defeated the result was reversed on petition the following year. He was returned unopposed in 1774 and headed the poll at contested elections in 1780 and 1784. Throughout his career he was generally a supporter of Lord North, though occasionally voting against him.
In 1780 he presented to St Mary's Church in Bridgwater a magnificent 17th-century painting of The Descent from the Cross, apparently captured when a Spanish warship was taken a prize. The artist is unknown, although it has been controversially attributed to Murillo. The picture is now used as the altarpiece of the church.
