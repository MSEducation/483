[[Revolutionary Party of Young Annam]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Vietnam

In 1925 the Revolutionary Party of Young Annam ([tpl]lang-vi|Tan-Viet-Cach- Manh-Bung[/tpl]) was a political party in Annam. It was founded in 1925, and was based amongst the petty bourgeoisie in northern Annam. It had its roots in a group of former political prisoners, that had been jailed in connection with the 1908 uprising. The group began having contacts with revolutionary groups in China and Siam after the First World War.Kratoska, Paul H. (ed.).

Within the party there were both nationalist and communist tendencies. Internal factional conflict weakened the party. In 1929 the communists broke away. The party was dissolved in 1930, after a police crackdown.
