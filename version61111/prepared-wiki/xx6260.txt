==Biography==

===Early years===

Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,Torvalds and the grandson of poet Ole Torvalds. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority (5.5% of Finland's population). Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize{–}winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel-prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".[tpl]Cite book|last=Moody|first=Glyn|title=Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution|publisher=Perseus Books Group|year=2002|page=336|url=http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738206709|isbn=0-7382-0670-9[/tpl]
Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996, graduating with a master's degree in computer science from NODES research group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/nodes/ |title=NODES research group |publisher=Cs.helsinki.fi |date=October 16, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Army, selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. In the army he held the rank of second lieutenant, with the role of a ballistic calculation officer.Torvalds, p. 29 In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to UNIX for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX.Torvalds, p. 53  His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/staff |title=Staff |publisher=The Linux Foundation |accessdate=April 24, 2012[/tpl]
His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20.Torvalds, pp. 6–7 After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. He programmed an assembly language and a text editor for the QL, as well as a few games.Torvalds, pp. 41–46Torvalds, Linus: GMOVE. Program listing. In MikroBitti 11/1986, p. 63.

===Later years===

After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996, Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Portland, Oregon, to be closer to the OSDL's Beaverton, Oregon–based headquarters.
From 1997 to 1999 he was involved in 86open helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. In 1999 he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=495 |title=1999 Young Innovators Under 35: Linus Torvalds, 29 |publisher=Technology Review | year=1999 | accessdate=August 14, 2011[/tpl]
In 1999 Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with stock options in gratitude for his creation. That same year both companies went public and Torvalds' share value temporarily shot up to roughly $20 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/linus_pr.html|title=Leader of the Free World|author=Gary Rivlin|accessdate=June 14, 2008|publisher=Wired[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/linus.html|title=Linus Torvalds: A Very Brief and Completely Unauthorized Biography|work=The Linux Information Project|publisher=Bellevue Linux Users Group|date=January 24, 2006|accessdate=October 22, 2010[/tpl]
His personal mascot is a penguin nicknamed Tux,Re: Linux Logo prototype., a Thu, May 9, 1996 message from Linus Torvalds (torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi) which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the mascot of the Linux kernel.[tpl]Wayback |date=20070113035356 |url=http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html |title=Why a Penguin?[/tpl]. linux.org
Although Torvalds believes "open source is the only right way to do software", he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job", even if that includes proprietary software.[tpl]YouTube|4XpnKHJAok8|Linus Torvalds at Google, on Git[/tpl], 9:50–10:00 He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel. Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called Git.
In 2008 Torvalds stated that he used the Fedora distribution of Linux because it had fairly good support for the PowerPC processor architecture, which he had favoured at the time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/linus-torvalds,-geek-of-the-week/ | title=Linus Torvalds, Geek of the Week | date=July 17, 2008 | accessdate=August 3, 2009 |author=Richard Morris[/tpl]  His usage of Fedora was confirmed in a later 2012 interview.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tuxradar.com/content/interview-linus-torvalds-linux-format-163 | title= Interview with Linus Torvalds from Linux Format 163 | date=29 November 2012 | website=TuxRadar | publisher=Linux Format | accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]
Currently, the Linux Foundation sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux.About Us. The Linux Foundation. Retrieved on June 19, 2013.

==The Linus/Linux connection==

Initially, Torvalds wanted to call the kernel he developed Freax (a combination of "free", "freak", and the letter X to indicate that it is a Unix-like system), but his friend Ari Lemmke, who administered the FTP server where the kernel was first hosted for download, named Torvalds' directory linux.[tpl]cite web|last=Moody|first=Glen|title=The Greatest OS That (Never) Was|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.08/linux.html?pg=3&topic=|work=Wired|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl]

==Authority and trademark==

As of 2006, approximately two percent of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds himself. Because thousands have contributed to the Linux kernel, this percentage is one of the largest contributions to it. However, he stated in 2012 that his own personal contribution is mostly merging code written by others, with little programming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/an-interview-with-millenium-technology-prize-finalist-linus-torvalds/ |title=An Interview With Linus Torvalds |publisher=Tech Crunch |date=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012[/tpl] Torvalds retains the highest authority to decide which new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.Henrik Ingo.

==Personal life==

Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni)—a six-time Finnish national karate champion—whom he first met in the autumn of 1993.Torvalds, p. 123 Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendants to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date. Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, Patricia Miranda (born 1996), Daniela Yolanda (born 1998), and Celeste Amanda (born 2000),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000022378/ |title=Torvalds' bio on |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] two of whom were born in the United States. The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.[tpl]cite web |author=Linus Torvalds |title=index : kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git |url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/reboot.h|work=Linux kernel |accessdate=May 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/reboot.h?id=607ca46e97a1b6594b29647d98a32d545c24bdff |archivedate=accessed git version [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://man.flashnux.com/en/debian/6/6.0.1/man2/reboot.2.html |title=Debian's reboot(2) man page |accessdate=August 16, 2011[/tpl]
Torvalds describes himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion."[tpl]cite web| title=Interview: Linus Torvalds | author= Marjorie Richardson | work=Linux Journal | url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3655 | date=November 1, 1999 | accessdate=April 2, 2011[/tpl]
In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and registered to vote in the United States. He is unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, saying, "I have way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly."

==Recognition==

===Internet Hall of Fame===

On April 23, 2012 at Internet Society's Global INET conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Torvalds was one of the inaugural inductees into the Internet Hall of Fame, one of ten in the Innovators category and thirty-three overall inductees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/year/2012 |title=2012 Internet Hall of Fame inductees 2012|publisher=Internet Hall of Fame |accessdate=April 24, 2012[/tpl]

===Space===

In 1996, the asteroid 9793 Torvalds was named after him. In 2003, the naming of an asteroid moon (Linus) was motivated in part by the fact that the discoverer was an enthusiastic Linux user.

===Patents===

As of March 2011, Torvalds has been granted 35 patents worldwide (application and granted patents).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.directoryinventor.com/inventor/4e6957a7ae45d335f53bce424b25391f_1.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110508050506/http://www.directoryinventor.com/inventor/4e6957a7ae45d335f53bce424b25391f_1.html | archivedate=2011-05-08 | title=Patent Portfolio of Linus Torvalds | work=directoryinventor.com[/tpl]

===Desktop environment criticism===

In 2005, on the official GNOME developmental mailing lists, Torvalds encouraged users to switch to K Desktop Environment 3 rather than use GNOME.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html |title=Printing dialog and GNOME |publisher=Mail.gnome.org |accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8745257437.html |title=Linus versus GNOME |publisher=Desktoplinux.com |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] However, Torvalds thought KDE Plasma Desktop 4.0 was a "disaster" because of its lack of maturity, and so he had switched to GNOME by 2009.[tpl]cite web|author=Rodney Gedda |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Software&articleId=9126619&taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=5 |title=Q&A: Linux founder Linus Torvalds talks about open-source identity |publisher=Computerworld |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2012|quote=it was a half-baked release (...)

===Possible NSA approach===

In September 2013, Torvalds was asked at the LinuxCon conference whether he had been approached by a US government agency to add backdoors into Linux; he responded with a verbal "no" while nodding his head "yes".Did NSA contact Linus for a backdoor in Linux? (updated) He later confirmed that it was obviously a joke, no government agency has ever asked him for a backdoor in Linux.[ref]http://mashable.com/2013/09/19/linus-torvalds-backdoor-linux/ No, the Government Never Asked Linus Torvalds for a Backdoor in Linux
