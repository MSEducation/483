When that city received reinforcements from Chalcis, the fleets diverted to Eretria rather than engage a more prepared enemy.  There they united with the fleet of Roman admiral Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, and the three of them laid heavy siege to Eretria, which surrendered after a nighttime assault by Quinctius.[tpl]Cite book  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Agesimbrotus  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 70  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0079.html  | postscript =   | isbn = 1-84511-002-1 [/tpl]Livy, xxxi. 46, xxxii. 16, 32  The three commanders sailed back to Carystus, which evacuated into the city citadel at the approach of such a fleet, and sent ambassadors to beg protection from Quinctius.
