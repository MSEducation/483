The Evangelical Presbyterian Church was a Reformed denomination founded in 1956. 

==History==

The EPC was composed of the majority of the Bible Presbyterian Church which left that denomination over what it felt was the strong influence of Carl McIntire and the fundamentalists, while the new church (then the BPC Columbus Synod) had a stronger emphasis on the Reformed aspect of belief and practice. This split occurred in 1956. The BPC-Columbus Synod renamed itself the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961 to avoid the confusion with the Bible Presbyterian church, Collingswood Synod. During this time it also established Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary as denominational institutions.

===Merger===

The EPC had a short lifespan, as it entered merger talks with the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod (RPCGS) and merged with that group in 1965 to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (which itself merged into the Presbyterian Church in America in 1982).

===The Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod===

The Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod adhered to the Solemn League and Covenant and was of the Covenanter tradition. It was formed in 1833 when the Reformed Presbyterian Church divided over issue of civil rights. One group named Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod allowed its members to vote and to hold office. The General Synod permitted instrumental music during the worship and adopted hymns and psalms to be sung in the services. The other group the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America did not allow members to vote and hold office and opposed hymns and instrumental music.www.gulfcoastpres.org/about.htm
