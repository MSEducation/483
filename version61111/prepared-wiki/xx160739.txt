I hated the script a lot.

===1990s===

In the 1990 film The Spirit of '76, Rob Reiner plays "Dr. Hedley Cash" (only referred to as "Dr. Cash" in the film), an abusive trainer for the est-like "Be, Inc. Seminars" who traps time-traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) in one of his seminars and continually refers to him as "Heinz Asshole."[tpl]cite book | last = Staff. |    title = DVD Verdict Review | publisher = 2003 Bill Gibron | year = 2003 |  pages = The Spirit Of '76 | url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/spiritof76.php |  id =  [/tpl]  In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the "Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship" was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement.  Lucas Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the "'70s hunger for self-improvement," and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves.  Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called "assholes" and insulted publicly.  Reiner noted that once his brother Carl put on the "Dr. Cash" costume, he played his character perfectly.[tpl]cite video | people=Reiner, Lucas |date=2003|title=DVD commentary for The Spirit of '76, 2003 edition| medium=DVD|publisher=Castle Rock Entertainment, Warner Home Video[/tpl] Heavyweights is a 1995 comedy film about a fat camp for kids that is taken over by fitness guru Tony Perkis, played by Ben Stiller.

Fight Club film producer Ross Grayson Bell believes that his "creative synchronicity" with writer Palahniuk was due to their shared experience of attending The Forum.  In the 1999 film Magnolia, Tom Cruise played a motivational guru named Frank T.J. Mackey, who was the author of a self-help book called Seduce and Destroy.  This work was meant to teach men how to get women to sleep with them.  The Frank T.J. Mackey character in the film has been likened to: "a sort of pop-TV blend of Werner Erhard and Bob Guccione, strutting around a stage with cocksure arrogance, indoctrinating his acolytes in the arts of machismo and seduction."[tpl]cite news  | last = Wilmington  | first = Michael |  title = Magnolia | work = Zap2it.com |   publisher = Tribune Media Services, Inc.  | date = 2000-01-06[/tpl]  The Frank T.J.

===2000–present===

In her 2004 book Life Long Learning: Transforming, Learning Discovering Through Living Life in Unlimitless Possibilities, Patti Diamond writes that filmmakers The Wachowskis got the inspiration for the screenplay to The Matrix Revolutions while participating in a Landmark Forum "seminar series."[tpl]cite book | last =Diamond | first =Patti |   title =Life Long Learning - Transforming, Learning Discovering Through Living Life in Unlimitless Possibilities | publisher =Lulu | year =2004 | location = Morrisville, North Carolina| page =Page 33 |   id =   | isbn = 1-4116-2492-0[/tpl]  Diamond also analyzes The Matrix Revolutions and the messages imparted in the film, in the context of her own personal experiences in the Landmark Forum.  She describes a tautologous exchange between Agent Smith and Neo in the film, where Neo is asked by Smith: "Why do you continue to do this, Mr. Anderson?" and Neo responds: "Because I choose to."  Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of "choice and decision."  Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: "we all choose to BE who we are being in each and every moment of our experience."[tpl]cite book | last =Diamond | first =Patti |   title =Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience | publisher =Lulu  | year =2006 | location =Morrisville, North Carolina | page =Page 169 |   id =   | isbn = 1-4116-5156-1[/tpl]

==Music==

Alameda, California musician and Elvis impersonator "eXtreme Elvis" (EE) attributes the origin of his show to an experience he had at the Landmark Forum. eXtreme Elvis told Glen Silverstone of East Bay Express: "Before I went to Forum I didn't have the confidence to put myself out there. I couldn't have gotten naked and felt okay with being fat, with just being myself naked in front of people."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/music/disgraceland/Content?oid=282564|title=Disgraceland: (Extreme) Elvis is not the first person to eat his shit onstage, and he won't be the last|work=East Bay Express |date=August 15, 2001|accessdate=2008-04-20|last=Silverstone|first=Glen [/tpl] He also compared his performance with the Landmark Forum: "I see a lot of parallels between my show and Landmark. Both have been accused of being abusive and being cults. But Landmark and my show are transforming, revolutionary experiences. People cannot possibly leave without having their lives changed." After completing the Landmark Forum, EE became a graduate instructor for Landmark Education.

===Mork & Mindy===

Parody and satire of est and The Forum in television has taken a more direct approach than in literature and film.  Characters have been shown attending seminars, and having negative outcomes as a result.  Mork & Mindy dealt with this in a lighter fashion, dealing with a small introduction of individuals to the training in a home environment, in season one, episode seventeen: "Mork Goes Erk."[tpl]cite news | last =Staff |   title ="Mork & Mindy" Mork Goes Erk (1979) | work =Internet Movie Database |   publisher =Amazon.com | date =Original Air Date: 8 February 1979 | url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651213/  | accessdate =  2007-10-29[/tpl]  In the episode, David Letterman portrayed an Erhard-like character by the name of "Ellsworth" offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning.[ref]
