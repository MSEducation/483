Dudley ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Dudley.ogg|ˈ|d|ʌ|d|l|i[/tpl] [tpl]respell|DUD|lee[/tpl]) is a large town in the West Midlands county of England and the administrative and financial centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. At the 2001 census, the population of the town of Dudley (as opposed to the wider borough) was given as being 194,919, making it one of the largest towns in Britain without city status. This figure does not include the towns of Stourbridge or Halesowen, which make up the larger borough, but does include smaller outlying districts such as Sedgley and Gornal. Some people[tpl]Who|[tpl]date=February 2014[/tpl]|date=February 2014[/tpl] prefer to measure the population as being the smaller Dudley built-up area, which according to the 2011 census had a population of 79,379.[tpl]cite web|title=Built-Up Area Populations of UK Towns and Cities - 2011 Census|url=http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Populations/TownsTable1.asp[/tpl] The wider metropolitan borough has a population of 312,925.
Dudley is part of the West Midlands conurbation and is located [tpl]convert|6|mi[/tpl] south-east of the city of Wolverhampton and [tpl]convert|8|mi[/tpl] north-west of the city of Birmingham.

==History==

===Early History===

Dudley has a history dating back to Anglo-Saxon times,Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council – History of Dudley Town, accessed 13 January 2011 its name deriving from the Old English Duddan Leah, meaning Dudda's clearing, and one of its churches being named in honour of the Anglo-Saxon King and Saint, Edmund.
Mentioned in the Domesday Book as Dudelei,Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911, accessed 4 March 2007 the town was listed as being a medium-sized manor in the possession of Earl Edwin of Mercia prior to the Norman Conquest, with William Fitz-Ansculf as Lord of the Manor in 1086.[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley - Domesday Book|url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SO9490/dudley//|work=Open Domesday|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] Dudley Castle, constructed in 1070 by William's father Ansculf de Picquigny[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley Castle|url=http://www.dudleyzoo.org.uk/around-dzg/dudley-castle|publisher=Dudley and West Midlands Zoological Society|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] after his acquisition of the town, served as the seat of the extensive Barony of Dudley, which possessed estates in eleven different counties across England.[tpl]cite journal|title=Parishes - Dudley|journal=A History of the County of Worcester|year=1913|volume=3|pages=90–105|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43093|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
Of historical significance, the town was attacked by King Stephen in 1138, after a failed siege of the castle following the Baron's decision to support Empress Matilda's claim to the throne during The Anarchy.[tpl]cite web|title=The history of Dudley Castle|url=http://www.dudleycastle.org.uk/history.html|publisher=The Friends of Dudley Castle|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
The castle provided the centre from which the town and borough grew, with early coal and iron workings helping establish Dudley as a major market town during the Middle Ages, selling not only agricultural produce, but also iron goods at a national level.History of Dudley Town Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council Working iron and mining for coal was in practice as early as the 13th century. The first mention of Dudley's status as a borough dates from the mid-13th century, when Roger de Somery, then Baron of Dudley, approved of the establishment of a market in nearby Wolverhampton. An inquisition after his death further established the value and importance of the borough, with mentions to the town's growing coal industry.

===Early Modern and Industrial Revolution===

By the early 16th century the Dudley estate, now held by the Sutton family, had become severely in debt, and was first mortgaged to distant relative John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, before being sold outright in 1535. Following Dudley's death, the estate returned to the Sutton family, during which time the town was visited by Queen Elizabeth during a tour of England.
In 1605, conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot fled to Holbeche House in nearby Kingswinford, where they were defeated and captured by the forces of the Sheriff of Worcestershire.[tpl]cite web|title=Holbeache House|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/heritage-centenary/landmark-listings/holbeache-house|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
During the English Civil War Dudley served as a Royalist stronghold, with the castle besieged twice by the Parliamentarians and later partly demolished on the orders of the Government after the Royalist surrender.A Brief History of Dudley Town and Castle Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council It is also from around this time that the oldest excavated condoms, found in the remains of Dudley Castle, were believed to have originated.[tpl]cite news|title=Antique condoms' Dutch Journey|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/3228255.stm|accessdate=22 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=30 October 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Martin|first=James|title=Condoms, Cathedrals, Castles and Caves|url=http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
Dudley had become an incredibly impoverished place during the 16th and 17th centuries, but the advent of the Industrial Revolution began to reverse this trend. In the early 17th century, Dud Dudley, an illegitimate son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, devised a method of smelting Iron ore using coke at his father's works in Cradley and Pensnett Chase, though his trade was unsuccessful due to circumstances of the time.[tpl]cite web|title=Dud Dudley's Metallum Martis|url=http://www.lostlabours.co.uk/agenoria/research/dud_dudley/dud_dudley.htm|publisher=lostlabours.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] His techniques were later refined by his distant relative Abraham Darby, who established his works in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire.
Dud Dudley's discovery, together with improvements to the local road network and the construction of the Dudley Canal, made Dudley into an important industrial and commercial centre. The first Newcomen steam engine, used to pump water from the mines of the Lord Dudley's estates, was installed at the Conygree coalworks a mile east of Dudley Castle in 1712,[tpl]cite web|title=Newcomen Engine|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/newcomen-engine/8.htm#.Uj9LzoYqj_s|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] though this is challenged by Wolverhampton, which also claims to have been the location of the first working Newcomen engine.[tpl]cite web|title=Edward Short's Newcomen Engine account book|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=149-dx840&cid=0#0|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
Dudley's population grew dramatically during the 18th and 19th centuries because of the increase in industry, with the main industries including coal and limestone mining.1911 article about Dudley – From the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica Other industries included iron, steel, engineering, metallurgy, glass cutting, textiles and leatherworking.
During this time living conditions remained incredibly poor, with Dudley being named 'the most unhealthy place in the country',Lee, William, Report to the General Board of Health on a preliminary inquiry into the sewerage, drainage and supply of water, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants of the Parish of Dudley in the county of Worcester, London, 1852. which led to the installation of clean water supplies and sewage systems, and later the extensive development of council housing during the early 20th century to relocate the occupants of local slum housing.
Following the Reform Act of 1832, Dudley returned one Member of Parliament, a privilege first enacted in the Parliament of 1295. The town was re-incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1865, later becoming a County Borough in 1889.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10026568&c_id=10001043 |title=Dudley CB Boundary Changes |publisher=Vision of Britain |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

===Modern Day===

Dudley was developed substantially in the early 20th century, with the construction of many entertainment venues including a theatre and cinemas, with two indoor shopping centres being added later in the century. Dudley Castle, which had fallen into ruin following a fire in 1750, was converted into a zoo in 1937 by the Earl of Dudley, with buildings designed by architect Berthold Lubetkin. A reported 250,000 people attempted to visit the site upon the first day of opening.[tpl]cite news|title=Worldwide plea over Dudley Zoo buildings|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2009/10/07/_feature.shtml|accessdate=22 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 October 2009[/tpl]
In World War II, Dudley was bombed on several occasions, with a number of fatalities, though nowhere near as severely as its near neighbour Birmingham.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Following parliamentary reforms in 1966, Dudley was expanded to include the majority of the former urban districts of Brierley Hill and Sedgley, along with parts of Coseley, Amblecote and Rowley Regis; an area in the eastern section of the town was also transferred into the new borough of Warley. Most of this land had previously been held by the Lords of Dudley, as well as contained within the Dudley registration district and parliamentary borough.[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief History of Kingswinford|url=http://www.kingswinford.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/com/kingswinford/kfordhistory.htm|publisher=Kingswinford and District Historical Society|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sedgley|url=http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SO9193/sedgley/|work=Open Domesday|publisher=domesdaymap.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dudley Registration District|url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/reg/districts/dudley.html|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] In 1974, further reorganization led to the creation of the present-day metropolitan borough, which included the nearby towns of Stourbridge and Halesowen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birminghamuk.com/dudleyhistory.htm |title=Birmingham UK Com |publisher=Birminghamuk.com |accessdate=2013-09-30[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In more recent years, the declining industry in Dudley has given rise to high unemployment, resulting in the closure of many businesses in the town. The development of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre between 1985 and 1990 also saw the loss of most of the town centre's leading name stores, which relocated to take advantage of the tax incentives offered by Merry Hill's status as an Enterprise Zone. The financial crisis and recession resulted in even more of the retail units in the town centre becoming vacant, with the Woolworths store on Market Place closing in December 2008 when the company went bankrupt,Woolworths Stores Closures Sky News, December 2008 and Beatties closing its store – the last department store in the town – in January 2010,Beatties to close store Express & Star, October 2009 after more than 40 years due to falling trade.

There are many canals in and around Dudley, the main one being the Dudley Canal – most of which passes beneath Dudley in a tunnel which lacks a towpath and is therefore accessible only by boat.
The open sections of canal are popular with walkers, cyclists, fishermen, and narrowboat users.Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council: Dudley Canals introduction  Many of the canalside towpaths have been upgraded for cycling, and some sections are part of the National Cycle Network.
St James's Church at Eve Hill had a church school from the mid 19th century, but this was closed during the 1970s and was used as a community centre for several years before being transferred to the Black Country Museum in 1989.

There is a Showcase Cinema and Bowlplex in a retail park between the zoo and museum.
Until 2011, the JB's nightclub was situated on Castle Hill, after relocating from an earlier site in the 1990s.

===Museums and galleries===

The museums in Dudley celebrate the geological and industrial heritage of the town and the surrounding Black Country region, and its role in the Industrial Revolution. The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air living museum, which consists of reconstructed buildings from the surrounding area forming a living replica of an industrial village, with demonstrators portraying life in the region from that time. The Dudley Museum and Art Gallery is located in the town centre, and houses a large collection of fossils excavated from the nearby Wren's Nest Nature Reserve, along with an exhibit on local footballer Duncan Edwards, and an art gallery featuring the work of local artists.[tpl]cite web|title=The Collections|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museums-galleries/dudley-museum-art-gallery/collections/|work=Dudley Museum & Art Gallery|publisher=Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]-[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Rail===

The nearest railway stations are all at least a mile outside Dudley town centre, with the closest stations of Tipton and Dudley Port located in the neighbouring Borough of Sandwell. The nearest station within the Dudley borough is Coseley, and is served by local services operated by London Midland. The nearest intercity services run from the Sandwell and Dudley railway station in Oldbury, which was rebuilt in 1984 to serve the two boroughs.[tpl]cite web|title=Sandwell & Dudley Station|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-396000-288000/page/14|work=Domesday Reloaded|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=18 June 2012[/tpl]

The site was later used as a Freightliner terminal by Freightliner UK, until an unpopular closure on 26 September 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://railaroundbirmingham.co.uk/Stations/dudley.php |title=Dudley Station |publisher=Rail Around Birmingham |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

===Bus===

There is a large bus station in the town centre which has many connections to surrounding towns, cities, and communities, including Birmingham, Halesowen, Smethwick, Stourbridge, Walsall, West Bromwich, and Wolverhampton, amongst others. 
The bus station also sees a coach service from National Express, whose services call at the station mostly for London or Wolverhampton. Other places served include holiday destination Blackpool, and London Heathrow and London Gatwick Airports. There are also small bus stations located at Russells Hall Hospital and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre.
Dudley Town Centre has been served by a bus station at the junction of Birmingham Street and Fisher Street since 1952. The original bus station was cleared in 1984 and replaced by the current bus station, which became fully operational in 1987.
Originally, Midland Red operated bus services in the town, mostly from its own bus depot, which opened in 1929. This depot was located on Birmingham Road and passed to West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive in 1973, along with operation of all bus services in Dudley. The depot itself was closed in 1993 and demolished a year later to make way for the Castle Gate roundabout, at the eastern end of the town's new southern by-pass. The island was built in 1997 and the by-pass opened on 15 October 1999.

===Road===

Dudley is served by main roads which give a direct route to neighbouring towns. The longest of these roads are the B4176 (which runs to Wombourne, Bridgnorth and Telford) and the A461 (which passes through Wednesbury and Walsall, finally reaching Lichfield).
The nearest motorway is the M5, with the closest junction situated in Oldbury, 3 miles south-east of the town.

===Air===

The nearest international airport is Birmingham International Airport, around 19 miles to the east. The nearest local airport is Wolverhampton Airport, which is about 10 miles to the west of the town.

===Tram===

Dudley was the terminus point of two tram routes which opened in the later part of the 19th century. The first route, linking the town with Tipton and Wednesbury, opened on 21 January 1884 operating steam trams, the route being electrified in 1907 before being closed in March 1930 and replaced by Midland Red buses along the route. The second route opened a year later, linking the town with Birmingham and heading through the centre of nearby Tividale village on the Dudley-Tipton border. This line was electrified in 1904 and remained open until 30 September 1939, when it too was replaced by Midland Red buses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk/brief-history-of-tipton.php |title=tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk |publisher=tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk |accessdate=2013-09-30[/tpl]

However, the Urban Subdivision includes Brierley Hill, which the local authority considers a separate town.[tpl]cite web|title=Brierley Hill Town Centre|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/business/regeneration/town-centre-managment/brierley-hill-town-centre/|publisher=Dudley MBC|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] It also includes other local centres such as Sedgley, Gornal, and Kingswinford.Williams, Ned, Dudley & Netherton Remembered ,  The History Press Ltd , 1 Oct 2010.

Dudley used to have a large theatre in the form of the Hippodrome, several cinemas, and multiple department stores, along with a football and cricket ground based in the town. However, the football team have been forced to play elsewhere after the loss of their ground,[tpl]cite web|title=A Hole in the Ground where a Hole Don't Belong! |url=http://www.blackcountrysociety.co.uk/articles/hole-in-the-ground/|publisher=Black Country Society|accessdate=4 July June 2013[/tpl] while the shopping centre has declined considerably since the opening of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the 1980s,[tpl]cite news|title=Pictures reveal the decline of Dudley town centre|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/12/16/pictures-reveal-the-decline-of-dudley-town-centre/|accessdate=30 June 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=16 December 2011[/tpl] and a subsequent lack of investment from the local authority. Brierley Hill, on the other hand, has only been considered a 'town' by the council since the council decided to include Merry Hill within the bounds of the centre. Brierley Hill itself remains a relatively small centre, with a ward population of just 13,935 as of the 2011 census.[tpl]cite web|title=Brierley Hill (Ward) - Population Density|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6500162&c=Brierley+Hill&d=14&e=13&g=6365045&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1361464834582&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2491|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=ONS|accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl]

===Ethnic unrest===

Dudley was the scene of some of Britain's first race riots in July 1962, when dozens of white men and youths rampaged in the North Street area of the town, vandalising properties in the area where the town's ethnic minorities were concentrated. Black Caribbean immigrants were particularly targeted in these disturbances.
Another riot, though less well known than the North Street riots, took place in Dudley in September 1991, when white and Asian youths clashed in the Kates Hill area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&story=35 |title=Riots and Lynchings, Fascists and Immigrants: What’s Changed?|publisher=Searchlightmagazine.com |date= October 2003 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]
The English Defence League demonstrated in the town centre on 3 April 2010; although there were no injuries, eight people were arrested and there were several instances of criminal damage. The English Defence League again demonstrated against the Hall Street mosque project on 17 July 2010. There were severe confrontations at many levels with the result that 20 criminal offences[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dudleynews.co.uk/news/8283291.Police_continue_to_investigate_criminal_damage_offences/?ref=mr |title=Police continue to investigate criminal damage offences|publisher=Dudleynews.co.uk |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] were being investigated by police during the aftermath, and many accounts of severe personal injury of visiting protesters were reported.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stourbridgenews.co.uk/news/7984097.Violence_erupts_at_EDL_protest/ |title=Violence Erupts at EDL Protest |publisher=Stourbridgenews.co.uk |date=3 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

==Education==

===Primary education===

Dudley is served by a range of primary schools. Several of these are church schools. For example, Jesson's Church of England Primary School, St Chads Roman Catholic School, St Edmund's and St John's Church of England Primary School and Netherton Church of England Primary School are all Church of England primary schools.
Other primary schools in the town include Dudley Wood Primary School, Priory Primary School, Kates Hill Primary School, Sledmere Primary School, Russells Hall Primary School, Milking Bank Primary School, Highgate Primary School, Northfield Road Primary School, Dudley Wood Primary School, Foxyards Primary School, Netherbrook Primary School (in Netherton), Blowers Green Primary School and Wrens Nest Primary School. Many of these schools are named after the housing estates they are located within.
Primary schools throughout the Dudley borough currently all provide education for pupils aged 5 to 11 years. Some schools also have nursery units for pupils aged 3 and 4 years. From 1972 to 1990, schoolchildren in Dudley, Sedgley, Coseley and Brierley Hill stayed at primary school until the age of 12. Halesowen ran a 5–13 first and middle school system from 1972 to 1982, while Stourbridge and Kingswinford have always had a traditional 5–11 infant and junior system.

===Secondary education===

There are four secondary schools in central Dudley. Castle High School is a visual arts college and secondary school. It was formed in September 1989 as a result of a merger between The Dudley School and The Blue Coat School. It also occupies the buildings which once consisted of Dudley Boys Grammar School and land that was once used for Dudley Girls High School. By name, it is one of the newest schools in the town, despite using some of the area's oldest school buildings.
Holly Hall Academy is a comprehensive school in Dudley and has served the south-west of the town since 1968.
Bishop Milner Catholic College is a Roman Catholic secondary school in Dudley. Opened in 1960, it became one of the first Roman Catholic secondary schools in the region and is the oldest existing secondary school – by name – in Dudley.
The Hillcrest School is another secondary school in Dudley, serving the community of Netherton since 1958.
Dudley traditionally ran a system of 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11+ secondary schools, but in September 1972 the system was altered to create 5–8 first, 8–12 middle and 12+ secondary schools – this affected the towns of Dudley, Sedgley, Coseley and Brierley Hill, while the traditional system remained in Kingswinford. Secondary modern and grammar schools were replaced by comprehensive schools in September 1975, and since that date all state secondary schools in the borough have been comprehensive.
Stourbridge, which became part of the Dudley borough in 1974, retained the traditional system as well, although Halesowen had adopted 5–9 first, 9–13 middle and 13+ secondary schools in 1972.
Halesowen reverted to the traditional 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11+ secondary school system in 1982, and by 1985 there were plans afoot to return to the traditional system across the borough. The traditional system was finally restored across the Dudley borough in September 1990, around which time most of the remaining sixth forms in Dudley secondary schools were closed in favour of concentrating post 16 education at Dudley College, Halesowen College, Stourbridge College and King Edward VI College in Stourbridge.
Casualties of the introduction of comprehensive education included Dudley's girls high and boys grammar schools, which merged with the nearby Park secondary modern school to form The Dudley School (which in turn became Castle High on a merger with The Blue Coat School in 1989), while the equivalent schools in Stourbridge merged with Valley Road Secondary Modern School to become Redhill School. Several other grammar schools, including the High Arcal School in Sedgley, continued merely with a change in status rather than name.
The borough's final single sex state schools, Walton Girls School and Richmond Boys School in Halesowen, merged in September 1985 to form Windsor High School.

===Special schools===

There are several special schools within Dudley, to cater for students with special educational needs. The Old Park School serves pupils from the age of 3 to 19,Old Park School website and was originally located in the Russells Hall Estate, but relocated to new premises in Quarry Bank in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome|url=http://www.oldpark.org/welcome.asp|publisher=Old Park School|accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] The Rosewood School also caters for children within the age range. It was built on the Russells Hall Estate during the 1960s, but relocated to the former Highfields Primary School site in Coseley in March 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dudleynews.co.uk/news/local/2252090.Special_school_in_move_to_new_home/ |title=Special school in move to new home|publisher=Dudleynews.co.uk |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

Sutton School, built in 1962 in Russells Hall, caters only for pupils from 11–16.Sutton School website

===Defunct schools===

As well as The Dudley School, Sir Gilbert Claughton School and The Blue Coat School, which merged to form Castle High School, other defunct schools in the town include Rosland Secondary School, which became part of The Blue Coat School in 1970, and Park Secondary School. The Mons Hill School also shut down as a result of falling pupil numbers; it had originally opened in 1965 to replace the Wolverhampton Street School.
Primary schools that no longer exist include St James' School (erected in 1842), St John's Primary School and St Edmund's Primary School, which merged to form St Edmund's and St John's Church of England Primary School in the 1970s. The St Edmund's building still exists on the corner of Castle Hill and Birmingham Street, and is currently used as a mosque.
Sycamore Green Primary School shut down in July 2006 as a result of falling pupil numbers. Staff and pupils were transferred to the nearby Wrens Nest Primary School, and the school buildings are currently used as a Pupil Referral Unit for students studying at Key Stage 3.

===Further education===

Dudley College is a college of further education situated mainly in the north of the town centre. Two new campuses were opened in 2012 as part of on-going plans to establish a 'learning quarter' in the town centre, relocating facilities from the other sites at Castle View and Wren's Nest.[tpl]cite news|title=New sixth form opens at Dudley College|author=Alex Ross|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/education/2012/09/27/new-sixth-form-opens-at-dudley-college/|newspaper=Express & Star|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012[/tpl] Originally established as a Mechanics' Institute in 1862,[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley College guide|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/9980876/Dudley-College-guide.html|work=Universities and Colleges guides|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl] it is the only college of further education in the town, and along with Halesowen College and several campuses of the Birmingham Metropolitan College (formerly part of the now-defunct Stourbridge College),[tpl]cite news|title=Stourbridge College's vision for the future shown in image|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/education/2013/08/14/stourbridge-colleges-vision-for-the-future-shown-in-image/|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=14 August 2013[/tpl] it is one of three further education colleges in the wider borough.
Until the summer of 2002, there was a campus of the University of Wolverhampton within the town. The newer part of the campus, built during the 1960s, was retained as part of Dudley College until 2012. The older buildings, which were originally a teacher training college built in 1905, were demolished soon afterwards with the site redeveloped for private housing.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==Public services==

===Libraries===

Dudley Library is situated on St. James's Road, in the town centre. The present building, a Grade II listed Edwardian baroque, was designed by George H. Wenyon, and opened in 1909 to replace the older site in Priory Street.[tpl]cite web|title=Public Library – Dudley|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-217995-public-library-dudley|publisher=British Listed Building|accessdate=10 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Clare|first=David|title=Images of England: Dudley|year=2005|publisher=Tempus Publishing|isbn=0-7524-3534-5|page=106[/tpl] The town has had a public library since 1878. The library underwent a major expansion in 1966, and significant refurbishment in 2002[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/dudley.html |title=A History of Dudley |publisher=Localhistories.org |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] and 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Dudley Library due for £200k revamp|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/05/16/dudley-library-due-for-200k-revamp/|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=Express & Star|date=16 May 2012[/tpl]
The library service also operates eight branch libraries and four self-service 'Library Links', along with four other main libraries situated throughout the Dudley Borough. A controversial re-structuring and modernisation of the service between 2006 and 2009 lead to the closure of several smaller borough libraries in favour of the 'Library Links'.[tpl]cite web|title=Libraries|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/libraries/find-a-library/|publisher=Dudley MBC|accessdate=10 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dudley libraries modernisation|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/improvement/library_support/Dudley|work=Museums, Libraries & Archives|accessdate=10 January 2012[/tpl]

===Medical===

In October 2006, Dudley Beacon and Castle Primary Care Trust and Dudley South Primary Care Trust merged to become Dudley Primary Care Trust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/england/authoritiestrusts/mentalhealth/showTrust.aspx?id=5PE |title=NHS in England: Dudley PCT Organisation Summary |publisher=Nhs.uk |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] As of January 2012, it is chaired by Gill Cooper.
Dudley is served by two major National Health Service health facilities. Dudley Guest Hospital was the first to be constructed. However it began as a charity by the Earl of Dudley to accommodate blinded local miners in 1849. The charity did not become popular and it was taken over by a local chainmaker who turned it into a hospital in 1871. As a result of the loss of the Emergency department in 1983, the hospital has become a less important facility compared with the Russells Hall Hospital, also in Dudley. A new outpatient centre opening at the Guest in 2003 but the original buildings remained use for another four years before the remaining services were transferred to Russells Hall.
Russells Hall Hospital was constructed in 1976 but financial problems meant that it could not open until 1983. A major expansion of the hospital was completed in 2005 when it incorporated all of the borough's inpatient services, following the closure of Wordsley Hospital and the downgrading of Dudley Guest Hospital and Stourbridge Corbett Hospital to outpatient services only.
Another hospital serving Dudley is Bushey Fields Hospital, which was developed in the 1980s and early 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.specialistinfo.com/thget.php?t=t_chst&r=DUBCH1 |title=Bushey Fields Hospital |publisher=Specialist Info |date=1 April 1974 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]
Burton Road Hospital stood on Burton Road approximately one mile to the west of the town centre, but this was not part of Dudley until 1966 having previously been in Sedgley. It was built in the mid 19th century as a workhouse and became a hospital in 1859. The hospital was demolished in 1994, having closed in December 1993.
The town's ambulance station was opened on land adjacent to Burton Road Hospital in 1986. The fire station was opened nearby in 1999, replacing a 1960s building on Tower Street which was then incorporated into council offices before being demolished in late 2010 to make way for a new building of Dudley College which will incorporate a listed section of the fire station dating from the 1930s.
Dudley Health Centre was opened in Cross Street in 1979. There are currently four GPs employed there, as well as numerous administration staff. There are also doctor's surgeries in Bean Road, and the clinic on the Priory Estate was demolished in the mid-2000s after serving the local community for some 70 years. Another surgery was built in the west of the town around 1990, to serve the new Milking Bank housing estate.[tpl]-[/tpl]

===Emergency services===

Law enforcement in Dudley is carried out by the West Midlands Police, with the main station located in Brierley Hill. Dudley town police station is situated on New Street, in a building that opened in 1939 to replace a 19th-century structure on Priory Street, which now forms part of the local council offices. Fire and rescue services are provided by the West Midlands Fire Service, with the fire station situated on Burton Road, on land previously occupied by Burton Road Hospital. The former site on Tower Street now forms part of a campus of Dudley College.[tpl]cite news|title=New Dudley College building hits the high point|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/education/2011/12/15/new-dudley-college-building-hits-the-high-point/|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Express & Star|date=15 December 2011[/tpl] West Midlands Ambulance Service provides emergency medical care, with the current ambulance station situated in Burton Road, near to the fire station.
There is also an Army Cadet Force of Dudley Detachment, Air Cadet Squadron of 347 (Dudley) Squadron and Sea Cadet unit based in Dudley. There is a Territorial Army centre based in the town centre of Dudley, in which houses both Dudley Army cadets and Air Cadets.

==Religion==

A detached part of the Anglican Diocese of Worcester, Dudley has its own Archdeaconry and suffragan bishop. The town is served by numerous parish churches, including the Church of St. Edmund, Church of St. James, and Church of St. Thomas within the town centre.
The oldest church in the town is St. Edmund's, dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, although the present building wasn't constructed until 1724, following its demolition during the English Civil War.[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley St Edmund|url=http://www.worcesterbmsgh.co.uk/parish/dudley-st-edmund|work=Parish Records|publisher=Worcester Branch of the Birmingham & Midland Society for Genealogy and Heraldry|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] St. Thomas' church dates from the 12th century,[tpl]cite web|title=Saint Thomas's Church|url=http://www.edu.dudley.gov.uk/gisweb/gallery/History/Dudley_Town_Trail/Saint%20Thomas.pdf|publisher=Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] and was rebuilt in the 1815 after the original building was declared 'unsafe'.[tpl]cite web|title=Parishes – Dudley|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43093#s6|work=A History of the County of Worcester|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] Both sites are now Grade II* listed.[tpl]cite web|title=Church of St Edmund – Dudley|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-217926-church-of-st-edmund-|work=Grade II* Listed Buildings in Dudley|publisher=British Listed Buildings Online|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Parish Church of St Thomas – Dudley|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-217947-parish-church-of-st-thomas-|work=Grade II* Listed Buildings in Dudley|publisher=British Listed Buildings Online|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl]
Dudley Priory was a Cluniac priory founded circa 1160 by the Lord of Dudley, Gervase de Paganel, and controlled several churches in the surrounding area. After its initial dissolution in 1395, it reopened as a denizen priory, and remained in use until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley Priory|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=118937|publisher=PastScape|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] Today the ruins form part of the surrounding Priory Park.
Dudley also has places of worship for other religious groups and Christian denominations, including a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall, two Sikh gurdwaras, and a Hindu temple. The old St Edmund's Church School, which closed in 1970 on a merger with St John's Church School, was converted into a mosque for the town's growing Islamic community, with an additional mosque also opening in the Queen's Cross area of the town.[tpl]-[/tpl]

===Proposed large mosque===

In 2003 plans were unveiled for the construction of a new mosque (which become known as the "Super Mosque" locally) in Hall Street, as site that had been leased by Dudley Council to the Dudley Muslim Association, in exchange for a site impacted by a proposed bypass.Societies, doi:10.3390/sco3020186, section 4 The mosque proposals were scrapped in May 2010, after a long dispute, in favour of an expansion to the existing Dudley Central Mosque in Castle Hill,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/05/03/dudley-mosque-plan-is-scrapped/ |title=Dudley Mosque Plan is Scrapped|publisher=Expressandstar.com |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] an appeal was made by the Dudley Muslim Association against the High Court ruling,[tpl]cite news|title=Appeal granted over rejection of mosque|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/07/27/appeal-granted-over-rejection-of-mosque/|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Express & Star|date=27 July 2012[/tpl] and failed in February 2014.http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/02/17/appeal-fails-on-plan-for-dudley-mosque/

==Economy==

===Retail===

The town centre is home to several high street retailers, including River Island, Wilkinsons, Argos, Peacocks, and New Look. There are also branches Subway and Costa Coffee. McDonald's, British Home Stores, Marks & Spencer, and Debenhams have all had branches in Dudley Town Centre in the past. Most of Dudley's shops are concentrated along the Market Place and adjacent side streets.
Established in the 12th century,[tpl]cite web|title=Dudley Market – Our History & Future|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/business/dudley-market/ourhistoryandfuture/|work=Business|publisher=Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] Dudley Market is situated on a wide part of the High Street, and is a major shopping area for the town. It has undergone numerous developments in its history, including pedestrianisation in 1982, and the removal of 12th century cobblestone paving. Other developments have included the addition of a new roof and toilet facilities, with the new ground level block having replaced underground toilets in the early 1990s.Dudley Market[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] There are also three small shopping centres situated off the High Street: the Churchill Shopping Centre, the Trident Shopping Centre, and the Fountain Arcade.
Dudley Town Centre is now rather run down, with nearly a third of its shop units vacant, the highest figure for a medium-sized town centre in Britain.[tpl]cite news|title=Dudley 'worst among medium centres' for empty shops|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-19470562|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 September 2012[/tpl] Retailing was particularly hard hit by the opening of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre three miles away, between 1985 and 1990. This led to the exit of the majority of major retailers, including British Home Stores (June 1990), Marks & Spencer (August 1990), Sainsbury's (August 1989), C&A (January 1992), and Littlewoods (January 1990), all of which closed before or soon after new stores opened at Merry Hill.[tpl]cite book |last=Roger Tym and Partners |title=Merry Hill Impact Study |publisher=HMSO |year=1993 |isbn=0-11-752786-6[/tpl] Although the town was already in slight decline at the time following the recession of the early 1980s, the opening of the Merry Hill Centre resulted in a 70% decline of the town's market share in retail between the first retailers moving there in 1985 and the final new shops opening during 1990.[tpl]cite web|title=Chase & Partners Report Appendix 4 – Dudley|url=http://www.the-blackcountry.com/images/Study/chase%20and%20partners%20report%20appendix%204.pdf|publisher=Black Country Consortium|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl]
Dudley residents and traders have asked for the removal of the parking charges in Dudley, which they see as a barrier to people coming into the town. (The rival Merry Hill Centre has always had free parking). Dudley Council has refused to reduce or remove parking charges citing "loss of revenue". Critics of the council point out that more revenue is lost through shoppers going elsewhere.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Since 2008, another economic downturn has led to retailers including Beattie's, H. Samuel, Dorothy Perkins, Thornton's and Millet's exiting the town, with WH Smith also planning to close later in 2013.[tpl]cite news|title=WH Smith store in Dudley is to shut|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/06/29/wh-smith-store-in-dudley-is-to-shut/|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=29 June 2013[/tpl] The town also lost its Woolworths store after nearly 100 years just after Christmas 2008 when the retailer went into liquidation.

===Industry===

The Bean Cars factory was opened in the first years of the twentieth century and remained in use until the 1930s, but survives to this day for other industrial use.

===Association Football===

Dudley is the largest town in England never to have had a league football club.The Guardian: Which is the smallest English town/city ever to have hosted a top-flight football team? And which is the largest never to have done so? (Accessed 4 March 2007) The town's key football teams, Dudley Town F.C. and Dudley Sports F.C. have never progressed beyond the Southern League. They are both currently[tpl]When|date=July 2011[/tpl] at Level 10 of the Football League pyramid.
Dudley Town is the older of the town's two clubs, and have enjoyed the most success. Their most notable success came in 1985 when they won promotion to the Southern Premier League, but in the same year they were forced to quit Dudley Sports Centre (at the junction of Tipton Road and Birmingham Road) due to mining subsidence. They played at Round Oak Sports Ground in Brierley Hill for the next 11 years, and then spent a season ground-sharing at Halesowen Town, before resigning from the Southern League due to financial difficulties. The club was reformed in 1999 to compete in the West Midlands Regional League, and currently ground-share with Stourbridge at the War Memorial Athletic Ground.
In 1981, when still playing at Dudley Sports Centre, Dudley Town played a prestigious game against Wolverhampton Wanderers to commemorate a refurbishment of the stadium, with the new floodlights being switched on by legendary former Wolves player Billy Wright.
For some time after leaving Dudley Sports Centre, there were hopes that it could be made safe for Dudley Town to return, but these plans never materialised and the site was instead redeveloped as a business and leisure complex which has been developing since 2000. The club currently play at The Dell Stadium in Pensnett.

===Rugby football===

The Dudley Kingswinford Rugby Club is the local rugby team, which play at their grounds in Wall Heath.[tpl]cite web|title=Location|url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/dudleykingswinfordrugbyclub/location/|publisher=Dudley Kingswinford Rugby Club|accessdate=2 January 2013[/tpl]

===Motor sports===

For a short period, a speedway team called Dudley Heathens attempted to find a site to race in Dudley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/sport/other-sport/speedway/2013/12/11/heathens-come-back-at-cradley/ |title= Heathens come back at Cradley |publisher=Express and Star|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]
Currently the team plays in Wolverhampton and Birmingham due to the lack of a speedway track within the Dudley borough. The team were originally called the Cradley Heath Heathens, due to the proximity of their home track at Dudley Wood Stadium to the Cradley Heath/Dudley boundary. The stadium was demolished in the mid-1990s to make way for housing development, with the club disbanding shortly afterwards, before it re-formed with its the name Dudley Heathens in 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=Cradley Heathens from a Stoke Potter's perspective|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Sport/Cradley-Heathens-from-a-Stoke-Potters-perspective.htm|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=Black Country Bugle|date=18 March 2010[/tpl] Though there have been attempts by the club to move back into the town, they have so far been rejected by the local authority.[tpl]cite news|title=Council leader: I'm not ignoring Heathens|url=http://www.halesowennews.co.uk/news/10293863.Council_leader__I_m_not_ignoring_Heathens/|accessdate=30 June 2013|newspaper=Halesowen News|date=15 March 2013[/tpl] The team re-adopted the name Cradley Heathens in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dudleyheathens.co/homepage|title= Cradley Heathens|publisher=Cradley Heathens|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]
