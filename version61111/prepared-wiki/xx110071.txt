The community is served by its own stop on the Norristown High Speed Line, formerly the Philadelphia and Western Railway.
Garrett Hill is mainly a residential community, but also includes a small commercial area (near the intersection of Conestoga Road and Garrett Avenue) consisting of a few bars and other small businesses that serve the community and the student population of nearby Villanova University.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20091013_Neighbors_rally_to_guide_Garrett_Hill_s_development.html?page=1&c=y
One of Garrett Hill's traditions is an annual community Fourth of July parade, followed by a free picnic with live music and other entertainment in Clem Macrone Park.
Garrett Hill's housing stock consists largely of 19th century and early 20th century buildings, including Victorian single-family homes and twins, and brick rowhouses.

==History==

Originally called Garretville or Methodist Hill, the community originally consisted of residences of workers at a nearby stone quarry and at a brickyard (now both disappeared). The residents also worked at the estates which were common in the area.  Garrett Hill is also the former home of Emlen Tunnell, the first African-American inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame.http://desmoinesregister.com/sports/extras/hall/tunnell.html
