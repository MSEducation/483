==So You Think You Can Dance Season 4==

On So You Think You Can Dance, he was paired up with Katee Shean, Courtney Galiano, Chelsie Hightower, and Stephen "tWitch" Boss. Along with Katee, he made the final four without an appearance in the Bottom 3 couples or Bottom 4 contestants. While on the show Allen had done performances in hip-hop, broadway, samba, contemporary, west coast swing, Viennese Waltz, rumba, Argentine tango, disco, lyrical jazz, and jive. It should also be noted that Allen has done the first Bollywood dance and trepak of America's So You Think You Can Dance, with Katee and tWitch, respectively.
Allen was consistently praised for his innate ability to adapt to the diverse range of dance styles assigned to him throughout the season.  There was also a belief that he had no prior formal training, but Allen has since clarified the issue and revealed that he had some previous training in several different dance styles including modern, ballet, and jazz.http://blog.zap2it.com/korbitv/2008/08/sytycd-winner-j.html On July 30, 2009, Allen returned, along with fellow Season 4 contestant Chelsie Hightower, to perform their Emmy nominated Argentine Tango, choreographed by Season 2 contestant Dmitry Chaplin.
