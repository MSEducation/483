Emanuel David "Manu" Ginóbili ([tpl]IPA-es|emaˈnwel xiˈnoβili[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|ʝiˈnoβili|[/tpl]; born 28 July 1977) is an Argentine professional basketball player. Coming from a family of professional basketball players, he is a member of the Argentine men's national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Hailed as one of the finest European-based players to grace the NBA, he plays a high-tempo and intense game. He is one of only two players, along with Bill Bradley, to have won a Euroleague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/london-2013/main-page/i/112584/7980 |title=An Oxford scholar turned European champion |publisher=Euroleague.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]
Ginóbili spent the early part of his basketball career in Argentina and Italy, where he won several individual and team honors. His stint with Italian side Kinder Bologna was particularly productive; he won two Italian League MVP awards, the Euroleague Finals MVP and the 2001 Euroleague and Triple Crown championships. Selected as the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, the shooting guard is considered one of the biggest draft steals of all time. Ginóbili joined the Spurs in 2002, and soon became a key player for the team. He has earned three NBA championship rings and was named an All-Star in 2005 and 2011. In the 2007–08 season, he was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year. Ginóbili has also enjoyed success with the Argentina national team. He made his debut in 1998, and helped win the gold medal during the 2004 Olympics Basketball Tournament.

==Family and personal life==

Ginóbili comes from an Italian Argentine family of basketball players. His oldest brother, Leandro, retired in 2003 after seven years in the Argentine basketball league, while brother Sebastián has played in both the local league and the Spanish Liga Española de Baloncesto. Their father Jorge was a coach at a club in Bahía Blanca, where Ginóbili learned to play the game.Ludden, Johnny, "Mover and shaker: Motor always has been running for Spurs' Ginobili", mysanantonio.com, 11 June 2005. Retrieved 18 August 2007. Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bahía Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan, Ginóbili's love for basketball grew rapidly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Ginobili/Ginobili_bio.html |title=Manu Ginobili – Bio |publisher=Jockbio.com |date=|accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]

==Professional career==

===Argentine and Italian years (1995-2002)===

Ginóbili made his professional debut in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club team of La Rioja from 1995–1996, and was traded to Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca the next year.Manu Ginoboli Info Page – Bio, nba.com. Retrieved 17 June 2007. He played with his hometown team until playing basketball in Italy attracted him, and in 1998 he moved to Europe, spending the 1998–1999 and 1999–2000 seasons with Basket Viola Reggio Calabria. In 1999, he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver and Sydney Johnson to earn promotion from the Italian 2nd Division to the Italian 1st Division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW07-08/05-1121/features_captain.html?SPID=4231&SPSID=46548&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=10600|title=The Captain Returns: Basketball’s Sydney Johnson ’97 has been ‘a coach all along’|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=21 November 2007|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|author=Tomlinson, Brett[/tpl] Ginóbili then entered the 1999 NBA Draft and the San Antonio Spurs selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick.Manu Ginobili, Argentina, interbasket.net. Retrieved 17 June 2007. However, he did not sign with the Spurs at this point. Instead, he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna, which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship, the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 Euroleague, where he was named the Euroleague 2000–01 Euroleague Finals MVP. He was also named the Italian League MVP in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and made the Italian league's All-Star game three times during this period.

===San Antonio Spurs (2002-present)===

It was not until after the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis that Ginóbili joined the Spurs.
There, he made the All-Tournament team alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojaković,FIBA World Basketball Championships, insidehoops.com. Retrieved 18 August 2007. and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish. In his first season in the NBA, Ginóbili played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. He spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record.Manu Ginobili Info Page – Career Stats and Totals, nba.com. Retrieved 9 June 2007.2002–03 Standings, nba.com/history. Retrieved 9 June 2007. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, and this was when Ginóbili rose to prominence.
In contrast to his regular season, Ginóbili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich's rotational set up in the playoffs, playing in every game. The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles2003 Playoff Results, nba.com/history. Retrieved 9 June 2007. and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, securing San Antonio's second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro ("Golden Olympia") as Argentina's sportsperson of the year,Agencia Diarios y Noticias, "Todos los ganadores de los Olimpia de Oro" (Spanish), ar.news.yahoo.com, 17 December 2007. Retrieved 7 January 2008. and even met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner. A gym in Bahía Blanca was dedicated in Ginóbili's honor as well.
In the 2003–04 season, Ginóbili began featuring more regularly for the Spurs, starting in half of the 77 regular season games he played in. His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs met their perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals.

While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.
After some initial issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals,At a Glance, nba.com.

Retrieved 17 June 2007. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan. The former finished the 2004–05 season as the second leading scorer on the team. During the season, he became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro, this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tevez.
The 2005–06 season was an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play. He managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season. During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.At a Glance, nba.com. Retrieved 17 June 2007.
In the 2006–07 season, the Spurs lacked energy from their reserves and Ginóbili provided it by coming off the bench for most of the second half of the season helping the Spurs attain the best record in the second half of the season. Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.Parker, Spurs Close Out Cavs for Fourth Title nba.com, 15 June 2007.

Ginóbili was to play an even bigger role for the Spurs the following season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage.

==Player profile==

Ginóbili is a 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205 lb (93 kg) left-handed shooting guard who has been deployed either as a sixth man or starter for the Spurs. He has established himself as a reliable and versatile back court presence, and was a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was very common.
Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style of play, Ginóbili is known for his clutch play.Kamla, Rick, "Living the Playoffs: Manu to the Rescue", nba.com, 9 May 2008. Retrieved 12 May 2008. This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, and his performances in San Antonio's championship-winning campaigns. Ginóbili's modus operandi however, causes concerns for some of his opponents. His go-to move is either a 3-pointer or a fierce attack to the basket, while he often lowers his head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates. He is also willing to draw charges on defense. In 2007, he was even listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at No. 6 on the list of greatest floppers in NBA history.Neumann, Thomas, "The greatest floppers in NBA history", 7 June 2007. Retrieved 22 June 2007. Five years later, Ian Thomsen, a Sports Illustrated columnist, grouped Ginóbili with fellow European league players Anderson Varejão and Vlade Divac as the players who "made flopping famous", by exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in soccer games.[tpl]cite web| url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/ian_thomsen/09/28/nba-flopping-david-stern/ | title= NBA's new flopping policy the best response to a difficult problem | date= 28 September 2012 | first= Ian |last= Thomsen |work= Sports Illustrated | publisher= cnn.com| accessdate=28 September 2012| quote= The ugly trend of faking physical contact began in soccer, a sport in which gamesmanship has given way to players writhing in false agony around the world. Soccer has been unable to fix its problem, but now the NBA will have an opportunity to deter players from trying to simulate violent contact in ways made famous by Vlade Divac, Manu Ginobili and Anderson Varejao.[/tpl]
