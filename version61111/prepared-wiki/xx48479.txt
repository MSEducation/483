Kennedy enrolled in the University of Virginia School of Law in 1956, and also attended the Hague Academy of International Law during 1958. At Virginia he was in the middle of the class ranking but was the winner of the prestigious William Minor Lile Moot Court Competition.[tpl]cite journal |author=McCarten, Tim |title=UVA Law's 7 Senators |journal=Virginia Law Weekly |date=September 8, 2006 |volume=59 |issue=2 |url=http://www.lawweekly.org/?module=displaystory&story_id=1252&edition_id=38&format=html |accessdate=[/tpl] While there, his fast automotive habits were curtailed when he was charged with reckless driving and driving without a license. He was officially named as manager of his brother John's 1958 Senate re-election campaign, while attending law school, and Ted's ability to connect to ordinary voters on the street helped bring a record-setting victory margin that gave credibility to John's presidential aspirations.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 25–27. In practice, Larry O'Brien and Kenneth O'Donnell were the actual campaign managers. Kennedy graduated from law school in 1959.

==Family and early career==

While attending law school, Kennedy met Virginia Joan Bennett when he was delivering a speech at Manhattanville College in October 1957.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 23–24. Bennett was a senior there, had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but was unfamiliar with the world of politics. After their engagement she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but his father insisted that the wedding should proceed. They were married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, New York, with the reception being held at the nearby Siwanoy Country Club.Bly, The Kennedy Men, p. 195. Together they had three children: Kara (February 27, 1960 – September 16, 2011), Ted, Jr. (born September 26, 1961), and Patrick J. (born July 14, 1967).  By the mid-1960s, their marriage was in trouble due to Ted's womanizing and Joan's growing alcoholism.
Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 27–30.
Following his victory in the presidential election, John vacated his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until February 22, 1962, when he would turn thirty. Initially Ted wanted to stay out West and do something other than run for office right away; he said, "The disadvantage of my position is being constantly compared with two brothers of such superior ability." His brothers were not in favor of his running immediately either, but Ted coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers' and their father overruled them. Therefore, John asked Massachusetts Governor Foster Furcolo to name Kennedy family friend Ben Smith as interim senator for John's unexpired term, which he did in December 1960.This was done so under the authority of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Massachusetts state law. This kept the seat available for Ted.[tpl]cite news |title=Teddy & Kennedyism |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,940066,00.html |date=September 28, 1962 |accessdate=May 23, 2008 | magazine=Time[/tpl] Meanwhile, Ted started work in February 1961 as an assistant district attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he first developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 33–35. He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours with the goal of improving his foreign policy credentials.Hersh, Edward Kennedy, p. 121, 132.  On a nine-nation Latin American trip in 1961, FBI reports from the time showed Kennedy meeting with Lauchlin Currie, an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals in each country whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers.  Reports from the FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/03/01/fbi_memo_tied_kennedy_to_brothel_leftists_in_61/ | title=FBI memo tied Kennedy to brothel, leftists in '61 | author=Stockman, Farah | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=March 1, 2011 | accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Miga, Andrew | date=February 28, 2011 | url=http://www.salon.com/news/ted_kennedy/index.html?story=/news/feature/2011/02/28/Ted_Kennedy_rented_brothel_in_chile |title=Ted Kennedy rented a brothel in 1961 | magazine=Salon | agency= Associated Press |accessdate= February 28, 2011[/tpl]Hersh, Edward Kennedy, p. 132.  The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy's foreign policy views, and in subsequent Boston Globe columns he warned that the region might turn to Communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in a more effective way. Kennedy also began speaking to local political clubs and organizations.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/16/chapter_2_the_youngest_brother/ | title=Chapter 2: The Youngest Brother: Turbulence and tragedies eclipse early triumphs | author=Swidey, Neil | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 16, 2009 | accessdate=February 24, 2009[/tpl]
In the 1962 U.S. Senate special election in Massachusetts, Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. McCormack, Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy's slogan was "He can do more for Massachusetts", the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 791. McCormack had the support of many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which later became public during the race. Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, "Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?" But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner. In a televised debate, McCormack said "The office of United States senator should be merited, and not inherited," and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy "would be a joke". Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing, and with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin. In the November special election, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55 percent of the vote.[tpl]cite news | title=Edward Kennedy (Dem) | newspaper=The Washington Times | date=May 5, 2006[/tpl]

==United States Senator==

===First years and assassinations of two brothers===

Kennedy was sworn in to the Senate on November 7, 1962. He maintained a deferential attitude towards the older, seniority-laden Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 43, 45–47.  Compared to his brothers in office, he lacked John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either of them.
On November 22, 1963, while Kennedy was presiding over the Senate—a task given to junior members—an aide rushed in to tell him that his brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot; his brother Robert soon told him that the President was dead. Ted, with his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to tell his father (afflicted by a stroke suffered in December 1961) the news.
On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a passenger in a private Aero Commander 680 airplane flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. It crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield .[tpl]cite news |title=Teddy's Ordeal |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,898150,00.html |magazine=Time |date=June 26, 1964 |accessdate=May 23, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Kennedy-N344S.htm | publisher=Check-Six.com | title=The Luck of the Kennedys | accessdate=February 24, 2009 | date=May 8, 2008[/tpl]  The pilot and Edward Moss, one of Kennedy's aides, were killed.[tpl]cite news |title=John F.

He suffered chronic back pain for the rest of his life.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 244, 305, 549.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1807447,00.html | title=In the Senate, Ted Kennedy Still Rules | author=Newton-Small, Jay | magazine=Time | date=May 17, 2008 | accessdate=June 20, 2009[/tpl] Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services.  His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.
Kennedy returned to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane and employing a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax at the state and local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there),[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/road/s38.cfm | title=The Road to Civil Rights: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | accessdate=September 18, 2011[/tpl] thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States.[tpl]cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7 |pages= 268–269[/tpl] He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.
Following in the Cold Warrior path of his fallen brother, Kennedy initially said he had "no reservations" about the expanding U.S. role in the Vietnam War, acknowledging that it would be a "long and enduring struggle". Kennedy held hearings on the plight of refugees in the conflict, which revealed that the U.S. government had no coherent policy for refugees.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 80–82. Kennedy also tried to reform "unfair" and "inequitable" aspects of the draft.  By the time of a January 1968 trip to Vietnam, Kennedy was disillusioned by the lack of U.S. progress, and suggested publicly that the U.S. should tell South Vietnam, "Shape up or we're going to ship out."Clymer, A Biography, pp. 99–103.

Ted initially advised his brother Robert against challenging the incumbent President Johnson for the Democratic nomination in the 1968 presidential election. Once Eugene McCarthy's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary led to Robert's presidential campaign starting in March 1968, Ted recruited political leaders for endorsements to his brother in the Western states.[ref]
