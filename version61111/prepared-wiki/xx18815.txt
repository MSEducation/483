Amanda, previously known as Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver is an open source computer archiving tool that is able to back up data residing on multiple computers on a network. It uses a clientâ€“server model, where the server contacts each client to perform a backup at a scheduled time.
Amanda was initially developed at the University of Maryland and is released under a BSD-style license.Amanda Copyright. Amanda.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-04. Amanda is available both as a free community edition and fully supported enterprise edition. Amanda runs on almost any Unix or Unix-like systems.

Amanda supports both tape-based and disk-based backup, and provides some useful functionality not available in other backup products.  Amanda supports tape-spanning - i.e. if a backup set does not fit in one tape, it will be split into multiple tapes.
Among its key features is an intelligent scheduler which optimizes use of computing resources across backup runs.
