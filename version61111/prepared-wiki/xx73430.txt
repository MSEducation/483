Kushner said at the time that his quotes were "grossly mischaracterized." Kushner told the Jewish Advocate in an interview, "All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am."Shayndi Raice. "Brandeis graduation honoree draws fire." The Jewish Advocate. May 4, 2006. In an interview with the Jewish Independent, Kushner commented, "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a one-state solution, which is not true." However, he later stated that he hopes that "there might be a merging of the two countries because they're geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map," although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug07/archives07Aug24-01.html|date=August 24, 2007 |title=Tony Kushner as film subject|author=Cynthia Ramsey|publisher=Jewish Independent[/tpl]
