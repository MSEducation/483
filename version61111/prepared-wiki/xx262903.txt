==History==

AfterCollege was one of the first entry-level job boards on the Internet, created in 1996 by students at Stanford University and originally called "The Job Resource". The service allowed students at Stanford to upload their resumes for employers to browse. The web site grew in popularity and soon after spread to other campuses.  In 1999, the service was incorporated and renamed AfterCollege.[tpl]cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7941844 |title=AfterCollege, Inc.: Private Company Information |publisher=BusinessWeek |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] In 2009, AfterCollege received a Webby Honoree Award for best design in the employment category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current_honorees.php?media_id=96&category_id=22&season=13 |title=Webby Honorees |publisher=Webbyawards.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] In early 2010, AfterCollege was named one of the top niche career sites by members of the public in an online competition run by the United States Department of Labor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.careeronestop.org/jobseekertools/jobSeekerChallenge.aspx?category=2&subcategory=5&keyword=&searchTab=&recommanded=Y&recommandedCategory=&recommandedSubCategory= |title=Niche Job Boards: Students |publisher=Careeronestop.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101226130556/http://www.careeronestop.org/jobseekertools/jobSeekerChallenge.aspx?category=2&subcategory=5&keyword=&searchTab=&recommanded=Y&recommandedCategory=&recommandedSubCategory=| archivedate= 26 December 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
