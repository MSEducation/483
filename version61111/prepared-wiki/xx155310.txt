==Production==

Filmed in 1933, this cautionary tale was produced under the name Weldon Pictures, because Columbia did not want to be associated with the topic of the film.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] Along with the controversial subject matter, this is also noteworthy for containing one of the earliest filmed nude scenes in a sequence where a group of fun-loving women strip naked and go skinny dipping.
Although some scenes in the film were cut by state film censor boards in Maryland and Ohio, it was still very popular in the United States. For example, in Baltimore 65,000 persons, representing approximately 10% of the population, saw the film.
