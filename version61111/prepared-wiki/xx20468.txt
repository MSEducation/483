Return of the Jedi, later released as Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, is a 1983 American epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand and written by George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, with Lucas as executive producer. It is the third film released in the Star Wars franchise and the first film to use THX technology. The film is set one year after The Empire Strikes Back[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/movies/episode-vi/|title=Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=March 4, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100212102456/http://www.starwars.com/movies/episode-vi/ |archivedate=February 12, 2010[/tpl] and was produced by Howard Kazanjian and Lucasfilm Ltd.
The evil Galactic Empire, under the direction of the ruthless Emperor Palpatine, is constructing a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance. Since Palpatine plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine, effectively bringing an end to the Empire once and for all. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, the Rebel leader and Jedi Apprentice, struggles to bring Darth Vader, who is his father Anakin and himself a fallen Jedi, back from the Dark Side of the Force.
David Lynch and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to a few weeks earlier to allow Industrial Light & Magic to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to [tpl]Start date|1982|3[/tpl], with Lucas handling second unit work. Strict secrecy surrounded the production and the film used the working title Blue Harvest to prevent price gouging.
The film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, receiving mostly positive reviews. The film grossed over $475 million worldwide. Several home video and theatrical releases and revisions to the film followed over the next 20 years. Star Wars continued with Episode I: The Phantom Menace as part of the film series' prequel trilogy. A sequel, Star Wars Episode VII, was announced on October 30, 2012 and it is set for release on December 18, 2015.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2012/10/30/disney-planning-new-star-wars-movie-with-lucasfilms-purchase| title=Disney Planning New 'Star Wars' Movie With Lucasfilm Purchase | work=Forbes | date=October 30, 2012 | accessdate=October 31, 2012 | author=Pomerantz, Dorothy[/tpl]

==Plot==

Luke Skywalker initiates a plan to rescue Han Solo from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt with the help of Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. Leia infiltrates Jabba's palace on Tatooine disguised as a bounty hunter and releases Han from a block of carbonite, but she is captured and enslaved. Luke arrives soon afterward and allows himself to be captured. After Luke survives a battle with the Rancor, Jabba sentences Luke and Han to death by being eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke breaks free and a large battle engages, during which Leia strangles Jabba to death, Han knocks Boba Fett into the gaping maw of the Sarlacc and Luke destroys Jabba's sail barge. While Han and Leia meet with the other Rebels, Luke returns to Dagobah, only to find that Yoda is dying. With his last breaths, Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father; he also mentions "another Skywalker". The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi confirms Luke's insight that the "other Skywalker" Yoda spoke of is Luke's twin sister, Leia. Obi-Wan then tells Luke that he must fight Vader again to defeat the Empire.
The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a new Death Star, and hatches a plan to destroy it. Both Vader and his Sith master Emperor Palpatine, the Empire's ruler, are aboard to supervise its completion. Han leads a strike team to destroy the battle station's shield generator on the forest moon of Endor, allowing a squadron of starfighters to enter the incomplete superstructure and destroy the station from within. The strike team, with Luke in tow, travels to Endor in an Imperial shuttle; Vader senses Luke's presence on the shuttle, but lets them through so that they will be ambushed by the Imperial forces lying in wait on Endor. Sensing Vader's presence, Luke fears he is endangering the mission.
On Endor, Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and after an initial conflict, form a partnership with them. Later, Luke confesses to Leia that she is his sister, that Vader is their father and that he is leaving to confront him. Luke surrenders to Imperial troops, so that they will bring him to Vader. He unsuccessfully tries to convince Vader to turn from the dark side of the Force. Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intent on turning his son to the dark side.
With the Death Star fully operational, the Emperor says it is set to destroy the Rebellion. On Endor, Han's strike team is captured by Imperial forces, but a surprise counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to launch an attack. Meanwhile, Lando in the Millennium Falcon leads the Rebel fleet to attack the Death Star, only to find the station's shield is still active and the Imperial fleet is waiting for them. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger and join the dark side, and Luke and Vader engage in a lightsaber duel. Vader discovers that Leia is Luke's sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Luke, enraged at this possibility, attacks Vader, severing his father's right hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi. Furious, the Emperor attacks him with Force Lightning. Unable to watch his son suffer, the suppressed 'good side' in Vader is rekindled and he kills the Emperor, thus fulfilling the prophecy that he would be the one to bring balance to the force. In the process, however, Vader is mortally wounded by the Emperor's lightning. With his dying breaths, the redeemed Vader asks Luke to remove his mask so he can look on his son with his own eyes instead of through the mask. Now revealed as Anakin Skywalker, he asks Luke to tell Leia that there was still good left in him after all.
On Endor, the strike team, with the help of the Ewoks, defeats the Imperial forces and destroys the shield generator base, allowing the Rebel fleet to launch a final assault on the Death Star. Lando leads the remaining ships into the station's core and destroys the main reactor. Luke escapes on Palpatine's Imperial shuttle with his father's body, while Lando escapes in the Falcon just moments before the Death Star explodes. On Endor, Han tells Leia that he knows she loves Luke and offers to step aside; she tells him that Luke is her brother and kisses him. That evening, Luke returns to Endor and cremates his father's armor on a funeral pyre. As the Rebels celebrate the end of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker watching over them.

===Development===

As with the previous film, Lucas personally funded Return of the Jedi.Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, 2004 Lucas approached David Lynch, who had been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for The Elephant Man in 1980, to helm Return of the Jedi, but Lynch declined in order to direct Dune.[tpl]cite web | year=2007| title=David Lynch: Weird at Heart | work=Belfast Telegraph | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/article2298474.ece | accessdate=March 5, 2007[/tpl] David Cronenberg was also offered the chance to direct the film, but he declined the offer to make Videodrome and The Dead Zone.Shawn Adler (September 20, 2007). "Cronenberg's Aborted Job Offer: Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Director's Chair?". MTV Movies Blog Lucas eventually chose Richard Marquand. Some reports have suggested that Lucas was so heavily involved in the shooting of Return of the Jedi that he could be considered a second or a co-director. It is likely that he directed much of the second unit work personally as the shooting threatened to go over schedule; this is a function Lucas had willingly performed on previous occasions when he had only officially been producing a film (e.g. Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Empire Strikes Back, More American Graffiti).[tpl]Cite book|title=Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas|author=Dale Pollock|publisher=Da Capo|year=1999|isbn=0-573-60606-4[/tpl] Lucas himself has admitted to being on the set frequently due to Marquand's relative inexperience with special effects.

Fox Home Entertainment, 2004 Marquand did note that Lucas kept a conspicuous presence on set, joking, "It is rather like trying to direct King Lear – with Shakespeare in the next room!"[tpl]Cite book | author=Marcus Hearn | title = The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher=Harry N.

The screenplay was written by Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas (with uncredited contributions by David Peoples and Marquand), based on Lucas' story. Kasdan claims he told Lucas that Return of the Jedi was "a weak title", and Lucas later decided to name the film Revenge of the Jedi. The screenplay itself was not created until rather late in pre-production, well after a production schedule and budget had been created by Kazanjian and Marquand had been hired, which was unusual for a film. Instead, the production team relied on Lucas' story and rough draft in order to commence work with the art department. When it came time to formally write a shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas; Kasdan used tape transcripts of these meetings to then construct the script.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Richard Patterson |date=June 1983| title=Return of the Jedi: Production and Direction, p. 3| journal=American Cinematographer| url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg3.htm | accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] The issue of whether Harrison Ford would return for the final film arose during pre-production. Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and Raiders of the Lost Ark had made him an even bigger star. Ford suggested that Han Solo be killed through self-sacrifice. Kasdan concurred, saying it should happen near the beginning of the film to instill doubt as to whether the others would survive, but Lucas was vehemently against it and rejected the concept. Yoda was originally not meant to appear in the film, but Marquand strongly felt that returning to Dagobah was essential to resolve the dilemma raised by the previous film. The inclusion led Lucas to insert a scene in which Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is Luke's father because, after a discussion with a children's psychologist, he did not want younger moviegoers to dismiss Vader's claim as a lie. Many ideas from the original script were left out or changed. For instance, the Ewoks were going to be Wookiees,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett.

Gary Kurtz, who produced Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back but was replaced as producer for Return of the Jedi, claimed in 2010 that the ongoing success with Star Wars merchandise and toys led George Lucas to reconsider the idea of killing off Han Solo in the middle part of the film during a raid on an Imperial base.  Luke Skywalker was also to have walked off alone and exhausted like the hero in a Spaghetti Western, but Lucas opted for a happier ending to encourage higher merchandise sales.Geoff Boucher (August 12, 2010).

===Filming===

Filming began on January 11, 1982 and lasted through May 20, 1982, a schedule six weeks shorter than The Empire Strikes Back. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting as early as possible in order to give Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) as much time as possible to work on effects, and left some crew members dubious of their ability to be fully prepared for the shoot.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Richard Patterson |date=June 1983| title=Return of the Jedi: Production and Direction, p. 4|  journal=American Cinematographer| url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg4.htm |  accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] Working on a budget of $32,500,000,[tpl]Cite journal| author=Richard Patterson |date=June 1983| title=Return of the Jedi: Production and Direction, p. 1|  journal=American Cinematographer| url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg1.htm | accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] Lucas was determined to avoid going overbudget as with The Empire Strikes Back. Producer Howard Kazanjian estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million. However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back had been big hits. The project was given the working title Blue Harvest with a tagline of "Horror Beyond Imagination." This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented price gouging by service providers.
The first stage of production started with 78 days at Elstree Studios in England, where the film occupied all nine stages. The shoot commenced with a scene later deleted from the finished film where the heroes get caught in a sandstorm as they leave Tatooine. (This was the only major sequence cut from the film during editing.) While attempting to film Luke Skywalker's battle with the rancor beast, Lucas insisted on trying to create the scene in the same style as Toho's Godzilla films by using a stunt performer inside a suit. The production team made several attempts, but were unable to create an adequate result. Lucas eventually relented and decided to film the rancor as a high-speed puppet. In April, the crew moved to the Yuma Desert in Arizona for two weeks of Tatooine exteriors. Production then moved to the redwood forests of northern California near Crescent City where two weeks were spent shooting the Endor forest exteriors, and then concluded at ILM in San Rafael, California for about ten days of bluescreen shots. One of two "skeletal" post-production units shooting background matte plates spent a day in Death Valley. The other was a special Steadicam unit shooting forest backgrounds from June 15–17, 1982 for the speeder chase near the middle of the film.[tpl]Cite journal |title=Return of the Jedi: Steadicam Plates, p. 3 |journal=American Cinematographer |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/stcm/pg3.htm |accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown personally operated these shots as he walked through a disguised path inside the forest shooting at less than one frame per second. By walking at about [tpl]convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|0[/tpl] and projecting the footage at 24 frame/s, the motion seen in the film appeared as if it were moving at around [tpl]convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Music===

John Williams composed and conducted the film's musical score with performances by the London Symphony Orchestra. Orchestration credits also include Thomas Newman. The initial release of the film's soundtrack was on the RSO Records label in the United States. Sony Classical Records acquired the rights to the classic trilogy scores in 2004 after gaining the rights to release the second trilogy soundtracks (The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones). In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of Return of the Jedi along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film. Despite the Sony digital re-mastering, which minimally improved the sound heard only on high-end stereos, this 2004 release is essentially the same as the 1997 RCA Victor release.[tpl]cite web | title=Star Wars / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi   (Original Soundtracks – 2004 reissue)|   url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2004/Sep04/star_wars.html | accessdate=January 20, 2007[/tpl]

===Post-production===

Meanwhile, special effects work at ILM quickly stretched the company to its operational limits. While the R&D work and experience gained from the previous two films in the trilogy allowed for increased efficiency, this was offset by the desire to have the closing film raise the bar set by each of these films. A compounding factor was the intention of several departments of ILM to either take on other film work or decrease staff during slow cycles. Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20 hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983. Of about 900 special effects shots, all VistaVision optical effects remained in-house, since ILM was the only company capable of using the format, while about 400 4-perf opticals were subcontracted to outside effects houses.[tpl]cite web | title=Return of the Jedi: Production and Direction, p. 2|  work=American Cinematographer| url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg2.htm | accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] Progress on the opticals was severely retarded for a time due to ILM rejecting about [tpl]convert|100000|ft|m[/tpl] of film when the film perforations failed image registration and steadiness tests.

===Title change===

The original teaser trailer for the film carried the name Revenge of the Jedi.Revenge of the Jedi Trailer from Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD Bonus Disc, 2004 In December 1982, Lucas decided that "Revenge" was not appropriate and returned to his original title. By that time thousands of "Revenge" teaser posters (with artwork by Drew Struzan) had been printed and distributed. Note that the poster reverses the correct color of the light sabers; Luke is seen wielding a red lightsaber while Vader wields a blue one [tpl]cite web | title=Collecting: Revenge of the Jedi| work=TheForce.Net | url=http://www.theforce.net/collecting/posters/rotj/advance.asp | accessdate=August 21, 2007[/tpl], while in the movie Luke's one is green and Vader's one red.

==Releases==

Return of the Jedi's theatrical release took place on May 25, 1983. It was originally slated to be May 27, but was subsequently changed to coincide with the date of the 1977 release of the original Star Wars film. With a massive worldwide marketing campaign, illustrator Tim Reamer created the image for the movie poster and other advertising. At the time of its release, the film was advertised on posters and merchandise as simply Star Wars:  Return of the Jedi, despite its on-screen "Episode VI" distinction. The original film was later re-released to theaters in 1985.
In 1997, for the 20th anniversary of the release of Star Wars (retitled Episode IV: A New Hope), Lucas released The Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition. Along with the two other films in the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi was re-released on March 14, 1997 with a number of changes and additions, which included the insertion of several alien band members in Jabba's throne room, the modification of the Sarlaac to include a beak, the replacement of music at the closing scene, and a montage of different alien worlds celebrating the fall of the Empire.[tpl]cite web | work=StarWars.com | title=Episode VI: What Has Changed?|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-vi/release/video/f20060908/index.html| date=September 8, 2006| accessdate=March 10, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229064256/http://www.starwars.com/episode-vi/release/video/f20060908/index.html |archivedate = February 29, 2008[/tpl] According to Lucas, Return of the Jedi required fewer changes than the previous two films because it is more emotionally driven than the others. The changes have caused controversy among the fans as some believe that they detract from the films.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/gamemakers/features/48017/This_Aint_Your_Daddys_Star_Wars.html|title=This Ain't Your Daddy's Star Wars|author=Steve Dove|publisher=G4|date=September 20, 2004|accessdate=March 10, 2008[/tpl]

While the action set pieces – particularly the Sarlacc battle sequence, the speeder bike chase on the Endor moon, the space battle between Rebel and Imperial pilots, and Luke Skywalker's duel against Darth Vader – are well-regarded, the ground battle between the Ewoks and Imperial stormtroopers remains a bone of contention.[tpl]Cite news|title=The best – and worst – movie battle scenes|publisher=CNN|date=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/29/movie.battles/index.html|accessdate=April 1, 2007[/tpl] Fans are also divided on the likelihood of Ewoks (being an extremely primitive race of small creatures armed with sticks and rocks) defeating an armed ground force comprising the Empire's "best troops". Lucas has defended the scenario, saying that the Ewoks' purpose was to distract the Imperial troops and that the Ewoks did not really win.

The original theatrical version of Return of the Jedi was released on VHS and Laserdisc several times between 1986 and 1995,[tpl]cite web | work=davisdvd.com | title=Star Wars Home Video Timeline: Return of the Jedi | url=http://www.davisdvd.com/misc/starwars/ep6.htm | accessdate=June 23, 2007 [/tpl] followed by releases of the Special Edition in the same formats between 1997 and 2000. Some of these releases contained featurettes; some were individual releases of just this film, while others were boxed sets of all three original films.
On September 21, 2004, the Special Editions of all three original films were released in a boxed set on DVD (along with a bonus disc). It was digitally restored and remastered, with additional changes made by George Lucas. The DVD also featured English subtitles, Dolby Digital 5.1 EX surround sound, and commentaries by George Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher. The bonus disc included documentaries including Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy and several featurettes including "The Characters of Star Wars", "The Birth of the Lightsaber", and "The Legacy of Star Wars". Also included were teasers, trailers, TV spots, still galleries, and a demo for Star Wars: Battlefront.
With the release of Revenge of the Sith, which depicts how and why Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, Lucas once again altered Return of the Jedi to bolster the relationship between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. The original and 1997 Special Edition versions of Return of the Jedi featured British theatre actor Sebastian Shaw playing both the dying Anakin Skywalker and his ghost. In the 2004 DVD and 2011 Blu-ray release, Shaw's portrayal of Anakin's ghost is replaced by Hayden Christensen, who portrayed Anakin in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The change drew further fan criticism directed toward Lucas.
All three films in the original unaltered Star Wars trilogy were later released, individually, on DVD on September 12, 2006. These versions were originally slated to only be available until December 31, 2006, although they remained in print until May 2011 and were packaged with the 2004 versions again in a new box set on November 4, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/20080826news.html |title=Star Wars Saga Repacked in Trilogy Sets on DVD |accessdate=November 8, 2008 |work=Lucasfilm |publisher=StarWars.com |date=August 28, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081026032957/http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/20080826news.html  |archivedate=October 26, 2008 [/tpl]  Although the 2004 versions in these sets each feature an audio commentary, no other extra special features were included to commemorate the original cuts.
A Blu-ray Disc version of the Star Wars saga was announced for release in 2011 during Star Wars Celebration V. Several deleted scenes from Return of the Jedi were included for the Blu-ray version, including a sandstorm sequence following the Battle at the Sarlacc Pit, a scene featuring Moff Jerjerrod and Death Star officers during the Battle of Endor, and a scene where Darth Vader communicates with Luke via the Force as Skywalker is assembling his new lightsaber before he infiltrates Jabba's palace.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/themovies/saga/mebd/bluray/index.html|title=George Lucas Announces Star Wars on Blu-Ray at Celebration V |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |work=Lucasfilm |publisher=StarWars.com |date=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100816235346/http://www.starwars.com/themovies/saga/mebd/bluray/index.html  |archivedate=August 16, 2010 [/tpl] On January 6, 2011, the release was announced for September 2011 in three different editions and the cover art was unveiled in May. Although selling well, the Blu-ray caused yet more criticism towards Lucas as the set featured further alterations and the original versions were not included.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.starwars.com/themovies/saga/preorder_bluray/index.html| title=Pre-order Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu-ray Now!| work=StarWars.com| publisher=Lucasfilm| date=January 6, 2011| accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Novelization===

The novelization of Return of the Jedi was written by James Kahn and was released on May 12, 1983, thirteen days before the film's release.[tpl]cite web | title=Star Wars, Episode VI — Return of the Jedi (Mass Market Paperback)|publisher=Amazon.com | url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345307674 | accessdate=March 6, 2007[/tpl] It contains many scenes that were deleted from the final cut as well as certain assertions which have since been superseded by the prequel trilogy. For example, Kahn writes that Owen Lars is the brother of Obi-Wan Kenobi, while in Attack of the Clones he is instead shown to be the stepbrother of Anakin Skywalker. When Leia is captured by Jabba, instead of him saying "I'm sure" to her warning of her powerful friends, he says, "I'm sure, but in the meantime, I shall thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company." Additionally, instead of simply licking his lips as seen in the movie, he is described as planting "a beastly kiss squarely on the Princess's lips." Later, the Force spirit of Obi-Wan reveals that he was able to hide Luke and Leia from Anakin because he did not know that his wife was pregnant when he "left," presumably when he became Vader. This is partly contradicted by Revenge of the Sith, in which Anakin is unaware his wife was expecting twins and believes their child died with her. A facet of the story which was made more clear in the novel was the confusion which overtook the Imperial forces upon the death of Palpatine, who ceased to be the guiding will animating the Empire. It also further supports the events depicted in all post-Return of the Jedi fiction.

===Radio drama===

A radio drama adaptation of the film was written by Brian Daley with additional material contributed by John Whitman and was produced for and broadcast on National Public Radio in 1996. It was based on characters and situations created by George Lucas and on the screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas. The first two Star Wars films were similarly adapted for National Public Radio in the early 1980s, but it was not until 1996 that a radio version of Return of the Jedi was heard. Anthony Daniels returned as C-3PO, but Mark Hamill and Billy Dee Williams did not reprise their roles as they had for the first two radio dramas. They were replaced by newcomer Joshua Fardon as Luke Skywalker and character actor Arye Gross as Lando Calrissian. John Lithgow voiced Yoda, whose voice actor in the films has always been Frank Oz. Bernard Behrens returned as Obi-Wan Kenobi and the late Brock Peters reprised his role as Darth Vader. Veteran character actor Ed Begley, Jr. played Boba Fett. Edward Asner also guest-starred speaking only in grunts as the voice of Jabba the Hutt. The radio drama had a running time of three hours.[tpl]cite web | work=HighBridge Audio | title=Return of the Jedi Produced by NPR|url=http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/returnofjedi.html| accessdate=March 6, 2007[/tpl]
Principal production of the show was completed on February 11, 1996. Only hours after celebrating its completion with the cast and crew of the show, Daley died of pancreatic cancer. The show is dedicated to his memory.
The cast and crew recorded a get-well message for Daley, but the author never got the chance to hear it. The message is included as part of the Star Wars Trilogy collector's edition box set.

===Comic book adaptation===

Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Archie Goodwin and artists Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Tom Palmer, and Ron Frenz. The adaptation appeared in Marvel Super Special #27Marvel Super Special #27 at the Grand Comics Database and as a four-issue limited series.Star Wars: Return of the Jedi at the Grand Comics Database[tpl]cite book|last = Edwards|first = Ted|title = The Unauthorized Star Wars Compendium|chapter= Adventures in the Comics|publisher = Little, Brown and Company|year = 1999|page = 87|isbn = 9780316329293|quote= The adaptation of Return of the Jedi was published in Marvel Super Special #27 and in a separate miniseries, once again penciled by Al Williamson and inked by Carlos Garzon.[/tpl] It was later reprinted in a mass market paperback.The Marvel Comics Illustrated Version of Star Wars Return of the Jedi at the Grand Comics Database

===Book-and-record set===

Lucasfilm adapted the story for a children's book-and-record set. Released in 1983, the 24-page Star Wars: Return of the Jedi read-along book was accompanied by a 33⅓ rpm 7-inch gramophone record. Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the film with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records.
