[[Logical conjunction]]

CATEGORIES: Logical connectives

In logic and mathematics, a two-place logical operator  and, also known as logical conjunction,Moore and Parker, Critical Thinking results in true if both of its operands are true, otherwise the value of false.
The analogue of conjunction for a (possibly infinite) family of statements is universal quantification, which is part of predicate logic.

==Notation==

==Definition==

Logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of true if and only if both of its operands are true.
The conjunctive identity is 1, which is to say that AND-ing an expression with 1 will never change the value of the expression. In keeping with the concept of vacuous truth, when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity, the empty conjunction (AND-ing over an empty set of operands) is often defined as having the result 1.
