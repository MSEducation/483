The sport of lacrosse was played at the 1904 Summer Olympics, which marked the first time that lacrosse had been featured at the Olympic Games.  Only three men's teams competed â€” two from Canada and one from the USA. One of the Canadian teams consisted entirely of Mohawk Indian players.

The Shamrock Hockey Team is more commonly known as the Winnipeg Shamrocks, and is unrelated to the then Canadian champions Montreal Shamrocks.

A second American team, the Brooklyn Crescents, was originally slated to round out the field, but eventually did not participate.
