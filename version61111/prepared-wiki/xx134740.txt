EndNote is a commercial reference management software package, used to manage bibliographies and references when writing essays and articles. It is produced by Thomson Reuters.

==Features==

EndNote groups citations into "libraries" with the file extension *.enl and a corresponding *.data folder.
There are several ways to add a reference to a library: manually, exporting, importing, connecting from EndNote. The program presents the user with a window containing a drop-down menu to select the type of reference they require (book, newspaper article, film, congressional legislation, etc.), and fields ranging from the general (author, title, year) to those specific to the kind of reference (ISBN, abstract, reporter's name, running time, etc.) Most bibliographic databases allow users to export references to their EndNote libraries. This enables the user to select multiple citations and saves the user from having to manually enter the citation information and the abstracts. There are some databases (e.g. PubMed) in which the user needs to select citations, select a specific format, and save them as .txt files. By then going to EndNote, the user can then import the citations into the EndNote software.
It is also possible to search library catalogs and free databases such as PubMed from within the EndNote software program itself.
If the user fills out the necessary fields, EndNote can automatically format the citation into whatever format the user wishes from a list of over two thousand different styles.
For example, here are some citations from Gray's Anatomy using several different styles:
In Windows, EndNote creates a file with an *.enl extension, along with a *.data folder containing various MySQL files with *.myi and *.myd extensions. EndNote can be installed so that its features, like Cite While You WriteTM, appear in the Tools menu of Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org Writer.
EndNote can export citation libraries as plain text, Rich Text Format, HTML or XML.
The current version of EndNote has networking capabilities, and files can reside on a central server. It does not, however, have multi-user capabilities for editing a single bibliographic file.
Endnote can also organize PDFs on the user's hard drive (or full text on the web) through links to files or by inserting copies of PDFs. It is also possible to save a single image, document, Excel spreadsheet, or other file type to each reference in an EndNote library. Starting from EndNote X version 1.0.1, formatting support for OpenDocument files (ODT) using the Format Paper command is supported.

==Legal dispute with Zotero==

In September 2008, Thomson Reuters, the owners of EndNote, sued the Commonwealth of Virginia for $10 million and requested an injunction against competing reference management software.
George Mason University's Center for History and New Media developed Zotero, a free/open source extension to Mozilla Firefox. Thomson Reuters alleges that the Zotero developers reverse engineered and/or decompiled EndNote, that Zotero can transform proprietary EndNote citation style files (.ens) to the open Citation Style Language format, that they host files converted in this manner, and that they abuse the "EndNote" trademark in describing this feature. Thomson Reuters claims that this is violation of the site license agreement. They also added a restrictive click-thru license to their styles download web site.
George Mason University responded that it would not renew its site license for EndNote and that
"anything created by users of Zotero belongs to those users, and that it should be as easy as possible for Zotero users to move to and from the software as they wish, without friction."  The journal Nature editorialized that "the virtues of interoperability and easy data-sharing among researchers are worth restating. Imagine if Microsoft Word or Excel files could be opened and saved only in these proprietary formats, for example. It would be impossible for OpenOffice and other such software to read and save these files using open standards â€” as they can legally do."[tpl]Cite doi|10.1038/455708a[/tpl]
The case was dismissed on June 4, 2009.
