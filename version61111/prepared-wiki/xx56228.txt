[[Operation Nougat]]

CATEGORIES: Nevada Test Site nuclear explosive tests

Operation Nougat was a series of 44 nuclear tests conducted (with one exception) at the Nevada Test Site in 1961 and 1962, immediately after the Soviet Union abrogated a testing moratorium, with the US' Mink test shot taking place the day before the Soviets test-detonated the Tsar Bomba. Most tests were limited-yield underground test shots.http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Nougat.html New designs would be further developed in atmospheric testing during Operation Dominic I and II.
Operation Dominic I and II would follow Operation Nougat, with some testing overlap. Operation Hardtack II preceded Nougat and the testing moratorium.
