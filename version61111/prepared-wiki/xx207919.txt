Following this inquiry, he was chosen to chair a Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds.

He presided over the libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken against The Guardian and Granada Television.
While presiding over the High Court case brought by the athlete Linford Christie against former criminal John McVicar, the editor of Spike magazine, he was widely reported as asking, "What is Linford's lunchbox?". He later claimed that this was intended as a joke.Legal legend and the 'lunchbox' question – The Times 20 May 2003 The question was in the tradition of British jurisprudence, in which the judge asks seemingly inane questions relevant to the facts of the case on the assumption that the jury, which cannot ask questions, is ignorant of them. Following this case, the name "Mr Justice Cocklecarrot" was revived by Private Eye magazine (it was originally the name of a character in the Beachcomber column in the Daily Express) which became the magazine's generic name for unworldly and out-of-touch judges, though Popplewell asserts that this description did not apply to him.The real world of Oliver Popplewell – the guardian 20 May 2003

==Hillsborough controversy==

On 19 October 2011 he sparked fury by calling on the Liverpool families involved in the Hillsborough disaster to behave more like the relatives of victims of the Bradford City stadium disaster. He made the comments in a letter to The Times following the Commons debate[tpl]cite news|title=Hillsborough decision 'a victory for democracy'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-15349118|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2011|date=18 October 2011[/tpl] on 17 October 2011 calling for all Cabinet papers on Hillsborough to be released.
