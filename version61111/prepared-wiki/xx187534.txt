The Doñana Disaster, also known as the Aznalcollar Disaster or Guadiamar Disaster (Sp: Desastre de Aznalcollar, Desastre del Guadiamar), was an industrial accident in Andalusia, southern Spain. On 25 April 1998, a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine, near Aznalcóllar, Seville Province, releasing 4–5 million cubic metres of mine tailings. The acidic tailings, which contained dangerous levels of several heavy metals, quickly reached the nearby River Agrio, and then its affluent the River Guadiamar, travelling about 40 kilometres along these waterways before they could be stopped.[tpl]citation | title = El desastre ecológico de Aznalcóllar | last1 = Aguilar | first1 = J. | last2 = Dorronsoro | first2 = C. | last3 = Fernández | first3 = E. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = J. | last5 = García | first5 = I. | last6 = Martín | first6 = F. | last7 = Ortiz | first7 = I. | last8 = Simón | first8 = M. | url = http://edafologia.ugr.es/Donana/aznal.htm | publisher = University of Granada | accessdate = 10 October 2010[/tpl].
