Margaret River is a town in the South West of Western Australia, located in the valley of the eponymous Margaret River, [tpl]convert|277|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Perth, the state capital. Its Local Government Area is the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River.
Margaret River's coast to the west of the town is a renowned surfing location, with world wide notoriety for its surf breaks. Colloquially, the area is referred to as Margs http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/16381257/champs-rolls-into-margs-for-pro/
The surrounding area is the Margaret River Wine Region and is known for its wine production and tourism, attracting an estimated 500,000 visitors annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://svc004.wic437d.server-web.com/images/MARGS/factsheet.pdf|title=Augusta Margaret River Region - Fact Sheet|author=Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association|year=2005|accessdate=1 May 2007[/tpl] In earlier days the area was better known for hardwood timber and agricultural production.

==History==

The town is named after the river, which is presumed to be named after Margaret Whicher, cousin of John Garrett Bussell (founder of Busselton) in 1831. The name is first shown on a map of the region published in 1839.  European migrants lived in the area as early as 1850, with timber logging commencing in around 1870. By 1910, the town had a hotel which also operated as a post office.
After World War I, an attempt by the Government of Western Australia to attract migrants to Western Australia (known as the Group Settlement Scheme) and establish farms in the region attracted new settlers to the town. In 1922 over 100 settlers moved into the district.
In the early 1920s the Busselton to Margaret River Railway was built and in 1925 the Margaret River to Flinders Bay line opened.

==Geography and climate==

 

Margaret River is located [tpl]convert|9|km|0[/tpl] inland from the Indian Ocean at a point about halfway between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia's South West region.
The climate is humid Mediterranean, with an average annual rainfall of around [tpl]convert|1130|mm|in[/tpl]. Most rain falls between May and August, when around two days in three record measurable rainfall and around one in ten over [tpl]convert|10|mm|in[/tpl]. On occasions, as in August 1955, the town has had measurable rain on every day of a month in this period. During the summer, the weather is very warm, though there are usually sea breezes, and frequently sunny. The hot dry summers, coupled with strong winds, creates an environment where there is always a high risk of bush fires.

==Wine Region==

Margaret River is the foremost Geographical Indication wine region in the South West Australia Zone, with nearly [tpl]convert|55|km2[/tpl] under vine and over 138 wineries as at 2008. The region is made up predominantly of boutique-size wine producers, although winery operations range from the smallest, crushing [tpl]convert|3.5|t[/tpl] per year, to the largest at around [tpl]convert|7000|t[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|title= The Australian Wine Encyclopedia |publisher= Hardie Grant Books |year=2009|ISBN=978-1-74066-774-6|author= James Halliday|pages= 166–167[/tpl]Campbell Mattinson, "Why the French hate us", Hardie Grant Books 2007  The region produces just three percent of total Australian grape production, but commands over 20 percent of the Australian premium wine market.
Stretching some [tpl]convert|100|km|-1[/tpl] from north to south and about [tpl]convert|27|km[/tpl] wide in parts, the region is bounded to the east by the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge, between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin, and to the west by the Indian Ocean. A Mediterranean-style climate, lacking extreme summer and winter temperatures, provides ideal growing conditions.  The climate is described as similar to that of Bordeaux in a dry vintage.
Humidity levels are ideal during the growing period and the combination of climate, soil and viticulture practices leads to consistently high quality fruit of intense flavour. Consequently, annual vintage results continue to exceed expectations and reinforce Margaret River's reputation as one of the premium wine-producing regions of the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.margaretriverwine.org.au/aboutregion.php|work=Margaret River wine region|title= Margaret River wine region|accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl]The Australian and New Zealand wine industry directory, 27th Annual edition, 2009, Winetitles.
The principal grape varieties in the region are fairly evenly split between red and white; Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Shiraz, Merlot, Chenin blanc and Verdelho.Oz Clarke, 'Oz Clarke's Pocket Wine Guides', Harcourt 1 November 2002

==Surfing breaks==

The Margaret River area has acquired a range of synonyms for the collection of surf breaks nearby Blair, Larry and Horan, Cheyne Wave Finder Australia (3rd edition) ISBN 0-9581726-6-8  give the name Margarets Area to the Cape Naturaliste to Boranup Sandpatch area and identify over 30 named breaks Usually significant surfing competitions concentrate their locale to Margarets Main Break (aka Surfers Point) which breaks in the vicinity of Prevelly at the mouth of Margaret River.http://www.margaretriver.com/pages/surf-spots/
The actual range of surf breaks range from the eastern side of Cape Naturaliste down to just south of Cape Hamelin, and despite web sites and online sources calling the whole Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin region the Margaret River surfing area, conditions and break types vary along the coast.
