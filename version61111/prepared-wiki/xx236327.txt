Chionopappus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, containing the single species Chionopappus benthamii. It is endemic to Peru, where it occurs at elevations up to 2500 meters in the central part of the country.Dillon, M. O., et al. (2009). Liabeae. Chapter 27 In: Funk, V. A., et al. Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of Compositae. International Association for Plant Taxonomy. 2009. 417-37. It is also sometimes found in the lomas of northern Peru, a type of moist oasis formed by fog that accumulates along the hills in the coastal desert region.Torres, M.

This plant is distinguished from other members of the tribe Liabeae by its reddish disc florets and its plumelike pappus of bristles.Gutiérrez, D. G. (2010). Inkaliabum, a new Andean genus of Liabeae (Asteraceae) from Peru. Boletín de la Sociedad Argentina de Botánica 45(3-4), 363-72.
