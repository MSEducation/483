Moutai or Maotai ([tpl]SSE|600519[/tpl]) is a Chinese liquor, a sauce-scented brand of baijiu. Maotai is distilled from fermented sorghum and now comes in different versions ranging in alcohol content from the standard 53% by volume down to 35%.
It is produced in the town of Maotai near the city of Renhuai in southwestern China's Guizhou. The official spelling "Moutai" is based on the company's traditional romanization; "Maotai" is the pinyin for the same name. Within China, it is believed that the town of Maotai possesses a unique climate and vegetation that contributes to the taste of the drink.
