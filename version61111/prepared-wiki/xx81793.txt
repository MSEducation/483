A tawaif (Urdu: طوائف) also Kanjri or Kanjari was a courtesan who catered to the nobility of India, particularly during the era of the Mughal Empire.

==History==

The patronage of the Mughal court before and after the Mughal Dynasty in the Doab region and the artistic atmosphere of 16th century Lucknow made arts-related careers a viable prospect. As well as the demand for (mostly) male music and dance teachers, many girls were taken at a young age and trained in both performing arts (such as Kathak and Hindustani classical music) as well as literature (ghazal, thumri) to high standards.[tpl]cite news |title= A hundred years of unsung love|author= |url= http://www.mid-day.com/specials/2010/jun/130610-gauhar-jaan-first-gramaphone-record-artist-thumris-ghazals-mysore.htm|newspaper= Mid Day|date= |accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl]  
Once they had matured and possessed a sufficient command over dancing and singing, they became a tawaif, high-class courtesans who served the rich and the nobility.[tpl]cite news |title= The Last Song of Awadh|author= |url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-last-song-of-awadh/502153/0|newspaper=Indian Express |date= |accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl] It is also believed that young nawabs-to-be were sent to these "tawaifs" to learn "tameez" and "tehzeeb" which included the ability to differentiate and appreciate good music and literature, perhaps even practice it, especially the art of ghazal writing. By the 18th century they had become the central element of polite, refined culture in North India.
These courtesans would dance, sing (especially ghazals), recite poetry (shairi) and entertain their suitors at mehfils. Like the geisha tradition in Japan,[tpl]cite news |title= Courtesans resisted male dominance|author= |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-12-29/lucknow/27292450_1_male-dominance-oldenburg-lucknow|newspaper= Times of India|date= 29 December 2002|accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl] their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose among the best of their suitors.
Some of the popular tawaifs were Begum Samru - who rose to rule principality of Sardhana in western UP, Moran Sarkar - who became wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Wazeeran - Prot of Lucknow’s last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, Umrao Jaan Ada, and Gauhar Jaan.

==Decline==

The annexation of Oudh by the British in 1856 sounded the first death-knell for this medieval institution. It soon was not favoured by the British empire for their consolidation and the women were branded as prostitutes to defame them.

==Popular culture==
