Karine Sergerie (born February 1, 1985) is the 2007 world champion in women's lightweight (under 63 kg) taekwondo. She is Canada's first female world champion in the sport. 

==Biography==

Sergerie was born in Sainte-Catherine, Quebec, Canada. Her father and coach, Rejean, introduced her to karate at age five. She competed in karate from 1992–1998. He continued to coach her when she took an interest in taekwondo after her older brother took up the sport. She is the six-time consecutive national champion (2002–2007).

==Career==

Sergerie won a silver medal at the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships. Despite this accomplishment, she did not qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics because of a "contradiction in the selection process". One set of requirements said she needed to win a gold at the Pan-American Games to qualify, while another one did not. Although she did win a bronze medal at the 2003 Pan-Am Games, the Taekwondo Federation of Canada ruled it was not enough.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/olympians/story/2008/05/27/f-olympics-taekwondo-sergerieprofile.html |title=World champion finally gets her shot|author=Kristina Rutherford|accessdate=2008-08-02|date=2008-07-12|publisher=CBC Sports[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
