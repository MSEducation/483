CATEGORIES: Metzgeriales, Parasitic plants

Cryptothallus mirabilis is a species of liverworts in the family Aneuraceae, and was first described in 1933.[tpl]cite book | last = Schuster | first = Rudolf M. | year = 1992 | title = The Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of North America | volume=V | pages=574–579 | location=Chicago | publisher = Field Museum of Natural History | isbn = 0-914868-20-9 [/tpl]  Plants of this species are white as a result of lacking chlorophyll, and their plastids do not differentiate into chloroplasts.[tpl]cite journal | last=Sigee | first=D.

Cryptothallus mirabilis is a subterranean myco-heterotroph that obtains its nutrients from the abundant fungi growing among its tissues rather than from photosynthesis.  Until recently, it was the only species of bryophyte known with this combination of characteristics,[tpl]cite book | last=Schofield | first=W. B. | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Bryology | pages=184, 192 | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-02-949660-8 [/tpl] but a second species Cryptothallus hirsutus was discovered in Costa Rica in 1996.[tpl]cite journal | last=Crum | first=Howard | coauthors=James Bruce | year=1996 | title=A new species of Cryptothallus from Costa Rica | journal=The Bryologist | volume=99 | issue=4 | pages=433–438 [/tpl] The infecting fungus is a basidiomycete, which is also the case in fungi associated with the related genera Aneura and Riccardia. However, this is not the case for other members of the Metzgeriales that have been studied.
The plants are small, seldom growing more than three centimeters long.  They grow in bogs and are typically found underneath peat moss or other dense moss growth near birch trees.[tpl]cite journal | last=Hill | first=David Jackson | year=1969 | title=The absence of chlorophyll in the spores of Cryptothallus mirabilis Malmb. | journal=Transactions of the British Bryological society | volume=5 | issue=4 | pages=818–819 [/tpl]  Plants have been found in locations across northern Europe, and once in Greenland.
The species is dioicous, with individual plants producing either antheridia or archegonia, but never both.  The female plants (with archegonia) are typically ten times the size of the male plants.  The development of reproductive structures in Cryptothallus is not controlled by photoperiod, but does require a temperature of at least [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F[/tpl] following a period of sufficiently low temperature.[tpl]cite book | last=Chopra | first=R.
