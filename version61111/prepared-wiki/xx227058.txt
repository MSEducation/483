==History==

William Procter, a candlemaker, and James Gamble, a soapmaker, both born in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, emigrated from England and Ireland respectively. They settled in Cincinnati initially and met when they married sisters, Olivia and Elizabeth Norris.[tpl]cite book|last=Dyer|first=Davis|first2=Frederick |last2=Dalzell |first3=Rowena |last3=Olegario |title=Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Procter & Gamble |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |year= 2004 |isbn=1-59139-147-4 [/tpl] Alexander Norris, their father-in-law, called a meeting in which he persuaded his new sons-in-law to become business partners. On October 31, 1837, as a result of the suggestion, Procter & Gamble was created.
In 1858–1859, sales reached $1 million. By this point, approximately 80 employees worked for Procter & Gamble. During the American Civil War, the company won contracts to supply the Union Army with soap and candles. In addition to the increased profits experienced during the war, the military contracts introduced soldiers from all over the country to Procter & Gamble's products.
In the 1880s, Procter & Gamble began to market a new product, an inexpensive soap that floats in water. The company called the soap Ivory. William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a profit-sharing program for the company's workforce in 1887. By giving the workers a stake in the company, he correctly assumed that they would be less likely to go on strike.
The company began to build factories in other locations in the United States because the demand for products had outgrown the capacity of the Cincinnati facilities. The company's leaders began to diversify its products as well and, in 1911, began producing Crisco, a shortening made of vegetable oils rather than animal fats. As radio became more popular in the 1920s and 1930s, the company sponsored a number of radio programs. As a result, these shows often became commonly known as "soap operas."
The company moved into other countries, both in terms of manufacturing and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the Thomas Hedley Co., based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide laundry detergent in 1946 and Prell shampoo in 1947. In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest. Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin Paper Mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other paper products. Once again focusing on laundry, Procter & Gamble began making Downy fabric softener in 1960 and Bounce fabric softener sheets in 1972. One of the most revolutionary products to come out on the market was the company's Pampers, first test-marketed in 1961. Prior to this point disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling.
Procter & Gamble acquired a number of other companies that diversified its product line and significantly increased profits. These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, and the Iams Company, among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from leveraged positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, Procter & Gamble again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved a new product developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks.
In January 2005 P&G announced an acquisition of Gillette, forming the largest consumer goods company and placing Unilever into second place. This added brands such as Gillette razors, Duracell, Braun, and Oral-B to their stable. The acquisition was approved by the European Union and the Federal Trade Commission, with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P&G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight. It also divested Gillette's oral-care toothpaste line, Rembrandt toothpaste. The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft & Drink, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation.[tpl]cite news |title=Dial Agrees to Buy P&G Deodorant Brands |date=February 21, 2006 |first=Constance |last=Wherrity |work=Pierce Mattie Public Relations New York blog |url= http://www.piercemattie.com/blogs/2006/02/dial_agrees_to_buy_pg_deodoran.html |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl] The companies officially merged on October 1, 2005. Liquid Paper, and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate were sold to Newell Rubbermaid. In 2008, P&G branched into the record business with its sponsorship of Tag Records, as an endorsement for TAG Body Spray.[tpl]cite web|url= http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |title=P&G Must Proceed With Caution |publisher=Marketing Doctor Blog |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl]

===Productions===

Procter & Gamble produced and sponsored the first radio soap operas in the 1930s (Procter & Gamble's being known for detergents—soaps—was the genesis of the term "soap opera")[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]. When the medium switched to television in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the new serials were sponsored and produced by the company. The serial The Young and the Restless is currently broadcast on CBS and is still partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble. When As the World Turns left the air on September 17, 2010, The Young and the Restless, became the only soap opera left that is partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble.
These past serials were produced by Procter & Gamble:
[tpl]col-begin[/tpl][tpl]col-break[/tpl]
Procter & Gamble also was the first company to produce and sponsor a prime-time show, a 1965 spin-off of the daytime soap opera As the World Turns called Our Private World. In 1979, PGP produced Shirley, a prime-time NBC series starring Shirley Jones which lasted thirteen episodes. They also produced TBS' first original comedy series, Down to Earth, which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced). They also distributed the syndicated comedy series Throb. Procter & Gamble Productions originally co-produced Dawson's Creek with Sony Pictures Television, but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. It also produced the 1991 TV movie A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story, which was co-produced by The Landsburg Company. It also produces the People's Choice Awards.
In addition to self-produced items, Procter & Gamble also supports many Spanish-language novellas through advertising on networks such as Univision, Telemundo, Telefutura, and Azteca America. Procter & Gamble was one of the first mainstream advertisers on Spanish-language TV during the mid-1980s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
In 2008, P&G expanded into music sponsorship when it joined Island Def Jam to create Tag Records, named after a body spray that P&G acquired from Gillette. In April 2010, after the cancellation of As the World Turns, PGP announced they were officially phasing out of the soap industry and expanding into more family appropriate programming.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07music.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=media&adxnnlx=1215442912-P1oe44maZMAEL5WOZFKoBw/ |first=Robert |last=Levine |title=It’s American Brandstand: Marketers Underwrite Performers |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |title=P&G Must Proceed With Caution |publisher=Marketing Doctor Blog |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl]
Procter & Gamble also gave a $100,000 contract to the winners of Cycle 1 through 3 of Canada's Next Top Model, wherein Andrea Muizelaar, Rebecca Hardy and Meaghan Waller won the prize.
As of 2013, PGP has rebranded itself as Procter & Gamble Entertainment (PGE) with a new logo and an emphasis on multi-platform entertainment production.

==Controversies==

===Price fixing===

In April 2011, P&G was fined 211.2m euros by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel in Europe along with Unilever, who was fined 104m euros, and Henkel (not fined). Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after P&G and Unilever admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13064928 |work=BBC News  | title=Unilever and Procter & Gamble in price fixing fine | date=April 13, 2011[/tpl]

===Toxic shock syndrome and tampons===

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a disease caused by strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless commensals in places such as the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with tampons.
In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble.[tpl]cite web|last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |last2=Mikkelson |first2=David |url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/tampax.asp |title=Tampax Pearl |publisher=Snopes.com |date=December 31, 2005 December 31 |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could in fact hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.
In the summer of 1980, the Centers for Disease Control released a report explaining how these bacterial mechanisms were leading to TSS. They also stated that the Rely tampon was associated with TSS more than any other brand of tampon. In September 1980, Procter & Gamble voluntarily recalled its Rely brand of tampons from the market and agreed to provide for a program to notify consumers. Since the 1980s, reported cases of TSS have dramatically decreased.[tpl]cite web|last=Mcpherson |first=Marianne |url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/companion.asp?id=13&compID=38 |title=Sexual Anatomy, Reproduction, and the Menstrual Cycle |date=March 2005 |publisher=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl]

===Animal testing===

On June 30, 1999, Procter & Gamble announced that it would limit its animal testing practices to its food and drug products which represents roughly 80% of its product portfolio.[tpl]cite news |first=Dana |last=Canedy |title=P.& G. to End Animal Tests For Most Consumer Goods |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1999 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/business/p-g-to-end-animal-tests-for-most-consumer-goods.html |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl] The company invested more than $275 million in the development of alternative testing methods.[tpl]cite web | title= Animal Welfare and Alternatives| url=http://www.pg.com/en_US/sustainability/point_of_view/animal_welfare.shtml |publisher=Procter & Gamble |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl]

===Other products===

In 2002, P&G was sued for its ads falsely suggesting to the consumers that the drug Prilosec could cure heartburn in a day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3076971/ns/health-digestive_diseases |title= Over-the-counter Prilosec to debut |date=Oct 15, 2003 |accessdate=Jul 6, 2013[/tpl] In December 2005, the Pharmaceutical division of P&G was involved in a dispute over research involving its osteoporosis drug Actonel.

In October 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed in the State of Georgia alleging that many users of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, with the active ingredient Cetylpyridinium chloride, suffered stained teeth and loss of their sense of taste as a result.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web2.customwebexpress.com/bellbrig2/UserFiles/File/Crest%20Complaint.pdf |title=In The Superior Court Of Richmond County |format=PDF |accessdate=February 15, 2012[/tpl] Procter & Gamble contends that these side effects occur in only three percent of users. The suit seeks to include disclosure warning users of these side effects on product packaging.

===Logo controversy===

P&G's former logo originated in 1851 as a crude cross that barge workers on the Ohio River painted on cases of P&G star candles to identify them. P&G later changed this symbol into a trademark that showed a man in the moon overlooking 13 stars, said to commemorate the original 13 colonies.[tpl]cite web|title=Procter and Gamble v. Amway 242 F.3d 539|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/242/242.F3d.539.99-20590.html |publisher=U.S. Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit |date=February 14, 2001 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 [/tpl]
The company received unwanted media publicity in the 1980s when rumors spread that the moon-and-stars logo was a satanic symbol. The accusation was based on a particular passage in the Bible, specifically Revelation 12:1, which states: "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars." P&G's logo consisted of a man's face on the moon surrounded by 13 stars. Some claimed that the logo was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded in the aforementioned verse, thus construing the logo to be satanic. Where the flowing beard meets the surrounding circle, three curls were said to be a mirror image of the number 666, or the reflected number of the beast. At the top and bottom, the hair curls in on itself and was said to be the two horns like those of a ram. The moon-and-stars logo was discontinued in 1985 because of the controversy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/762134992.html?dids=762134992:762134992&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+25%2C+1985&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Corporate+news&pqatl=google |title=Corporate news: Procter symbol succumbs to devilish rumor |last=Witt |first= Howard |work=Chicago Tribune |date=April 25, 1985[/tpl]
These interpretations have been denied by company officials and no evidence linking the company to the Church of Satan or any other occult organization has ever been presented. The company unsuccessfully sued Amway from 1995 to 2003 over rumors forwarded through a company voice-mail system in 1995. In 2011, the company successfully sued individual Amway distributors for reviving and propagating the false rumors.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500395_162-2587161.html |publisher=CBS Money Watch |title=Procter & Gamble Wins Satanic Civil Suit |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] The Church of Satan denies being supported by Procter & Gamble.Church of Satan FAQ  16.
