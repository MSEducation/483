==Origin==

The dish originated during the Korean War, and was popular for a time afterwards, when people had little to eat. People made this dish by combining leftover Spam and hot dogs from U.S. Army facilities with whatever else was available.[tpl]cite news|last=Williamson|first=Lucy|title=Why is Spam a luxury food in South Korea?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24140705|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 September 2013[/tpl] All the leftovers were combined with water in a large pot and boiled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Food/food.cfm?Subject=stew#Budae-jjiggae|title=Korean Food: Stews|work=Life in Korea|accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl] The dish is also referred to as Johnson Tang (존슨 탕), combining the surname Johnson for President Lyndon B.

The city of Uijeongbu, which is bordered by Seoul to the south and has many army bases, is famous for its budae jjigae. In the late 20th century, the city of Uijeongbu stipulated that the dish be referred to as Uijeongbu jjigae to remove the military or war-time connotation in the name, though not many restaurants follow this guideline. Some restaurants have begun calling their product Uijeongbu budae jjigae. There is also what locals refer to as "Uijeongbu Budaejjigae Street" where there is a high concentration of buddaejjigae restaurants.[tpl]cite news|title=Uijeongbu restaurant owners take pride in army base stew|url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/06/113_113729.html|accessdate=1 April 2013|newspaper=Korea Times|date=26 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Kim|first=Violet|url=http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/eat/food-map-search-koreas-best-regional-cuisine-391772|title=Food map: Eat your way around Korea|work=CNN Travel|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-12[/tpl]
