"Everlasting Love" is the title of a popular song originally written and recorded by the British singer-songwriter Howard Jones.
Released as the first single from Jones' 1989 album Cross That Line, "Everlasting Love" reached #12 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the late spring of that year, and also peaked at #19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the first of only two singles to appear there. It also spent two weeks at #1 on the US adult contemporary chart, the singer's second chart-topper on this tally (following "No One Is to Blame" from 1986). In his native UK, where Jones had enjoyed numerous pop hits, "Everlasting Love" failed to have as much of an impact as earlier singles, and it stalled at #62 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was co-produced by ex-Tears for Fears band member Ian Stanley.
This was the first of Howard Jones' singles to be released on CD.
