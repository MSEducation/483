The Cape Grass Lizard is ovoviviparous. A discovery has shown females are not breeding at the same time in a year.
This lizard has three subspecies. They are the C. a. anguina, the C. a. oligopholis, and the C. a. tenuior.

==Distribution==

The Cape Grass Lizard is widely distributed in the grasslands of southern Africa. It has been reported in South Africa, Swaziland, Angola, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, the Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The grasslands that the Cape Grass Lizard inhabits often have wildfire.

==Breeding==

The Cape Grass Lizard is ovoviviparous, meaning eggs will stay inside the mother until they are ready to hatch. The average clutch size is three to seventeen eggs. A discovery has revealed that females are breeding throughout the year. This adaptation is probably to prevent the total loss of reproductive gain in a year due to fire.[tpl]cite journal |last= du Toit|first= Annemarie|coauthors= P. le Fras N. Mouton and Alexander F.
