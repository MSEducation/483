The Corpus Christi Sharks were a 2007 expansion member of the af2.  They played their home games at the American Bank Center.  Michael Trigg was the team's head coach. http://www.kristv.com/Global/story.asp?S=5622266 Trigg previously was a head coach in the Arena Football League with the Milwaukee Mustangs, Grand Rapids Rampage and Philadelphia Soul, coaching  the Rampage to victory in ArenaBowl XV. The Sharks folded in October 2009.
The team is not to be confused with the Corpus Christi Hammerheads of the Indoor Football League, the American Bank Center's former tenant now playing again at the American Bank Center, as the Sharks have folded, since there isn't competition in trying to schedule games that might occur on the same day.
