</ref> By contrast, the Sun only rotates once every 25 – 35 days, with an equatorial velocity of 1.994&nbsp;km/s. The star's magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow a [[main sequence star|main sequence star's]] rate of rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.<ref>

Degenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind.[tpl]cite journal | last = Villata | first = Massimo | title=Angular momentum loss by a stellar wind and rotational velocities of white dwarfs | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | year=1992 | volume=257 | issue=3 | pages=450–454 | bibcode=1992MNRAS.257..450V [/tpl] In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second.[ref]
</ref> The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.

===Temperature===

The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production at the core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star's color index.[ref]
