The national parks of New Zealand are 14 protected areas administered by the Department of Conservation "for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the public". These are popular tourist destinations, with three-tenths of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand. Although the national parks contain some of New Zealand's most beautiful scenery, the first few established were all focused on mountain scenery. Since the 1980s the focus has been on developing a more diverse representation of New Zealand landscapes in the national parks. New Zealand's national parks are all culturally significant; many also contain historic features. Tongariro National Park, in particular, is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance, while four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu, another World Heritage Site.

==National Parks Act==

The National Parks Act of 1980 was established in order to codify the purpose, governance and selection of national parks. It begins by establishing the definition of a national park:

The National Parks Act goes on to state that the public will have freedom of entry and access to the parks, though this is subject to restrictions to ensure the preservation of native plants and animals and the welfare of the parks in general. Access to specially protected areas (550 km²) constituted under the act is by permit only.
Under the Act, national parks are to be maintained in their natural state as far as possible to retain their value as soil, water and forest conservation areas. Native plants and animals are to be preserved and introduced plants and animals removed if their presence interferes with the natural wildlife. Development in wilderness areas established under the act is restricted to foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research.

===Services available for public use===

The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and similar facilities, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. In addition to these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by other government agencies, voluntary organisations and private firms. More comprehensive services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are privately provided with concessions from the department.

==Proposed national park==

The area centred on Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville, has been proposed as a possible Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand's remaining kauri, including the largest known kauri, Tāne Mahuta. These stands of kauri are also valuable as havens for endangered species including the North Island Brown Kiwi.[tpl]Cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new+kauri+national+park+northland |title=Beehive — New Kauri National Park for Northland |work=beehive.govt.nz |accessdate=21 August 2010[/tpl] This proposal is currently being investigated by the Department of Conservation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+welcomes+progress+kauri+national+park|title=Minister welcomes progress on Kauri National Park|date=11 February 2010|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=Wellington, NZ[/tpl]

==Mining concerns==

In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which prohibits mining in those areas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pollution/news/article.cfm?c_id=281&objectid=10630166&pnum=0|title=Miners press to enter the green zone|date=6 March 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=26 March 2010|first=Geoff|last=Cumming[/tpl] In July the government abandoned the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which opposed mining.
