==History==

From around 1046 BCE to the emergence of the Qin Dynasty, northwest Guizhou was part of the State of Shu.[tpl]cite book|title=South-West China|edition=2|first=Bradley|last=Maygew|first2=Korina|last2=Miller|first3=Alex|last3=English|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2002|chapter=Facts about South-West China - History|pages=16–20, 24[/tpl] During the Warring States period, the Chinese state of Chu conquered the area, and control later passed to the Dian Kingdom. During the Chinese Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), to which the Dian was tributary, Guizhou was home to the Yelang collection of tribes, which largely governed themselves before the Han consolidated control in the southwest and established the Lingnan province. During the Three Kingdoms period, parts of Guizhou were governed by the Shu Han state based in Sichuan, followed by Cao Wei (220–265) and the Jin Dynasty (265–420).
During the 8th and 9th centuries in the Tang Dynasty, Chinese soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native women, their descendants are known as Lǎohànrén ([tpl]lang|zh|老汉人[/tpl]), in contrast to new Chinese who populated Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eG8cAAAAMAAJ&q=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&dq=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&hl=en&ei=SdPMTIrZOMaAlAez8YWbBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Scottish geographical magazine, Volumes 45-46|author=Scottish Geographical Society|year=1929|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society.|location=|isbn=|page=70|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married these pre-Chinese women.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vqcSAAAAIAAJ&q=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&dq=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&hl=en&ei=r9LMTLz_AsTflgftkNzjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ|title=The Cowrie Shell Miao of Kweichow, Volume 32, Issue 1|author=Margaret Portia Mickey|year=1947|publisher=The Museum|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] Although the Song Dynasty after the Tang did not care to govern the lands south of the Dadu River, the development of Chinese commercial, urban, and Confucian culture in the Song greatly influenced the culture of Guizhou.
Kublai Khan and Möngke Khan conquered the Chinese southwest in the process of defeating the Song during the Mongol invasion of China, and the newly established Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368) saw the importation of Chinese Muslim administrators and settlers from Bukhara in Central Asia.
It was during the following Ming Dynasty, which was once again led by Han Chinese, that Guizhou was formally made a province in 1413. The Ming established many garrisons in Guizhou from which to pacify the Yao and Miao minorities during the Miao Rebellions. Chinese-style agriculture flourished with the expertise of farmers from Sichuan, Hunan and its surrounding provinces into Guizhou. Wu Sangui was responsible for the ousting the Ming in Guizhou and Yunnan during the Manchu conquest of China. During the governorship-general of the Qing Dynasty's nobleman Ortai, the tusi system of indirect governance of the southwest was abolished, prompting rebellions from disenfranchised chieftains and the further centralization of government. After the Second Opium War, criminal triads set up shop in Guangxi and Guizhou to sell British opium. For a time, Taiping Rebels took control of Guizhou, but they were ultimately suppressed by the Qing. Concurrently, Han Chinese soldiers moved into the Taijiang region of Guizhou, married Miao women, and their children were brought up as Miao.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5wOBAAAAMAAJ&q=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&dq=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&hl=en&ei=BNLMTIfrLIK0lQfZkuT8CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Contributions to Southeast Asian ethnography, Issue 7|author=|year=1988|publisher=Board of Editors, Contributions to Southeast Asian Ethnography|location=|isbn=|page=99|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HLERRaLvOXEC&pg=PR17&dq=taijiang+miao+rebellion&hl=en&ei=ruDMTKrdIsH_lgeH1uiYBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=taijiang%20miao%20rebellion&f=false|title=Butterfly mother: Miao (Hmong) creation epics from Guizhou, China|author=Dan Jin, Xueliang Ma, Mark Bender|year=2006|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|isbn=0-87220-849-4|page=xvii|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]

Jenks|location=Honolulu[/tpl] After the overthrow of the Qing in 1911 and following Chinese Civil War, the Communists took refuge in Guizhou during the Long March (1934–1935). While the province was formally ruled by the Guomindang warlord Wang Jialie, the Zunyi Conference in Guizhou established Mao Zedong as the leader of the Communist Party. As the Second Sino-Japanese War pushed China's Nationalist Government to its southwest base of Chongqing, transportation infrastructure improved as Guizhou was linked with the Burma Road.[tpl]cite book|title=Modern China: A Guide to a Century of Change|first=Graham|last=Hutchings|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|chapter=Guizhou Province|pages=176–177[/tpl] After the end of the War, a 1949 Revolution swept Mao into power, who promoted the relocation of heavy industry into inland provinces such as Guizhou, to better protect them from Soviet and American attacks. After the Chinese economic reform began in 1978, geographical factors led Guizhou to become the poorest province in China, with a GDP growth average of 9 percent from 1978–1993.

==Geography==

Guizhou adjoins Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality to the north, Yunnan Province to the west, Guangxi Province to the south and Hunan Province to the east. Overall Guizhou is a mountainous province however it is more hilly in the west while the eastern and southern portions are relatively flat. The western part of the province forms part of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.
Other cities include: Anshun, Kaili, Zunyi, Duyun, Liupanshui and Qingzhen.
Guizhou has a subtropical humid climate. There are few seasonal changes. Its annual average temperature is roughly 10 to 20 °C, with January temperatures ranging from 1 to 10°C and July temperatures ranging from 17 to 28 °C.
Like in China's other southwest provinces, rural areas of Guizhou suffered severe drought during spring 2010. One of China's poorest provinces, Guizhou is experiencing serious environmental problems, such as desertification and persistent water shortages. On 3–5 April 2010, China's Premier Wen Jiabao went on a three days inspection tour in the southwest drought-affected province of Guizhou, where he met villagers and called on agricultural scientists to develop drought-resistant technologies for the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/05/c_13238009.htm|title=China's premier concerned about drought in SW China|publisher=Xinhua|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2008-09-17[/tpl]

===Biodiversity===

The border mountains of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan have been identified as one of the eight plant diversity hotspots in China. The main ecosystem types include evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, and montane elfin forest. Plant species endemic to this region include Abies ziyuanensis, Cathaya argyrophylla, and Keteleeria pubescens.[tpl]cite doi |10.1007/s10531-008-9384-6[/tpl] In broad terms, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is one of the vertebrate diversity hotspots of China. At the level of counties, Xingyi is one of nine Chinese vertebrate diversity (excluding birds) hotspots.[tpl]Cite journal| volume = 10| issue = 4| pages = 359–368| last = Chen| first = Yang| coauthors = An-Ping Chen, Jing-Yun Fang| title = Geographical distribution patterns of endangered fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals and their hotspots in China: a study based on "China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals"| journal = Biodiversity Science| year = 2002[/tpl] Animals only known from Guizhou include Leishan moustache toad, Kuankuoshui salamander, Shuicheng salamander, Guizhou salamander, and Zhijin warty newt.
Caohai Lake with its surroundings is a wetland that is an important overwintering site for many birds. It is a National Nature Reserve and an Important Bird Area identified by BirdLife International.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=15583 |title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Cao Hai Nature Reserve |author=BirdLife International |year=2013 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=24 February 2013[/tpl]

==Transportation==

===Rail===

Guizhou's rail network consists primarily of a cross formed by the Sichuan-Guizhou, Guangxi-Guizhou and Shanghai-Kunming Railways, which intersect at the provincial capital, Guiyang, near the center of the province.  The Liupanshui-Baiguo, Pan County West and Weishe-Hongguo Railways form a rail corridor along Guizhou's western border with Yunnan.  This corridor connects the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, which dips into northwestern Guizhou at Weining, with the Nanning-Kunming Railway, which skirts the southwestern corner of Guizhou at Xingyi.  
As of 2013, the Guiyang-Guangzhou and Chongqing–Guizhou High-Speed Railways are under construction.

==Demographics==

As of 1832, the population was estimated at five million.
Guizhou is demographically one of China's most diverse provinces. Minority groups account for more than 37% of the population and they include Miao (including Gha-Mu and A-Hmao), Yao, Yi, Qiang, Dong, Zhuang, Bouyei, Bai, Tujia, Gelao and Sui. 55.5% of the province area is designated as autonomous regions for ethnic minorities. Guizhou is the province with the highest fertility rate in China, standing at 2.19. (Urban-1.31, Rural-2.42)[tpl]cite web|url=http://repository.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/3892/etd-tamu-2005A-SOCI-Terrell.pdf?sequence=1|title=Fertility in China in 2000 : A County Level Analysis (thesis, 140 p.)|publisher=Texas A & M University|author=Heather Kathleen Mary Terrell|date=May 2005|accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]

The southeastern corner of the province is known for its unique Dong minority culture. Towns such as Rongjiang, Liping, Diping and Zhaoxing are scattered amongst the hills along the border with Guangxi.
The rich population of minorities in Guizhou allow for a great many ethnic festivals throughout the lunar calendar. During the first lunar month (usually February), the early festival in Kaili (east of Guiyang) celebrates local culture with acts of bullfighting, horse racing, pipe playing, and comedy works.
