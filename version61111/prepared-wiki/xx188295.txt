[[Lovett River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Alberta

The Lovett River is a short river in the Alberta foothills.  The Lovett is an early tributary of the Pembina River, itself a major tributary of the Athabasca River.  The Lovett River was formerly known as the Little Pembina River, but to avoid confusion its name was changed.  The new name was derived from Lovettville, a defunct coal mining town in the vicinity.  The settlement took its name from H. A. Lovett, President of North American Collieries, a mining company in the area.Karamitsanis, Aphrodite. Place Names of Alberta, Volume 1.
