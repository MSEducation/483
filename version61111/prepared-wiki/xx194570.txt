A skirmish occurred on the morning of February 10, 2003 outside of Lejay, a small village in the northern, mountainous part of Helmand Province, Afghanistan.  The village is in the Baghran valley, and one of the few highways in Afghanistan passes through it.
American intelligence analysts assert that the village is the focus of the Opium Trade.
Vehicles approaching the village report being fired on.  In response American forces mobilized hundreds of troops to comb the country surrounding the village in Operation Eagle Fury.  The Operation mobilized dozens of coalition warplanes.
