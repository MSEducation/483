The Chanter Sisters, Irene and Doreen Chanter, are a duo of backup singers. They began recording with a family group called the Chanters which also included several of their brothers. 
The sisters then went their own way, recording first under the name Birds of a Feather, and then as The Chanter Sisters, and it is under the latter that they enjoyed their only UK Singles Chart hit when "Sideshow" (not to be confused with the much bigger hit for Barry Biggs with the same title later the same year) entered the chart in July 1976 reaching number 43.
The sisters have been far more successful in their backup singing career. Their credits include work with Elton John, Long John Baldry, Phil Manzanera, Roxy Music, John Miles, The Secret Policeman's Ball, Van Morrison, Roger Waters, Meat Loaf, Joe Cocker and many other famous names. The pair also had uncredited bit parts as schoolgirls in the 1971 schlock horror film, Twins of Evil.
Although the sisters have predominantly worked together, Doreen has had the more extensive musical career, touring without her sister with several of the above named bands. However, the pair continue to work together in the recording studio, providing backup vocals for Chris Farlowe as recently as 2003.
Doreen also found success as a song-writer, being responsible for "Star", a UK hit in 1982 for Kiki Dee.
