CATEGORIES: Types of healthcare facilities, Clinics

A polyclinic (or policlinic), is a place where a wide range of health care services (including diagnostics) can be obtained without the need for an overnight stay. Polyclinics are sometimes co-located with a hospital.

==Etymology==

Greek polis city, klinike (techne) "(practice) at the sickbed," from klinikos "of the bed," kline "bed, couch, that on which one lies". Literally city-clinic, in fact "a clinic held in a private house".

==Function==

A typical polyclinic is an outpatient facility that houses general medical practitioners (GPs) such as doctors and nurses to provide ambulatory care and some acute care services but lacks the major surgical and pre- and post-operative care facilities commonly associated with hospitals. Besides GPs a polyclinic can house outpatient departments of some medical specialties i.e. gynecology, dermatology, ophthalmology, ENT, neurology, pulmonology, cardiology, endocrinology etc. In some university cities polyclinics house outpatient departments of all the teaching hospital in one building.

==Internationally==

Polyclinics are common type of healthcare facility in many countries incl. France, Germany (long tradition), Switzerland and most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (mixed Soviet-German model), as well as in former Soviet republics such as Russia and Ukraine;[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/HealthManagement/ViewResource.aspx?resID=267332 |title=NLH - Health Management - Policlinics |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-07-03[/tpl] and in many countries across Asia and Africa.Google Recent Russian governments have attempted to replace the polyclinic model introduced during Soviet times with a more western model. However, this has failed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ershova I, Rider O, Gorelov V |title=Policlinics in London |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9603 |pages=1890–1 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18068500 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61793-0 |url=[/tpl] India has also set up huge numbers of polyclinics for former defence personnel. The network envisages 426 polyclinics in 343 districts of the country which will benefit about 33 lakh (3.3 million) ex-servicemen  residing in remote and far-flung areas.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/article438777.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=199 Additional Polyclinics For Ex-Servicemen | date=2010-05-26[/tpl] Polyclinics are also the backbone of Cuba's primary care system and have been credited with a role in improving that nation's health indicators.Cuba’s primary health care revolution: 30 years on, Bulletin of the World Health Organization 

==Other uses of the word==

The word "polyclinic" ("policlinico") in Italy refers to a general hospital, not to a polyclinic in the English sense of the word, which would instead be termed a "poliambulatorio".
