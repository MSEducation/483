==History==

Practical Farmers of Iowa was founded in 1985 by Larry Kallem and Richard Thompson resulting from Kallem's attendance at a 1984 on-farm field day on the Thompson farm northwest of Ames in central Iowa. The field day was then an annual event that showed the results of scientific trials in agricultural production techniques. Richard Thompson had for a number of years been actively testing production practices that were both ecologically and economically sound. Kallem sought to make this information and this philosophy more widespread by creating an organization to support and promote it.
