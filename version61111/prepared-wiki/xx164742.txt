Cathedral Preparatory School and Seminary is a private, Roman Catholic high school and seminary in Elmhurst, Queens, New York.  It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.  It is the only full-time high school seminary day school in the United States.

==Background==

Cathedral Preparatory Seminary was established in 1914 in Brooklyn at 555 Washington Avenue as Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception, a six-year minor seminary, with a four-year high school track and a two-year college track. Upon completion of the six-year program, students still discerning a priestly vocation would be assigned to a major seminary. This six-year program was in place until 1967, when Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception was established as a four-year college seminary in Douglaston, New York. The college would continue as a four-year independent academic institution until 1988, when it changed to a college seminary residence and pre-theology program titled Cathedral Seminary Residence of the Immaculate Conception.[tpl]cite book|title=Forgotten New York: views of a lost metropolis |first= Kevin|last= Walsh|publisher =HarperCollins|year= 2006 |page=67|ISBN =978-0-06-114502-5[/tpl]
A second campus in Elmhurst was established in 1963 at 56-25 92nd Street.  In 1985 the Brooklyn campus was closed and the Elmhurst location serves both Kings and Queens Counties. Currently, students from both the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Diocese of Rockville Centre attend Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, as well as one student from the Archdiocese of New York. Since 1968, each summer Cathedral Prep has hosted the Father Edward W. Troike Leadership Program for young men of 6th and 7th grades, as well as incoming freshmen.

==History==

Cathedral Prep and Seminary is a secondary school for young men who have expressed a desire to consider priesthood as an option in discerning a vocation. For this purpose, the school was established in 1914 by the Bishop of Brooklyn, and continues today under the auspices of Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio. In 1963 the Elmhurst division was opened. In 1985 the original Brooklyn school was closed, leaving the Elmhurst school to serve students from both Kings and Queens Counties. Since 1914 nearly 4,000 students have received their high school diplomas from Cathedral Prep. The school alumni include Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Religious and dedicated laity who serve the Church and society.
