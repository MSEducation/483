Club Drive is a racing video game published by Atari for the Atari Jaguar in 1994.

==Summary==

There are multiple game modes including single race and tag. Players can choose from different areas like the Old West and San Francisco. Like many 3D Jaguar games, Club Drive uses little or no textures, instead using flat shaded polygons which gives the game a simple and somewhat primitive look. Club Drive also features a two-player mode.
The player must also gather Power Balls to advance to the next level or must finish the circuit on the stage that the player is on. Power Balls can be found scattered throughout the different racing stages, and when the player makes contact with a Power Ball, an audible "All Right!" can be heard. The game is considered to be one of the worst Atari Jaguar games ever released. Many reviewers criticized this video game for its poor graphics; even for a system that was touted to be 64-bits. The same reviews would critique this game's uncontrollable glitch-filled gameplay.

==Reception==

It has a 4.5/10 rating on GameFAQs. Seanbaby listed this game #2 on his list of "The 20 worst games ever made", and said that the game was "made entirely by the handicapped."
