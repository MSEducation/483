The HAFDASA C-4 is a submachine gun of Argentinian origin and is chambered in 9mm and .45 calibres. It has an aluminium lower receiver and is fed from a wide box magazine (50 rounds for 9x19mm Parabellum rounds and 40 rounds in .45 ACP).*Julio S. Guzmán, Las Armas Modernas de Infantería, Abril de 1953 Its magazine insert has a dust cover that folds open forward to form a grip shrouding the front of the magazines. The C-4 was available with a fixed wooden stock, folding metal stock, full rifle stock and also came as a machine pistol which predates and even outperforms many modern submachine guns.

==History==

Originally it was derived from the HAFDASA 'Ballester-Rigaud C1' model rifle, which was based on the famous Beretta Model 1918/30 submachinegun that was used, among others, by the police of the capital.
The Criolla ("Native") C-2 was originally designed for crews of armored vehicles. Based on the C-2 design, beginning in 1938, Hafdasa manufactured the C-4 in calibers 9mm and .45 ACP. Its frame was built out of forged aluminum and was painted in green, black, or brown colors.
They were originally semiautomatic, although it is known that some were modified at the factory for automatic fire. Those of caliber 9mm had a magazine capacity of 50 cartridges, while the .45 model stored 40 rounds, a high capacity, especially for the era. The magazines are small in size, due to a design using two internal double-stack columns,http://s1.postimage.org/586h3cp9c/DSCF1196.jpg and a feed selector to choose which column to feed from.http://s2.postimage.org/chf4ldxdw/DSCF1193.jpghttp://s2.postimage.org/g118xce15/DSCF1194.jpg Placing the feed selector in its central position prevents the weapon from firing.  The Suomi KP-31 Schillstrom 50 round "coffin" magazines used a similar dual-doublestack design, but lacked the column feed selector.
As with all the weapons manufactured by HAFDASA, the C4 is a practically unbreakable and strong weapon, though as those of its epoch, quite heavy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Variants==

===C-4===

The C-4 was available with fixed and folding stocks for use of the paratroopers, but its design, had a flaw, the box was of cast aluminum, and personnel parachute jump was a torment from a plane with the weapon in their hands, and therefore ceased to be practiced.http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3138/hafdasac4.jpg

===Z-4===

The Z-4 variant came with a full length rifle type stock.http://s2.postimage.org/5e6ip6825/DSCF1190.jpghttp://s2.postimage.org/qnuex8r9a/DSCF1191.jpg
