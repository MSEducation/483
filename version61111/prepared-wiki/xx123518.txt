Love's decision to play for the Bruins brought animosity from fans of the University of Oregon, his father's alma mater, where it was expected he would play. Prior to a game at Oregon, Ducks fans obtained Love's cell phone number and left obscene messages as well as death threats; the fans also subjected Love's family to obscenities and threw garbage at them during the game. This event, along with similar incidents directed at other players, prompted a discussion of whether abuse by college basketball fans is becoming too extreme.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/sioncampus/02/26/abusive.fans0303/index.html|title=Over the Top|last=Wahl|first=Greg|date=February 26, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2008|work=SI.com[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/31/sports/sp-streeter31|title=University must enforce an attitude adjustment in fans|last=Streeter|first=Kurt|date=January 31, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] Love finished the game with 26 points and 18 rebounds in an 80–75 win.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280242483|title=Love, Westbrook power Bruins' late charge against Ducks|date=January 24, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2010|publisher=ESPN[/tpl]
In the 2008 Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, the Bruins defeated the USC Trojans, featuring O. J. Mayo, in the semi-finals. Both Mayo and Love were nominated to the All Pac-10 tournament team. Later, Love guided UCLA to the regular season Pac-10 conference championship, the conference tournament championship, and a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Love helped the Bruins to the Final Four of the tournament, where they lost to the Memphis Tigers, whose season and tournament appearance in turn were later vacated.  At the end of the 2007–08 regular season, Love was named consensus first-team All-American, Pac-10 Player of the Year, All-Pac-10, and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. He led the Bruins with 17.5 ppg, 10.6 rpg, and 23 double-doubles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/timberwolves/news/wolves_sign_love_080711.html|title=Wolves sign Love|publisher=NBA|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=February 7, 2010[/tpl]
