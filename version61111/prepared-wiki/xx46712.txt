==History==

Local Native Americans witnessed the collapse of Mount Mazama and kept the event alive in their legends. One ancient legend of the Klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today's scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, Llao of the Below World and Skell of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/New%20Folder/crlacr.htm | title = Park History | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate=[tpl]date|2010-10-18|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.
A trio of gold prospectors: John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters were the first whites to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water "Deep Blue Lake" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point.  But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name Crater Lake.
William Gladstone Steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a National Park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including Wizard Island, Llao Rock, and Skell Head.
With the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the Cleetwood, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the Cleetwood, a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points.  Their deepest sounding, [tpl]convert|1996|ft[/tpl], was very close to the modern official depth of [tpl]convert|1932|ft[/tpl] made in 1953 by sonar.  At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area.
Partly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. And because of Steel's involvement, Crater Lake Lodge was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.
Highways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of O Ranger! described access and facilities available by then:
 Crater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.[tpl]cite book | first1 = Horace M. | last1 = Albright | first2 = Frank J. | last2 = Taylor | title = Oh, Ranger! | others = illustrated by Ruth Taylor White | publisher = The Chatham Press, Inc. | location = Riverside, Connecticut | edition = Centennial | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright3/ | chapterurl = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright3/chap13a.htm | accessdate = [tpl]date|2006-08-18|mdy[/tpl] | date = [tpl]date|2004-09-06|mdy[/tpl] | chapter = Glimpses of the National Parks and Monuments | origyear = 1928 [/tpl] 
The lake is described in the poetry of Joaquin Miller.[tpl]Cite Americana|wstitle=Crater Lake National Park[/tpl]

==Activities==

There are many hiking trails inside the park, and several campgrounds. Unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size, species, or number.  The lake is believed to have no indigenous fish, but several species of fish were introduced beginning in 1888 until all fish stocking ended in 1941. Kokanee Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) now thrive and reproduce here naturally.[ref]

Swimming is allowed in the lake, and the boat tours, which stop at Wizard Island a cinder cone inside the lake, operate daily during the summer. All lake access for people is from Cleetwood Trail, a steep walking trail, and there are no roads for cars, trucks, or wagons that lead to the waterfront. All of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter.[ref]

Numerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the "Rim Drive", which is [tpl]convert|33|mi[/tpl] long and has an elevation gain of [tpl]convert|3800|ft[/tpl].
The highest point in Crater Lake National Park is Mount Scott at [tpl]convert|8929|ft[/tpl]. Getting there requires a fairly steep [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|adj=on[/tpl] hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day visibility from the summit exceeds [tpl]convert|100|mi[/tpl], and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked Cascade Range volcanoes to the north, the Columbia River Plateau to the east, and also the Western Cascades and the more-distant Klamath Mountains to the west.
The scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular "Rim Drive", which is generally completely open from July to October, and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.
