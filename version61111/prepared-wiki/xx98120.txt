Monumental ogham inscriptions are found in Ireland and Wales, with a few additional specimens found in southwest England; (Devon & Cornwall), the Isle of Man, and Scotland, including Shetland and a single example from Silchester in England. They were mainly employed as territorial markers and memorials (grave stones). The stone commemorating Vortiporius, a 6th-century king of Dyfed (originally located in Clynderwen), is the only ogham stone inscription that bears the name of an identifiable individual.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 The language of the inscriptions is predominantly Primitive Irish, apart from the few examples in Scotland, such as the Lunnasting stone, which record fragments of what is probably the Pictish language.
The more ancient examples are standing stones, where the script was carved into the edge (droim or faobhar) of the stone, which formed the stemline against which individual characters are cut. The text of these "Orthodox Ogham" inscriptions is read beginning from the bottom left-hand side of a stone, continuing upward along the edge, across the top and down the right-hand side (in the case of long inscriptions). Roughly 380 inscriptions are known in total (a number, incidentally, very close to the number of known inscriptions in the contemporary Elder Futhark), of which the highest concentration by far is found in the southwestern Irish province of Munster. Over one third of the total are found in Co Kerry alone, most densely in the former kingdom of the Corcu Duibne.
Later inscriptions are known as "scholastic", and are post 6th century in date. The term 'scholastic' derives from the fact that the inscriptions are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript sources, instead of being continuations of the original monument tradition. Unlike orthodox ogham, some mediæval inscriptions feature all five Forfeda. Scholastic inscriptions are written on stemlines cut into the face of the stone, instead of along its edge. Ogham was also occasionally used for notes in manuscripts down to the 16th century. A modern ogham inscription is found on a gravestone dating to 1802 in Ahenny, County Tipperary.
In Scotland, a number of inscriptions using the ogham writing system are known, but their language is still the subject of debate.
It has been argued by Richard Cox in The Language of Ogham Inscriptions in Scotland (1999) that the language of these is Old Norse, but others remain unconvinced by this analysis, and regard the stones as being Pictish in origin. However due to the lack of knowledge about the Picts, the inscriptions remain undeciphered, their language possibly being non-Indo-European. The Pictish inscriptions are scholastic, and are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript tradition brought into Scotland by Gaelic settlers.

==Non-monumental uses==

As well as its use for monumental inscriptions, the evidence from early Irish sagas and legends indicates that ogham was used for short messages on wood or metal, either to relay messages or to denote ownership of the object inscribed. Some of these messages seem to have been cryptic in nature and some were also for magical purposes. In addition, there is evidence from sources such as In Lebor Ogaim, or the Ogham Tract, that ogham may have been used to keep records or lists, such as genealogies and numerical tallies of property and business transactions. There is also evidence that ogham may have been used as a system of finger or hand signals.
In later centuries when ogham ceased to be used as a practical alphabet, it retained its place in the learning of Gaelic scholars and poets as the basis of grammar and the rules of poetry. Indeed, until modern times the Latin alphabet in Gaelic continued to be taught using letter names borrowed from the Beith-Luis-Nin, along with the Medieval association of each letter with a different tree.

==Unicode==

Ogham was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.
The spelling of the names given is a standardisation dating to 1997, used in Unicode Standard and in Irish Standard 434:1999.
The Unicode block for ogham is U+1680–U+169F.

==Neopaganism==

Modern New Age and Neopagan approaches to ogham largely derive from the theories of Robert Graves in his book The White Goddess.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] In this work Graves took his inspiration from the theories of the ogham scholar R.A.S Macalister (see above) and elaborated on them much further. Graves proposed that the ogham alphabet encoded a set of beliefs originating in the Middle-east in Stone Age times, concerning the ceremonies surrounding the worship of the Moon-goddess in her various forms. Graves' argument is extremely complex, but in essence he argues that the Hebrews, Greeks and Celts were all influenced by a people originating in the Aegean, called 'the people of the sea' by the Egyptians, who spread out around Europe in the 2nd millennium BC, taking their religious beliefs with them.Graves, R 'The White Goddess', pp. 61, 123, Faber & Faber, London, 1961 At some early stage these teachings were encoded in alphabet form by poets to pass on their worship of the goddess (as the muse and inspiration of all poets) in a secret fashion, understandable only to initiates. Eventually, via the druids of Gaul, this knowledge was passed on to the poets of early Ireland and Wales. Graves therefore looked at the Tree Alphabet tradition surrounding ogham and explored the tree folklore of each of the letter names, proposing that the order of the letters formed an ancient "seasonal calendar of tree magic".Graves 1961, p. 165 Although his theories have been disregarded by modern scholars (including Macalister himself, with whom Graves corresponded ),Graves 1961, pp. 116–117 they have been taken up with enthusiasm by the neopagan movement. In addition, Graves followed the BLNFS order of ogham letters put forward by Macalister (see above), with the result that this has been taken up by New Age and Neopagan writers as the 'correct' order of the letters, despite its rejection by scholars.
The main use of ogham by modern Druids, Neo-Pagans is for the purpose of divination. Divination by using ogham symbols is mentioned in Tochmarc Étaíne, a tale in the Irish Mythological Cycle. In the story, druid Dalan takes four wands of yew, and writes ogham letters upon them. Then he uses the tools for divination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=PagEd&file=index&topic_id=1&page_id=74 |title=What Is an Ovate? |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=The Order of Bards Ovates & Druids [/tpl] The tale doesn't explain further how the sticks are handled or interpreted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.somersetpagan.org/Ogham.html |title=Ogham |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=Somerset Pagans [/tpl] Another method requires a cloth marked out with Finn's Window.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.druidorder.demon.co.uk/ogham.htm  |title=A Little History of Ogham |accessdate=28 April 2010 |author=Philip Shallcrass |publisher=The British Druid Order |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050404123651/http://www.druidorder.demon.co.uk/ogham.htm |archivedate = 4 April 2005[/tpl] A person selects some sticks randomly, throws them on the cloth, and then looks both at the symbols and where they fell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/library/oghamdiv.htm |title=Druids, Ogham and Divination |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=Searles O'Dubhain [/tpl]
The divinatory meanings are usually based on the tree ogham, rather than the kennings of the Bríatharogam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centerofthegrove1.com/ |title=Center of the Grove |accessdate=19 January 2007 [/tpl] Each letter is associated with a tree or other plant, and meanings are derived from them. Robert Graves' book The White Goddess has been a major influence on assigning divinatory meanings for ogham. Some reconstructionists of Druidic ways use Briatharogam kennings as a basis for divinatory meanings in ogham divination. The three sets of kennings can be separated into Past-Present-Future or Land-Sea-Sky groupings in such systems, but other organising structures are used, as well.O'Dubhain, Searles, Ogham Divination Course, The Journal of the Henge of Keltria (1995–1998) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.keltria.org/journal/orderint.htm |title=Keltria Back Issues [/tpl]and offered online in the Summerlands (1995–2007) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/daireclass_promo/ogham_divination_book_toc.htm |title=Ogham Divination Course [/tpl]Laurie, Erynn Rowan, Ogam: Weaving Word Wisdom, Megalithica Books (2007) ISBN 1-905713-02-9
