Marcin Bielski (or Wolski) (1495 – December 18, 1575) was a Polish chronicler and satirical poet. He was born of noble parentage on the patrimonial estate of Biała, Pajęczno County (whence the family name), in the Polish province of Sieradz. The name Wolski is derived from his estate at Wola. One of two Polish writers of the same name, he was the first to use the Polish language, hence his designation as the father of Polish prose.
