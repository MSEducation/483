==History==

===World War II===

Completing shakedown off Bermuda, La Prade departed Norfolk, Virginia, 27 June 1944 for the Pacific Ocean, arriving Pearl Harbor 25 July. The destroyer escort engaged in ASW, screening, and escort operations out of Pearl Harbor and departed 8 September for Eniwetok. Operating out of Eniwetok and Ulithi, La Prade continued escort and patrol services, sailing with a hunter-killer task group during the Palau Islands invasion. When the Palaus, needed as logistic bases for the Philippine Islands invasion, were secure, La Prade returned to Eniwetok 9 October and resumed escort and patrol duty.
While escorting the damaged [tpl]USS|Canberra|CA-70|6[/tpl] to Manus on 12 November, La Prade was detached to aid a distressed PBM seaplane. The destroyer escort salvaged the portable equipment and stood guard until [tpl]USS|Onslow|AVP-48|2[/tpl] arrived to direct the rescue operations. From November 1944 until March 1945, La Prade escorted convoys to Leyte, Manus, and Ulithi. She also joined [tpl]USS|Casco|AVP-12|2[/tpl] in a joint attack on a Japanese midget submarine in the entrance to Kossol Roads Harbor, Palau Islands.
Departing Ulithi 30 March, she steamed toward Okinawa to join the screen for oilers engaged in replenishing Vice Admiral Mitscher's fast carrier task force. With American troops struggling to establish a garrison next door to Japan, the oilers and their screening units played a vital role in keeping supplies moving into the embattled island. La Prade continued to support the campaign until Okinawa was declared secured 26 June. La Prade performed escort and patrol operations for the rest of the war before joining the Japan occupation forces at Sasebo 23 September.

==Decommissioning==

The destroyer escort returned to Okinawa 10 October and 4 days later headed home, arriving San Diego, California, 5 November. La Prade remained at San Diego until 11 May 1946 when she commissioned and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Stricken 15 January 1972 sold for scrapping 15 January 1973.
