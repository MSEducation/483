The term clairvoyance (from French clair meaning "clear" and voyance meaning "vision") is used to refer to the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human senses,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance |title=Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 "1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration" |publisher=Mw1.merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011[/tpl]Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Retrieved 2007-10-07. The ESP entry includes clairvoyance i.e., a form of extrasensory perception.  A person said to have the ability of clairvoyance is referred to as a clairvoyant ("one who sees clearly").
Claims for the existence of paranormal and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance have not been supported by scientific evidence published in high impact factor peer reviewed journals.Carroll, Robert Todd. (2003). "Clairvoyance". Retrieved 2014-04-30. Parapsychology explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is not accepted by the scientific community.[ref]

==Usage==

Pertaining to the ability of clear-sightedness, clairvoyance refers to the supposed paranormal ability to see persons and events that are distant in time or space.  It can be divided into roughly three classes: retrocognition, premonition, and the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.Melton, John. (2001). The Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology. p. 297. Gale Group, Detroit. ISBN 978-0810385702.

==Parapsychology==

===Early research===

The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the Marquis de Puységur, a follower of Franz Mesmer, who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others.Taves, Ann. (1999). Fits, Trances, and Visions: Experiencing Religion and Explaining Experience from Wesley to James. Princeton University Press. p. 126. ISBN 0-691-01024-2 Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the spiritualist period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.Hyman, Ray. (1985). A Critical Historical Overview of Parapsychology. In Kurtz, Paul. A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 3-96. ISBN 0-87975-300-5
Early researchers of clairvoyance included William Gregory, Gustav Pagenstecher, and Rudolf Tischner.Roeckelein, Jon. (2006). Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories. Elsevier Science. p. 450. ISBN 0-444-51750-2 Clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by Charles Richet. Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them. The subject was reported to have been successful in a series of 133 trials but the results dropped to chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge. J. M. Peirce and E. C. Pickering reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23, 384 trials which did not obtain above chance scores.Hansel, C. E. M. The Search for a Demonstration of ESP. In Kurtz, Paul. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. ISBN 0-87975-300-5
A significant development in clairvoyance research came when J. B. Rhine, a parapsychologist at Duke University, introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analysing the data, as part of his research into extrasensory perception.  A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25, 064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."Cox, W. S. (1936). An experiment in ESP. Journal of Experimental Psychology 12: 437. Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.[ref]Cited in Hansel, C. E. M.

===Remote viewing===

A well known study of clairvoyance in recent times has been the US government-funded remote viewing project at the Stanford Research Institute during the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In 1972, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the viewers or percipients) could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or targets. In the early studies, a human sender was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term remote viewing was coined to describe this overall process. The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on remote viewing was published in Nature in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |first2=Harold |last2=Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602–607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476[/tpl] After the publication of these findings, other attempts to replicate the experiments were carried out.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |date=October 1976 |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544–1545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.|issue=10[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |date=October 1976 |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550–1551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.|issue=10[/tpl] and remotely linked groups using computer conferencing.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |date=October 1976 |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551–1552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.|issue=10[/tpl]
The psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff’s remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute. In a series of 35 studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.David Marks, Richard Kammann. (1978). "Information transmission in remote viewing experiments", Nature 274: 680–81.David Marks. (1981). "Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments", Nature 292: 177. Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues.Martin Bridgstock. (2009). Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal. Cambridge University Press. p. 106. ISBN 978-0521758932 "The explanation used by Marks and Kammann clearly involves the use of Occam's razor. Marks and Kammann argued that the 'cues' - clues to the order in which sites had been visited—provided sufficient information for the results, without any recourse to extrasensory perception. Indeed Marks himself was able to achieve 100 percent accuracy in allocating some transcripts to sites without visiting any of the sites himself, purely on the ground basis of the cues. From Occam's razor, it follows that if a straightforward natural explanation exists, there is no need for the spectacular paranormal explanation: Targ and Puthoff's claims are not justified". James Randi has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/remote%20viewing.html |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=Randi.org |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl]
In 1980, Charles Tart claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff’s experiments revealed an above-chance result.Charles Tart, Harold Puthoff, Russell Targ. (1980). Information Transmission in Remote Viewing Experiments. Nature 284: 191. Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues.Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 136 Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote "considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart’s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues."David Marks, Christopher Scott. (1986). Remote Viewing Exposed. Nature 319: 444.
In 1982 Robert Jahn, then Dean of the School of Engineering at Princeton University wrote a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective. His paper included numerous references to remote viewing studies at the time.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1982.12260 |title=The persistent paradox of psychic phenomena: An engineering perspective |date=February 1982 |author=Jahn, R.G. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=70 |pages=136–170|issue=2[/tpl] Statistical flaws in his work have been proposed by others in the parapsychological community and within the general scientific community.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/pear_proposition_fact_or_fallacy/ |title= The PEAR proposition: Fact or fallacy? |publisher= Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |author=Stanley Jeffers |date= May–June 2006 |accessdate= 2014-01-24 |volume= 30.3[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=George P.

==Scientific reception==

According to scientific research, clairvoyance is the result of confirmation bias, expectancy bias, fraud, hallucination, self-delusion, sensory leakage, subjective validation, wishful thinking or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences.Rawcliffe, Donovan. (1988). Occult and Supernatural Phenomena. Dover Publications. pp. 367-463. ISBN 0-486-20503-7Reed, Graham. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience: A Cognitive Approach. Prometheus Books. ISBN 0-87975-435-4Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren. (1989). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. pp. 152-168. ISBN 0-8058-0508-7 Parapsychology is regarded by the scientific community as a pseudoscience.Massimo Pigliucci, Maarten Boudry. (2013). Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem. University Of Chicago Press p. 158. ISBN 978-0-226-05196-3 "Many observers refer to the field as a "pseudoscience". When mainstream scientists say that the field of parapsychology is not scientific, they mean that no satisfying naturalistic cause-and-effect explanation for these supposed effects has yet been proposed and that the field's experiments cannot be consistently replicated." In 1988, the US National Research Council concluded that it "...finds no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years, for the existence of parapsychological phenomena."An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. James Randi Educational Foundation.
Skeptics say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear.  They also contend that those who believe in paranormal phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons.  According to David G. Myers (Psychology, 8th ed.):
 The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem & Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem & others, 2001; Milton & Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).

One skeptic, magician James Randi, has a longstanding offer—now U.S. $1 million—“to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions” (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi’s offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  "People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist." Susan Blackmore, "Blackmore's first law", 2004.

The words "clairvoyance" and "psychic" are often used to refer to many different kinds of paranormal sensory experiences, but there are more specific names:

===Clairsentience (feeling/touching)===

In the field of parapsychology, clairsentience is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by feeling.Parapsychological Association historical terms glossary, retrieved 2006-12-17 The word “clair” is French for "clear", and “sentience” is derived from the Latin sentire, “to feel”.           Psychometry is related to clairsentience. The word stems from psyche and metric, which means "soul-measuring".Joseph Rodes Buchanan, Manual of Psychometry : the Dawn of a New Civilization Boston, Frank H. Hodges (4th edition), 1893 p.3

===Clairaudience (hearing/listening)===

In the field of parapsychology, clairaudience late 17th century French clair (clear) and audience (hearing) is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires information by paranormal auditory means. It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance.Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Retrieved 2006-01-24 Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a paranormal manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling (clairsentience).

===Clairgustance (tasting)===

In the field of parapsychology, clairgustance is defined as a form of extra-sensory perception that allegedly allows one to taste a substance without putting anything in one's mouth.  It is claimed that those who possess this ability are able to perceive the essence of a substance from the spiritual or ethereal realms through taste.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
