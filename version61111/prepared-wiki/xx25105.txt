Robert Underdunk Terwilliger, PhD,  better known as Sideshow Bob, is a recurring character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared briefly in the episode "The Telltale Head." Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University, a member of the Republican Party, and a champion of high culture. He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob attempted to frame his employer for armed robbery in "Krusty Gets Busted." The plan was foiled by Bart Simpson, and Sideshow Bob was sent to prison.
Bob made his second major appearance in season three's "Black Widower"; the writers echoed the premise of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. In each appearance thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on The Simpsons of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve murder and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though these plans often involve targeting the entire Simpson family.
Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer's character Frasier Crane from the sitcoms Cheers and Frasier, and has been described as "Frasier pickled in arsenic". Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in The Simpsons between Bob and Frasier Crane – Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney respectively, echoing the roles they played in Frasier. Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode "The Italian Bob."
As of 2014, Bob has had speaking appearances in 14 episodes and been featured in 12; the most recent of the latter, "The Man Who Grew Too Much," aired during the 25th season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media. He appears in the Simpsons Comics, cameos in the 2007 video game The Simpsons Game, and stars as the main antagonist in The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in The Simpsons musical compilations.

This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison.[tpl]cite episode |title=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming |episodelink=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming |series=The Simpsons |credits=Feresten, Spike; Polcino, Dominic |network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-26 |season=7 |number=137[/tpl] In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. In "Brother from Another Series," Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.
In "Day of the Jackanapes" (season 12, 2001), Bob discovers that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty's retirement special. Just as Bob was to succeed, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it.[tpl]cite episode |title=Day of the Jackanapes |episodelink=Day of the Jackanapes |series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Marcantel, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=2001-02-18 |season=11 |number=261[/tpl] Bob's aid is sought by Springfield police in "The Great Louse Detective" (season 14, 2002).

The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance.

==Character==

===Creation===

Sideshow Bob first appeared in the background of a scene in "The Telltale Head", the eighth episode of season one. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. His first major appearance was in season one's twelfth episode "Krusty Gets Busted", written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=28-29[/tpl] Bob's design was updated for "Krusty Gets Busted"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director Brad Bird made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique. Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in "The Telltale Head", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.Moore, Rich. (2001). Commentary for "The Telltale Head," in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Bob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his educated and refined voice.Jean, Al. (2001). Commentary for "Krusty Gets Busted", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. An early version of the script for "Krusty Gets Busted" called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer.Bird, Brad. (2001). Commentary for "Krusty Gets Busted", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose "lamenting tones became the foundation for Sideshow Bob".Grammer, Kelsey. (2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series," in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.[tpl]cite web |last=Allan |first=Marc |title=17 Reasons to Turn On the TV |url=http://www.nuvo.net/ScreensBlog/archives/2011/07/30/17-reasons-to-turn-on-the-tv |work=Nuvo Magazine |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl]
Sideshow Bob's full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first revealed in "Black Widower" while his middle name was first mentioned in "Sideshow Bob Roberts". Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker from the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, but others say he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date=2007-07-26 |author=Carroll, Larry |publisher=MTV[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/the-simpsons-anniversary-special-in-3-d-on-ice |title=The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special |accessdate=2010-01-25 |date=2010-01-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link |date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Onderdonk in the pilot episode of the TV show Hunter.Unclaimed Simpsons Reference Finally Gotten

===Development===

For season three's "Black Widower", the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from Looney Tunes cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. For "Black Widower", director David Silverman updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird.Silverman, David. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower," in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after season eight's "Brother from Another Series" when the chronology became too lengthy.Weinstein, Josh. (2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like "The Great Louse Detective" and "The Italian Bob".
Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already been the focus of four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him.Oakley, Bill. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking.Weinstein, Josh. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming," in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Despite these challenges, however, creators of The Simpsons usually look forward to "Sideshow Bob episodes;" the writers consider them enjoyable to write,Keeler, Ken. (2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series," in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as "a treat" to work on.Polcino, Dominic. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Kelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him "the most popular character I've ever played". Grammer usually joins the show's "table readings" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time),Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare," in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh.Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob Roberts", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying "his voice is so rich."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/215823 |title=Producer speaks out on cartoon cameos |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=2007-10-13 |date=2007-05-20[/tpl] Writer George Meyer commented that "writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing."[tpl]cite news |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |work=TV Guide |date=2000-10-21 |accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl]
The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that "Grammer is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it."[tpl]Cite news |title=The man who makes 'The Simpsons' sing |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/20/simpsons.clausen/index.html |publisher=CNN Entertainment |author=Leopold, Todd |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2009-01-03[/tpl] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in "Cape Feare". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for "Cape Feare" earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore – Series in 1994.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |accessdate=2007-10-17[/tpl]
Bob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in Les Misérables.Reiss, Mike. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower," in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in "Cape Feare". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession. The sequence has become known as the "rake joke" and was described by Entertainment Weekly as showing "genius in its repetitive stupidity."

===Family===

The episode "Brother from Another Series" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?"[tpl]Cite news |title=TV Tidbits |work=The Hamilton Spectator |date=1997-02-20 |accessdate=2008-11-24[/tpl] Several of Frasier's producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.Michels, Pete. (2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series," in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Cecil returns in season 19's "Funeral for a Fiend," which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by John Mahoney.[tpl]cite news |author=|title=The Simpsons |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2007-09-04 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20054579,00.html |accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl] Mahoney portrayed Martin Crane, the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in Frasier.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a75660/frasier-cast-to-reunite-for-simpsons.html |title=Frasier cast to reunite for Simpsons |date=2007-09-14 |author=Dadds, Kimberley |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=Digital Spy[/tpl] Whereas in Frasier, Mahoney played the "down-to-Earth, average guy" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's "uppity snobs", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob.[tpl]cite news |author=Canning, Robert |title=The Simpsons: "Funeral for a Fiend" Review |publisher=IGN |date=2007-11-26 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/837/837504p1.html |accessdate=2009-01-03[/tpl] His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Underdunk, "the finest classical actress of her generation." She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in season 17 episode "The Italian Bob" and returned for "Funeral for a Fiend."

==Reception==

The character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006 IGN listed him as the second-best "peripheral character" on The Simpsons, commenting that Bob is "a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac."[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html |title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters |accessdate=2007-06-08 |date=2006-09-06 |author=Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski |publisher=IGN.com[/tpl] Also that year, Wizard Magazine rated Bob as the 66th greatest villain of all time.[tpl]cite journal |last=McCallum |first=Pat |date=July 2006 |title=100 Greatest Villains Ever |journal=Wizard |issue=177[/tpl] Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that "that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best reocurring [tpl]sic[/tpl] characters on the show."[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/ |title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars |author=Finley, Adam |publisher=TV Squad |date=2006-06-20 |accessdate=2009-01-03[/tpl]

The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with "Cape Feare" being ranked first. "The Italian Bob" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that "All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode – the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming – were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs." He noted that only "The Italian Bob" and the ninth ranked "Funeral for a Fiend" were "the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun."[tpl]Cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1051182p1.html |author=Canning, Robert |date=2009-12-02 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-05-19 |title=The Simpsons: Top 10 Sideshow Bob Episodes[/tpl]

===Analysis===

In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually hit him with a rake and bring him down. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=129-131[/tpl] In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a "mass-culture upbringing" and thus is Bob's enemy.Arnold, pp. 2–3. Frustrated by his early role as the target of "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." He also tries to "manipulate the tastes of the masses" by becoming a criminal mastermind.Arnold, pp. 12–13. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in "Sideshow Bob Roberts," wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.Arnold, p. 17.
Bob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode "Cape Feare", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says "Die, Bart, Die". Bob replies that it is German for "The, Bart, The;" members of the board are impressed by his reasoning. Believing that "nobody who speaks German could be an evil man," they release him. However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta H.M.S. Pinafore in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.Arnold, p. 16.
