"You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk" is a single by UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys, released as the third and last single from their album Nightlife in 2000. It was a success on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the top 10 at #8, but failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It also missed the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, and the Hot Dance Club Play chart, the first Pet Shop Boys single to miss that chart entirely since "Single-Bilingual" in 1996.
