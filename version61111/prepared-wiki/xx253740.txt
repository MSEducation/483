The 2003 Motor City Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between the Northwestern Wildcats and the Bowling Green Falcons on December 26, 2003, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Northwestern led early after shutting down Bowling Green's running game but Bowling Green made a comeback in the second half led by a strong passing game under quarterback Josh Harris and won 28–24. It was the seventh time the Motor City Bowl had been played and the final game of the 2003 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams.
The game between the Mid-American Conference (MAC) team Bowling Green and Big Ten Conference Northwestern was played at neutral-site Ford Field. As then organized the Motor City Bowl matched a MAC team and a team from either the Big Ten, the Big East Conference, or an at-large team. Bowling Green accepted a bid for the Motor City Bowl after losing to Miami (OH) in the MAC Championship Game. It was Bowling Green's first appearance in a bowl game since the 1992 Las Vegas Bowl.[tpl]cite news | title=Bowling Green to Motor City | publisher=The Ledger | date=December 5, 2003 | accessdate=2010-01-10 | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yqEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3v0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2751,2142450&dq=bowling+green+motor+city&hl=en[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Northwestern was the first Big Ten team to play in the Motor City Bowl and had not appeared in a bowl game since the 2000 Alamo Bowl.

Harris passed for 386 yards, including three touchdown passes, and rushed for Bowling Green's fourth touchdown. Harris' completion record of 38/50 and total offense of 454 yards set Motor City Bowl records. Wright had 21 carries for 237 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown run which was the second-longest in Motor City Bowl history.[tpl]cite news | title=Harris throws 3 second-half TDs | publisher=ESPN.com | date=December 26, 2003 | accessdate=2010-01-10 | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=233600189[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Bowling Green defeats Northwestern 28–24 in Motor City | publisher=USA Today | date=December 26, 2003 | accessdate=2010-01-10 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bowls/2003-12-27-motor_x.htm | first=Ron | last=Vample[/tpl]
