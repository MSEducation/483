The Arc is an 83 km long river in the south of France. It arises at an altitude of 470 m, close to the village of Pourcieux. It then passes through Aix-en-Provence before flowing into the Étang de Berre, a lake to the west of Marseille.
Its drainage basin, with a surface area of 727 km², is divided between two départments, Var and Bouches-du-Rhône. The risk of flood, always present in the basin, has been aggravated by urban development that has sometimes been lacking in foresight, with Aix-en-Provence particularly threatened.
