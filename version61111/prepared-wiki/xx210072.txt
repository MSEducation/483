Laura Camaur (5 January 1913 â€“ 13 September 1984), known by the stage name Laura Solari, was an Italian film actress.

==Early life==

Laura Camaur was born on 5 January 5, 1913, in Trieste, then part of Austria-Hungary. She was the daughter of sculptor and artist Antonio Camaur (1875-1919) and his wife, Maria Taucer. In addition to being prominent in Triestine art and intellectual circles, Antonio Camaur was a prominent Irredentist and advocated annexation of Trieste by Italy. In late 1915, Camaur went into exile because of his pro-Italian sympathies, and Laura lived in Northern Italy until her family's return to Trieste in 1919.

==Personal life==

After World War I, Laura came under the tutelage of the Taucer family who sent her to be educated in Vienna. In 1930, Laura married an older Hungarian army officer, Oscar Szemere, but the couple separated after his business failed. They were divorced in Reno, Nevada, in 1940. Laura later married Arthur Roper Caldbeck,  a colonel in the British army.

==Film career==

Laura was spotted by a talent scout, who was taken by her beauty, at a function at the La Scala theater in Milan. She was recruited as a motion picture actress by the fledging Italian film industry and acquired the stage name "Laura Solari".  Beginning with Regina della Scala in 1936, she appeared in 30 films between 1936 and 1969. Solari participated in the legitimate stage in Trieste's Nuovo Teatro. She also appeared on television in programs such as the 1955 drama television series Police Call.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=203819&more=ucepisodelist&episodeid=1078994|title=TV Guide, Police Call episodes listing|accessdate=August 1, 2010[/tpl]
