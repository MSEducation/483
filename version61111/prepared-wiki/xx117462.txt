WSAR is an AM radio station licensed to Fall River, Massachusetts and with its studios and transmitter in Somerset, Massachusetts broadcasting on 1480Â kHz.  Its transmitter power output is 5,000 watts unlimited hours using two towers at the Somerset site.  In September 2011 WSAR was granted an FCC construction permit to increase day power to 25,000 watts by adding a third tower that is about one half the height of the current two towers.

==Format==

WSAR's format is currently news/talk and sports although in earlier decades it was a full service music station playing top 40 music. Currently, the radio station's flagship programs are "The Bristol County Breakfast Club" with Hector "Happy Hec" Gauthier in the Morning, "Underreported" with Ric Oliveira, "The WSAR Newsroom" with Barry Richard & Alan Zarek, and Faust Fiore during afternoon drive, "The Faust Lane". WSAR also carries live game coverage for the Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots and the Boston Celtics.

==History==

===1920s===

WSAR was licensed in June 1923 (although in one 1940s station publication, the station claimed September 21, 1921) with the sequentially-issued callsign of WSAR.  WSAR's original owner was the Doughty & Welch Electric Company.  WSAR's first air date was July 3, 1923.  WSAR first operated on 1180kc with 10 watts.  It would stay on 1180 through 1926.  Power in 1926 was 100 watts.  WSAR then moved to Portsmouth, Rhode Island and changed frequency to 1190kc, still with 100 watts, by June 30, 1927.  WSAR moved back to Fall River and changed frequency again, to 1410kc, in 1928.  During the late 1920s the power was increased to 1,000 watts.  An early slogan used by WSAR (sometime between 1926 and 1932) was "Fall River Looms Up."

===1930s===

WSAR was on 1450kc with 250 watts of power by June 30, 1930.  The owner was still the Doughty & Welch Electric Company.

===1940s===

With the adaptation of the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement, WSAR's frequency shifted from 1450 to 1480kc, effective @ 03:00 Eastern Time on March 29, 1941.  In 1941-42 WSAR was an affiliate of both the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves networks.  This has been noted by a history book on-site at WSAR detailing weekly programming schedules.  In 1945 the Doughty & Welch Electric Company finally sold WSAR to K&M Publishing.  In 1948, WSAR was a Mutual affiliate with 5,000 watts of power & had a license for WSAR-FM/103.7 (Channel 279); however by 1950  WSAR-FM had been deleted.  It is unknown if WSAR-FM ever made it to air.

===1980s===

WSAR was sold by Knight Quality Stations to the current owners in 1989.

===2000s===

Paul Giammarco took over as program director and afternoon host in 2003.  In 2005 he left for WPRO with Keri Rodrigues taking his position until her tenure ended in controversy in August 2008.  Rodrigues' afternoon drive seat was filled by then Production Director "Fast" Eddie Garcia and sports-talk personality "The Hurricane" Mike Herren. Meanwhile, the role of Program Director was never officially replaced.
After several contentious, on-air confrontations, "Fast Eddie and the Hurricane" was disbanded, with Herren remaining as the afternoon drive host, and Garcia returning full-time to producing. The new program was dubbed "The Hurricane's Highway Home," with Herren adding new co-host Ryan Phelan into the studio.
Phelan left the station in the spring of 2010 after accepting a position with Bristol Eighth District Mike Rodrigues' State Senate Campaign to replace the retiring Joan Menard.  Herren's program was cancelled soon after.
Late in the Summer of 2008, WSAR remodeled its webpage http://www.wsar.com, adding streaming audio, mobile streaming, and podcasts of interviews, newscasts and special programming

===2010s===

In the Summer of 2012, Giammarco returned to WSAR, this time as General Manager and Program Director, the first PD since Rodrigues, who had moved on to be a union organizer with the SEIU in Boston.
