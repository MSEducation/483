Barrow Association Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The club participates in the Conference North, the sixth tier of the English league system. They were relegated (22nd place with 46 points) from the Conference National at the end of the 2012–13 season. Barrow play their home games at Holker Street, (currently sponsored as the "Furness Building Society Stadium"), close to the town centre and approximately 0.5 km from Barrow Railway Station.
The club spent over fifty years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972,  achieving promotion to Division 3 by finishing 3rd in the Football League Fourth Division in the 1966–67 season. The highest league period in the club's history was to be short-lived and a return to Division 4 came after relegation in 1969–70 season. Fortunes never improved and at the end of the 1971–72 season, after an unsuccessful bid for re-election, Barrow were voted out of the Football League, to be replaced by Hereford United of the Southern League. Barrow have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football and have twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the FA Trophy – in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to have won the Trophy at both old and new Wembley Stadium.
The club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname "The Bluebirds". Attendances at the club's Holker Street ground vary – the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954 – but during the 1990s and 2000s the average remained consistently between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 918http://stats.football365.com/dom/ENG/FC/attend.html during the 2012–13 season.
The club won their second FA Trophy title on 8 May 2010 after beating Stevenage Borough 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.

===Early years===

Barrow were founded on 16 July 1901 at the old Drill Hall (later the Palais) in The Strand and played at initially at The Strawberry Ground, before moving to Ainslie StreetBarrow The Beautiful History.

Retrieved 02–05–11. and in 1908 the club won promotion to the first division. In 1909, Barrow moved once more to Holker Street, the stadium that they still occupy today. The club remained in the Lancashire Combination for up to and after World War I, winning the league in the 1920–21 season. This victory preceded the formation of the Football League Third Division North in the 1921–22 season, and Barrow became one of the league's founder members.

===Football League years===

In their early years as a league club, Barrow were as notable for their absence of success as any achievements.Yelland, Phil. Chapter 2: Into the League  A Brief History of Barrow AFC. Retrieved 02–05–11. Their highest finish before World War II was 5th in the 1931–32 season.In 1933–34 season Barrow finished in 8th position. Barrow remained in the lowest tier of the Football League when football resumed after the war, and were founder members of Football League Division Four in 1958–59.Yelland, Phil Chapter 3: Post War Struggles and Cup Ties  A Brief History of Barrow AFC. Retrieved 02–05–11. The 1950s saw greater success in the FA Cup, however. The club's record crowd of 16,874 watched Barrow draw 2–2 with Swansea City in the 1953–54 FA Cup. A few years later this was followed by a Third Round tie in the 1958–59 competition against the then Football League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers at Holker Street. Wolves, captained by Billy Wright, won 4–2.
The late 1960s finally saw Barrow win promotion, after a third placed finish under the management of Don McEvoy in the 1966–67 Fourth Division.Yelland, Phil Chapter 4: To Division Three And Back To Non League A Brief History of Barrow AFC. Retrieved 02–05–11. McEvoy's successor, Colin Appleton, lead Barrow to their highest ever final league position of eighth in the Football League Third Division the following season. The club topped the Third Division league table for one day during the season, the highest position that they have ever held. During this period defender Brian Arrowsmith became the player to make the most Football League appearances for Barrow. Barrow remained in the third flight of English football for another two seasons before returning to the basement in 1970. Financial difficulties combined with poor performances saw Barrow twice up for re-election in 1971 and 1972. On the second occasion, at the end of the 1971–72 season, they were voted out of the Football League  to be replaced by Hereford United. Though the reasons for losing the re-election were many, three features – Barrow's geographic isolation, Hereford United's FA Cup victory against Newcastle United and the decision of the Barrow board to introduce a speedway track around pitch at Holker Street, as a means of off-setting financial difficulties – have all been highlighted as contributing to Barrow's relegation.Gone But Not Forgotten (Part 4) Twohundredpercent.net. 07–08–07.

===Return to Non-League===

To gain access to the Northern Premier League, the club had to promise to remove the infamous speedway track from Holker Street,Holker Street Newsletter 1674 2 March 2006. Retrieved 3 May 2011. though it remained until 1974. Barrow subsequently struggled in the Northern Premier with low financial resources.Yelland, Phil Chapter 5: Fighting For Survival A Brief History of Barrow AFC. However in 1979 Barrow were invited to join the new Alliance Premier League, the first national division in non-league football. In 1981 the club won the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy, its first success as a non-league club since winning the Lancashire Combination in 1921, but relegation followed in 1983.Yelland, Phil Chapter 6: Making Progress A Brief History of Barrow AFC Under manager Vic Halom Barrow won the Northern Premier League title the following season, but were relegated again by 1986. Just before relegation, the club hired Ray Wilkie as manager, who went on to lead Barrow to their then most successful period in non-league football.Yelland, Phil Chapter 7: The Wilkie Years A Brief History of Barrow AFC
After a number of close misses, Barrow won promotion back to the renamed Vauxhall Conference in 1988–89, finishing champions of the Northern Premier League. Driven by the goals of Colin Cowperthwaite, the club's record appearance holder and record goalscorer, Barrow achieved two respectable finishes in the Conference – 10th in 1989–90 and 14th the season after. As well as league success, Wilkie had a number of successful cup runs. In 1988, Barrow reached the FA Trophy semi-final, losing to Enfield after a replay. The first leg at Holker Street attracted 6,002 supporters – still a non-league record for the club. The season after, Barrow reached the 1st round of the FA Cup, losing out 3–1 against Rotherham United.
In 1990, Barrow won their first major trophy as a non-league club, the FA Trophy. In the final they beat Leek Town at Wembley. Scoring the first and third goals was Kenny Gordon, a player who was not normally found on the score sheet, and who was playing his final game for his hometown club before emigrating to Australia.Barrow AFC's 1990 FA Trophy Heroes Reunited at Wembley Other notable members of the squad included Kenny Lowe, who was sold to Barnet for £40,000 after the final, then a club record fee.Turnbull, Simon The real Barrow boys The Independent. 12–11–00.

The following season, benefiting from direct entry to the first round, Barrow made the third round of the FA Cup for the first time as a non-league club, losing 1–0 away to Third Division high fliers Bolton Wanderers.
Unfortunately Wilkie was forced to step down during the 1991–92 due to health problems. That season Barrow would be relegated back to the Northern Premier League, and also coincided with Cowperthwaite's retirement, after a fifteen year career with Barrow, finishing with 704 appearances and 282 goals.The highlight of my career, North West Evening Mail, 2010–05–06.

===Turmoil of the 1990s===

Following Wilkie's departure and Barrow's subsequent relegation, the club had three mediocre seasons in the Northern Premier League. In February 1995, Barrow were purchased by Stephen Vaughan, a Scouse-boxing promoter and businessman.Conn.D (2009) 'Chester City owner told by FA to surrender his majority shares', The Guardian, 2009–11–18.

Vaughan left the club at the end of 1998, withdrawing his financial support that had been keeping it afloat. It transpired that the club's main asset, its Holker Street ground, had been sold for £410,000 to Northern Improvements, a company Vaughn had an interest in.Robson.K (1999) 'Unfair dismissal', When Saturday Comes, vol.149, July 1999. Retrieved 2011–05–01. In January 1999, the club were the subject of a compulsory winding up order and a liquidator was appointed to run the club whilst trying to establish who the legal owner of the ground was. A new members' company was formed with the aim of providing financial support to the club and with the long term intention of taking over the running of the football club.
In the summer of 1999 the club were thrown out of the Football Conference, despite avoiding relegation . After a long dispute, and thanks to the support of the Football Association, Barrow were allowed entrance into the Northern Premier League for the 1999–2000 season, almost a month after it had commenced. This reduced time in which to play their fixtures led to the scheduling of Barrow v Winsford United on 30 December 1999, recognised as the last professional or semi-professional game in the United Kingdom of the millennium. Barrow managed to survive in the Northern Premier League under manager Kenny Lowe, despite having to create an almost entirely new squad. The team improved over the following few years despite remaining in administration. They twice missed out narrowly on promotion back to the Conference, finishing second and third in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons respectively. The legal disputes over the ownership of Holker Street were finally resolved in August 2002 and the new members company bought the stadium from the liquidator. In 2003, the Football Association finally allowed the 'football membership' to be transferred to the new company.
In April 2004, Barrow defeated local rivals Workington in a two-legged final in the UniBond Presidents (League) Cup. The game finished 6–6 on aggregate, Barrow winning on away goals. Following their failure to gain promotion to the Conference  in 2004–05, Barrow became founder members of yet another division, this time the Conference North, which replaced the Northern Premier League at the level below the Conference National.

===Return to the Conference National===

During the following two seasons Barrow showed poor form in the league, narrowly escaping relegation at the end of 2006–07. Manager Lee Turnbull, who succeeded Lowe when the latter had to give up the job for work commitments, was sacked in 2005 and replaced by Phil Wilson. Compounding this was the jailing of defender James Cotterill for an assault committed on the pitch. In a first round FA Cup game Cotterill punched Bristol Rovers striker Sean Rigg, the incident being missed by the referee but caught by the Match of the Day cameras, resulting in Cotterill being the only English player in recent history to be jailed for an offence on the pitch.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6252157.stm|title=FA Cup assault footballer jailed|publisher=BBC Online|date=11 January 2007|accessdate=19 June 2008[/tpl]
On 12 November 2007, after two years in the job, Phil Wilson was dismissed as manager. Although the sacking came two days after a good 1–1 draw in the FA Cup First Round against AFC Bournemouth, it was the club's continued poor league form which cost the manager his job. Barrow's first team affairs were shifted to players Paul Jones, David Bayliss and Darren Sheridan. Following a decent run of results, Bayliss and Sheridan were appointed as player-managers, whilst Jones became club captain. Bayliss and Sheridan led Barrow  from 20th place in the league in December to fifth, ensuring a place in the play offs for promotion to the Conference National. Barrow won the semi-final against Telford United 4–0 on aggregate, before beating Stalybridge Celtic in the playoff final, held at the Pirelli Stadium, Burton upon Trent.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7371753.stm|title= Blue Square North/South play-offs|publisher=BBC Sport Online|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 June 2008[/tpl]
After an initial strong start in the Conference National, which saw Barrow top the table during the first few weeks, the club began to struggle and found themselves just above the relegation zone by January 2009. Barrow had more success in the FA Cup, beating Brentford 2–1 with goals from David Brown and Matt Henney in Round Two, their first victory over Football League opposition since their own elimination from the league in 1972. In the third round they were drawn an away tie against Middlesbrough, a Premier League team, losing 2–1.'Barrow boys are brought back to earth', The Guardian, 2009–01–04. Retrieved 2011–05–01. More than 7,000 Barrow fans travelled to Boro's Riverside Stadium, at the time the highest away attendance at the ground in the 14 years it had been open.

Having made several alterations to the squad during the summer, the club started its 2nd season in the Conference National in August 2009. After a tough start, the club put together a good run, losing only once in 16 games, and reaching the FA Cup 3rd round, where they were beaten 3–0 by Premier League side Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 2 January 2010, watched, again, by 7,500 travelling supporters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/sunderland/article6973785.ece|title=Fraizer Campbell strikes roll out Barrow for Sunderland in FA Cup|date=3 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=4 January 2010 | location=London | first=Ron | last=Clarke[/tpl]Brave Barrow AFC give their all in Sunderland defeat, North West Evening Mail, 2010–01–04.

Floodlights were erected in 1963, and the ground hosted speedway meetings during the 1970s which involved the demolition of the 'Steelworks End', which had been damaged by fire, the re-positioning of the pitch and the removal of the front rows of terracing. Following the removal of the speedway track, the pitch was moved back to its original orientation and a new leisure centre with squash courts was constructed.
Under Stephen Vaughan's ownership, an new all-seater Main Stand with a capacity of around 1000 was built at the Wilkie Road side, but since then, the only significant change to the ground has been the removal of an unsafe roof over the Holker Street end terraces. Described as having "a traditional, old fashioned feel", the ground has three sides of terracing. The Main Stand is raised above the central portion of the pitch, with flat standing on either side. The Popular Side now has the only covered terracing, opposite the Main Stand.Barrow AFC conferencegrounds.co.uk. Retrieved 10–05–11.Barrow 0–2 U's: The Sirens and the Prams Cambridge United.
