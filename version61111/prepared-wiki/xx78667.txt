Key Tower is a skyscraper on Public Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio designed by architect César Pelli. It is the tallest building in both the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio, the 18th tallest building in the United States, and the 109th tallest building in the world. The building reaches 57 stories or [tpl]convert|947|ft|m[/tpl] to the top of its spire, and it can be visible for up to twenty miles (32 km) away. The tower contains about 1.5 million square feet (139,355 m²) of office space.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=SC6 |title=Society Center |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |date=1997-07-22 |accessdate=2009-08-22[/tpl]
It was originally built as the Society Center but was renamed when Key Bank acquired Society Bank. Society had recently acquired Ameritrust and canceled Ameritrust's plans for an even taller building on Public Square. Key Tower was developed by the Richard E. Jacobs Group and is owned by Wells Real Estate Funds.[tpl]cite news |first=Michelle |last=Jarboe |title=Jacobs Group no longer owns stake in Key Center |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/04/jacobs_group_no_longer_owns_st.html |work=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2009-04-22[/tpl] Key Bank's headquarters occupy most of the tower.
When Key Tower was completed in 1991, it became the tallest building between Chicago and New York City. The 975-foot (297 m) Comcast Center in Philadelphia assumed this distinction in 2007. Key Tower is connected to the Marriott at Key Center, built in conjunction with the tower, and the older Society for Savings Building. The Chamber of Commerce Building stood on the tower's site from 1898 to 1955.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=COCB |title=Chamber of Commerce Building |work=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |accessdate=2007-01-06[/tpl]
F-111, James Rosenquist's large pop art painting, hung in the tower's lobby until building owner Richard Jacobs sold it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1996.  He replaced it in 1998 with Songs for Sale, a mural by artist David Salle.Litt, Steven. "Salle Mural Quietly Fills Key Tower Void", The Plain Dealer. March 22, 1998. In October 2005, Key Bank installed four 15-foot (4.6 m) long illuminated logos at the base of the tower's crowning pyramid. Each sign weighs 1,500 pounds (680 kg).
A smaller-scale building was proposed by Pelli to be built in Hartford, Connecticut during the late 1980s, but the plan was ultimately canceled.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&lng=3&id=121788 |title=Key Tower |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=2009-08-22[/tpl]
