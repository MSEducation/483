The Hawaiian Islands ([tpl]lang-haw|Mokupuni o Hawai‘i[/tpl]) are an archipelago of eight major islands, several atolls, numerous smaller islets, and undersea seamounts in the North Pacific Ocean, extending some [tpl]convert|1500|mi|km|abbr=off[/tpl] from the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in the south to northernmost Kure Atoll. Once known as the "Sandwich Islands", the name chosen by James Cook in honour of the then First Lord of the Admiralty John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, the archipelago now takes its name from the largest island in the cluster. The United States state of Hawaii occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety, with the sole exception of Midway island, which is instead an unincorporated territory within the United States Minor Outlying Islands.
The Hawaiian Islands are the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle. The islands are about [tpl]convert|1860|mi|km|-2[/tpl] from the nearest continent.Macdonald, Abbott, and Peterson, 1984

==Islands and reefs==

Captain James Cook visited the islands on January 18, 1778 and named them the "Sandwich Islands" in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was one of his sponsors as the First Lord of the Admiralty.[tpl]Cite book|title= A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean: Undertaken, by the Command of His Majesty, for Making Discoveries in the Northern Hemisphere, to Determine the Position and Extent of the West Side of North America, Its Distance from Asia, and the Practicability of a Northern Passage to Europe: Performed Under the Direction of Captains Cook, Clerke, and Gore, in His Majesty's Ships the Resolution and Discovery, in the Years 1776, 1777, 1778, 1779, and 1780 |author= James Cook and James King |volume=2 |year=1784 |page= 222 |publisher= Nicol and Cadell, London |url= http://books.google.com/?id=O5AqNKtDqX0C&pg=PA222 [/tpl] This name was in use until the 1840s, when the local name "Hawaii" gradually began to take precedence.[tpl]cite web |last=Clement |first=Russell |title=From Cook to the 1840 Constitution: The Name Change from Sandwich to Hawaiian Islands |url=http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/495/JL14054.pdf?sequence=2 |publisher=University of Hawai'i at Manoa Hamilton Library|accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl]
The Hawaiian Islands have a total land area of [tpl]convert|6423.4|sqmi|km2|1[/tpl]. Except for Midway, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States, these islands and islets are administered as the state of Hawaii—the 50th state of the United States of America.

===[tpl]Anchor|Hawaiian Windward Islands[/tpl] Main islands===

The eight main islands of Hawaii (also called the Hawaiian Windward Islands) are listed here. All except Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe are inhabited.

===Smaller islands, atolls, reefs===

Smaller islands, atolls, and reefs (all west of Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau are uninhabited) form the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, or Hawaiian Leeward Islands:

===Islets===

The state of Hawaii counts 137 "islands" in the Hawaiian chain.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/library/facts/Facts_and_Figures_State_and_Counties.pdf | title= Hawai'i Facts & Figures |work= state web site  |publisher= State of Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development & Tourism |date=December 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-23 [/tpl] This number includes all minor islands and islets offshore of the main islands (listed above) and individual islets in each atoll. These are just a few:

==Geology==

The chain of islands or archipelago formed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at about [tpl]convert|32|mi|km|[/tpl] per million years. Hence the islands in the northwest of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods.[tpl]Cite web|title= Tectonics, geochronology, and origin of the Hawaiian-Emperor Volcanic Chain |url= http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/Faculty/Morden/BotZool450/Clague1989.pdf |work= The Geology of North America, Volume N: The Eastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii |year= 1989 |accessdate=2011-01-17 |publisher= The Geology Society of America [/tpl] From this study and others,[tpl]Cite journal|title= Potassium-Argon Ages of Lavas from the Hawi and Pololu Volcanic Series, Kohala Volcano, Hawaii |url= http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/83/12/3731.abstract |publisher= Geology Society of American Bulletin |year=1972 |volume=83 |pages= 3731–3738 |accessdate= 2011-01-17|doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1972)833731:PAOLFT2.0.CO;2|last1= McDougall|first1= IAN|last2= Swanson|first2= D.

The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, and on the submerged but growing volcano at the extreme southeast, Lo[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihi. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the U. S. Geological Survey documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism.
Almost all magma created in the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are constructed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser grained, gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite, does occur on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.
Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes. Mauna Loa, comprising over half of the Big Island, is the largest shield volcano on the Earth. The measurement from sea level to summit is more than [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km|0[/tpl], from sea level to sea floor about [tpl]convert|3.1|mi|km|0[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web|title= Mauna Loa Earth's Largest Volcano |url= http://wwwhvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/ |work= Hawaiian Volcano Observatory web site |publisher= USGS |date = February 2006|accessdate=2009-12-09 [/tpl]

===Earthquakes===

The Hawaiian Islands have many earthquakes, generally caused by volcanic activity. Most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in Hilo, by missionaries Titus Coan, Sarah J. Lyman and her family. From 1833 to 1896, approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/hawaii/history.php |title= Hawaii Earthquake History |accessdate=2009-12-09 |work= Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher= United States Geological Survey |year=1972 [/tpl]
Hawaii accounted for 7.3% of the United States' reported earthquakes with a magnitude 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003, with a total 1533 earthquakes. Hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period, after Alaska and California.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/top_states.php |title= Top Earthquake States |accessdate=2009-12-09 |work= Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher= United States Geological Survey |year=2003 [/tpl]
On Sunday, October 15, 2006, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the Kona area of the big island. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock. Minor-to-moderate damage was reported on most of the Big Island. Several major roadways became impassable from rock slides, and effects were felt as far away as Honolulu, Oahu, nearly [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] from the epicenter. Power outages lasted for several hours to whole days. Several water mains ruptured. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.
Earthquakes are monitored by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory run by the USGS.

==Tsunamis==

The Hawaiian Islands are subject to tsunamis, great waves that strike the shore. Tsunamis are most often caused by earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific. The waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of [tpl]convert|400|–|500|mph|km/h|-2[/tpl] and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles (kilometers) away.
Tsunamis may also initiate in the Hawaiian Islands. Explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis. The island of Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i had a catastrophic collapse or debris avalanche over a million years ago; this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis. The Hilina Slump on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.
The city of Hilo on the Big Island has been most affected by tsunamis, where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of Hilo Bay. Coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.
A tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Chile hit the islands on February 27, 2010. It was relatively minor, but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. It was declared a "good drill" for the next major event by the Governor.
A tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Japan hit the islands on March 11, 2011. It was relatively minor, but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The tsunami caused about $1 million in damages, almost all limited to the Kona coast of the Big Island. However, due to the deep underwater trenches that surround the Hawaiian islands, very few tsunamis reach them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Ecology==

The endemic plant and animal species of the Hawaiian Islands developed in nearly complete isolation over about 70 million years. Prior to the human arrival, the only native mammals were the Hawaiian hoary bat and the Hawaiian monk seal.http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Hawaii/mammal-monk-seal.html
Human contact, first by Polynesians, introduced new trees, other plants and animals. These included voracious species such as rats and pigs, who took a heavy toll on native birds and invertebrates that evolved in the absence of such predators. The growing population also brought deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food went extinct. As humans cleared land for farming, monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.
The arrival of the Europeans had a significant impact, with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing. This led to increased clearing of forests, and the development of towns, adding more species to list of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands. As of 2009, many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.[tpl]Cite book|title= Agroforestry Guides for Pacific Islands |editors= Craig R. Elevitch and Kim M.

==National Monument==

On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush issued a public proclamation creating Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Monument encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] marine wildlife reserve in the world.

==Climate==

The climate of the Hawaiian Islands is tropical but it experiences many different climates, depending on altitude and weather.[tpl]cite book|pages=39, 43, 49, 53|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BJjf0Oh2EBIC&pg=PA49|title=Hydrology of the Hawaiian Islands|isbn=9780824829483|author1=Lau|first1=Leung-Ku Stephen|last2=Mink|first2=John Francis|date=2006-10-01[/tpl]  The islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks (the windward side) as a result of orographic precipitation. Coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks or leeward sides, tend to be drier.
In general, the lowlands of Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April). Drier conditions generally prevail from May to September. The tropical storms, and occasional hurricanes, tend to occur from July through November.
