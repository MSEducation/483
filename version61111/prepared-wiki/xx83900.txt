BBspot was a geek satire and humour web site founded in 2000.  In 2003, the site was successful enough that webmaster Brian Briggs "quit his day job" and made the site his full-time vocation. BBspot is most notable for its technology news satire.
Material from BBspot has been featured several times, sometimes presented inaccurately as real news, on respectable news websites and on TV.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
BBspot is a founding member of HumorFeed, a prominent community of news satire webmasters; Briggs is also a member of the editorial board for Check Please!, a journal devoted to the serious examination of news satire and journalism.
Content updates to BBSpot ceased in November of 2011.

==Content==

BBspot is most notable for its news satire, which mainly covers Technology, Microsoft, and Hollywood. Responses from "BBelievers" [tpl]sic[/tpl] who are fooled by the stories are posted approximately weekly. Since 2006, the site also hosts The PC Weenies cartoons by Krishna M. Sadasivam, which replaces the FuzzyLogic cartoons created between 2001 and 2004.
BBspot issues an award, the Technical Award of Excellence, for gadgets and technology, based on a series of obscure or superficial challenges; such as coin flips, who has the best mascot, logo or name, and the web site.
The site also contains movie trailer reviews, internet-based guffs ("BBloopers"), regular guest columns and other items of general interest. There is also a forum.

==Press coverage==

Several mainstream media outlets have represented the satire on the site as real news. Fooled outlets include TechTV's The Screen Savers show, the Discovery Channel as well as radio shows, major newspapers and books.

==Awards==

BBspot won third place in the HumorFeed Satire News Awards twice, in 2006 for its story "Microsoft's AntiSpyware Tool Removes Internet Explorer" and in 2007 for "Teen Using Myspace To Lure Bands to Los Angeles".
