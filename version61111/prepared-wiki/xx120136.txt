The song is sometimes rendered as "I've Grown Accustomed to His Face" when sung by a female singer, or as "I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face."
Kermit the Frog performed this song several times during the 1950s and '60s, though at that time he was not yet a frog. In this case, the character wore a wig while lipsyncing to Rosemary Clooney's recording of the song, singing to a small creature that is covered entirely by a piece of cloth with a face drawn on it. As "she" sings, the creature eats the mask off its own head, revealing itself to be the Muppet character Yorick (from Sam and Friends). Kermit keeps singing though, even as Yorick tries to munch on his hand. Later on, Brian Henson (son of Jim Henson, the original performer of Kermit) and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph recreated the famous sketch for the Henson Alternative Show Stuffed and Unstrung and at the D23 Expo, once again using the Rosemary Clooney soundtrack.
Barbra Streisand performed several lines in her "Color Me Barbra Medley" from the TV special and album Color Me Barbra.
Stewie Griffin sings his version in the Family Guy episode "Running Mates"
Sideshow Bob sings his own version of this song in The Simpsons (in the Season 14 episode The Great Louse Detective).
