St Paul's Walden is a village about [tpl]convert|5|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England. The civil parish of St Paul's Walden also includes the village of Whitwell and the hamlet of Bendish. 
St Paul's Walden has two 18th-century mansions, both standing in parks of great beauty: Stagenhoe  (once owned by the Earls of Caithness) and St Paul's Walden Bury (owned by the Bowes-Lyon family), which some say was the birthplace of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Indeed, she was baptised in the All Saints church in St Paul's Walden.[tpl]cite book|last=Whitelaw |first=Jeffrey W.|title=Hidden Hertfordshire|accessdate=19 April 2012|edition=First|date=13 October 1988|publisher=Countryside Books|isbn=9781853060250[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://parishmagazine.freeyellow.com/Church_History04.htm|title=Welcome to the history of  All Saints, St. Paul's Walden|publisher=St Paul's Walden Parish Magazine|accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl]
