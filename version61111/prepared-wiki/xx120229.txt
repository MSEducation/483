The personal name Duncan can be found in Scotland’s oldest records in its Gaelic form Dunchad/Donchadh/Donachie/Donnchadh and other spelling variants.

==Origins==

(Dunchad) Duncan, originally a forename[tpl]cite book|last=Black|first=George F.|title=The Surnames of Scotland|year=1996|publisher=Birlinn Ltd. Edinburgh|isbn=1-874744-83-1|page=228[/tpl] is without doubt one of the earliest names in Scotland – surnames being introduced by the Normans around 1120 AD – and originates from the Dalriadan Celtic Celtic Scotii (Scots) from Ireland who colonised the south west of Scotland from about the 4th century AD. Dúnchad (Duncan mac Conaing) co-ruled Dalriada with Conall II (c.650 - 654).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annalauladhannal01royauoft/annalauladhannal01royauoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Annala Uladh = Annals of Ulster |accessdate=2009-08-15|work=Internet Archive[/tpl]
Other early accounts of the name include the 9 ft inscribed ‘Turpillian Stone’ of the 4th century AD at Crickhowell, Wales, a particularly early mention of the name Duncan. Inscribed in Ogham (an early form of Celtic writing) the stone also carried the Latin translation “TURPILLI IC IACIT PUUERI TRILUNI DUNOCATI” which roughly translates as  The Fort Warrior.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/crckh_1.html|title=The Turpillian Stone, Macalister/1845, Nash-Williams 1950|accessdate=2009-08-15|work=University College London[/tpl] Mention is also made of Dunchad (Duncan) the 11th Abbot of Iona, 707 – 717AD (later St. Dunchadh) and Dunchad (Duncan) the 39th Abbot in 989AD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_010/10_202_214.pdf|title=History of the Ruins of Iona by William Forbes Skeen|accessdate=2009-08-15|work=Proceedings of The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (April 14th 1873)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunchad_I_of_Iona|title=Dúnchad mac Cinn Fáelad|accessdate=2009-08-15|work=Wikipedia Encyclopedia[/tpl]
Records from this time are scant and it is not until after the unification by Kenneth MacAlpin around 843 AD of the Celtic Scots of Dál Riata (Dalriada) and the aboriginal Picts of northern Britain do we start to see the name significantly being used in other parts of Scotland. One of the earliest references to Dunchad/Donchad, is found in the margins of the 11th century 'Book of Deer the oldest writings in Scots Gaelic known in Scotland today, These manuscript were written by the early Christian Monks of the Abbey of Deer in Aberdeenshire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cushnieent.force9.co.uk/NewDeerBook/index.htm|title=The Book of Deer, Aberdeenshire, Folio 5|accessdate=2009-08-15|work=Firths Celtic Scotland[/tpl]
When Duncan I took the Scottish throne, Unlike the "King Duncan" of Shakespeare's Macbeth, the historical Duncan appears to have been a young man. He followed his grandfather Malcolm II as king after the latter's death on 25 Nov. 1034, without apparent opposition. He may have been Malcolm's acknowledged successor or tánaise as the succession appears to have been uneventful. Duncan would have been wise to pacify his remaining family, especially his senior cousin Thorfinn the Mighty, Earl of Orkney; his uncle, MacBeth; and the person closest to his throne, Queen Gruoch, MacBeth’s wife. By 1040, however, Duncan had been murdered and the crown was in the hands MacBeth.thumb|Scottish Clan Map  
Fifty-four years later, despite being the son of Malcolm Canmore, Duncan II was also dead at the hands of his relatives. Although Duncan had left a son, the throne was seized by his younger half-brother, one of the children of English Queen Margaret.

The clan name is said to come from Donnachadh Reamhar -‘Stout Duncan’. Legend has it that this chief led the clan into Battle at Bannockburn in 1314. Recent genealogical research however suggests that this is unlikely. Both the Duncans and the Robertsons descend from the 4th Donachie/Donnachadh Chief.
The predominant Duncans of the East of Scotland were the Duncans of Lundie in Forfarshire. Their extensive property included not only the barony of Lundie but also the estate of Gourdie.
