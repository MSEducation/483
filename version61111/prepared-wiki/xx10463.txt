It is generally intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, and is of a reddish, tawny color.
Based on fossil and archaeological evidence, the original red wolf range extended throughout the southeast, from the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, north to Indiana and the Ohio River Valley and central Pennsylvania, and west to central Texas and southeastern Missouri. Historical habitats included forests, swamps, and coastal prairies, where it was an apex predator. The red wolf is morphologically intermediate between gray wolves and coyotes, and a 2011 genetic study indicated that it may be a hybrid species between gray wolves and coyotes. Re-analysis of this study coupled with a broader contextual analysis including behavioral, morphological and additional genetic information led to arguments that the red wolf is an independent species but has suffered from significant introgression of coyote genes likely due to decimation of red wolf packs with fragmentation of their social structure from hunting.[tpl]cite journal |title=Conservation genomics in perspective: A holistic approach to understanding Canis evolution in North America |authors=Linda Y.

The red wolf was thought to be extinct in the wild by 1980. 1987 saw a reintroduction in northeastern North Carolina through a captive breeding program and the animals are considered to be successfully breeding in the wild.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.1997.Endangered Red Wolves. http://library.fws.gov/Pubs4/endangered_red_wolves.pdf:1-3.

==Taxonomy==

The taxonomy of the red wolf has been debated since before efforts began in 1973 to save it from extinction. In 1971, Atkins and Dillon conducted a study on the brains of canids and confirmed the basal characteristics of the red wolf.Atkins, D. and L.Dillon. 1971. Evolution of the cerebellum in the genus Canis. J. Mammal. 52:96-97. Many studies throughout the 1970s focused on the morphology of the red wolf came to the conclusion that the red wolf is a distinct species.Paradiso, J. 1968. Canids recently collected in east Texas, with comments on the taxonomy of the red wolf. Am. Midl. Nat. 80:529-34. In 1980, a unique allele was found in Canis specimens from within the red wolf range, supporting the conclusion that the red wolf is a distinct species.Ferrell et al. 1980. Biochemical markers in species endangered by introgression: The red wolf. Biochem. Genet. 18:39-49. Nevertheless, some in the scientific community considered it a subspecies of the gray wolfLawrence,B. and W. Bossert. 1975. Relationships of North American Canis shown by a multiple character analysis of selected populations. P. 73-86 in M.W. Fox, ed., The wild canids: Their systematic, behavioral ecology, and evolution. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York. or a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote.Mech, L.1970. The wolf: The ecology and behavior of an endangered species. Natural History Press, Garden City, NY.Wayne, R. and S.Jenks. 1991. Mitochondrial DNA analysis supports extensive hybridization of the endangered red wolf (Canis rufus)" Nature 351:565-68.
In 1992, the USFWS conducted an exhaustive review of the literature, including their own, and concluded that the red wolf is either a separate species unto itself or a subspecies of the gray wolf.Phillips, M. & Henry, V. (1992). Comments on red wolf taxonomy. Conservation Biology, 6:596–599.Nowak, R. (1992). The red wolf is not a hybrid. Conservation Biology, 6:593–595.Nowak et al. (1995). Another look at wolf taxonomy. pp 375–397 In L.N. Carbyn, S.H. Fritts, and D.R. Seip, eds. Ecology and conservation of wolves in a changing world. Canadian Circumpolar Institute, Edmonton, Alberta. Many agency reports, books and web pages list the red wolf as Canis rufus but genetic research re-opened the debate about the taxonomy of both the red wolf and Canada's eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon).Wilson et al. (2000). DNA profiles of the eastern Canadian wolf and the red wolf for a common evolutionary history independent of the gray wolf. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 78:2156–2166. Wilson et al. (2000) concluded that the eastern wolf and red wolf should be considered as sister taxa due to a shared common ancestor going back 150,000–300,000 years. In addition, Wilson et al. further stated that they should be recognized as distinct species from other North American canids, and not as subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). However, these conclusions were disputed,Koblmuller, S., Nord, M., Wayne, R. K. and J. Leonard. (2009). Origin and Status of the Great Lakes wolf. Molecular Ecology, 18:2313–2326. and MSW3[tpl]MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id = 14000773[/tpl] listed them both in 2005 as subspecies of the gray wolf.
In May 2011, an analysis of red wolf, Eastern wolf, gray wolf, and dog genomes suggested that the red wolf was 76–80 percent coyote and only 20–24 percent gray wolf, suggesting that the red wolf is actually much more coyote in origin than the Eastern wolf. This study analyzed 48,000 SNP and found no evidence for a unique Eastern wolf or red wolf species.[tpl]cite journal|last=VonHolt|first=BM|coauthors=et al|title=A genome-wide perspective on the evolutionary history of enigmatic wolf-like canids|journal=Genome Res|date=12 May 2011|pmid=21566151|doi=10.1101/gr.116301.110|pmc=3149496|volume=21|issue=8|pages=1294–305[/tpl] However, X-Ray analysis of the 16 red wolf specimens used in the SNP study were later shown to be wolf-coyote hybrids via cranial morphometric analysis, rendering the finding that the red wolf was a gray wolf-coyote hybrid inaccurate.[tpl]cite book |title=The Secret World of Red Wolves |author=T.

Another Y-chromosome genetic study in 2012 also argued that the eastern wolf and red wolf are not hybrids but rather are a distinct species from the gray wolf, although eastern and red wolves do intermix with coyotes.[tpl]cite journal |title=Y-chromosome evidence supports widespread signatures of three-species Canis hybridization in eastern North America |authors=Paul J.

Stronen, Nathalie Tessier, Hélène Jolicoeur, Paul C. Paquet, Michel Hénault, Mario Villemure, Brent R. Patterson, Tim Sallows, Gloria Goulet and François-Joseph Lapointe |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.335/abstract |accessdate=2013-07-01 |doi=10.1002/ece3.335[/tpl] The controversy over the red wolf's species status was the subject of a comprehensive review of the 2011 and 2012 genetics studies, which concluded that there are three separate species of wolf in North America, the red wolf, eastern wolf and gray wolf.
In a pair of 2012 reports, scientists critical of the May 2011 paper outlined three main points of criticism. First, the 2011 paper relied on mtDNA SNPs derived from boxer and poodle genomes and used these to extrapolate inference about genetic variation within wild canids across the globe. While it is true that many SNPs were examined, it remains unclear whether loci important to red wolf genetic variation were actually identified and analyzed (for example, nuclear DNA was not compared in the SNP analysis). Second, the study sampled modern red wolf specimens, and not historic red wolf specimens from prior to 1900 (when extensive hybridization with coyotes is known to have taken place), which obfuscates the reliability of the study's findings. This is important because using historic red wolf genetic material would have created a baseline genetic profile for the species against which to test the modern captive-bred specimens. (It is common knowledge that the captive-bred red wolves are likely slightly hybridized, but this is a separate issue from interpreting their species origin as due to hybridization.) Third, the authors lumped Eastern wolf specimens (which critics from Trent University warn are of unverified origin) with other Great Lakes wolf specimens, and did not test them separately, which again obfuscated any genetic differences that may have been present. The controversy over the eastern wolf's origins is not considered by the scientific community to be laid to rest, although it may be synonymous with the red wolf.
When considered as a full species, three subspecies of red wolf were originally recognized by Goldman;E.A. Goldman. (1937). The wolves of North America. Journal of Mammology, 18:37–45. two of these subspecies are extinct. The Florida black wolf (Canis rufus floridanus) (Maine to Florida)Nowak, R. M. (2002). The original status of Wolves in Eastern North America. Southeastern Naturalist, 1:95–130 has been extinct since 1930 and Gregory's wolf (Canis rufus gregoryi) (south-central United States) was declared functionally extinct in the wild by 1980. The Texas red wolf (Canis rufus rufus), the third surviving subspecies, was also functionally extinct in the wild by 1980, although that status was changed to "critically endangered" when captive-bred red wolves from Texas were reintroduced in eastern North Carolina in 1987. The current status of the "non-essential/experimental" population in North Carolina is "endangered" and the population numbers around 100 wild animals.[tpl]cite web |title=Red Wolf Recovery Program |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Program |url=http://www.fws.gov/redwolf/ |accessdate=2013-07-02 [/tpl] The subspecies designations are essentially moot since two are extinct but the genetic evidence for the three subspecies appears to have been unconvincing anyway.

===Fossil and historic record===

Paleontological evidence has suggested an origin of the red wolf line 1–2 Ma, branching from a wolf-coyote ancestor, which itself appeared about 4.9 Ma.W. W. Dalquest and G. E. Schultz 1992. Ice Age mammals of northwestern TexasB. Kurten and E. Anderson. 1980. Pleistocene mammals of North America 1-442 Between 150,000–300,000 years ago, the North American branch evolved into the red wolf, eastern wolf and the coyote.Wilson, P.J., S. Grewal, I.D. Lawford, J.N.M. Heal, A.G. Granacki, D. Pennock, J.B. Theberge, M.T. Theberge, D.R. Voigt, W. Waddell, R.E.Chambers, P.C. Paquet, G. Goulet, D. Cluff, and B.N. White. 2000. DNA profiles of the eastern Canadian wolf and the red wolf provide evidence for a common evolutionary history independent of the gray wolf. Canadian Journal of Zoology 78:2156 - 2166.  Another wolf-like branch migrated to Eurasia and evolved into the gray wolf, which later migrated to North America. 
It is thought that its original distribution included much of eastern North America, where red wolves were found from Maine south to Florida and in south central US westward to Texas. Records of bounty payments to Wappinger Indians in New York in the middle 18th century confirm its range at least that far north;J.

==Physical description and behavior==

The red wolf's appearance is typical of the genus Canis, and is generally intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, though some specimens may overlap in size with small gray wolves. Adults measure 136-160 cm in length, and weigh 40-90 lbs. Its pelage is typically more reddish and sparsely furred than the coyote's and gray wolf's, though melanistic individuals do occur.Paradiso, J. L., and R. M. Nowak. 1972. Canis rufus. Mammalian Species 22:1–4 Its fur is generally tawny to grayish in color, with light markings around the lips and eyes.Woodward, D. W. (1980), The Red Wolf, FWS Like the eastern wolf,[ref]
