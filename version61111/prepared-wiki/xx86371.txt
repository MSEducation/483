Maury Island is a small island in Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. It is connected to Vashon Island by an isthmus built by local homeowners in 1913. Before construction of the isthmus, the island was connected to Vashon only during low tide.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The island is rural with large areas of excellent farmland, forest, and relatively undeveloped shoreline. Currently, environmental issues on the island are under considerable scrutiny.
Maury Island was named during the Wilkes Expedition[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] in honor of William Lewis Maury,[ref]
