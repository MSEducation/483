The entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 123 districts.
The Russian capital's specific town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century, when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development, when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future town-planning of the Russian capital.
The following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Automobile Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the Ring Road, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of Zelenograd. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now has a border with Kaluga Oblast.Official website of the Government of Moscow. Draft of adopted measures of the capital and oblast governments with regards to the expansion of the borders of Moscow [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] In all, Moscow gained about [tpl]convert|1500|km2|sp=us[/tpl] and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a "mega-city" of twenty million people, to develop "harmonically".
All administrative okrugs and districts have their own coats of arms and flags as well as individual heads of the area.
In addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.[tpl]cite web|title=Цены на Квартиры в Москве по Административным Районам и Станциям Метро|url=http://www.metrinfo.ru/area/|work=Metrinfo.ru|accessdate=27 September 2010|language=Russian[/tpl]
Moscow also hosts some of the government bodies of Moscow Oblast, although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.According to Article 24 of the Charter of Moscow Oblast, the government bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially named the administrative centre of the oblast.
On the map, Moscow that until the 2011 enlargement had the form of an irregular circle, turned into a "comet" and, interrupting its development according to a circular principle, began to grow along the axis. The city had expanded by adding territories in the southwest: twenty-one municipal formations, including two urban okrugs (Troitsk and Shcherbinka), and nineteen urban and rural settlements that used to be a part of Podolsky, Leninsky, and Naro-Fominsky Districts of Moscow Oblast. Part of the territory of Odintsovsky and Krasnogorsky Districts was also added to the city."Putin to hold meeting on Moscow enlargement", August 14, 2012

Moscow has one of the largest municipal economies in Europe and it accounts for approximately 22% of Russian GDP.[tpl]cite web|last=Arkhipov |first=Ilya |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-28/medvedev-fires-moscow-s-mayor-yury-luzhkov-citing-a-loss-of-confidence-.html |title=Medvedev Fires Moscow Mayor Luzhkov After Conflict |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl] As of 2009, the GRP in Moscow reached 7.16 trl roubles[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/vvp/vrp98-09.xls|date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-08-21 |publisher=RosStat |title=Moscow Gross Regional Product[/tpl] ($225 bln[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2007&ey=2014&ssd=1&sort=subject&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=52&pr1.y=12&c=922&s=NGDP_R%2CNGDP_RPCH%2CNGDP%2CNGDPD%2CNGDP_D%2CNGDPRPC%2CNGDPPC%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CPPPSH%2CPPPEX%2CPCPI%2CPCPIPCH%2CPCPIE%2CPCPIEPCH%2CLP%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&grp=0&a=|date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2010-03-11 |publisher=IMF Russia Economy |title=Russia GDP and PPP conversion rate[/tpl]).
Moscow has the lowest unemployment rate of all federal subjects of Russia, standing at just 1% in 2010, compared to the national average of 7%. The average monthly wage in the city is 41,600 roubles (), which is almost twice the national average of 21,800 rubles (), and the fourth highest among the federal subjects of Russia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/A0C226F8-3D3F-4B6F-8AA3-B621E963D4CC/0/w201042.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tmjrHFzM|archivedate=2010-10-27|title=BOFIT Weekly 42/2010|publisher=Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition|date=2010-10-22[/tpl]
Moscow is the undisputed financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as natural gas giant Gazprom. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gks.ru/gis/tables%5CUROV-7.htm |publisher=Federal Service on State Statistics |title=Average monthly salaries |accessdate=2007-09-07[/tpl] Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, various business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use.
Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption continue still hinder business development.

Additionally, some industry is now being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city. Nevertheless, Moscow remains one of Russia's major industrial centers.

===Living costs===

During Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s, when people were permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.
Due to the current economic situation, the price of real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4000 on average per square meter (11 sq ft) on the outskirts of the city[tpl]cite web|url=http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://rus.intermark.ru/about-us/press/mt_20_10/ |title=US$4,500 for a Square Meter of Apartment Space.

A typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square meters (323 sq ft), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square meters (485 sq ft), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square meters (753 sq ft). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in dachas (country houses) outside the city.

In regards to primary and secondary education, Clifford J. Levy of The New York Times said "Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades."[tpl]cite news |first=Clifford J. |last=Levy |authorlink=Clifford J.

==Transportation==

===Air===

There are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow:
Sheremetyevo International Airport is the most common entry point for foreign visitors, handling sixty percent of all international flights.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.go-russia.com/angela.php |publisher=Go-Russia |title=Moscow Airports |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl] Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput, and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo's. The three other airports particularly offer flights within Russia and to and from states from the former Soviet Union.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/byplane.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708154208/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/byplane.html |archivedate=2006-07-08 |accessdate=2006-07-03 |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Plane |publisher=The Moscow Times[/tpl] Moscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Bykovo is the farthest, at [tpl]convert|35|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; Domodedovo is next at [tpl]convert|22|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; Vnukovo is [tpl]convert|11|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; Sheremetyevo is [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about [tpl]convert|8|km|mi[/tpl] from MKAD.
There are also several smaller airports close to Moscow, such as Myachkovo Airport, intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.[tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Airport Myachkovo changed the owners

===Water===

Moscow also has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is also the main hub for long-range river routes. There are also three freight ports serving Moscow.

===Railway===

Moscow employs several train stations to serve the city. Moscow's nine rail terminals (or vokzals)  are:
The terminals are located close to the city center, along the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and all connect to a metroline to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708154220/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archivedate=2006-07-08 |publisher=The Moscow Times |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Train |accessdate=2006-07-03[/tpl] There are also many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are relatively cheap, they are the preferred mode of travelling for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is also the western terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which traverses nearly [tpl]convert|9300|km|precision=0[/tpl] of Russian territory to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.
Suburbs and satellite cities are also connected by commuter elektrichka (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to [tpl]convert|140|km|mi|0|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) large railway stations.
The Moscow Little Ring Railway is only used for cargo traffic. There are plans to use the railway for passenger traffic. There is a connecting railway line on the North side of the town which connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.

===Metro===

Local transport includes the Moscow Metro, a metro system famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers. When it first opened in 1935, the system had just two lines. Today, the Moscow Metro comprise twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 188 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance the Park Pobedy station, completed in 2003, at [tpl]convert|84|m[/tpl] underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is one of the world's busiest metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily.

===Bus and trolleybus===

As Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to [tpl]convert|4|km[/tpl], an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow also has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.See also: [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] http://www.kvartirant.ru/news/?news_id=10891&date=12.05.2006&date2=2006-05-12 Realty news.

Every major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a trolleybus route and have trolley wires over them.

===Monorail===

There is also a short monorail line, operated by the Moscow Metro company. The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VVTs. The line opened in 2004. Effective January 2013, no additional fare is needed (first metro-monorail transfer in 90 minutes does not charge).

===Tram===

Moscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899. The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips, because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross links between metro lines, for example between University station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino.
There are three separate tram networks in the city:
In addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the current problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.

===Taxi===

In Russia and Moscow, the difference between hailing a cab and simply hitchhiking is blurred. It's an old Russian tradition for drivers to offer rides to strangers for a fee. Generally, wherever you are, at any time of day or night, you can get a 'cab' in a matter of minutes or seconds by holding out your hand. Commercial taxi services are also available. In addition, route taxis are also in widespread use.

===Roads===

There are over 2.6 million cars in the city on a daily basis. Recent years have seen the growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.
The MKAD, along with the Third Transport Ring and the future Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. However, as one can easily observe from a map of the Moscow area, there are several other roadway systems that form concentric circles around the city.

==Future development==

The "Moscow International Business Center" is a projected new part of central Moscow. Geographically situated in Presnensky District, located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development.
The goal of MIBC is to create a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,[tpl]cite news|title=Москва-Сити начинается строительство Города столиц |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/12/23/city/|agency=Lenta.ru|language=Russian |work=|publisher=|date=December 23, 2005|accessdate=May 24, 2009[/tpl] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. It will be a city within a city. The project was conceived by the Moscow government in 1992.
The construction of Moscow-City takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to 1 square kilometer (247 acres). This area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.
The Federation Tower, now being built is to be completed in 2015, will become the tallest building in Europe when completed. Also to be included in the project are a water park and other recreational facilities; business and entertainment complexes, numerous prestigious office and residential buildings, the transport network and the new site of the Moscow government. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has already been completed, two of which have already opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the Sheremetyevo International Airport is also planned. Major thoroughfares through Moscow-City are the Third Ring and Kutuzovsky Prospekt. Three metro stations were initially planned for the Filyovskaya Line. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005, and was later renamed "Vystavochnaya" in 2009. The branch extended to the Mezhdunarodnaya station in 2006, and all work on third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between Kiyevskaya and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed. It was recently announced that there are plans to extend the branch as far as the Savyolovskaya station, on the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line.
A Fourth Ring freeway (in addition to Moscow Automobile Ring Road, Garden Ring and the Third Ring) has been designed and is being built around Moscow. It is to be completed by 2012 and will have a total length of [tpl]convert|61|km|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/auto/2006/02/27_a_551381.shtml |title=Вербепрне Йнкэжн Опнахбюер Днпнцс – Цюгерю.Ru |publisher=Gazeta.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prime-realty.ru/cmi/c5/5.146..htm |title=Четвертое транспортное кольцо Москвы |language=Russian|publisher=Prime-realty.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roads.ru/4tk/4tk_rbk.php |title=Plan of the Fourth Transport Road |publisher=Roads.ru |date=|accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl]
A rail connection linking the international airports at Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo with downtown terminals is also planned.
In March 2009 the Russian business newspaper "Kommersant"[tpl]cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/ |title=Издательский дом "Коммерсантъ" |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1087182 |title=Ъ-Санкт-Петербург – Девелопер на перепутье |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Ольга Ъ-Сичкарь |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1129754 |title=Ъ – Mirax Group проявила дар убеждения |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-rss.aspx?DocsID=1139873 |title=Ъ—ПИК построил меньше, а AFI Development получила убыток |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] reported that because of the Worldwide Economic Crisis, which started in 2008 and spread globally, many of the construction projects in Moscow (especially in the "Moscow International Business Center") are frozen and may be cancelled altogether—like the ambitious "Russia Tower" in "Moscow-city". Many of yesterday's monstrous development groups are now in a near-bankrupt state like the Mirax-group or AFI Development.
