The 2008–09 season did not start well for Seitaridis, as he lost his place in the first team to new signings Tomáš Ujfaluši and John Heitinga, and his heavy contract meant that Atlético was looking to sell him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.in.gr/football/international/article/?aid=919811|title=Πιέζεται για... έξοδο από την Ατλέτικο Μαδρίτης ο Γιούρκας (Giourkas pressured to exit Atletico Madrid)|date=16 July 2008|publisher=in.gr|language=Greek[/tpl] Despite that, Seitaridis was a starter in Atlético's opening game, in a 4–0 victory over Málaga CF,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.in.gr/football/international/article/?aid=933695|title=Επιμένει η Μπενφίκα για την απόκτηση του Σεϊταρίδη (Benfica insists on signing Seitaridis)|date=1 September 2008|publisher=in.gr|language=Greek[/tpl] and went on to make 14 league appearances that season.
