 [tpl]Harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=77–78[/tpl]</ref> By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. In 1947, [[Rudolf Rocker]] published ''Zur Betrachting der Lage in Deutschland'' (''Regarding the Portrayal of the Situation in Germany'') about the impossibility of another anarchist movement in Germany. It became the first post-World War II anarchist writing to be distributed in Germany. Rocker thought young Germans were all either totally cynical or inclined to fascism and awaited a new generation to grow up before anarchism could bloom once again in the country. Nevertheless, the Federation of Libertarian Socialists (FFS) was founded in 1947 by former FAUD members. Rocker wrote for its organ, ''Die Freie Gesellschaft'', which survived until 1953.<ref>[tpl]Harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=94–95[/tpl]</ref> In 1949, Rocker published another well-known work. On 10 September 1958, Rocker died in the Mohegan Colony. The [[Syndicalist Workers' Federation]] was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain,<ref name="Political Encyclopedia">[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'|year=2000|publisher=Pinter Publishers|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1855672642|url=http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-British-Irish-Political-Organizations/dp/1855672642[/tpl]</ref> and one of the Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.<ref name="Political Encyclopedia"/> Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], worker-centred strategy from the outset.<ref name="Political Encyclopedia"/> The [[Confédération nationale du travail]] (CNT, or National Confederation of Labour) was founded in 1946 by Spanish anarcho-syndicalists in exile with former members of the CGT-SR. The CNT later split into the CNT-Vignoles and the CNT-AIT, which is the French section of the IWA.
At the seventh congress in Toulouse in 1951 a much smaller IWA was relaunched, again without the CNT, which would not be strong enough to reclaim membership until 1958 as an exiled and underground organization. Delegates attended, though mostly representing very small groups, from Cuba, Argentina, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Britain, Bulgaria and Portugal. A message of support was received from Uruguay. But the situation remained difficult for the International, as it struggled to deal with the rise of state-sanctioned economic trade unionism  in the West, heavy secret service intervention as Cold War anti-communism reached its height and the banning of all strikes and free trade unions in the Soviet Union bloc of countries. At the tenth congress in 1958, the SAC’s response to these pressures led it into a clash with the rest of the international. It withdrew from the IWA following its failure to amend the body’s statutes to allow it to stand in municipal electionsSAC had begun contesting municipal elections under the candidatures of Libertarian Municipal People and amid concerns over its integration with the state over distribution of unemployment benefits.Michael Schmidt and Lucien Van Der Walt (2009), Black Flame For most of the next two decades, the international struggled to prebuild itself. In 1976, at the 15th congress, the IWA had only five member groups, two of which (the Spanish and Bulgarian members) were still operating in exile (though following Franco's death in 1975, the CNT was already approaching a membership of 200,000).
The Direct Action Movement was formed in 1979, when the one remaining SWF branch, along with other smaller anarchist groups, decided to form a new organisation of anarcho-syndicalists in Britain.http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/x69qfd The DAM was highly involved in the Miners' Strike as well as a series of industrial disputes later in the 1980s, including the Ardbride dispute in Ardrossan, Scotland, involving a supplier to Laura Ashley, for which the DAM received international support. From 1988 in Scotland, then England and Wales, the DAM was active in opposing the Poll Tax.[tpl]cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Albert|title=I Couldn't Paint Golden Angels|year=2001|publisher=AK Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1873176931|url=http://libcom.org/library/25-lucky-strike-direct-action-years-poll-tax-battle-trafalgar-square-class-war-leo[/tpl] In 1994 it adopted its current name, having previously been the Direct Action Movement since 1979, and before that the Syndicalist Workers' Federation since 1950. In March 1994, DAM changed its name to the Solidarity Federation. Presently, the Solidarity Federation publishes the quarterly magazine Direct Action (presently on hiatus) and the newspaper Catalyst
In 1979 a split over representative unionism, professional unionism and state-funded schemes saw the CNT divided into two sections, the CNT as it is today and the Confederacion General del Trabajo. After Franco's death in November 1975 and the beginning of Spain's transition to democracy, the CNT was the only social movement to refuse to sign the 1977 Moncloa Pact,[tpl]Harvnb|Roca Martínez|2006|p=108[/tpl] an agreement amongst politicians, political parties, and trade unions to plan how to operate the economy during the transition. In 1979, the CNT held its first congress since 1936 as well as several mass meetings, the most remarkable one in Montjuïc. Views put forward in this congress would set the pattern for the CNT's line of action for the following decades: no participation in union elections, no acceptance of state subsidies,[tpl]Harvnb|Roca Martínez|2006|p=109[/tpl] no acknowledgment of works councils, and support of union sections. In this first congress, held in Madrid,[tpl]harvnb|Aguilar Fernández|2002|p=110[/tpl] a minority sector in favor of union elections split from the CNT, initially calling themselves CNT Valencia Congress (referring to the alternative congress held in this city), and later Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) after an April 1989 court decision determined that they could not use the CNT initials.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cnt.es/Documentos/faq.htm#diferencia |title=FAQ |quote="Un sector minoritario que es partidario de las elecciones sindicales se escinde y pasa a llamarse CNT congreso de valencia (en referencia al Congreso alternativo realizado en esa ciudad) y posteriormente, perdidas judicialmente las siglas, a CGT." [/tpl] In 1990, a group of CGT members left this union because they rejected the CGT's policy of accepting government subsidies, founding Solidaridad Obrera. One year before, the 1978 Scala Case affected the CNT. An explosion killed three people in a Barcelona night club.[tpl]harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=1094[/tpl] The authorities alleged that striking workers "blew themselves up", and arrested surviving strikers, implicating them in the crime.[tpl]harvnb|Meltzer|1996|p=265[/tpl] CNT members declared that the prosecution sought to criminalize their organization:[tpl]es icon[/tpl] A series of three articles about the Scala Case from the CNT point of view: (1) El Caso Scala.

thumbnail|right|Members of the Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT marching in Madrid in 2010After its legalization, the CNT began efforts to recover the expropriations of 1939. The basis for such recovery would be established by Law 4/1986, which required the return of the seized properties, and the unions' right to use or yield the real estate. Since then the CNT has been claiming the return of these properties from the State. In 1996, the Economic and Social Council facilities in Madrid were squatted by 105 CNT militants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1996/12/07/economia/186681.html |title=Los 117 detenidos de la CNT, en libertad tras prestar declaración |date=1996-12-07 |work=El Mundo |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-01-14 [/tpl] This body is in charge of the repatriation of the accumulated union wealth. In 2004 an agreement was reached between the CNT and the District Attorney's Office, through which all charges were dropped against the hundred prosecuted for this occupation.
On 3 September 2009, six members of the Serbian IWA section (ASI-MUR), including then-IWA General Secretary Ratibor Trivunac, were arrestedhttp://libcom.org/news/belgrade-anarchists-arrested-state-attorney-international-terrorism-04092009 on suspicion of international terrorism, a charge which was heavily disputed by the international and other anarchist groups. Shortly after their arrest, an open letter was circulatedhttp://asi.zsp.net.pl/belgrade-professors-send-open-letter-in-defense-of-arrested/ by Serbian academics criticizing the charges and the attitude of Serbian police. The six were formally indicted on December 7 and after a lengthy trial procedure Trivunac, along with other 5 anarchists, was freed on February 17, 2010. On 10 December 2009, the FAU local in Berlin was effectively banned as a union following a public industrial dispute at the city's Babylon cinema. At the XXIV annual congress of the IWA, which was held in Brazil in December 2009, the first time the congress had been held outside Europe, motions of support were passed for the "Belgrade Six" and FAU while members of the Solidarity Federation temporarily took over duties as Secretariat. The International's Norwegian section subsequently took on the Secretariat role in 2010. As part of the anti-austerity movement in Europe, various IWA sections have been highly active in the 2008-2012 period, with the CNT taking a leading role in agitating for the general strikes which have occurred in Spain, the USI in Milan taking on anti-austerity campaigns in the health service and the ZSP organizing tenants against abuses in rented accommodation.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://internationalworkersassociation.blogspot.com|title=The unofficial IWA blog|year=2011|publisher=ASI-MUR|accessdate=2011-10-14[/tpl] keeps an updated list of recent IWA member activities"
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004). The regions with the largest CNT membership are the Centre (Madrid and surrounding area), the North (Basque country), Andalucía, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.Beltrán Roca Martínez, "Anarchism, Anthropology and Andalucia", Anarchist Studies The CNT opposes the model of union elections and workplace committees[tpl]es icon[/tpl] ¿Que son las elecciones sindicales?, official CNT site.

==Theory and politics==

Anarcho-syndicalists believe that direct action—action carried out by workers, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—would allow workers to liberate themselves.Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice (AK Press, 2004), p. 73, ISBN 1-902593-92-8
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers’ organisations that oppose the wage system will eventually form the basis of a new society and should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers alone should decide on that which affects them.Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice (AK Press, 2004), p. 62-63, ISBN 1-902593-92-8

===Relationship with party politics===

The anarcho-syndicalist orientation of many early American labour unions arguably played an important role in the formation of the American political spectrum, most significantly of the Industrial Workers of the World. The United States is the only industrialized country that does not have a major labour-based political party.Lipset, Seymour Martin and Marks, Gary, It Didn’t Happen Here: Why Socialism Failed in the United States (W. W. Norton & Company, 2001). ISBN 0-393-32254-8  This has not always been the case.  In 1912, for example, Eugene Debs (a founding member of the IWW) polled 6% of the popular vote as the Socialist Party presidential candidate—a significant portion of the popular vote considering that this was 8 years before the adoption of universal suffrage in the U.S.  Some political scientists would, in part, attribute the lack of an American labour party to the single member plurality electoral system, which tends to favour a two-party system.  This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Duverger's law.
Controversially, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo participated in the Spanish Republican Popular Front government in the Spanish Civil War.  In November 1936, four anarchist ministers—Garcia Oliver, Federica Montseny, Joan Peiró, and Juan López—accepted positions in the government. This move was criticised by rank-and-file groups like the Friends of Durruti.
The French CGT leadership under Léon Jouhaux faced similar criticism from its own left-wing, after its close collaboration with Government during the First World War and, later, the Popular Front (France); However, unlike the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, on both occasions the CGT stopped short of full Cabinet participation.

===Notable theorists===

====Rudolf Rocker====

Rudolf Rocker is one of the most influential figures in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] He dedicated himself to the organisation of Jewish immigrant workers in London's East End and led the 1912 garment workers strike. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet Anarcho-Syndicalism.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] In his article Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism, Rocker points out that the anarcho-syndicalist union has a dual purpose, "1. To enforce the demands of the producers for the safeguarding and raising of their standard of living; 2. To acquaint the workers with the technical management of production and economic life in general and prepare them to take the socio-economic organism into their own hands and shape it according to socialist principles."  In short, laying the foundations of the new society "within the shell of the old".  Up to the First World War and the Russian Revolution, anarcho-syndicalist unions and organisations were the dominant actors in the revolutionary left.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

====Noam Chomsky====

Noam Chomsky, who was influenced by Rocker, wrote the introduction to a modern edition of "Anarcho-syndicalism: Theory and Practice". A member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Chomsky is a self-described Anarcho-Syndicalist, a position which he sees as the appropriate application of classical liberal political theory to contemporary industrial society:
'Now a federated, decentralised system of free associations, incorporating economic as well as other social institutions, would be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism; and it seems to me that this is the appropriate form of social organisation for an advanced technological society in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools, of cogs in the machine. There is no longer any social necessity for human beings to be treated as mechanical elements in the productive process; that can be overcome and we must overcome it to be a society of freedom and free association, in which the creative urge that I consider intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realize itself in whatever way it will.'The Chomsky-Foucault Debate on Human Nature, The New Press, 2006, p.38-9

==Anarcho-syndicalist groups==

==Criticisms and responses==

Anarcho-syndicalism has been criticised as anachronistic by some contemporary anarchists.Heider, Ulrike and Bode, Ulrike, Anarchism: Left, Right and Green (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994), p. 4. ISBN 0-87286-289-5 Murray Bookchin in 1992 spoke against its reliance on an outdated view of work:
Bookchin has said that it prioritizes the interests of the working class, instead of communal freedom for society as a whole; and that this view ultimately prevents a true revolution. He argues that in instances like the Spanish Revolution, it was in spite of the syndicalist-minded CNT leadership that the revolution occurred.
Direct action, being one of the main staples of anarcho-syndicalism, would extend into the political sphere according to its supporters. To them, the labour council is the federation of all workplace branches of all industries in a geographical area "territorial basis of organisation linkage brought all the workers from one area together and fomented working-class solidarity over and before corporate solidarity".Romero Maura, "The Spanish Case", contained in Anarchism Today, D. Apter and J. Joll (eds.), p. 75 Rudolf Rocker argues:
Thus, anarcho-syndicalism is not apolitical but instead sees political and economic activity as the same. Unlike the propositions of some of its critics, anarcho-syndicalism is different from reformist union activity in that it aims to obliterate capitalism "Anarcho-syndicalism has a double aim: with tireless persistence, it must pursue betterment of the working class's current conditions. But, without letting themselves become obsessed with this passing concern, the workers should take care to make possible and imminent the essential act of comprehensive emancipation: the expropriation of capital."Emile Pouget in No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism, edited by Daniel Guerin (AK Press, 2005), p. 71. ISBN 1-904859-25-9
While collectivist and communist anarchists criticise syndicalism as having the potential to exclude the voices of citizens and consumers outside of the union, anarcho-syndicalists argue that labour councils will work outside of the workplace and within the community to encourage community and consumer participation in economic and political activity (even workers and consumers outside of the union or nation) and will work to form and maintain the institutions necessary in any society such as schools, libraries, homes, etc. Murray Bookchin argues:
