The Bohr radius is a physical constant, approximately equal to the most probable distance between the proton and electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It is named after Niels Bohr, due to its role in the Bohr model of an atom. In SI units the Bohr radius is:David J. Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Prentice-Hall, 1995, p. 137.

In the Bohr model of the structure of an atom, put forward by Niels Bohr in 1913, electrons orbit a central nucleus. The model says that the electrons orbit only at certain distances from the nucleus, depending on their energy.  In the simplest atom, hydrogen, a single electron orbits the nucleus and its smallest possible orbit, with lowest energy, has an orbital radius almost equal to the Bohr radius. (It is not exactly the Bohr radius due to the reduced mass effect. They differ by about 0.1%.)
Although the Bohr model is no longer in use, the Bohr radius remains very useful in atomic physics calculations, due in part to its simple relationship with other fundamental constants. (This is why it is defined using the true electron mass rather than the reduced mass, as mentioned above.) For example, it is the unit of length in atomic units.
According to the modern, quantum-mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom, the average distance −its expectation value− between electron and proton is ≈1.5a0,Modern physics, by Serway, Moses, Moyer, Example 8.9, p284 The value 1.5a0 is approximate, not exact, because it neglects reduced mass, fine structure effects (such as relativistic corrections), and other such small effects. somewhat different than the value in the Bohr model (≈a0), but certainly the same order of magnitude.
The Compton wavelength is about 20 times smaller than the Bohr radius, and the classical electron radius is about 1000 times smaller than the Compton wavelength.

==Reduced Bohr radius==

The Bohr radius including the effect of reduced mass in the hydrogen atom can be given by the following equation:
where:
In the above equation, the effect of the reduced mass is achieved by using the increased Compton wavelength, which is just the Compton wavelengths of the electron and the proton added together.
