Man o' War, (Lexington, Kentucky, March 29, 1917 – Faraway Farm, November 1, 1947) is considered one of the greatest Thoroughbred racehorses of all time.[tpl]Harvnb|Ours|2006|p=283[/tpl]. During his career just after World War I, he won 20 of 21 races and $249,465 in purses.[tpl]Harvnb|Ours|2006|p=277[/tpl].
Man o' War was sired by the prominent Fair Play. His dam, Mahubah, was sired by U.K. Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand. Man o' War was owned and bred by August Belmont, Jr. (1851–1924), whose father's accomplishments were recognized through the naming of the Belmont Stakes. Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named a new foal "Man o' War" in honor of her husband.[tpl]Harvnb|Ours|2006|pp=18, 286[/tpl]. However, the Belmonts decided to liquidate their racing stable. At the Saratoga yearling sale in 1918, Man o' War was sold at a final bid of $5,000 (equivalent to $[tpl]Inflation|US|5|1918|r=0[/tpl],000 in [tpl]currentyear[/tpl]) to Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction was believed to be Robert L. Gerry, Sr.http://www.eclipsepress.com/mediaroom/pdf/SireLines_ex.pdf

==Racing career==

===As a two-year old===

Trained by Louis Feustel and ridden by Johnny Loftus, Man o' War made his debut at Belmont Park on June 6, 1919, winning by six lengths.  Three weeks later, he won the Keene Memorial Stakes.
In the early 1900s, there were no starting gates. Horses circled around and then lined up behind a piece of webbing known as the barrier and were sent away when it was raised.[tpl]Harvnb|Ours|2006|p=40[/tpl]. In Man o' War's only loss, the Sanford Memorial Stakes, he still was circling with his back to the starting line when the barrier was raised (though some accounts give other reasons).[tpl]Harvnb|Ours|2006|p=102[/tpl]. After Man o' War turned around, he already was far behind the starters. Jockey Johnny Loftus put Man o' War in a bad position, getting boxed in by other horses. Despite this, he came close to winning, losing by a half-length. The winner was Upset, whose name is sometimes erroneously thought to have popularized a new phrase in sports (meaning an underdog  beating the favorite)—in fact, the term "upset" was already in use to describe such a situation decades before.Hillenbrand, Laura. "Seabiscuit" Man o' War finished his two-year-old campaign with nine wins from ten starts.

===Weight carrying===

As a two-year-old, he carried [tpl]convert|130|lb[/tpl] in six races; few horses ever carried that much at any age. As a three-year-old, he carried as much as [tpl]convert|138|lb[/tpl] in races, conceding as much as [tpl]convert|32|lb[/tpl] to other horses.

===As a three-year old===

In 1920, Johnny Loftus was denied a renewal of his jockey's license by The Jockey Club and was replaced as Man o' War's rider by Clarence Kummer. Loftus retired and became a trainer.
At three, Man o' War was 16 hands 2 inches (167.6 centimeters) high and weighed about [tpl]convert|1150|lb[/tpl] with a 72-inch girth.[ref]
