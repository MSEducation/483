==Facilities==

The large grounds of the school consist of a forest, playground, and a small field which is covered with artificial turf. Armbrae completed construction of multi-purpose building consisting of a gymnasium, art room and drama studio in April 2008.
All of the school's classrooms are equipped with Apple computers and Smartboard interactive whiteboards. Armbrae also has a computer lab with more than 20 computers. These computers as well as all those within the school are connected to the school's wireless network, which is easily accessed by students for use with personal laptops. Recently a policy has been created which bans the use of personal computers and any hand held/cellular devices on school property. This policy has recently become more liberal allowing students to use hand held electronics after school for contacting parents, to arrange changes to departure time. 
The main building at Armbrae is undergoing a greening project. Parts of this project include the replacing of old single pane windows and the replacing of all old energy inefficient lights in the school. Also the original oil-fired boilers have recently been replaced energy efficient natural gas burners.
