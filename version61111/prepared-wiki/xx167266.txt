==Biography==

Jörg Kachelmann spent his youth in Schaffhausen. His childhood ambition was to become a meteorologist and record the weather.
During his school and university holidays he worked for various weather services.
He studied geography, mathematics and physics at the University of Zurich, where meteorology was not offered. He dropped out of the university before being awarded his degree and became a free-lance contributor to a Swiss newspaper, the Sonntagsblick. In between he also worked for Schaffhausen local radio station Radio Munot. From there he moved to the Scientific Editorship of Swiss Television SRG and in 1988 he became Deputy Editor in Chief of Schweizer Illustrierte.
For a long time he had faxed unsolicited weather forecasts to Südwestfunk. Eventually these were adopted. In 1989, Jörg Kachelmann bought an old farmhouse in Bächli and rebuilt this into a high tech weather station. In 1991 he founded the Meteomedia AG weather service operating over 1000 weather stations in Germany alone.
In 1996 Kachelmann became Programme Director of the German edition of the American television Weather Channel. After barely two years, however, the station discontinued the service citing "lack of viewer interest."
Apart from producing weather forecasts for ARD and various other broadcasters Kachelmann acted in other areas. In 1996 he presented the German programme "Vorsicht Blöff", appeared from 1999 to 2004 on the talk show "Riverboat", to which he returned in 2007 and which he gave up due to lack of time in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdr.de/mittendrin/3959806.html|title=Tatort Riverboat|work=MDR|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=26 March 2010|language=German[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdr.de/presse/fernsehen/6093539.html|title="Riverboat": Neue Crew ab März|work=MDR|date=30 January 2009|accessdate=26 March 2010|language=German[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] 1998 he presented three shows of the quiz show "One will win".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brigitte.de/gesellschaft/politik-gesellschaft/joerg-kachelmann-1054385/3.html|title=Jörg Kachelmann: Ein Leben zwischen Hochs und Tiefs|work=brigitte|accessdate=26 March 2010|language=German[/tpl]
In April 2002 ARD changed its weather service provider from the German Weather Service, DWD, to Meteomedia AG. Since then he has presented the weather alternating with Claudia Kleinert, Sven Plöger and Alexander Lehmann before the main news. Kachelmann has become famous for his unconventional presentation of the weather. A common fallacy is that he introduced words such "Blumenkohlwolken" ("Cauliflower clouds" for Cumulus) and "schlürfende Winde" (slurping wind). He denied this in an interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/medien/Medien;art290,1979776|work=Der Tagesspiegel|title=Das Klima ist verrückter als das Wetter|date=8 April 2004|accessdate=26 March 2010|language=German[/tpl] In January 2009 he became an Internet phenomenon after a cat joined him on set while he was presenting the weather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7819843.stm|title=Cat turns up on weatherman's set|work=BBC News|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=9 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/4208164/Cat-interrupts-TV-weather-forecast.html|title=Weatherman interrupted by cat during forecast |publisher=The Telegraph|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009[/tpl]
The headquarters of the Swiss Meteomedia AG is located in Gais AR near to St. Gallen, the headquarters of German Meteomedia GmbH is in Bochum. In 2004 Meteomedia founded the Weather Information on Demand (WIND) system in Austria. He has been criticised for his commercial exploitation of the media and describing himself as a "meteorologist" without holding a recognised qualification. Kachelmann has also been criticised for his sensationalism. He established a weather station at the Funtensee in Germany because of the extremely low temperatures in winter (up to -45 °C) caused by the location of the lake. It is situated in a valley which is shaded by high mountains, forming a sink for cold air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/reisen/urlaubstipps/kaeltepol_aid_104033.html|title=Deutschlands Kältepol - Warum ist es so eisig am Funtensee?|work=Focus|date=24 January 2006|accessdate=25 March 2009|language=German[/tpl] Local hotel owners in the winter sport resort Berchtesgaden near the Funtensee are afraid that tourists stay away because of the reported low temperatures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern/wege-und-ziele/funtensee-kaeltepool-berchtesgaden-ID1231757181191.xml|title=Berchtesgaden wehrt sich -  Funtensee als Kälteloch fürs Winterloch|work=Bayerischer Rundfunk|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=25 March 2010|language=German[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In March 2010, Kachelmann was arrested at Frankfurt airport in Germany after an ex-girlfriend accused him of raping her  [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5848070,00.html|title=TV weatherman Kachelmann released from pre-trial custody|first=David|last=Levitz|work=Deutsche Welle|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=29 July 2010[/tpl] following an argument in the previous month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20100322-26043.html|title=Weatherman Kachelmann arrested for alleged rape|work=The Local|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=25 March 2009[/tpl] After a trial lasting almost nine months, Kachelmann was acquitted on May 31, 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Weatherman acquitted of rape in 'trial of the year' |author=Joanna Impey |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15118786,00.html |newspaper=Deutsche Welle |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011[/tpl] He theorized that his then girlfriend had invented the crime in order to destroy his life and complained about the intense media coverage of the trial, which he considered to be unbalanced. In a 2012 interview, Kachelmann claimed that concerning rape accusations, women would generally be regarded as victims, coining the term victim's subscription ([tpl]lang-de|Opfer-Abo[/tpl]). Subsequently, a jury of language scholars chose "Opfer-Abo" as German Un-Word of the Year, thus criticizing its usage as inappropriate and inhuman.The Local: Victim subscription worst phrase of 2012.
