Death Jr. is a video game for the PlayStation Portable. The PSP iteration was the very first PSP game ever shown publicly and advertised as a killer-app. It was released to fairly mediocre reviews and noted for numerous problems about the camera, gameplay and uninspiring graphics, but was praised for its Tim Burton-esque themes and quirky characters. Slightly better received was the comic book adaptation by Gary Whitta and Ted Naifeh, which includes two three-issue miniseries.

==Plot==

The game, movie, and comic book are about the teenage son of the Grim Reaper, named Death Jr. (DJ for short).  His father tried many times (all of them failed) to stop his son from creating chaos at every school he has been in. Now is DJ's last chance. If he creates chaos one more time, he'll be sent to military school. He meets new friends at this school: Pandora, a girl with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and a thing for locked boxes; Stigmartha, a girl who has holes in her hands and bleeds from them whenever she's nervous; Smith and Weston, conjoined twins who are very smart and conjoined at the head; the Seep, an armless, legless, foul-mouthed kid in a vat; and the Dead Guppy, a character who speaks for himself.
The friends go on a field trip to a museum, where they find a locked box that Pandora wants opened, so DJ opens it to impress her.  Unfortunately, all hell breaks loose and demons run amok. It's up to DJ to stop them, revert the town back to normal, all the while making sure Dad doesn't find out.
In the game, the player has a variety of guns ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher. The controls are simple. The player moves around with the analog nub and attacks people with the square and circle buttons. There is a lot of emphasis in the game on the combos which can be achieved by linking attacks to each other very soon. Death Jr. is a fairly short game with short cut scenes and various enemies. It is worth noting that although Death himself, DJ's father, appears on the cover of the game's case, he does not actually appear in-game.
