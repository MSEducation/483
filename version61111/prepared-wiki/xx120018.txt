[[Nimrod (computing)]]

CATEGORIES: History of computing, 1951 video games

The Nimrod was a special purpose computer that played the game of Nim, designed and built by Ferranti and displayed at the Exhibition of Science during the 1951 Festival of Britain.  Later, when the Festival ended, the computer was shown in Berlin. Due to its historical importance, famous German politicians were present including Konrad Adenauer, the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and Ludwig Erhard, the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs.
It was the first digital computer exclusively designed to play a game, though its true intention was to illustrate the principles of the (then novel) digital computer for the public. A smaller replica of Nimrod has been built for the Computerspielemuseum Berlin.
