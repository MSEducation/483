[[Scottish Amateur Football League]]

CATEGORIES: Football leagues in Scotland

The Scottish Amateur Football League (SAFL) is a football league competition for amateur teams in Scotland. It was formally founded in 1909 when Scottish Football League club Queen's Park decided that their fourth team needed regular competition. Queen's Park were successful in winning the first league title, but Edinburgh Civil Service won the league the following year, so Queen's Park decided to enter their third team for the third season of the competition, indicating a high standard of football was played at this level from an early stage.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Despite being called the Scottish Amateur Football League, the league has never included clubs from across the country. Although, prior to the official formation of the league a SAFL side made at least one visit to Fife for a match. Prior to the Second World War membership stretched across the Scottish Central Belt, with a number of clubs from the East of the country participating. However, following the end of the war membership became concentrated in the West of the country. The SAFL has been successful in embracing a number of clubs from the Argyll area which otherwise might not have regular competition.
At its peak in the early 1980s the SAFL contained 12 divisions, but this number has been halved to six. For more than 20 years, the League was split into a Premier section of three divisions, with two or three further divisions comprising Section One, so named as it preserved the divisions of the original league. But following an SAFA directive during the 2011/2012 season, this format has been changed back to one all-in competition, with effect from the start of the 2012/2013 season. The three premier divisions are retained, and the lowest two divisions become two sections of equal status, decided by a ballotted draw prior to the start of each season. The top two teams from each section will be promoted to Premier 2, which will start the 2012/2013 season with 11 clubs, but will have 12 clubs from the start of the following season.
