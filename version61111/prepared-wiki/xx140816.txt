===2003===

After seeing success in the 2002 season along with the teamsâ€™ new ownership, the outlook for 2003 looked bright. The team had initial player tryouts in March followed by an invitiaion only try-outs in April to fill out the final team roster.
On May 13, it was announced that the team would play as a traveling team for the 2003 season after ownership was unable to pay the league a $100,000 safety net to make sure they would finish out the season on the heels of the Ozark and Americus teams folding mid-season in 2002. After the announcement, the team would play on May 29 and a final double-header on May 31 in Selma before officially becoming a traveling team. These games against the Montgomery Wings were played in Selma due to a scheduling conflict at Paterson Field.
