==Artistic Approach==

Art Papers declared that "Margaret Craig has used the accidents and 'moments' of painting to explore the chaotic and whimsical."Zwartjes, Arend, The Un-Painters, Art Papers, Atlanta, GA p 28-33. Informed by her biology degree and a healthy understanding of the experimental process, Craig synthesizes innovative techniques with the traditional from her painting and printmaking background, as well as other artistic disciplines.  "Craig is interested in the natural processes of growth and erosion. Experimentation often results in irregularities, and the unexpected results bring delight to both maker and beholder." New Art Examiner described the work as evoking "an intensity which extends beyond the nostalgia and irony of its components."Ewing, John, Biochrome, New Art Examiner Chicago Il. p60-61 Nov 2000 Vol 28#3. "Craig's ability to allow the chance operations of natural processes helps her create her finished product, and the pure aesthetic pleasure that each of her works provokes is their main subject."Zwartjes, Arend, Biochrome, Artlies, Houston TX, p104-105, Fall 2000. Her pieces are very much tied to process, a slow evolution of layers that culminates in environments and creatures that could be swimming in a drop of rainwater or thriving in an alien ecology. Bennett said that some of Craig's pieces "offer panoramic views of beautifully barren otherworlds, as if Craig were able to photograph the surface of Jupiter."Bennett, Steve, Otherworldly Beauty Belies Its Toughness, San Antonio Express News, November 20, 2011, 5K.
