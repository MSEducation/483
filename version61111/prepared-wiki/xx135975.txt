Saint-Brieuc Cathedral Basilica ([tpl]lang-fr|Basilique-Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Saint-Brieuc[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of Brittany (France), located in the town of Saint-Brieuc.
It was the seat of the Bishopric of Saint-Brieuc, one of the nine ancient dioceses of Brittany, and continues to be the seat of the enlarged Bishopric of Saint-Brieuc-Tréguier, as it has been known since 1852.
Some of the relics of Saint Brieuc himself, the 6th-century founder, are still kept here. The present building however was built in the 14th and 15th centuries.
