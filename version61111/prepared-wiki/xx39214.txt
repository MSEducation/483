Force It is the fourth album by UFO, released in 1975. It became their first album to chart in the United States.
The album was produced by Ten Years After bass player Leo Lyons. Another Ten Years After member, Chick Churchill, played keyboards, the first use of that instrument on a UFO record.
The CD reissue was remastered at Sound Recording Technology, Cambridge in 1994.

==Album cover==

The somewhat controversial original cover was designed by Hipgnosis, as were almost all other UFO albums of the 1970s. For years, the genders of the couple in the bath were unknown, and the nudity was on the verge of decency standards. The models were actually Genesis P Orridge and girlfriend Cosey Fanni Tutti, both later of the band Throbbing Gristle.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ugo.com/music/ufo-force-it | title = Awesome Borderline Pornographic Album Covers | accessdate = 2011-07-20 | last = Jensen | first = K. Thor | date = 27 April 2011 | work = UGO.com | publisher = UGO Networks[/tpl] The artwork was softened for the initial US release, making the couple in the bathtub transparent.  The cover is a pun - there are multiple taps (British English) or "faucets" (US English) in the picture, which is a pun in the album's title.
