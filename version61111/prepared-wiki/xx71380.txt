Kerry Anne Wells (born 1952) of Australia was the 1972 winner of the Miss Universe contest.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Almanac 2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2nxLkMspauIC&pg=PA760|date=2009-03-25|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=9781593398392|pages=760â€“[/tpl]  She is from East Victoria Park, Western Australia.
The 1972 pageant was the first to take place outside the continental United States. That year, it was held in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Wells was not crowned by her predecessor, Georgina Rizk because Rizk was not able to travel to Puerto Rico due to government restrictions because of fears of a terrorist attacks after a group of Japanese hired by Arab terrorists, attacked the international airport in Tel Aviv and killed twenty-two Puerto Rican tourists. For that reason Wells was crowned by Miss Universe 1970, Marisol Malaret of Puerto Rico.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDVJos1_UQ
Her crowning moment was not shown on television because of a strike threat among pageant electricians. The screen blacked out as her name was announced as the new Miss Universe.
After her reign, she pursued working as a news anchor.  Prior to entering the pageants, she worked as a weathergirl.http://www.pageants.coms.ph/muphotos3.html
