From the mid-1920s to 1949, Bai and his close ally Li Zongren ruled Guangxi province as regional warlords with their own troops and considerable political autonomy.  His relationship with Chiang Kai-shek was at various times rivalrous and cooperative.  He and Li Zongren supported the anti-Chiang warlord alliance in the Central Plains War in 1930, and then supported Chiang in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.  He was the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of China from 1946 to 1948.  After losing to the Communists in 1949, Bai fled to Taiwan, where he died in 1966.

==Warlord era==

Bai was born in Guilin, Guangxi and given the courtesy name Jiansheng ([tpl]lang|zh|健生[/tpl]). He was a descendant of a Persian merchant of the name Baiderluden; the Baidurludens changed their surname to Bai. His Muslim name was Omar Bai Chongxi.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=iTogAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Chief+of+the+General+Staff+of+All+Chinese+Land-Sea-and-Air+muslim&q=The+Chief+of+the+General+Staff+of+All+Chinese+Land-Sea-and-Air+was+general+omar+pei|title=Islam in China|author=M.

At the age of 14, Bai attended the Guangxi Military Cadre Training School in Guilin, a modern-style school run by Cai E to modernize Guangxi's military.  Bai and classmates Huang Shaohong and Li Zongren would become three leading figures of the Guangxi's military.  For a time, Bai withdrew from the military school at the request of his family and studied at the civilian Guangxi Schools of Law and Political Science.
With the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 Bai joined a Students Dare to Die corps. Huang Shaoxiong was its squad commander. After entering the Nanjing enlistment Corps he transferred from the Corps the Second Military Preparatory School at Wuchang. He graduated from the school in 1914, then underwent pre cadet training for six months before attending the 3rd class of Baoding Military Academy in June 1915. He became a 1st Guangxi division probationary officer upon coming back to Guangxi.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r3AJFusMHJwC&pg=PA51&dq=pai+ch'ung-hsi+dare+to+die#v=onepage&q=pai%20ch'ung-hsi%20dare%20to%20die&f=false|title=Biographical dictionary of Republican China, Volume 3|author=Howard L.

Bai rose to fame during the warlord era by allying with Huang Shaohong (a fellow deputy commander of the Model Battalion of the Guangxi First Division) and Li Tsung-jen as supporters of the Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen.  This alliance, called the New Guangxi Clique, proceeded to move against the Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting (陸榮廷) in 1924. The coalition's efforts brought Guangxi Province under ROC jurisdiction, and Pai and Li represented a new generation of Guangxi leaders.
During the Northern Expedition (1926–1928), Bai was the Chief of Staff of the National Revolutionary Army and was credited with many victories over the northern warlords, often using speed, maneuver and surprise to defeat larger enemy forces. He led the Eastern Route Army which conquered Hangzhou and Shanghai in 1927. As garrison commander of Shanghai, Bai also took part in the purge of Communist elements of the National Revolutionary Army on April 4, 1927 and of the labor unions in Shanghai. Bai also commanded the forward units which first entered Beijing and was credited with being the senior commander on site to complete the Northern Expedition. For many of his battlefield exploits during the Northern expedition, he was given the laudatory nickname Xiao Zhuge, literally meaning "little Zhuge Liang," of the Three Kingdoms fame.
Bai was the commander of Kuomintang forces in the Shanghai massacre of 1927, purging and massacring Communists. He allowed Communist leader Zhou Enlai to slip away and escape after placing him under arrest.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HlttAAAAMAAJ&q=Pai+Chung-hsi+has+at+times+attacked+the+Reds,+though+he+winked+at+their+passage+through+a+part+of+his+Kwangsi+domain+during+the+Long+March,+on+severe+conditions+.+The+story+is+told+that+he+once+saved+the+life+of+Chou+En-lai&dq=Pai+Chung-hsi+has+at+times+attacked+the+Reds,+though+he+winked+at+their+passage+through+a+part+of+his+Kwangsi+domain+during+the+Long+March,+on+severe+conditions+.+The+story+is+told+that+he+once+saved+the+life+of+Chou+En-lai|title=Inside Asia|author=John Gunther|year=1942|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=|isbn=|page=281|accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] Western news reports later nicknamed General Bai "The Hewer of Communist Heads".[tpl]cite news |title=CHINA: Nationalist Notes|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=June 25, 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl]

Bai was out of money and bankrupted in December 1928. He planned to lead 60,000 troops from east China to Xinjiang province and construct a railroad, as a barrier against Russian encroachment in Xinjiang. His plan was perceived by some to be against Feng Yuxiang.[tpl]cite news |title=BANKRUPT PEI STUNS CHINA BY AMBITIONS; Hopes to March 60,000 Unpaid Troops 1,000 Miles and Colonize Sinkiang.RAILWAY LINE PLANNEDScheme Is to Erect Bulwark AgainstRussia--Project Is Viewed asBlow at Feng.|author=|newspaper=THE NEW YORK TIMES|date=12 December 1928|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C1EFB3A5B167A93C0A81789D95F4C8285F9|accessdate=December 12, 2010[/tpl]
At the end of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek began to agitate to get rid of the Guangxi forces. At one time in 1929, Bai had to escape to Vietnam to avoid harm. From 1930 to 1936, Bai was instrumental in the Reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a "model" province with a progressive administration. Guangxi supplied over nine hundred thousand soldiers toward the war effort against Japan.
During the Chinese Civil War, Bai fought against the Communists. In the Long March, Bai Chongxi allowed the Communists to slip through Guangxi.
Governing his province with capability and aptitude was one of the things Bai was exclusively renowned for in China.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=knfZAAAAMAAJ&q=gunther+inside+asia+pai+reputation&dq=gunther+inside+asia+pai+reputation|title=Historical magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church, Volume 50|author=Church Historical Society (U.S.)|editors=Walter Herbert Stowe, Lawrence L.

==Second Sino-Japanese War==

Formal hostilities broke out on 7 July 1937 between China and Japan with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident outside of Beijing. On 4 August 1937, Bai rejoined the Central Government at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff responsible for operations and training. He was the key strategist who convinced Chiang to adopt a "Total War" strategy in which China would trade space for time, adopt guerrilla tactics behind enemy lines, and disrupt enemy supply lines at every opportunity. When the better armed and trained Japanese troops advanced, the Chinese would adopt a scorched earth campaign in the enemy's path to deny them local supply. Bai was also involved in many key campaigns including the first major victory at the Battle of Tai'erzhuang in Shandong Province in the Spring of 1938 when he teamed up with General Li Zongren to defeat a superior enemy. China managed to check and delay the Japanese advance for several months. Subsequently, he was appointed the Commander of the Field Executive Office of the Military Council in Guilin, with responsibility for the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 9th War Zones. In that capacity he oversaw the successful defense of Changsha, capital of Hunan Province. Between 1939 and 1942, the Japanese attacked Changsha three times and were repelled each time. Bai also directed the Battle of South Guangxi and Battle of Kunlun Pass to retake South Guangxi.
Bai's Guangxi soldiers were priased as a "Crack"(as in elite) army during the war against Japan, and was noted for being an able General who would lead the Chinese resistance should Chiang Kai-shek be assassinated.[tpl]cite news |title=Background For War: ASIA - Chiang's War|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Jun 26, 1939|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,931319-4,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl] The majority of Chinese presumed that Chiang Kai-shek, as leader of China, tapped Bai to inherit his position.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HlttAAAAMAAJ&q=It+is+generally+believed+that+he+has+been+chosen+by+the+Generalissimo+to+be+his+political+successor.+Most+people+in+China+would+say+that+he+was+No.+2+to+Chiang+in+a+political+sense,+as+Pai+is+No&dq=It+is+generally+believed+that+he+has+been+chosen+by+the+Generalissimo+to+be+his+political+successor.+Most+people+in+China+would+say+that+he+was+No.+2+to+Chiang+in+a+political+sense,+as+Pai+is+No|title=Inside Asia|author=John Gunther|year=1942|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=|isbn=|page=281|accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl]

==Chinese Civil War==

Following the Surrender of Japan in 1945, the Chinese Civil War resumed in full-fledged fighting. In the Spring of 1946, the Chinese Communists were active in Manchuria. A crack People's Liberation Army unit of 100,000 strong under the Communist general Lin Biao occupied a key railroad junction at Siping. Kuomintang forces could not dislodge Lin after several attempts, Chiang Kai-shek then sent Bai to oversee the operation. After some redeployment, the Nationalist forces were able to thoroughly defeat Lin's forces after a two-day pitched battle. This was to be the first major victory for the Kuomintang in the 1946-1949 stage of the civil war before the fall of mainland China to the Chinese Communists.
In June 1946, Bai was appointed Minister of National Defense.Generals from China Bai Chongxi It turned to be a post without power as Chiang began to bypass Bai on major decisions regarding the Chinese Civil War. Chiang would hold daily briefings in his residence without inviting him and began to direct frontline troops personally down to the division level, bypassing the chain of command. The Civil War went poorly for the Kuomintang as Chiang's strategy of holding onto provincial capitals and leaving the countryside to the Communists very quickly caused the downfall of his forces which had a 4:1 numerical superiority at the beginning of the conflict.
During the Ili Rebellion, Bai was considered by the government for the post of Governor of Xinjiang. The position later was given to Masud Sabri, a pro-Kuomintang Uyghur leader.
In April 1948 the first National Assembly in China convened in Nanjing, with thousands of delegates from all over China representing different provinces and ethnic groups. Bai Chongxi, acting as Minister of National Defense, debriefed the Assembly on the military situation, completely ignoring Northern China and Manchuria in his report. Delegates from Manchuria in the assembly responded by yelling out and calling for the death of those responsible for the loss of Manchuria.[tpl]cite news |title=CHINA: Sorrow for Old Chiang|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Apr 26, 1948|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798460,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl]

In January 1949, with the Communists bordering on victory, almost everyone in the Nationalist media, political, and military command began to demand peace as a slogan and turn against Chiang. Bai Chongxi decided to follow suit with the mainstream current, and defied Chiang Kai-shek's orders, refusing to battle Communists near the Huai River and demanding that his soldiers which were "lent" be sent back to him, so he could secure his hold province of Guangxi and ignore the central government in Nanjing. Bai was the Commander of 4 armies in Central China in the Hankow region. He demanded that the government negotiate with the Communists like the others.[tpl]cite news |title=CHINA: When Headlines Cry Peace|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Jan 17, 1949|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,780095,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl] Bai was in charge of the defense of the capital, Nanjing.

==Involvement in Taiwan==

The riots following the 228 Incident of 28 February 1947 that broke out in Taiwan due to poor governance by the central government appointed officials and the garrison forces caused many casualties of both native Taiwanese and mainland residents. Bai was sent as Chiang Kai-shek's personal representative on a fact finding mission and to help pacify the populace. After a two-week tour, including interviews  with various  segments of the Taiwan population, Bai made sweeping recommendations, including replacement of the governor, and prosecution of his chief of secret police. He also granted amnesty to student violators of peace on the condition that their parents take custody and guarantee subsequent proper behavior. For his forthright actions, native Taiwanese held him in high regard.[tpl]cite news |title=CHINA: Snow Red & Moon Angel|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Apr 7, 1947|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804090-2,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl]
Bai had another falling out with Chiang when he supported General Li Zongren, his fellow Guangxi comrade-in-arms, for the vice presidency in the 1948 general election when Li won against Chiang's hand picked candidate, Sun Fo. Chiang then removed Bai from the Defense Minister post and assigned him the responsibility for Central and South China. Bai's forces were the last ones to leave the mainland for Hainan Island and eventually to Taiwan.
He served Chief of the General Staff since 1927 until his retirement in 1949. After he came to Taiwan, he was the appointed vice director of the strategic advisory commission in the presidential office.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FWVxAAAAMAAJ&q=bai+chongxi+At+the+end+of+1949,+he+went+to+Taiwan,+where+he+became+the+vice+director+of+the+strategic+advisory+commission+in+the+presidential+office.&dq=bai+chongxi+At+the+end+of+1949,+he+went+to+Taiwan,+where+he+became+the+vice+director+of+the+strategic+advisory+commission+in+the+presidential+office.|title=The autobiography of Kim Ku, Volume 20|author=Ku Kim, Jongsoo Lee|year=2000|publisher=University Press of America|location=|isbn=0-7618-1685-2|page=366|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FWVxAAAAMAAJ&q=At+the+end+of+1949,+he+went+to+Taiwan,+where+he+became+the+vice+director+of+the+strategic+advisory+commission+in+the+presidential+office&dq=At+the+end+of+1949,+he+went+to+Taiwan,+where+he+became+the+vice+director+of+the+strategic+advisory+commission+in+the+presidential+office|title=The autobiography of Kim Ku, Volume 20|author=Ku Kim, Jongsoo Lee|year=2000|publisher=University Press of America|location=|isbn=0-7618-1685-2|page=366|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] He also continued to serve in the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.

Bai Chongxi was interested in Xinjiang, a predominately Muslim province.

He cited specific examples, such as the Tibetans under the British, the Manchus under the Japanese, the Mongols under the Outer Mongolian People's Republic, and the Uyghurs of Xinjiang under the Soviet Union. Bai called upon China to assist them in expelling the foreigners from those lands. He personally wanted to lead an expedition to seize back Xinjiang to bring it under Chinese control, in the style that Zuo Zongtang led during the Dungan revolt. Bai's partner in the Guangxi clique Huang Shaohong planned an invasion of Xinjiang. During the Kumul Rebellion Chiang Kai-shek was ready to sent Huang Shaohong and his expeditionary force which he assembled to assist Muslim General Ma Zhongying against Sheng Shicai, but when Chiang heard about the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang, he decided to withdraw to avoid an international incident if his troops directly engaged the Soviets, leaving Ma alone with not reinforcements to fight the Red Army. Huang was suspicious of this, suspecting that Chiang feared that the Guangxi clique was take control of Xinjiang rather than Chiang's Nanjing regime.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&dq=ma+lin+muslim&q=ma+zhongying#v=onepage&q=ma%20zhongying%20ally%20xinjiang%20huang%20&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|isbn=0-415-58264-4|page=46|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]

==Impact==

Bai's reputation as a military strategist was well known.Barbara Tuchman's book Stilwell and American Experience in China Evans Carlson, a United States Marine Corps colonel, noted that Bai "was considered by many to be the keenest of Chinese military men." Edgar Snow went even further, calling him "one of the most intelligent and efficient commanders boasted by any army in the world."
Bai is the father of Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai, Chinese author and playwright now living in the United States.
Bai and his wife had ten children, three girls and seven boys.Picture of Bai and his Wife with their Children Their names are Patsy, Diana, Daniel, Richard, Alfred, Amy, David, Kenneth, Robert and Charlie. His wife was Ma P'ei-chang, married since 1925.
Of his ten children, three have since died. The remaining are scattered across America and Taiwan.  Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin announced in March 2013 that Bai's tomb will form the basis for a Muslim cultural area and Taiwan historical park.http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=202548&CtNode=445
