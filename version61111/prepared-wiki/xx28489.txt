Saint Onesimus (d. ca. 68 AD)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ec-patr.org/list/index.php?lang=en&id=3|title =Onesimus|publisher=Ecumenic Patriarchate of Constantinople|accessdate = Apr 2, 2011[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-grc-gre|Ὀνήσιμος|Onēsimos[/tpl], meaning "useful," also called Onesimus of Byzantium and The Holy Apostle Onesimus in some Eastern Orthodox churches) was a slave to Philemon of Colossae, a man of Christian faith. He may be the same Onesimus named by Ignatius of Antioch as Bishop in Ephesus.

==In Scripture==

The name 'Onesimus' appears in two New Testament epistles. In Colossians 4:9Christian Bible: Colossians 4:9 a person of this name is identified as a Christian accompanying Tychicus to visit the Christians in Colossae; nothing else is stated about him in this context.
The Epistle to Philemon was written by the Apostle Paul to the slave-master Philemon concerning a runaway slave called Onesimus. This slave found his way to the site of Paul's imprisonment (most probably Rome or Caesarea)'The Letter to Philemon', Joseph A. Fitzmyer S.J.,  paragraph 5, pages 869-870 The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, 1989, Geoffrey Chapman to escape punishment for a theft he was said to have committed.Saint Onesimus at SQPN website After hearing the Gospel from Paul, Onesimus converted to Christianity. Paul, having earlier converted Philemon to Christianity, sought to reconcile the two by writing the letter to Philemon which today exists in the New Testament.Christian Bible: Philemon verses 19-16). The letter read (in part): 

==In Tradition==

Although it is doubted by authorities such as Joseph Fitzmyer,Fitzmyer paragraph 4 it may be the case that this Onesimus was the same one consecrated a bishop by the Apostles and who accepted the episcopal throne in EphesusThe Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians following Saint Timothy. During the reign of Roman emperor Domitian and the persecution of Trajan, Onesimus was imprisoned in Rome and may have been martyred by stoning (although some sources claim that he was beheaded).The Holy Apostle Onesimus - Serbian Orthodox Calendar

==In Liturgy==

Onesimus is regarded as a saint by many Christian denominations. The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, which commemorates him and Philemon on February 15.Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. Lutheran Worship.  Concordia Publishing House, 1982, updated by the same church's Lutheran Service Book.  Concordia Publishing House, 2006.
Eastern Churches remember Onesimus on 15 February and 22 November.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 2nd edition, E. A. Livingstone, 2000, Oxford University Press, page 414.
The traditional Western commemoration of Onesimus is on 16 February.Livingstone, op. cit. But in the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, Onesimus is listed under 15 February with the Latin name Onésimi. He is mentioned as follows: 'A runaway slave, whom the apostle Paul received to the faith of Christ while in prison, regarding him as a son of whom he had become father, as he himself wrote to Philemon, Onesimus's master.'.Martyrologium Romanum, 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), page 150. The date is designated the 'commemoration of blessed Onesimus', indicating that it is not regarded as his date of death, and suggesting that his rank in the Catholic Church may be Blessed rather than Saint.
