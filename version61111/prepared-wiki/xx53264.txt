[[Iron poisoning]]

CATEGORIES: Iron, Dietary mineral toxicity

Iron poisoning is an iron overload caused by a large excess of iron intake and usually refers to an acute overload rather than a gradual one. The term has been primarily associated with young childrenhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2552952/Toddler-died-overdosing-iron-tablets-thought-Mummys-sweets-climbed-bathroom-sink-reach-them.html who consumed large quantities of iron supplement pills, which resemble sweets and are widely used, including by pregnant women—see overnutrition (approximately 3 grams is lethal for a 2 year old).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/iron.html |title=Plants Poisonous to Livestock - Cornell University Department of Animal Science |publisher=Ansci.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09[/tpl] Targeted packaging restrictions in the US for supplement containers with over 250 mg elemental iron have existed since 1978, and recommendations for unit packaging have reduced the several iron poisoning fatalities per year to almost nil since 1998.[tpl]cite journal |last=Tenenbein |first=M. |date=June 2005 |title=Unit-Dose Packaging of Iron Supplements and Reduction of Iron Poisoning in Young Children |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. |volume=159 |pages=557–560 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/159/6/557 |accessdate=2011-11-30  | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.159.6.557 | pmid = 15939855[/tpl]AAPCC Annual Reports, American Association of Poison Control Centers.

==Nature of iron==

In nature, iron is usually found in its oxidized form, iron (III) oxide, which is insoluble. Ferrous iron is soluble and its toxicity varies, largely with the integrity of the gastrointestinal lining. Iron supplements are typically used to treat anemia.

==Toxic dosage==

The amount of iron ingested may give a clue to potential toxicity. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3–6 mg/kg/day. Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10–20 mg/kg of elemental iron. Ingestions of more than 50 mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/iron-poisoning |title=Iron Poisoning |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09[/tpl]
In terms of blood values, iron levels above 350-500 µg/dL are considered toxic, and levels over 1000 µg/dL indicate severe iron poisoning.thefreedictionary.com > Iron Tests, citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. Copyright 2008

==Symptoms==

The first indication of iron poisoning by ingestion is a pain in the stomach, as the stomach lining becomes ulcerated.  This is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The pain then abates for 24 hours as the iron passes deeper into the body resulting in metabolic acidosis, which in turn damages internal organs, particularly the brain and the liver.  The body goes into shock and death from liver failure. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
If intake of iron is during a prolonged period of time, symptoms are likely similar to other causes of iron overload.

==Treatment==

Later stage treatment consists of cleaning the iron from the blood, using a chelating agent such as deferoxamine.  If this fails then dialysis is the next step.
