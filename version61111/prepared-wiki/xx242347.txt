Child labour is the practice of having children engage in economic activity, on part or full-time basis. The practice deprives children of their childhood, and is harmful to their physical and mental development. Poverty, lack of good schools and growth of informal economy are considered as the important causes of child labour in India.
The 2001 national census of India estimated the total number of child labour, aged 5–14, to be at 12.6 million, out of a total child population of 253 million in 5-14 age group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://labour.nic.in/cwl/ChildLabour.htm|title=National Child Labour project|publisher=Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India|accessdate = 12 September 2011[/tpl]Age Structure And Marital Status India Census 2001 The child labour problem is not unique to India; worldwide, about 217 million children work, many full-time.[tpl]cite web|title=Child Labour - ILO|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/child-labour/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl]

Article 24 of India's constitution prohibits child labour. Additionally, various laws and the Indian Penal Code, such as the Juvenile Justice (care and protection) of Children Act-2000, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Abolition) Act-1986 provide a basis in law to identify, prosecute and stop child labour in India.[tpl]cite web|title=National Legislation and Policies Against Child Labour in India|publisher=International Labour Organization - an Agency of the United Nations, Geneva|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/legacy/english/regions/asro/newdelhi/ipec/responses/india/national.htm[/tpl]

==Definition==

The term child labour, suggests ILO,[tpl]cite web|title=What is child labour?|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl] is best defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. It refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children, or work whose schedule interferes with their ability to attend regular school, or work that affects in any manner their ability to focus during school or experience healthy childhood.
UNICEF defines child labour differently. A child, suggests UNICEF, is involved in child labour activities if between 5 to 11 years of age, he or she did at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work in a week, and in case of children between 12 to 14 years of age, he or she did at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work per week.[tpl]cite web|title=Definitions: Child Protection|publisher=UNICEF|year=2012|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup9.html[/tpl] UNICEF in another report suggests, "Children’s work needs to be seen as happening along a continuum, with destructive or exploitative work at one end and beneficial work - promoting or enhancing children’s development without interfering with their schooling, recreation and rest - at the other. And between these two poles are vast areas of work that need not negatively affect a child’s development."
India's Census 2001 office defines[tpl]cite web|title=Figures: An Analysis of Census 2001 Child Labour Facts and Figures|publisher=Govt of India and ILO|year=2007|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@asia/@ro-bangkok/@sro-new_delhi/documents/projectdocumentation/wcms_125442.pdf[/tpl] child labor as participation of a child less than 17 years of age in any economically productive activity with or without compensation, wages or profit. Such participation could be physical or mental or both. This work includes part-time help or unpaid work on the farm, family enterprise or in any other economic activity such as cultivation and milk production for sale or domestic consumption. Indian government classifies child laborers into two groups: Main workers are those who work 6 months or more per year. And marginal child workers are those who work at any time during the year but less than 6 months in a year.
Some child rights activists argue that child labour must include every child who is not in school because he or she is a hidden child worker.[tpl]cite web|title=Abolition of Child Labour– A Brief Note|publisher=National Advisory Council|year=2011|url=http://www.nac.nic.in/pdf/child_labour.pdf[/tpl] UNICEF, however, points out that India faces major shortages of schools, classrooms and teachers particularly in rural areas where 90 percent of child labour problem is observed. About 1 in 5 primary schools have just one teacher to teach students across all grades.[tpl]cite web|title=The Children - Education|publisher=UNICEF|year=2011|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/children_2359.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Global campaign for children - More teachers needed|publisher=UNICEF|date=24 April 2006|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/education_1551.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Shortage of teachers cripples right to education|author=Swati Chandra|work=The Times of India|date=10 April 2012|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-10/varanasi/31318133_1_primary-schools-single-teacher-primary-teachers[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Uniform shortage|date=3 September 2011|publisher=India Today|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/primary-teachers-shortage-education-purandareswari/1/149858.html[/tpl]

==Child labour laws in India==

After its independence from colonial rule, India has passed a number of constitutional protections and laws on child labour. The Constitution of India in the Fundamental Rights and the Directive of State Policy prohibits child labour below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or castle or engaged in any other hazardous employment (Article 24). The constitution also envisioned that India shall, by 1960, provide infrastructure and resources for free and compulsory education to all children of the age six to 14 years. (Article 21-A and Article 45).[tpl]cite web |url= http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/contents.htm|title= Constitution of india|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Govt. of India[/tpl]
India has a federal form of government, and child labour is a matter on which both the central government and country governments can legislate, and have. The major national legislative developments include the following:[tpl]cite web|title=India Code - Legislations|publisher=Department of Law and Justice, Government of India|year=2012|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/[/tpl]
The Factories Act of 1948: The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory. The law also placed rules on who, when and how long can pre-adults aged 15–18 years be employed in any factory.
The Mines Act of 1952: The Act prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986: The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in hazardous occupations identified in a list by the law. The list was expanded in 2006, and again in 2008.
The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act of 2000: This law made it a crime, punishable with a prison term, for anyone to procure or employ a child in any hazardous employment or in bondage.
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009: The law mandates free and compulsory education to all children aged 6 to 14 years. This legislation also mandated that 25 percent of seats in every private school must be allocated for children from disadvantaged groups and physically challenged children.
India formulated a National Policy on Child Labour in 1987. This Policy seeks to adopt a gradual & sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations. It envisioned strict enforcement of Indian laws on child labour combined with development programs to address the root causes of child labour such as poverty. In 1988, this led to the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) initiative. This legal and development initiative continues, with a current central government funding of [tpl]Indian Rupee[/tpl] 6 billion, targeted solely to eliminate child labour in India.[tpl]cite web|title= Initiatives towards Elimination of Child Labour – Action Plan and Present Strategy|publisher=Ministry of Labour, Government of India|year=2011|url=http://labour.nic.in/cwl/childlabour.htm[/tpl] Despite these efforts, child labour remains a major challenge for India.

==Causes==

For much of human history and across different cultures, children less than 17 years old have contributed to family welfare in a variety of ways. UNICEF suggests that poverty is the big cause of child labour. The report also notes that in rural and impoverished parts of developing and undeveloped parts of the world, children have no real and meaningful alternative. Schools and teachers are unavailable. Child labour is the unnatural result.[tpl]cite web|title=Beyond Child Labour - Affirming Rights|publisher=UNICEF|year=2001|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/pub_beyond_en.pdf[/tpl] A BBC report, similarly, concludes poverty and inadequate public education infrastructure are some of the causes of child labour in India.[tpl]cite news|last=Morris|first=Madeleine|title=Educating India's child labourers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4240702.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 September 2005[/tpl]
Between boys and girls, UNICEF finds girls are two times more likely to be out of school and working in a domestic role. Parents with limited resources, claims UNICEF, have to choose whose school costs and fees they can afford when a school is available. Educating girls tends to be a lower priority across the world, including India. Girls are also harassed or bullied at schools, sidelined by prejudice or poor curricula, according to UNICEF. Solely by virtue of their gender, therefore, many girls are kept from school or drop out, then provide child labour.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Spreading Smiles Through Education Organisation(OSSE) suggests poverty is the greatest single force driving children into the workplace.[tpl]cite web|title=Child labor - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm[/tpl] Income from a child's work is felt to be crucial for his/her own survival or for that of the household. For some families, income from their children's labour is between 25 to 40% of the household income.
According to a 2008 study by ILO, among the most important factors driving children to harmful labour is the lack of availability and quality of schooling. Many communities, particularly rural areas do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worthwhile. In government-run primary schools, even when children show up, government-paid teachers do not show up 25% of the time.[tpl]cite news|title=Combating India's truant teachers|author=Kaushik Basu|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4051353.stm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=TEACHER ABSENCE IN INDIA: A SNAPSHOT|author=Kremer et al.|publisher=World Bank|date=September 2004|url=http://ddp-ext.worldbank.org/EdStats/INDstu04a.pdf[/tpl] The 2008 ILO study suggests that illiteracy resulting from a child going to work, rather than a quality primary and secondary school, limits the child's ability to get a basic educational grounding which would in normal situations enable them to acquire skills and to improve their prospects for a decent adult working life. An albeit older report published by UNICEF outlines the issues summarized by the ILO report. The UNICEF report claimed that while 90% of child labour in India is in its rural areas, the availability and quality of schools is decrepit; in rural areas of India, claims the old UNICEF report, about 50% of government funded primary schools that exist do not have a building, 40% lack a blackboard, few have books, and 97% of funds for these publicly funded school have been budgeted by the government as salaries for the teacher and administrators.[tpl]cite web|title=Child Labour and Education - Digest 28|publisher=UNICEF|year=1990|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000855/085584eo.pdf[/tpl] A 2012 Wall Street Journal article reports while the enrollment in India's school has dramatically increased in recent years to over 96% of all children in the 6-14-year age group, the infrastructure in schools, aimed in part to reduce child labour, remains poor - over 81,000 schools do not have a blackboard and about 42,000 government schools operate without a building with make shift arrangements during monsoons and inclement weather.[tpl]cite news|title=Are Indian Schools Getting Even Worse?|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 January 2012|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/01/20/are-indian-schools-getting-even-worse/?mod=google_news_blog[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=India Journal: The Basic Shortages that Plague Our Schools|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=3 January 2012|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/01/03/india-journal-the-basic-shortages-that-plague-our-schools/[/tpl]
Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest[tpl]cite book|title=Asian Informal Workers: Global Risks, Local Protection|author= Mario Biggeri and Santosh Mehrotra|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-38275-5[/tpl] that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy - called organised economy in India - is amongst the causes of the demand side. India has rigid labour laws and numerous regulations that prevent growth of organised sector where work protections are easier to monitor, and work more productive and higher paying. The unintended effect of Indian complex labour laws is the work has shifted to the unorganised, informal sector. As a result, after the unorganised agriculture sector which employs 60% of child labour, it is the unorganised trade, unorganised assembly and unorganised retail work that is the largest employer of child labour. If macroeconomic factors and laws prevent growth of formal sector, the family owned informal sector grows, deploying low cost, easy to hire, easy to dismiss labour in form of child labour. Even in situations where children are going to school, claim Biggeri and Mehrotra, children engage in routine after-school home-based manufacturing and economic activity. Other scholars too suggest that inflexibility and structure of India's labour market, size of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.[tpl]cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labor: A Comparative Study|author=Christiaan Grootaert and Harry Anthony Patrinos|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0312221225[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills|author=Douglas Galbi|journal=Journal of Popffafjjh Economics|year=1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages= 357–375|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Brown, D.

Cigno et al. suggest the government planned and implemented land redistribution programs in India, where poor families were given small plots of land with the idea of enabling economic independence, have had the unintended effect of increased child labour. They find that smallholder plots of land are labour-intensively farmed since small plots cannot productively afford expensive farming equipment. In these cases, a means to increase output from the small plot has been to apply more labour, including child labour.[tpl]cite journal|title=Child Labor, Nutrition and Education in Rural India: An Economic Analysis of Parental Choice and Policy Options|journal=Pacific Economic Review|author=Cigno, Rosati and Tzannatos|date=December 2001|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Child-Labor-DP/0131.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Child Labour, Education and Nutrition in Rural India|author=Cigno, A. and F.

==Bonded child labour in India==

Srivastava describes bonded child labour as a system of forced, or partly forced, labour under which the child, or usually child's parent enter into an agreement, oral or written, with a creditor. The child performs work as in-kind repayment of credit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---declaration/documents/publication/wcms_081967.pdf  |title=Incidence and Pattern[/tpl] In this 2005 ILO report, Srivastava claims debt-bondage in India emerged during the colonial period, as a means to obtain reliable cheap labour, with loan and land-lease relationships implemented during that era of Indian history. These were regionally called Hali, or Halwaha, or Jeura systems; and by colonial administration the indentured labour system. These systems included bonded child labour. Over time, claims the ILO report, this traditional forms of long-duration relationships have declined.[tpl]cite journal|title=Unfree labour and capitalist restructuring in the Agrarian sector: Peru and India|author=Tom Brass|journal=Journal of Peasant Studies|volume=14|number=1|year=1986|doi=10.1080/03066158608438319[/tpl]
In 1977, India passed legislation that prohibits solicitation or use of bonded labour by anyone, of anyone including children. Evidence of continuing bonded child labour continue. A report by the Special Rapporteur to India's National Human Rights Commission, reported the discovery of 53 child labourers in 1996 in the state of Tamil Nadu during a surprise inspection. Each child or the parent had taken an advance of Rs. 10,0000 to 25,0000. The children were made to work for 12 to 14 hours a day and received only Rs. 2 to 3 per day as wages.[tpl]cite web|title=Annual Report 1999-2000|publisher=National Human Rights Commission, Govt of India|year=2000|url=http://www.nhrc.nic.in/ar99_00.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Debt Bondage in India: An Indicative Report|publisher=Centre for Education and Communication|year=2004|pages=48–50|isbn=8188160113|oclc= 177083728[/tpl] According to an ILO report, the extent of bonded child labour is difficult to determine, but estimates from various social activist groups range up to 350,000 in 2001.
Despite its legislation, prosecutors in India seldom use the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976 to prosecute those responsible. According to one report,[tpl]cite web |url=http://idsn.org/uploads/media/Small_change-_Child_labour_in_India_s_silk_industry__HRW_01.pdf |title=Small Change: Bonded Labour in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=January 2003[/tpl] the prosecutors have no direction from the central government that if a child is found to be underpaid, the case should be prosecuted not only under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986, the case should include charges under the Bonded Labour Act of India. The few enforcement actions have had some unintended effects. While there has been a decrease in children working in factories because of enforcement and community vigilance committees, the report claims poverty still compels children and poor families to work. The factory lends money to whoever needs it, puts a loom in the person’s home, and then the family with children works out of their homes, bring finished product to pay interest and get some wages. The bonded child and family labour operations were moving out of small urban factories into rural homes.

==Consequences of child labour==

The presence of a large number of child labourers is regarded as a serious issue in terms of economic welfare. Children who work fail to get necessary education. They do not get the opportunity to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and psychologically.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ncpcr.gov.in/Reports/Magnitude_of_Child_Labour_in_India_An_Analysis_of_Official_Sources_of_Data_Draft.pdf |title= Magnitude of Child Labour in India[/tpl] Children in hazardous working conditions are in worse condition.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5059106.stm |title= Child Labour - India’s Cheap Commodity | work=BBC News | first=Navdip |last=Dhariwal |date=13 June 2006[/tpl] Children who work, instead of going to school, remain illiterate which limits their ability to contribute to their own well being as well as to community they live in. Child labour has long term adverse effects for India.
To keep an economy prospering, a vital criteria is to have an educated workforce equipped with relevant skills for the needs of the industries. The young labourers today, will be part of India’s human capital tomorrow. Child labour undoubtedly results in a trade-off with human capital accumulation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.iq.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/jr_childlaborpublished.pdf|title=Is Child Labor Inefﬁcient?|publisher=Harvard|accessdate = 12 September 2011[/tpl]

According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), there are tremendous economic benefits for developing nations by sending children to school instead of work. Without education, children do not gain the necessary skills such as English literacy and technical aptitude that will increase their productivity to enable them to secure higher-skilled jobs in future with higher wages that will lift them out of poverty.

===Diamond industry===

In the year 1999, the International Labour Organisation co-published a report with Universal Alliance of Diamond Workers, a trade union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/actrav/what/pubs/WCMS_111504/lang--fr/index.htm|title=Child Labour in the Diamond Industry|publisher=International Labour Organization|pages=51–53|author=Chandra Korgaokar and Geir Myrstad|year=1997[/tpl] The ILO report claimed that child labour is prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in a separate 1997 press release observed that child labour continued to flourish in India's diamond industry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|title=Child Labour Crisis in Diamond Industry|date=26 October 1999|publisher=BBC News|accessdate = 8 September 2009[/tpl] Not everyone agreed with these claims. The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, another trade union, acknowledged child labour is present but it is not systematic, is less than 1% and against local industry norms. Local diamond industry businessmen too downplayed these charges.[tpl]cite web|author=Summit Khanna |location= Ahmedabad |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=195628 |title=Diamond industry plays down child labour charges |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=13 December 2004 |accessdate = 9 November 2009[/tpl] child labour should be banned.
According to the 1999 ILO paper, India annually cuts and polishes 70 per cent of the world’s diamonds by weight, or 40 per cent by value. Additionally, India contributes 95 percent of the emeralds, 85 percent of the rubies, and 65 percent of the sapphires worldwide. India processes these diamonds and gems using traditional labour-intensive methods. About 1.5 million people are employed in the diamond industry, mostly in the unorganized sector. The industry is fragmented into small units, each employing a few workers. The industry has not scaled up, organised, and big operators absent. The ILO paper claims that this is to avoid the complex labour laws of India. The export order is split, work is subcontracted through many middlemen, and most workers do not know the name of enterprise with the export order. In this environment, claims the ILO report, exact number of child labourers in India's diamond and gem industry is unknown; they estimate that child labourers in 1997 were between 10,00 to 20,00 out of 1.5 million total workers (about 1 in 100). The ILO report claims the causes for child labour include parents who send their children to work because they see education as expensive, education quality offering no real value, while artisan work in diamond and gem industry to be more remunerative as the child grows up.
A more recent study from 2005, conducted at 663 manufacturing units at 21 different locations in India's diamond and gem industry, claims incidence rates of child labour have dropped to 0.31%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=11399|title=Child Labor Practice Drops in India|last=Tanna|first=Ketan|date=14 February 2005|publisher=Rapaport News|accessdate = 8 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=117676|title=Use of child labour in gem industry lower|date=14 February 2005|work=The Indian Express|accessdate = 20 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/af-ferguson-report-slams-surat-diamond-industry/206061/|title=AF Ferguson report slams Surat diamond industry|last=Khanna|first=Summit |date= 23 February 2005|work=Business Standard|accessdate = 20 October 2007[/tpl]

===Fireworks manufacture===

The town of Sivakasi in South India has been reported to employ child labour in the production of fireworks.[tpl]cite web|last=NDTV|title=Child Labour in Fireworks|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/child-labour-taints-fireworks-industry/19060[/tpl] In 2011, Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu was home to over 9,500 firecracker factories and produced almost 100 percent of total fireworks output in India.[tpl]cite web|title=Firecracker industry edgy about slow business prospects this Diwali: ASSOCHAM|publisher=ASSOCHAM|date=20 October 2011|url=http://www.assocham.org/prels/shownews-archive.php?id=3130[/tpl] The fireworks industry employed about 150,000 people at an average of 15 employees per factory. Most of these were in unorganised sector, with a few registered and organised companies.
In 1989, Shubh Bhardwaj reported[tpl]cite book|title=Urban unorganized sector in India|publisher=Mittal|year=1989|oclc=20057864|pages=45–48[/tpl] that child labour is present in India's fireworks industry, and safety practices poor. Child labour is common in small shed operation in the unorganized sector. Only 4 companies scaled up and were in the organised sector with over 250 employees; the larger companies did not employ children and had superior safety practices and resources. The child labour in small, unorganised sector operations suffered long working hours, low wages, unsafe conditions and tiring schedules.
A more recent 2002 report by International Labour Organisation claims[tpl]cite web|title=A future without child labor|publisher=International Labor Organization, Geneva|year=2002|isbn=92-2-112416-9|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_publ_9221124169_en.pdf[/tpl] that child labour is significant in Tamil Nadu's fireworks, matches or incense sticks industries. However, these children do not work in the formal economy and corporate establishments that produce for export. The child labourers in manufacturing typically toil in supply chains producing for the domestic market of fireworks, matches or incense sticks. The ILO report claims that as the demand for these products has grown, the formal economy and corporate establishments have not expanded to meet the demand, rather home-based production operations have mushroomed. This has increased the potential of child labour. Such hidden operations make research and effective action difficult, suggests ILO.

===Silk manufacture===

A 2003 Human Rights Watch report claims children as young as five years old are employed and work for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in silk industry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/23silk.htm|title=Indian silk industry employs child : Human Rights Watch|date=23 January 2003|accessdate = 20 October 2009[/tpl] These children, claims, are bonded labour; even though the government of India denies existence of bonded child labour, these silk industry child are easy to find in Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, claims Children are forced to dip their hands in scalding water to palpate the cocoons and are often paid less than Rs 10 per day.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1801/18010660.htm|title=Child : Blood on silk |publisher= (magazine)|accessdate= 20 October 2009|location=Chennai, India[/tpl]
In 2010, a German news investigative report claimed that in states like Karnataka, non-governmental organisations had found up to 10,000 children working in the 1,000 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of bonded child labourers were present in 1994. But today, after UNICEF and NGOs got involved, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report.[tpl]cite news|title=India: Freeing the Small Hands of the Silk Industry|publisher= (Germany)|year=2010|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1114659,00.html[/tpl]

===Carpet weaving===

Siddartha Kara finds about 20% of carpets manufactured in India could involve child labour. He notes, "determining the extent to which the hand-made carpet supply chain from India to the U.S.A. is tainted by slavery and child labor requires an additional exercise in supply chain tracing."Tainted Carpets: Slavery and Child Labor in India's Hand-Made Carpet Sector, Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights, Harvard University, page 48 Kara's study also finds variation in child labour practices between ethnic and religious groups.

==Demography of child labour==

According to 2005 Government of India NSSO(National Sample Survey Org.), child labour incidence rates in India is highest among Muslim Indians, about 40% higher than Hindu Indians. Child labour was found to be present in other minority religions of India but at significantly lower rates. Across caste classification, the lowest caste Dalit children had child labour incidence rates of 2.8%, statistically similar to the nationwide average of 2.74%. Tribal populations, however, had higher child labour rates at 3.8%.Magnitude of Child Labour in India Table 12, Section 8.12, Government of India
