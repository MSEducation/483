The Canadian territory of Yukon has had a responsible government since 1978. In the 19th century, Yukon was a segment of the Hudson's Bay Company-administered North-Western Territory and then the Canadian-administered Northwest Territories. The territory only obtained a recognizable local government in 1895 when it became a separate district of the Northwest Territories.[tpl]harvnb|Coates|1988|p=74[/tpl] In 1898, Yukon was made a separate territory with its own commissioner and appointed Territorial Council.[tpl]harvnb|Coates|1988|p=103[/tpl] Prior to 1978, the territory had a legislature with a largely advisory role and no political parties or government leader. Instead, powers were invested in a governing Commissioner appointed by the federal government.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 10, 2008|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/provincial_territorial_politics/topics/2365/|title=Territorial Battles: Yukon Elections, 1978-2006 |publisher=CBC|date=November 22, 1978 [/tpl]
