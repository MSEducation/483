CATEGORIES: Celle (district)

Baven is a village in the parish of Hermannsburg in the north of Celle district in central Germany. It lies on the western edge of the Südheide Nature Park, on the Lüneburg Heath and currently has a population of 1,638.
There is evidence that the first settlements here go back to the Bronze Age. Until the 19th century Baven consisted of 15 farmsteads, before the sale and division of an estate (Hofstelle) made new land available and the number of inhabitants rose markedly. In 1973 Baven was incorporated into the parish of Hermannsburg as part of the regional and administrative reform in Lower Saxony.About the regional and administrative reform in Lower Saxony compare Blazek, Matthias: Von der Landdrostey zur Bezirksregierung – Die Geschichte der Bezirksregierung Hannover im Spiegel der Verwaltungsreformen, Stuttgart 2004, ISBN 3-89821-357-9.
Just north of the village a small stream, the Brunau feeds into the River Örtze.
