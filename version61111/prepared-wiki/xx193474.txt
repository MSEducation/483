Laanila Highschool (Laanilan lukio in Finnish) is an upper secondary school in Oulu, Finland that was founded in 1957. There are currently about 300 pupils in it.
The high school shares a building with Laanila intermediate school. Although the schools are named after Laanila neighbourhood, they are actually located in Hintta neighbourhood, an area next to Laanila.
In November 2007, the schools celebrated their 50-year anniversary. Old pupils were invited to take a look at the new parts of the building and see how the pupils are taught nowadays.
The schools have a motto "Luja, l√§mmin, luotettava", meaning literally "Stalwart, warm, dependable".
