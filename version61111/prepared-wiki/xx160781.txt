HD 154345 (Gliese 651) is a G-type dwarf star located in northern Hercules. It is not visible to the naked eye since it is below +6.50 magnitude, but using binoculars it is an easy target.

==Planetary system==

In 2006, a long-period, wide-orbiting planet was observed by radial velocity, and published in May 2007, gaining the designation HD 154345 b.
The complete observation of its nine-year orbit rules out any interior planets of minimum mass (m sini) greater than 0.3 Jupiter. The star rotates at an inclination of 50[tpl]Â±|40|26[/tpl] degrees relative to Earth.  It is probable that the planet shares that inclination. It has been called a "Jupiter twin".
The system's habitable zone is centered at .754 AU and is narrower than the Sun's.Square root of stellar luminosity.
