Zvonko Milojević ([tpl]lang-sr-Cyrl|Звoнкo Mилojeвић[/tpl]; born August 30, 1971 in Jagodina) is a retired Serbian football goalkeeper. 
Having made his first team debut for Red Star Belgrade at only 17 years of age in the return leg of the 1989-90 UEFA Cup matchup versus 1. FC Köln, his first years with the club were spent as a deputy to Stevan Stojanović. After Stojanović moved on in summer 1991 following the European Cup win, 20-year-old Milojević shared the goalkeeping load with Dragoje Leković who was brought in. The following year Milojević became the first choice goalie and continued as such until 1997 when he left.
On November 15, 2007 Milojević was involved in a car accident in Germany in which he received severe injuries. As of April 2009 he's still recuperating and fighting to regain the strength needed to walk again.Zvonko Milojević: Deset sekundi na nogama, MTS Mondo, April 20, 2009
