James Bonnin (about 1782 – 8 January 1850) was an English property developer who built more than three hundred houses in the Brompton, Kensington, Knightsbridge and Chelsea areas of London.

==Early years==

James Bonnin's birth and baptism records have not been found, but he was probably born between 1775 and 1782 in or around London. His parents were James Bonnin and his wife Susanna (formerly Brown) who were married in St Marylebone in 1770. Little is known of his early life, but it his clear that he was of French Huguenot extraction, as many of his siblings were baptised in French churches in and around the city of London.

==Career==

James Bonnin has been described as "the builder who more effectively than another left his stamp on present-day Brompton."'The Alexander Estate', Survey of London: volume 41: Brompton (1983), pp. 58-86. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50009 Around 1806, He was involved in a number of developments in the Hans Town area. James was then describing himself as a carpenter and undertaker. In 1815, the London Gazette reports a James Bonnin - builder, carpenter, dealer and chapman - of North Street, Kensington being declared bankrupt.London Gazette: 16 September 1815 However he seems to have recovered rapidly from this setback: in a trade directory for 1816-17 he is listed as a timber merchant with an address in Sloane Place.   About 1819-20 James Bonnin was involved in building in Knightsbridge (including Trevor Square), and in 1821 he undertook the initial development of Brompton Square.
His subsequent work was divided between for the Alexander Estate (starting in 1826) and Smith's Charity, which owned substantial areas of land in the Brompton area. His first contract for the charity started in 1822.Greater London Council Survey of London: Volume 41 - Brompton (1983) http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50011  He built a terrace of eight houses for the charity, (Onslow Terrace: later demolished to make way for the underground railway), on what is now the western end of Brompton Road.
Bonnin worked with a surveyor appointed by the charity, whose job was to handle the details of contracts and approve designs for the buildings. In 1828 George Basevi, an architect who was a cousin of Benjamin Disraeli, was appointed surveyor. James Bonnin was a meticulous builder who produced high quality buildings and from then on, Basevi designed the houses and Bonnin built them. Between 1833 and 1844 they built Pelham Crescent, Pelham Place, part of Pelham Street and a small area of Fulham Road on either side of the Pelham Street junction.
Alongside the building, James had another venture. In 1802, his sister Susanna had married Samuel Cocks, a master Pewterer in the City of London. At some point - probably after Samuel's death in 1820, James went into partnership with Susanna, who kept the Cocks pewter touch markPewterbank: Marks on Pewter Plates http://pewterbank.com/html/plate_marks_-_rims.html producing until 1844.  James was admitted to the Freedom of the City of London London, England, Freedom of the City Admission Papers  http://search.ancestry.co.uk/search/db.aspx?dbid=2052 as a Master Pewterer in 1836. His partnership with his sister was dissolved in 1838.
By 1843 James senior and his second son James Bonnin junior were splitting further work on the estate between them. James Bonnin junior was appointed to construct 6-10 (even) Pelham Street and some houses on the north side of Pelham Street which were eventually demolished to make way for the South Kensington station. James Bonnin senior secured a much bigger project on the site of Brompton Grange, which was to result in the construction of Egerton Crescent, Egerton Terrace, Yeoman's Row and Crescent Place by 1849. James senior may only have been directly involved in the construction of Egerton Crescent and probably sub-contracted the rest of the work.
To finance these various developments, the Bonnins entered into arrangements with lenders and with other speculators. It is known, for example, that James senior borrowed £2,000 from a wine merchant in Pelham Crescent, on the security of his underlease of Nos. 50-53 Egerton Crescent.
James Bonnin senior's partnership with architect George Basevi ended in 1845 when Basevi fell from one of the towers of Ely Cathedral and was killed.

==Personal life==

In 1805 he married Elizabeth Moye, who subsequently bore him a large family. Elizabeth having died in 1835, James married Mary Ann Aldridge in 1838 and five more children ensued.
Following Basevi's death, James Bonnin senior fell on hard times and in July 1846 he was again declared bankrupt. He explained his financial difficulties as being due to 'undertaking more than my means would justify, ... the fluctuations in the funds in 1845 and 1846, and fall in House property with some heavy losses'. There was a depression in the Kensington housing market about this time which may have caught him over-exposed financially. Four of his sons from his first marriage had emigrated to South Australia and in 1849, faced with the prospect of the workhouse, he decided to join them. He managed to persuade the Kensington Board of Guardians to give him £10 so that he and his young family could emigrate to South Australia and start a new life.Passenger list for the "Asiatic": London - Adelaide 1849 http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/fh/passengerlists/1849Asiatic.htm
