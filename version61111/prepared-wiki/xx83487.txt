The Others is an American TV series created by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and produced by Delusional Films, NBC Studios, and DreamWorks Television. It ran for 13 40-minute episodes from February 5, 2000 to June 10, 2000, airing on NBC in the US, Five in the UK and on Nine in Australia. It concerned a group of people with various psychic talents as they encountered different, and often evil, paranormal forces.  It was an ensemble show.

==Plot==

Primary focus is on a student, Marian Kitt, as she came to terms with her frequently unwanted abilities. Although the series gradually built up an overall storyline of a strong evil power targeting the group, its cancellation meant that this was never properly resolved.

Note that the episodes were seemingly[tpl]weasel inline|date=November 2012[/tpl] broadcast out of order although it is listed below in the linear[tpl]clarify|date=November 2012[/tpl] order. The sixth episode "Luciferous" should have been the second episode as it deals with Marian's decision to join the group. The 12th episode "Life Is for the Living" should clearly[tpl]editorializing|date=November 2012[/tpl] have been the last one, as it is the end of the story (all of the main characters are apparently killed), a story which is oddly unresolved in the 13th episode. It is believed[tpl]weasel inline|date=November 2012[/tpl] that episode 13 was delayed and should[tpl]editorializing|date=November 2012[/tpl] have been broadcast several episodes earlier.

==Production==

Famed horror director Tobe Hooper directed one episode, "Souls On Board", and the series' writers included Glen Morgan and James Wong (also executive producers, with Brancato and Ferris), who had previously written for shows including The X-Files and Millennium and created, produced and written for Space: Above and Beyond. Morgan's wife Kristen Cloke played the significant role of Allison/The Woman in the episodes "The Ones That Lie in Wait" and "Life Is for the Living".
The series was filmed at Paramount Studios, with the exception of the pilot episode, which was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
