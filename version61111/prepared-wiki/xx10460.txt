Rock Bridge High School is a public high school located in southern Columbia, Missouri. The school serves grades 9 through 12, and is a part of the Columbia Public Schools. Students in Grade 9 will be attending the school starting fall of 2013 for the first time following new redistricting in Columbia Public Schools.

==History==

Due to the increasing population of Columbia in the 70's, and the crowding of David H. Hickman High School towards the end of the 1960s, the Columbia Board of Education decided to form a new high school. The board bought [tpl]convert|42|acre|m2[/tpl] of land in Southern Columbia and started the construction of the new high school. The name Rock Bridge was chosen because of the schools proximity to the natural rock bridge of Rock Bridge State Park.   In September 1973, Rock Bridge first opened and had a class of 583 students.  The original portion of RBHS had only 20 classrooms (plus a gymnasium), which was soon expanded in 1978 for a then-total of about 40 classrooms. The design of the school at this point won a national award in school design. Many of the original classrooms were connected with folding partitions; those in the east section are now opened to facilitate "Studies" classes team-taught English and Social Studies classes in a "double classroom" while those in the west section were later replaced with a regular wall. The school is centrally air conditioned.http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/rbhs/about/school_information.htm Three new science classrooms, as well as a performing arts center, were added in 1992. Eight years later, in 2000, a large addition opened with seven science classrooms, four "double" classrooms to facilitate the "studies" department, seven new foreign language classrooms, a new Library, and three new computer labs (two of which were converted to physics classrooms in 2013). As of 2010-2011, the school has Wi-Fi throughout the media center, commons, and main hallways, with the entire building wired in the summer of 2012.  In 2011, the school's library received a set of 30 laptops for teachers to reserve for their class. When the students need the laptops, the teacher sends the students to the library, where each student will check out a laptop under their name as an hourly checkout. By 2013, the school had received nine more carts (plus a set of 30 iPads). http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/rbhs/parents/ptsa_newsletter/PTSA%20newsletter.pdf A second gymnasium also opened in 2013.

==Structure==

Rock Bridge runs on a block scheduling format during the hours of 8:55 AM to 4:05 PM. This format is structured so that students have four 86 minute classes each day. However, most of these classes meet every other day for a total of eight classes for the year. Only the English and Social Studies classes (which is one large class for both curriculums) meet daily. Underclassmen have "Advisory" for one block which is a structured study hall with a senior mentor, which transitions to an Alternating Unassigned Time, referred to as AUT. Most upperclassmen have an AUT, and it is not uncommon for seniors to have two AUTs (one on each day). In addition to the four main classes, Freshmen and Sophomores have a 31 minute "Bruin Block" during the 62-minute Lunch Time. Freshmen have Bruin Block in the First half of lunch, and Sophomores have Bruin Block in the Second half of lunch. Though current Juniors and Seniors do not have Bruin Block, current underclassmen will have Bruin Block for all four years. Bruin Block focuses on different areas that may give advisement of how to be successful in High School and in College.

NOTE: Freshmen and Sophomores only have half a lunch period; Bruin Block is the other half.
