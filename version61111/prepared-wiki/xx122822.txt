OpenOffice.org XML is an open XML-based file format developed as an open community effort[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/  |title=Welcome to the OpenOffice.org Source Project (archived website) |author=OpenOffice.org Foundation |date=2000-07-19 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20000815055517/http://www.openoffice.org/ |archivedate = 2000-08-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/project/www/openofficefoundation.html#standards_process |title=The OpenOffice.org Project |author=OpenOffice.org Foundation |date=2000-08-10 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000823051154/http://www.openoffice.org/project/www/openofficefoundation.html#standards_process |archivedate=2000-08-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://opendocument.xml.org/milestones |title=History of OpenDocument |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2010-08-08[/tpl] by Sun Microsystems in 2000â€“2002. The open-source software application suite OpenOffice.org 1.x and StarOffice 6 and 7 used the format as their native and default file format for saving files. The OpenOffice.org XML format is no longer widely used, but it is still supported in recent versions of OpenOffice.org-descended software.
OpenDocument (ISO/IEC 26300:2006) is based on OpenOffice.org XML and these formats are very similar in many technical areas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xml.openoffice.org/general.html |title=OpenOffice.org XML File Format |accessdate=2010-03-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.file-extensions.org/sxw-file-extension |title=file extension SXW - OpenOffice.org Writer document |accessdate=2010-03-27[/tpl] However, OpenDocument is not the same as the older OpenOffice.org XML format and these formats are not directly compatible. In 2005, OpenOffice.org (since version 2.0) and StarOffice (since version 8) switched to OpenDocument as their native and default format.[tpl]cite press release | title = Sun Introduces New Version of StarOffice Software | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc. | date = 2005-09-27 | url = http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-09/sunflash.20050927.1.xml | accessdate = 2007-09-20 [/tpl][tpl]cite press release | title = OpenOffice.org 2.0 Is Here | publisher = OpenOffice.org | date = 2005-10-20 | url = http://www.openoffice.org/press/2.0/press_release.html | accessdate = 2007-09-20 [/tpl]

==History==

StarOffice developers adopted XML to replace the old binary StarOffice file format. The draft version was also known as StarOffice XML File Format.[tpl]citation |url=http://xml.coverpages.org/openoffice-xml_specification_draft200012.pdf |format=PDF |title=StarOffice XML File Format Working Draft, Technical Reference Manual, Draft 9, December 2000 |date=December 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-08[/tpl]
The stated goal in the draft was:

==File formats==

The format uses XML files to describe the documents. To minimize space, the files are compressed into an archive and given a suffix depending on what sort of data is contained in them.
