A nazarbattu is often an intentional blemish or flaw that is introduced to prevent perfection. For instance, a black mark might be made on the face or neck of a loved one.[tpl]Citation | title=The Dawoodi Bohras: an anthropological perspective | author=Shibani Roy | publisher=B.R.

Although it doesn't involve a specific nazar battu, it is customary in the region for mothers to lightly spit at their children (usually ritualistically to the side of the children rather than directly at them) to imply a sense of disparagement and imperfection that protects them from nazar.[tpl]Citation | title=Indian ritual and belief: the keys of power | author=John Abbott | publisher=Usha, 1984 | isbn= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zkIvAAAAYAAJ | quote=...

==Satirical usage in popular culture==

In North India and Pakistan, the term nazar battu can be used idiomatically in a satiric sense to allude to people or objects which are undesirable but must be tolerated. For instance, when it appeared that former military ruler Pervez Musharraf would insist on being accommodated institutionally as Pakistan made the transition to democracy with the 2008 general election, some press commentators alluded to him as the nazarbattu of Pakistan's democracy.[tpl]Citation | title= ’آزادی جمہور کا آتا ہے زمانہ‘ / 'The era of freedom and democracy draws close' | publisher=BBC | date=Feb 26, 2008 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/urdu/2008/02/post_276.html | quote=... ریٹائرڈ جنرل پرویز مشرف کو بغیر نفع نقصان کی شراکت کے قبول کرنا ہوگا۔ اب نہیں معلوم کہ وہ جمہوریت کے ’نظربٹو‘ کے طور پر قبولے جائیں گے یا / retired general Pervez Musharraf will have to be accepted without diminishing him in any way. It is unknown if he will be accepted as the nazar battu of democracy or ...[/tpl]
