Serpentine  National Park is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), located on the Darling Scarp, approximately 50Â km southeast of Perth.  
The park's main feature, and most popular tourist destination, is Serpentine Falls, a series of waterfalls in the upper reaches of Serpentine River.  Other attractions include Serpentine Dam and the smaller Pipehead Dam.  The park overlaps the North Dandalup Important Bird Area.
The park was proclaimed as a National Park in 1957.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/park-finder/property/national-parks/serpentine-national-park.html|title=Serpentine National Park|publisher=Department of Environment and Conservation|accessdate=29 August 2009[/tpl]
