[tpl]nihongo|Sashiko|刺し子||literally "little stabs"[/tpl] is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching (or functional embroidery) from Japan.  Traditionally used to reinforce points of wear, or to repair worn places or tears with patches, this running stitch technique is often used for purely decorative purposes in quilting and embroidery.  The white cotton thread on the traditional indigo blue cloth gives sashiko its distinctive appearance, though decorative items sometimes use red thread. 
Many Sashiko patterns were derived from Chinese designs, but just as many were developed by the Japanese themselves.   The artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849) published the book New Forms for Design in 1824, and these designs have inspired many Sashiko patterns.
