[[Drought in Chile]]

CATEGORIES: Water in Chile, Climate of Chile, Environment of Chile, Natural disasters in Chile, Droughts by location

Through its history Chile has been regularly affected by droughts. In the more arid parts of Chile droughts are produced when there are low amount of snow accumulation in the Andes. Chilean coastal basins without snow accumulation are particularly vulnerable to drought.
The territory of Central Chile has been affected by long-term droughts in 1280–1450, 1570–1650 and 1770–1820.

==Historical droughts==

===Drought of 1770–82===

The 1770–1782 period was one of general drought in Central Chile with a total of three non-consecutive years of extreme drought. In 1772 vineyards and cropfields along Mapocho River in Santiago could not be irrigated.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 67-68. This drought led the authorities to begin the construction of the long-planned San Carlos Canal in 1772 to deviate waters from Maipo River to Mapocho River.

===Drought of 1924===

In 1924 a drought spread between Coquimbo and Maule Region.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 201-203. In Coquimbo Region (at the time known as Province of Coquimbo) 70% of the wheat from non-irrigated land was lost while in irrigated areas the harvest loss was of 20%. The price of railroad transport of livestock to places south of Curicó was lowered by 40% as there was hardly any grass or plant buds for livestock to eat in Norte Chico.
Rural people in Coquimbo Region flocked around the towns of Illapel, Combarbalá and Ovalle. Later the intendant of Coquimbo claimed that about hundred people had left the province as result of the drought.

===Great Drought of 1968–69===

The drought faced by Chile between 1968 and 1969, known as the Great Drought of 1968, was one of the largest rainfall deficits in the country during the twentieth century, only comparable to the drought of 1924.[tpl]citation|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000227/022757so.pdf|author=Espíldora, Basilio|title=Algunos antecedentes hidrológicos de la sequía en Chile|work=Acta del Seminario Regional sobre Hidrología de Sequías|year=1972|pages=181–184|accessdate=2011-02-14[/tpl] The drought had its origin in the low amounts of precipitation the fell in 1967.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 337-340. The area affected by the drought spanned from Atacama Region in the north to Ñuble Province in the south.
The drought created huge losses for cultivations of potato, rice, maize, beans. Fruit trees and vineyards were also affected. 100 thousand cattle and 1 million sheep died because of the drought. Milk, meat and wool output declined. By September 1969 only 250 thousand goats remained from an earlier population of 650.000.
Through rural Norte Chico many farmers and communities came to lack water even for human consumption. In 1969 farmers received support of several financial institutions and state agencies including tax exemptions and a line of credit to buy forage.
In Central the typical river flow increase in December did not happen in 1968. Chile many farmers decided to not cultivate in early summer due to this and the known fact there was almost no snow in Andes. Later in summer the rivers did grew due to glacier ablation a causing many farmers to repent albeit it was too late to cultivate.
The decline in hydroelectrical power generation (The hydroelectrical deficit was of 200 GW) was partly compensated by having the thermoelectrical plants of Ventanas, Renca and Laguna Verda function at maximum capacity. To supply the thermoelectrical plants with coal the production and stock of Lota-Schwager was not enough and government authorized the import of 50 thousand tons of coal from the United States, Poland, France and Germany.
In the hydrological year of 1969–1970 the area affected by the drought disminished from previously spanning the latitudes of 27–37° S to 27–33° S.

===Drought of 1998–99===

Beginning in December 1996 the El Niño phenomemnon affected Chile during 14 months until 1998. Sea temperatures were high in the Pacific.
The drought of caused an energy shortage in SIC, Chile's main power grid. The energy shortage was worsened by problems in the Nehuenco Power Plant driven by natural gas.
