Helge Rosvaenge (Roswaenge, Rosvænge), Helge Anton Rosenvinge Hansen, (August 29, 1897[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]June 17, 1972)  was a famous Danish operatic tenor whose career was centred on Germany and Austria, before, during and after World War II.
Rosvaenge was born in Copenhagen. He made his debut at  Neustrelitz as Don Jose in Carmen in 1921. Engagements followed at Altenburg, Basle, Cologne (1927–30) and the Berlin State Opera, where he was leading tenor from 1930 to 1944, being especially distinguished in the Italian repertory. He sang regularly, too, at the Vienna State Opera (from 1936) and in Munich. Rosvaenge also appeared at the Salzburg Festival, making his debut there in Der Rosenkavalier. Other roles which he performed at Salzburg between 1933 and 1939 were Tamino in The Magic Flute, Huon in Oberon and Florestan in Fidelio. His London debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, occurred in 1938, as Florestan.
Rosvaenge sang Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival in 1934 and 1936 but otherwise avoided the Wagnerian repertory, except on recordings.
After World War II Rosvaenge divided his time between Berlin and Vienna. He continued to sing until May 30, 1959 (when he gave what was billed as his farewell concert at Vienna's Great Musikvereinssaal), appearing as Calàf, Radamès and Manrico. His voice showed little sign of age; it was still warm and sonorous throughout its range, and brilliant and lustrous in its upper register. Indeed, Rosvaenge, could deliver an easy and full-blooded high D during his vocal prime.  This can be heard in one of his most celebrated recordings, the Postillon's Song ("Mes amis, écoutez l'histoire") from Le postillon de Lonjumeau by Adolphe Adam.
Rosvaenge appeared in a wide spectrum of roles ranging from Mozart to Weber, from Verdi to Puccini. He sang with "a steely voice, brilliant high notes and insistent declamation throughout its scale" which was "brilliant and lustrous in its top register", according to Luiz Eduardo Goncalves Gabarra. Rosvaenge was equally impressive as Andrea Chénier and was also an acclaimed and exciting Radamès and Otello: he was often heard in this latter role on German radio.
Rosvaenge conducted a tour of the USA prior to his retirement. He died in Munich, aged 74.

==Recordings==

Rosvaenge was a prolific recording artist, with records being produced as early as 1927 by the Gramophone Company (now EMI), and later by the Telefunken, Parlophone and Odeon labels. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. The finest of them were made in the 1930s and early 1940s and feature a wealth of exciting lyric-dramatic singing.
