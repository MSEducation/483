In sailing, a brigantine is a two-masted vessel with foremast fully square rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail (a gaff sail) and a square topsail, and possibly a topgallant sail.http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/brigantine.html

==Early brigantines==

Originally the brigantine was a sail- and oar-driven warshiphttp://www.conservapedia.com/Brigantine used in the Mediterranean in the 13th century.[tpl]cite book|title=Aken, tjalken en kraken|author=Dik Vuik, Hans Haalmeijer|year=2006|publisher=Uitgeverij De Alk B.V.|location=Alkmaar, the Netherlands[/tpl] It was lateen rigged on two masts and had between eight and twelve oars on each side. Its speed, manoeuvrability and ease of handling made it a favourite of the Mediterranean pirates. Its name is derived from the Italian word brigantino, meaning brigand.

==17th century and onwards==

The vessel had no lateen sails but was instead square-rigged on the foremast and had a gaff-rigged mainsail with square rig above it on the mainmast.[tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|editor=Peter Kemp|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford[/tpl] The main mast of a brigantine is the aft one.
By the first half of the 18th century the word had evolved to refer not to a ship type name, but rather to a particular type of rigging: a two-masted vessel with her foremast fully square-rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail (a gaff sail) and square topsails and possibly topgallant sails.http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/brigantine.html
The brigantine was the second most popular rig for ships built in the American colonies before 1775http://www.gaspee.info/history/shipsdescribed/brigentineDescribed.htm (the most popular ship type being a sloop). The brigantine was swifter and more easily maneuvered than a sloop or schooner, and was hence employed for purposes of piracy, espionage, and reconnoitering, and as an outlying attendant upon larger ships for protecting the larger ship, or for supply or landing purposes in a fleet of ships.
The brigantine could be of various sizes, ranging from 50 to 200 tons burden. The brigantine was generally larger than a sloop or schooner but smaller than a brig.[tpl]cite book|title=Aken, tjalken en kraken|author=Dik Vuik, Hans Haalmeijer|year=2006|publisher=Uitgeverij De Alk B.V.|location=Alkmaar, the Netherlands[/tpl]

==Modern terminology==

Historically, this rig used to be called a schooner brig or hermaphrodite brig.http://universalium.academic.ru/85396/brigantine
The word brig is an 18th-century shortening of the word brigantine, but came to mean a different type of rigging. It is the gaff-rigged mainsail on a brigantine which distinguishes it from the brig, which is principally square rigged on both masts.http://www.conservapedia.com/Brigantine
