==History==

Lions Clubs International, a service membership organization of 1,368,683 members world-wide, was founded in the United States on June 7, 1917, by Melvin Jones,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.extramile.us/honorees/jones.cfm | title= Melvin Jones biography | work= The Points of Light Foundation | accessdate= 2007-06-07 [/tpl] a Chicago businessman.  Jones asked, with regard to his colleagues, "What if these men who are successful because of their drive, intelligence and ambition, were to put their talents to work improving their communities?"  Jones' personal code, "You can't get very far until you start doing something for somebody else," reminds many Lions of the importance of community service.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/lions_history_jones.shtml| title= Melvin Jones Biography  | accessdate= 2007-11-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070919111921/http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/lions_history_jones.shtml  |archivedate = 2007-09-19[/tpl]
The Lions motto is “We Serve.” Local Lions Club programs include sight conservation, hearing and speech conservation, diabetes awareness, youth outreach, international relations, environmental issues, and other programs.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/resources_contact_leader.shtml| title= Leadership Development Programs | accessdate= 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070910162740/http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/resources_contact_leader.shtml  |archivedate = 2007-09-10[/tpl]

==Purpose==

The stated purposes of Lions Clubs International are:

==Charitable work==

Much of the focus of Lions Clubs International work as a service club organization is to raise money for worthy causes. All funds raised by Lions Clubs from the general public are used for charitable purposes, and administrative costs are kept strictly separate and paid for by members. Some of the money raised for a club’s charity account goes toward projects that benefit the local community of an individual club.

===Service projects===

Lions Clubs plan and participate in a wide variety of service projects that meet the international goals of Lions Clubs International as well as the needs of their local communities.  Examples include donations to hospices,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/4185894.stm | title= Lions share flower carpet riches | work= BBC News | date= 25 August 2005 | accessdate= 2007-06-07 [/tpl] or community campaigns such as Message in a bottle, a United Kingdom initiative which places a plastic bottle with critical medical information inside the refrigerators of vulnerable people.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4668172.stm | title= Scheme not bottling out of aid | work= BBC News | date= 31 January 2006 | accessdate= 2007-06-07 [/tpl] Money is also raised for international purposes. Some of this is donated in reaction to events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Other money is used to support international campaigns, coordinated by the Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF), such as Sight First and Lions World Sight Day, which was launched in 1998 to draw world media attention to the plight of sight loss in the third world.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/474116.stm | title= Webcast fights blindness | work= BBC News | date= 13 October 1999 | accessdate= 2007-06-07 [/tpl] Lions take on all sorts of various fundraisers to fund these projects. For example, the Dublin, Virginia Lions Club host two flea markets a year, and sell their famous Lion Dog, a fresh prepared variation of a corn dog.http://www.dublinlions.org/dlprojects.html
Lions focus on work for the blind and visually impaired began when Helen Keller addressed the international convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, on 30 June 1925 and charged Lions to be Knights of the Blind.
Lions also have a strong commitment to community hearing- and cancer-screening projects. In Perth, Western Australia, they have conducted hearing screening for over 30 years and provided seed funding for the Lions Ear and Hearing Institute established September 9, 2001, a center of excellence in the diagnosis, management, and research of ear and hearing disorders.[tpl]cite web | title= About The Institute | url= http://www.earscience.org.au/institute/index.php | work= Ear Science Institute Australia | accessdate= 2007-06-23 [/tpl] In Perth, Lions have also been instrumental in the establishment of the Lions Eye Institute. In Brisbane, Queensland, the Lions Medical Research Foundation provides funding to a number of researchers. Ian Frazer's initial work, leading to the development of a HPV vaccine for the human papillomavirus which could lead to cervical cancer, was funded by the Lions Medical Research Foundation.
Lions Clubs International has supported the work of the United Nations since that organization's inception in 1945, when it was one of the non-governmental organizations invited to assist in the drafting of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, California.

Upon endorsing the biggest ever collaborative disease eradication programme called the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases launched on 30 January 2012 in London, the organization has implemented SightFirst program by which it aims to eradicate blindness due to trachoma, one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases. It has allocated over US$11 million in 10 countries for eye surgeries, medical training, distribution of Zithromax and tetracycline, and sanitary services. It has also announced US$6.9 million funding to support the Government of China for the same cause.[tpl]cite web| author= Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= Private and Public Partners Unite to Combat 10 Neglected Tropical Diseases by 2020|date= 30 January 2012| url= http://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/press-releases/2012/01/private-and-public-partners-unite-to-combat-10-neglected-tropical-diseases-by-2020|work= gatesfoundation.org |publisher= Press Room, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |accessdate= 2013-05-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web| author= Uniting to Combat NTDs|title= Endorsements (endorsing organizations) |year= 2012| url= http://www.unitingtocombatntds.org/endorsements |work= unitingtocombatntds.org |publisher= Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases |accessdate= 2013-05-30[/tpl]

===Membership===

Membership is by "invitation only" as mandated by its constitution and by-laws. All member applicants need a sponsor who is an active member and of good standing in the club they intend to join. Membership applications, moreover, are subject to the approval of the Club's Board of Directors. Attendance at meetings is encouraged on a monthly or fortnightly basis. Due to the hierarchical nature of Lions Clubs International, members have the opportunity to advance from a local club to an office at the zone, multiple district, and international levels.
In 1986 the constitution of Lions Clubs International was amended to allow for women to become members.[ref]
