==History==

Former Flowered Up keyboard player Tim Dorney and Andy Todd founded Republica. The Nigerian-born Saffron was an actress at one point, performing for two years in London's Starlight Express. She also appeared in the video for the Chesney Hawkes' hit "The One and Only" and in the video for N-Joi's single "Mindflux". She was also lead vocalist on N-Joi's hit "Anthem" in 1990.
Republica released the first single "Out of This World" in 1994, followed by the single "Bloke" in January 1995.
Their debut album Republica was released in July 1996 and reached No. 4 in the charts. Their signature single "Ready to Go" peaked at No. 13 in UK Singles Chart. The fourth single "Drop Dead Gorgeous" ranked No. 7 in UK Singles Chart.
The group attracted positive press coverage. Emerging after a wave of female-fronted rock bands (such as Elastica, Lush, Sleeper, Echobelly and Kenickie), they had, like Garbage, a notably more aggressive and electronic sound.
In 1997 Saffron performed vocals for The Prodigy's "Fuel My Fire" from their album The Fat of the Land.
The second album, Speed Ballads, was released in 1998 and reached No. 37 in UK Albums Chart. Its lead single, "From Rush Hour With Love", peaked at No. 20 in UK Singles Chart.
The band suffered when their label, Deconstruction Records, folded shortly after the release of Speed Ballads. Deconstruction's back catalogue was swallowed up by BMG and Speed Ballads was never released in the United States. In 2001 the band went on hiatus. On their official site it was posted the message "Republica are not recording at this time".Band on hiatus In 2002 BMG released the compilation Ready to Go: The Best Of against the band's wishes.
After the band went on hiatus, Saffron worked with The Cure, appearing on the single "Just Say Yes" from their Greatest Hits album. She also collaborated with Junkie XL for his 2003 album Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin.
