==Reception==

Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic called Word of Mouf a "superstar affair that aims for mass appeal with a broad array of different styles" and enjoyed "witty puns and sly innuendoes" displayed in songs such as "Area Codes".  However, he felt that "amid all of these various team-ups you do lose a little bit of the sincere, personal edge that had characterized much of Ludacris' debut."  Soren Baker of the Chicago Tribune also praised the album's comedic nature, commenting that "Whether he's delivering a punchy one-liner, exaggerating his rhyme flow to a silly extreme or cleverly deploying pop culture references, Ludacris keeps the mood light and festive. Even his skits are funny enough that they could serve as the foundation for a top-tier comedy album."[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-02-03/news/0202030376_1_ludacris-def-jam-south-guilty-pleasure|title=Ludacris "Word of Mouf" (Def Jam South) - Review|last=Soren|first=Baker|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tony W.
