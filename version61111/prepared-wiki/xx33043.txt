Guildhall School of Music and Drama is an independent music and dramatic arts school which was founded in 1880 in London, England. Students can pursue courses in Music, Opera, Drama and Technical Theatre Arts.

==History==

The first Guildhall School was housed in an old warehouse in Aldermanbury, but these premises soon proved too small. A new purpose-built building in John Carpenter Street was designed by City Architect Sir Horace Jones and opened in December 1886. The school is owned by the City of London Corporation and takes its name from the Corporation's historic headquarters at the Guildhall, though it was never based there. Before 1935 it was known as  the Guildhall School of Music. Since 1977 it has been situated next to the Barbican Arts Centre in the Barbican Complex.
In 2004, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama's external examinations department merged with the performing arts examinations division of Trinity College London to form the Trinity Guildhall Examination system. Today, the merged examinations board offers qualifications in performing and teaching in areas such as music, speech and drama, and dance to external students. However the name Trinity Guildhall was dropped in 2012 and the board's examinations are now offered under the Trinity College London brand.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In 2008 work began to redevelop the Milton Court complex, which is near to the School's main building and part of which has been used by the School for several years. The new 36-floor building (The Heron), funded by the City of London and developed by Heron International, houses a 625-seat concert hall, a 225-seat theatre and a 90-seat studio theatre, as well as studios for television, radio, teaching, rehearsal, office and support services. The extension to the School is estimated to cost around £89 million. The acoustic design, was by Arup. The hall's official opening was in September 2013, and received positive reviews.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalconcertreviews/10339687/Milton-Court-opening-concert-review.html|author=Shirley, Hugo|title=Milton Court opening concert, review|date=27 Sep 2013|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl]
