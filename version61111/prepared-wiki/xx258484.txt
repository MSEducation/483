John Giheno (born 1950) is a Papua New Guinea politician and former government minister.

Prime Minister Julius Chan resigned on March 27, 1997, following a scandal regarding the hiring of foreign mercenaries to fight rebels on the island of Bougainville. The use of mercenaries by the Chan government resulted in an Papua New Guinea Defence Force mutiny codenamed 'Operasen Rausim Kwik' and riots in Bougainville. Chan stated that he resigned to preserve peace in Papua New Guinea.
The Cabinet chose John Giheno, who was serving as the mining and petroleum Minister at the time, as acting Prime Minister until new elections could be held. Giheno served as Prime Minister as a caretaker until new elections could be held in June 1997. Sixteen government ministers in the Chan government, including both Giheno and Chan, lost their seats in Parliament in the June 1997 general elections.
