The 2002-2003 UK firefighter dispute began when the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), voted to take strike action in an attempt to secure a better salary. The FBU demanded a 39 percent increase in pay, which would have brought the average firefighter's wage to around £30,000. It balloted its members for a strike in late 2002 and the industrial action began in November. It was the first nationwide firefighters' strike in the UK since the 1970s.BBC News Website: Fire strike 'would threaten Iraq action', 5 Sep 02, (accessed 11 Oct 07)
