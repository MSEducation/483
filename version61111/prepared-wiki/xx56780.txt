United Poultry Concerns (UPC) is a national non-profit animal rights organization that addresses the treatment of domestic fowl, including chickens, ducks and turkeys, in food production, science, education, entertainment, and human companionship situations. The organization was founded in 1990 by animal rights activist and writer Karen Davis.[tpl]cite news|last=Wallis|first=David|title=Newsreal: Chickens have rights too!|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1997/11/07/news|newspaper=Salon|date=November 7, 1997[/tpl]
According to UPC's website, "United Poultry Concerns seeks to make the public aware of the ways poultry are treated by our society and elsewhere in the world. We assist the public to see how our treatment of these birds affects our health, our ethics, our education, our occupational safety, and our environment. We inform people about and actively promote alternatives. We do this through our extensive investigations, our chicken sanctuary, public talks, writings, mailings, conferences, information displays, and film presentations using such sources as public interest groups, animal advocacy organizations, poultry trade publications, government agencies, and scientific journals and proceedings."
The organization's slogan is "Birds are friends, not food," another common slogan used by the UPC is "Turkeys are too neat to eat" [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
