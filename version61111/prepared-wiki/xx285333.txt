The 2013 Open de Suède Vårgårda – team time trial will be the 6th team time trial running on the Open de Suède Vårgårda and the 6th race of the 2013 UCI Women's Road World Cup season. It will be held on 16 August 2013 over a distance of [tpl]convert|42.5|km|1|abbr=off[/tpl].

==Preview==

Only two teams have ever won a World Cup team time trial. These teams are Cervelo and [tpl]ct|SLU|2012[/tpl] (both with various incarnations of their team names). After the introduction of the team time trial for trade teams at the UCI Road World Championships in 2012, this team time trial World Cup race is an important benchmark for the team time trial at the 2013 UCI Road World Championships. 
[tpl]ct|SLU|2013[/tpl], that won both the team time trial at the 2012 World Championships and the 2012 Vargarda World Cup, is the main favourite for the victory. The important rival teams are Orica-AIS and [tpl]ct|RBW|2013[/tpl], both medalists in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.uci.ch/Modules/ENews/ENewsDetails2011.asp?id=OTUxOQ&MenuId=MTYzMjc&LangId=1&BackLink=%2Ftemplates%2FUCI%2FUCI8%2Flayout%2Easp%3FMenuId%3DMTYzMjc%26LangId%3D1| publisher=UCI|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013|title=Technical Guide Open de Suède/Swedish Open Team Time Trial|format=pdf [/tpl]

==The Route==

The course is a 42.5 km from Vårgårda to Herrljunga and back in and is mainly flat with one small climb after 35 km of an ascent of 40 metres in 2 km. The route is a challenging course including several tight corners and narrow roads. Crosswinds could be an important factor between Vårgårda and Herrljunga and on the bridge on Kullingsleden after 32.5 km.[tpl]cite web|url= http://deessesdelaroute.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/open-de-suede-vargarda-ttt.html | publisher= deessesdelaroute.co.uk|date=31 July 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013|title= Open de Suède Vårgårda TTT and Road Race [/tpl]
