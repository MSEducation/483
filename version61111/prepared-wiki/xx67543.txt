Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/20/canada-eu-tar-sands |title=Canada threatens trade war with EU over tar sands |first=Damian |last = Carrington |date=20 February 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=21 February 2012 |location=London[/tpl] According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta’s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.[tpl]cite news |title=Oilsands less polluting than EU claims: report |author=Vincent McDermott |date=11 May 2012 |publisher=Fort McMurray Today |url=http://www.fortmcmurraytoday.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3558953[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Barbara Lewis, David Ljunggren and Jeffrey Jones |title= Canada's Tar Sands Battle With Europe |agency=Reuters |date=2012-05-10 |publisher=huffington post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/10/canada-tar-sands-battle-europe_n_1505658.html[/tpl]
In 2014 results of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough. Report authors noted that, "emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR)." This study found that tailings ponds were an indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of evaporative emissions of three representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)s (phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) and that these emissions had been previously unreported.[tpl]cite report|title=Evaluating officially reported polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in the Athabasca oil sands region with a multimedia fate model|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)|first2=Frank |last2=Wania |first1=Abha |last1=Parajulee |date=February 3, 2014 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1319780111[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/university-of-toronto-researchers-share-oil-sands-study-results/article/370008|title=Op-Ed: University of Toronto researchers share oil sands study results|first=Grace C. |last=Visconti|date=23 February 2014|accessdate=24 February 2014|location=Scarborough, Ontario[/tpl]

===Air pollution management===

Since 1995, monitoring in the oil sands region shows improved or no change in long term air quality for the five key air quality pollutants – carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide – used to calculate the Air Quality Index.[tpl]cite web| url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01997.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111209190102/http://environment.alberta.ca/01997.html | archivedate=2011-12-09 | title=Air Quality and Oil sands – Alberta Environment | accessdate=21 March 2013 [/tpl]  Air monitoring has shown significant increases[tpl]when|date=February 2012[/tpl] in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide ([tpl]chem|H|2|S[/tpl]) both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders.[tpl]cite web | url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01997.html |publisher=Government of Alberta Environment and Water | title=Air Quality and the Oil Sands | accessdate=16 January 2012 [/tpl]
In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for hydrogen sulfide (formula [tpl]chem|H|2|S[/tpl]) exceeded standards.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://alberta.ca/acn/200712/22769EEFBE725-9D96-985A-E4143B1351544456.html |date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Government of Alberta | title=Province orders Suncor to address excessive H2S emissions [/tpl]

===Land use and waste management===

A large part of oil sands mining operations involves clearing trees and brush from a site and removing the overburden— topsoil, muskeg, sand, clay and gravel – that sits atop the oil sands deposit.  Approximately two tons of oil sands are needed to produce one barrel of oil (roughly 1/8 of a ton).  As a condition of licensing, projects are required to implement a reclamation plan.  The mining industry asserts that the boreal forest will eventually colonize the reclaimed lands, but their operations are massive and work on long-term timeframes. As of 2013, about [tpl]convert|715|km2[/tpl] of land in the oil sands region have been disturbed, and [tpl]cvt|72|km2[/tpl] of that land is under reclamation.  In March 2008, Alberta issued the first-ever oil sands land reclamation certificate to Syncrude for the [tpl]convert|1.04|km2[/tpl] parcel of land known as Gateway Hill approximately [tpl]convert|35|km[/tpl] north of Fort McMurray.[ref]

</ref>  Several reclamation certificate applications for oil sands projects are expected within the next 10&nbsp;years.<ref>

===Water management===

Between 2 to 4.5 volume units of water are used to produce each volume unit of synthetic crude oil in an ex-situ mining operation. According to Greenpeace, the Canadian oil sands operations use [tpl]convert|349|e6m3/a|abbr=on[/tpl] of water, twice the amount of water used by the city of Calgary. However, in SAGD operations, 90–95% of the water is recycled and only about 0.2 volume units of water is used per volume unit of bitumen produced.
For the Athabasca oil sand operations water is supplied from the Athabasca River, the ninth longest river in Canada.  The average flow just downstream of Fort McMurray is [tpl]convert|633|m3/s|abbr=on[/tpl] with its highest daily average measuring [tpl]convert|1200|m3/s|abbr=on[/tpl].  Oil sands industries water license allocations totals about 1.8% of the Athabasca river flow. Actual use in 2006 was about 0.4%.  In addition, according to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow.
In December 2010, the Oil Sands Advisory Panel, commissioned by former environment minister Jim Prentice, found that the system in place for monitoring water quality in the region, including work by the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program, the Alberta Water Research Institute, the Cumulative Environmental Management Association and others, was piecemeal and should become more comprehensive and coordinated.[tpl]cite web|title=A Foundation for the Future: Building an Environmental Monitoring System for the Oil Sands|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/pollution/default.asp?lang=En&n=E9ABC93B-1#s2c|work=Monitoring Organizations in the Oil Sands Area|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl]

===Greenhouse gas emissions===

The production of bitumen and synthetic crude oil emits more greenhouse gases than the production of conventional crude oil. A 2009 study by the consulting firm IHS CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits "about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the
"well-to-wheels" (WTW) lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil." Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from the petroleum production.
A Stanford University study commissioned by the EU in 2011 found that oil sands crude was as much as 22% more carbon intensive than other fuels.[tpl]cite news|last=Lewis |first=Barbara |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/10/us-oil-sands-idUSBRE8490OL20120510 |title=Insight: Canada's oil sand battle with Europe | Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= 10 May 2012|accessdate=2013-08-27[/tpl]https://circabc.europa.eu/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/db806977-6418-44db-a464-20267139b34d/Brandt_Oil_Sands_GHGs_Final.pdf
Greenpeace says the oil sands industry has been identified as the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Canada, as it accounts for 40 million tons of [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] emissions per year.
According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Environment Canada the industrial activity undertaken to produce oil sands make up about 5% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, or 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It predicts the oil sands will grow to make up 8% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2015.  While the production industrial activity emissions per barrel of bitumen produced decreased 26% over the decade 1992–2002, total emissions from production activity were expected to increase due to higher production levels.[ref]

[/ref]  As of 2006, to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands released almost [tpl]convert|75|kg[/tpl] of greenhouse gases with total emissions estimated to be [tpl]convert|67|Mt|lk=on[/tpl] per year by 2015.  A study by IHS CERA found that fuels made from Canadian oil sands resulted in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than many commonly cited estimates. A 2012 study by Swart and Weaver estimated that if only the economically viable reserve of [tpl]convert|170|Goilbbl|adj=on|abbr=on[/tpl] oil sands was burnt, the global mean temperature would increase by 0.02 to 0.05 °C. If the entire oil-in-place of 1.8 trillion barrels were to be burnt, the predicted global mean temperature increase is 0.24 to 0.50 °C.[tpl]Cite journal |title=The Alberta oil sands and climate |author=Neil C.

To offset greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands and elsewhere in Alberta, sequestering carbon dioxide emissions inside depleted oil and gas reservoirs has been proposed. This technology is inherited from enhanced oil recovery methods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/CCS_Implementation.pdf |title=Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Implementation in Alberta, Final Report |format=PDF |publisher=Alberta Carbon Capture and Storage Development Council |date=24 July 2009[/tpl]  In July 2008, the Alberta government announced a C$2 billion fund to support sequestration projects in Alberta power plants and oil sands extraction and upgrading facilities.

===Aquatic life deformities===

There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands.  David W. Schindler, a limnologist from the University of Alberta, co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of aromatic polycyclic compounds, some of which are known carcinogens, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries.  Scientists, local doctors, and residents supported a letter sent to the Prime Minister in September 2010 calling for an independent study of Lake Athabasca (which is downstream of the oil sands) to be initiated due to the rise of deformities and tumors found in fish caught there.
The bulk of the research that defends the oil sands development is done by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP). RAMP studies show that deformity rates are normal compared to historical data and the deformity rates in rivers upstream of the oil sands.

===Public health impacts===

In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of arsenic in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2007/04/03/game-alberta.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Mixed reports on safety of eating northern Alberta game | date=3 April 2007[/tpl]
Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of cancer among residents of Fort Chipewyan.[tpl]cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE51568020090206 | work=Reuters | title=High cancer rates confirmed near Canada's oil sands | date=6 February 2009[/tpl] However, John O'Connor, the doctor who initially reported the higher cancer rates and linked them to the tar sands development, was subsequently investigated by the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. The College later reported that the O'Connor's statements consisted of "mistruths, inaccuracies and unconfirmed information."
In 2010, the Royal Society of Canada released a report stating that "there is currently no credible evidence of environmental contaminant exposures from oil sands reaching Fort Chipewyan at levels expected to cause elevated human cancer rates."
In August 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study to examine whether a link exists between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands emissions.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/08/19/edm-cancer-oilsands-fort-chipewyan-study.html | work=CBC News | title=Cancer rates downstream from oil sands to be probed | date=19 August 2011 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
In a report released in 2014, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. James Talbot, stated that "There isn’t strong evidence for an association between any of these cancers and environmental exposure tar sands." Rather, Talbot suggested that the cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan, which were slightly higher compared with the provincial average, were likely due to a combination of factors such as high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism as well as poor levels of vaccination."Oil sands foes ignore the facts as cancer claims dealt a blow by study by Claudia Cattaneo, Financial Post, March 24, 2014.
