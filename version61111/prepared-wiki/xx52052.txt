The "Marching Song" ([tpl]lang-vi|Tiến Quân Ca[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-vi|tjə̌n kwən kaː|pron[/tpl]), also known as the "Army March" and the "Song of Advancing Soldiers", is the national anthem of Vietnam, both written and composed by Văn Cao in 1944. The "Marching Song" was adopted as the national anthem of North Vietnam in 1945, and was adopted as the national anthem of the new Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976, following the reunification of both North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War.

==History==

The "Marching Song" was both written and composed by Văn Cao in 1944, and was adopted as the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945, and throughout the Vietnam War. 
When Vietnam was unified following the end of the Vietnam War, the "Marching Song" became the national anthem of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976. During the wars there was a movement to replace the national anthem of Vietnam as the "Marching Song" was deemed outdated, but no reasonable alternative ever materialized.

==Usage==

Although the "Song of Advancing Soldiers" consists of two verses, only the first is recognized and used as the official anthem of Vietnam.
