At the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a "City Beautiful" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize), the central Post Office (now Polk County Administrative Building with a newer addition attached), and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.
The ornate riverfront balustrade that still line the Des Moines and Raccoon River were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s. The ornamental fountains that once stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a post-industrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s.Dahl, Orin L. (1978) Des Moines: Capital City: A Pictorial and Entertaining Commentary on the Growth and Development of Des Moines, Iowa. Continental Heritage, Tulsa.Gardiner, Allen (2004) Des Moines: A History in Pictures. Heritage Media, San Marcos, California. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.
In 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. This form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, and further changed in 1967 so that four of the seven city council members were elected by ward rather than at-large. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960). The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009.[tpl]cite web|publisher=United States Census Bureau|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Iowa: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls|format=XLS|accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl] However, the growth of the outlying suburbs has been a constant and the overall metro area population is over 560,000 today.
During the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood stage levels.  The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993 leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach.[tpl]cite news | title= Flood-Ravaged Iowa Scrambles to Mend Levees, Protect Water Supplies and Salvage Homes | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,367004,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel | date= June 14, 2008 | accessdate= September 12, 2009[/tpl]  The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir, but in both 1993 and 2008 the river overtopped the reservoir spillway.
Today, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented "The Tomorrow Plan", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally planning growth and resource consumption to manage the local population.

==Cityscape==

The skyline of Des Moines changed during the 1970s and 1980s as several new skyscrapers were built. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985), Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand (1991), and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building (1997).
This time period also saw the opening of the Des Moines Performing Arts (1979) which hosts Broadway shows and special events, the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979) which is a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river, the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk system also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is [tpl]convert|4|mi[/tpl] long and connects many downtown buildings.Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau. Seedesmoines.com (1998-07-21). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The city is in the midst of major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005, while the new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.
The World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011.  The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Dr. Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.
In 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a "civic garden" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.

==Museums==

==Government==

Des Moines currently operates under a council-manager form of government. The council consists of a mayor (who, as of 2014, is Frank Cownie) and is elected in citywide vote, two at-large members, and four members representing each of the city's four wards.
A plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The consolidated city-county government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would have still retained its individual government but had the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, many city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.

==Transportation==

Des Moines has an extensive skywalk system within its downtown core. With over four miles of enclosed walkway, it is one of the largest of such systems in the United States. The Des Moines Skywalk System has been criticised for hurting street-level business, though a recent initiative has been made to make street-level Skywalk entrances more visible.
Interstate 235 cuts through the city, and Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 both pass through the Des Moines metropolitan area. On the northern side of the Des Moines metropolitan area, Interstates 35 and 80 converge into a long concurrency while Interstate 235 takes a direct route through Des Moines, Windsor Heights, and West Des Moines before meeting up with Interstates 35 and 80 on the western edge of the metro.
Des Moines' freeway design makes it easy for travelers. A motorist who misses an exit at the interstate
"mixmasters" at the eastern and western edges of the metro eventually ends up at the convergence of the same interstates at the opposite side of the metro. These Interstates include I-35, I-80, and I-235. I-235, which takes the brunt of most congestion, is six lanes throughout the entire length and expands to eight and ten lanes near the downtown area. The remainder of traffic congestion in the area occurs near the Northeast and West Mixmasters on either side of Des Moines. Interstate 35 south of the West Mixmaster is currently being widened to six lanes all the way to the IA 5 bypass interchanges.
Due to increasing traffic congestion and prevalence of accidents along Interstate 235, the city of Des Moines implemented a speeding camera program to curb excessive speeding through the most densely populated parts of Greater Des Moines. The northeast Mixmaster has also undergone a redesign with wider lanes and redesign of bridges allowing easier traffic flow in all directions along Interstates 35, 80, and 235. U.S. Highway 65 and Iowa Highway 5 form a freeway loop to the east and south of the city, providing an alternative route around the metropolitan area. U.S. Highways 6 and 69 and Iowa Highways 28, 141, 163, and 415 are also important routes to and within the city.
There have been proposals to convert Iowa Highway 5 and U.S. Highway 65 into what would be renamed Interstate 335, giving the Des Moines Metropolitan Area an interstate running from the northeast suburb of Altoona to the southeastern suburb of Carlisle and then connect with Interstate 35 in the southern part of West Des Moines.[tpl]cite web|title=New Interstate 335 Coming to DM Area?|url=http://www.kcci.com/automotive/27825552/detail.html|publisher=KCCI News Channel 8|accessdate=May 9, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Des Moines's public transit system, operated by DART (Des Moines Area Regional Transit), which was the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority until October 2006, consists entirely of buses, including regular in-city routes and express and commuter buses to outlying suburban areas. A light rail tram system has been proposed, but is years away and dependent on finding funding.
Burlington Trailways, Jefferson Lines, and Megabus run long-distance, inter-city bus routes through Des Moines. The nearest Amtrak train station is in Osceola, about [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] south of Des Moines. Trains on the route that passes through Osceola, the California Zephyr, go east to Chicago, Illinois, and west to Emeryville, California.
The Des Moines International Airport (DSM), located in the southern part of Des Moines, on Fleur Drive, offers nonstop service to destinations within the United States. Currently the only international service is cargo service, but there have been discussions about adding an international terminal.
