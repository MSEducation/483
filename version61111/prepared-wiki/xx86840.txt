 a translation by  P. Fleury Mottelay of William Gilbert (1600) ''Die Magnete'', London</ref>   The '''pith-ball electroscope''' and the '''gold-leaf electroscope''' are two classical types of electroscope that are still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of [[electrostatics]].  A type of electroscope is also used in the [[quartz fiber radiation dosimeter]]. Electroscopes were used by the Austrian scientist [[Victor Hess]] in the discovery of [[cosmic rays]].
Electroscopes detect electric charge by the motion of a test object due to the Coulomb electrostatic force.  The electric potential or voltage of an object equals its charge divided by its capacitance, so electroscopes can be regarded as crude voltmeters.  The accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of volts, so electroscopes are only used with high voltage sources such as static electricity and electrostatic machines.  Electroscopes generally give only a rough, qualitative indication of the magnitude of the charge; an instrument that measures charge quantitatively is called an electrometer.
