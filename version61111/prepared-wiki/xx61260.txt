[[Bushland]]

CATEGORIES: Natural history of Australia

Bushland is land which supports remnant vegetation or land which is disturbed but still retains a predominance of the original floristics and structure.[tpl]cite book |title=Dictionary for Managing Trees in Urban Environments |year=2009 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=0643096078 |page=23 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=uRGc9tb_gFcC |accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl]  Bushland is the term commonly used by conservation protection groups and other environmental groups as a blanket term for natural vegetation, which may cover any kind of habitat from open shrubby country with few trees, to tall closed forests.

Human survival in bushland has a whole mythology evolving around it, with the legendary stories of Aboriginal trackers and bushrangers deeply entrenched in Australian folklore. Bushland has been a traditional source of wood for fuel and bushfood.[tpl]cite book |title=The Future is an Ancient Lake: Traditional Knowledge, Biodiversity and Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in Lake Chad Basin Ecosystems |last=Batello|first=Caterina |coauthors=Adamou Harouna Tour√©, Peter Ervin Kenmore |year=2004 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |isbn=9251050643 |page=166 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=P1lNboNEnQ0C |accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl]
Bushland provides a number of ecosystem services including the protection of water quality, stopping erosion, acting as a windbreak, and trapping nutrients.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lakemac.com.au/downloads/Fact%20Sheet%207%20-%20Managing%20our%20Bushland.pdf |title=Fact Sheet 7: Managing our Bushland |publisher=Lake Macquarie City Council |accessdate=6 October 2013 [/tpl] 
Bushland is prone to bushfires.  This presents a challenge to authorities as infrastructure and habitations encroach into bushland areas.[tpl]cite book |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |last=Bowman |first=David |editor1-first=Cary |editor1-last=Geoffrey |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Lindenmayer |editor3-first=Stephen |editor3-last=Dovers  |year=2003 |chapter=Bushfires: A Darwinian Perspective |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=0643098542 |page=11 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mrkmBI1liKoC |accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl]

==Preservation==

Until recently Australia had a very high rate of land clearing which resulted in the destruction of bushland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/media-releases/bio-bites-life-support-02-10-05.html |title=Bushland On Life Support |date=4 November 2002 |work=Media Release |publisher=Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research and Australian National Herbarium |accessdate=6 October 2013 [/tpl] Since 2006 the rate of land clearing has declined significantly.  This is partially attributed to legislation which placed a ban on broadscale clearing of mature bushland in Queensland in 2006 and an expansion of those bans to regrowing bushland with a high conservation value in 2009.[ref]
