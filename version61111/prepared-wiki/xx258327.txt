Zoe is a troubled teenage tearaway . She has enough of children's care homes and runs away, living on the streets with her boyfriend Liam Shepherd. The character first appears in an amusement arcade where Judy Mallett works. Liam causes trouble and one day when Judy's husband Gary is there, he throws the teenager out but then he decides to blackmail the Malletts for a substantial amount of money, threatening to go to the police. The real reason for wanting the money is because Zoe is pregnant with his baby.
Judy, struggling with her own fertility issues, offers Zoe £2,000 for her baby. Zoe is overwhelmed and though Gary objects to the plan, Zoe accepts the offer. The neighbours assume that Gary is the baby's father and Judy allows them to think that, deciding it would help matters if anyone asked why they had the baby. Zoe soon makes friends with new neighbour Leanne Battersby and confesses the real story, including the payment.
The baby arrives and Judy is anxious to get rid of Zoe, who is showing signs of bonding with little Katy Joyce. Gary fraudulently signs the birth certificate as the father and Judy settles in to new motherhood with Zoe resentfully looking on in the background. After the health visitor’s first visit, Zoe is persuaded to leave but it's not long before Leanne tells Nick Tilsley the truth and the gossips speculate wildly. The Mallets claim Zoe stole the money and ran off. Leanne finds Zoe and persuades her to come back and clear her name.
Meanwhile, Ashley Peacock, working in the corner shop, develops feelings for Zoe. Finally, after the christening, Gary and Judy are so worried about Zoe’s presence that they plan to leave Weatherfield but Zoe snatches her baby with Ashley’s help, renaming her Shannon. Zoe and Shannon move in with Ashley, Leanne and Nick and live together for a while until Shannon is rushed to hospital with meningitis and dies. Zoe is devastated and has a breakdown, lashing out at her friends and neighbours, which results in her being sectioned for a period of time. During this time, Ashley realizes that though he loves Zoe, he cannot give her what she needs. He can’t bring himself to finish with her, however, and when she is released from hospital, she comes back to live with him.
Zoe meets a couple while out clubbing, Ben and Ruth. Ruth becomes her new best friend very quickly, making Ashley suspicious. They get Zoe a job at their “Foundation” and convince her to sell new age crystals on the street and door to door, all the while telling her about their beliefs and working on her grief for her baby. She is soon convinced that theirs is the road to salvation and becomes deeply involved in the Cult of Nirab. Despite his efforts, Ashley realises that Zoe has to make her own decisions. She needs a new start, wants to have a baby for the Foundation and leaves with Ben and Ruth in December 1998 and is never seen again.
