Djurgårdens Idrottsförening, usually shortened as Djurgårdens IF – commonly known as Djurgården ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˈjʉːr.ˈɡoːɖɛn|[/tpl] or informally Djurgår'n [tpl]IPA-sv|ˈjʉː(r)ɡɔɳ|[/tpl]); abbreviated as DIF ([tpl]IPA-sv|diːf|[/tpl]) – is a Swedish sports club with several departments, located in Stockholm.

==History==

The club was founded in 1891 by a group of young athletes living on the royal island Djurgården in central Stockholm. With an original focus on winter sports and athletics, the club quickly branched into other sports, becoming one of Sweden's most successful sports clubs of the 20th and 21st century.[tpl]cite book|title=Nationalencyklopedin, vol. 5 DIO-ET|page=50|language=Swedish|publisher=Bokförlaget Bra Böcker|location=Höganäs|isbn=91-7024-619-X|date=1991[/tpl] The club started playing association football in 1899 and soon started a derby rivalry with neighbouring club AIK,[tpl]cite book|last=Cederquist|first=Jonas|title=Stockholms fotbollshistoria 1880–2010|publisher=Stockholmia förlag|series=Monografier utgivna av Stockholms stad #210|date=2010|location=Stockholm|page=23[/tpl] the so called tvillingderbyt.
Today the most popular sections are ice hockey and football, with 16 and 11 Swedish national championship titles respectively. Other popular sections are bandy, handball and floorball. The club has won 418 Swedish championships through 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Bengtsson|first=Janne|coauthors=|title=Dif glänser i slaget om titlarna|pages=|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=2004-02-24|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/sport/did_6957077.asp|accessdate=2007-04-05[/tpl]

==Logo and colours==

The first logo of the club was a four pointed silver star in saltire, which had a shield on it with the letters DIF. This star pre-dates the similar star which Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna adopted and is using to this day. The present logo in the form of a shield in yellow, red and blue with the text D.I.F. was adopted in 1896. According to an often quoted poem by Johan af Klercker from 1908, blue and yellow stand for Sweden and red stands for love. Blue and yellow are also the colours of Stockholm.
Yellow, red and blue are the club colours. The logo is registered as a trademark and the colours are set to Pantone, CMYK and web colour values.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alliansen.dif.se/varumarket/|title=Varumärket|publisher=Djurgårdens IF|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://dif.se/om-dif/|title=Om DIF|publisher=Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl] In many sports – among them football, bandy and handball – the home jersey of the team is vertically striped in light and dark blue. Because of this, blue is usually seen as the most important of the three colours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://difshop.se|title=Djurgården Fotboll – Officiell webshop|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] The ice hockey team uses jerseys in one blue shade with yellow and red details.[tpl]cite web|url=http://shop.difhockey.se/matchtrojor-c-150-1.aspx|title=Matchtröjor|publisher=Djurgårdens IF Hockey|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl]

==Fans and fan culture==

While the club has a considerable fan base all over Sweden, the strongest concentration of Djurgården fans is found in the affluent urban districts of Östermalm and Vasastan (eastern and northern parts of the inner city) and in many of the suburbs of the nation's capital.  In 1981 the main supporter club "Blue Saints" was formed, but due to its notorious fans and their bad reputation, the supporter club changed its name to Järnkaminerna, literally "The Iron Furnices" (an old nickname for Djurgården from the 1950s).  Since 2005, Fabriken is Djurgården's TIFO group; they have two ultras groups: UCS (Ultra caos Stockholm) and Ultras Sthlm.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

Through the years, many types of souvenirs and memorabilia has been made for the club.  Stuffed toys in the form of a rabbit called Järnkanin ("Iron Rabbit") are sold, the name a pun on the word Järnkamin.  
===Club beers=== 
[tpl]anchor|Alberget 4A[/tpl]A couple of beers have been created over the years.  At present, Alberget 4A is sold for Djurgårdens IF.  It is named for the address of the café where the club was founded.  The beer was launched in 2013 and is sold through Djurgårdshjälpen, a supporter initiative to raise money for the sports club.  Originally, the beer was called Alltid oavsett[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/shl/djurgarden/article17415141.ab| title=Snart finns Djurgården – på Systembolaget|language=Swedish| publisher=Aftonbladet| author=Linus Norberg| date=5 September 2013| accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] ("always, no matter what"), which is a slogan often used by supporters of Djurgårdens IF.  The beer is a pale lager of 5.0% abv made by Grebbestad Bryggeri on behalf of Djurgårdshjälpen and is not part of Grebbestad Bryggeri's own range of beers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.djurgardshjalpen.com/index.php/olen|title=Ölen|publisher=Djurgårdshjälpen|accessdate=22 April 2014[/tpl]
