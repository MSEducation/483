CATEGORIES: Uniform polyhedra, Archimedean solids

In geometry, the truncated cube, or truncated hexahedron, is an Archimedean solid. It has 14 regular faces (6 octagonal and 8 triangular), 36 edges, and 24 vertices.

==Area and volume==

The area A and the volume V of a truncated cube of edge length a are:

==Orthogonal projections==

The truncated cube has five special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: triangles, and octagons. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes.

==Cartesian coordinates==

The following Cartesian coordinates define the vertices of a truncated hexahedron centered at the origin with edge length 2Î¾:

==Vertex arrangement==

It shares the vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra:

==Related polyhedra==

The truncated cube is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform truncated polyhedra with vertex configurations (3.2n.2n), and n,3 Coxeter group symmetry.
It is topologically related to a series of polyhedra and tilings with face configuration Vn.8.8.

===Alternated truncation===

A cube can be alternately truncated producing tetrahedral symmetry, with six hexagonal faces, and four triangles at the truncated vertices. It is one of a sequence of alternate truncations of polyhedra and tiling.

==Related polytopes==

The truncated cube, is second in a sequence of truncated hypercubes:
