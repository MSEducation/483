==Writing & Recording==

I wrote the whole thing and honestly I wrote it about this whole experience, this breakup and the two years I was in a mess. Just being able to write was amazing. My label sent me away to Los Angeles and said, ‘Don’t come back until you’re done writing a whole album.’ So it was great just to get away. And there wasn’t much collaboration; most of the producers were friends of mine in Los Angeles."[tpl]Cite web|url = http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/music/features/new-danny-fernandes-single-spotlights-fame%E2%80%99s-grisly-downside|title = New Danny Fernandes single spotlights fame’s grisly downside|accessdate = August 12, 2013|publisher = MSN Entertainment Canada|first = Kim|last = Hughes|date = April 5, 2013[/tpl] Fernandes co-wrote and wrote all of the songs on the album. He said of the album's overall vibe: "There's really not any 'happy' songs on the album. I went through a lot in the last four years, I just thought I'd put it all on this record."[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.680news.com/2013/03/27/video-danny-fernandes/|title = Video: Danny Fernandes|date = March 27, 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2013|last = Blair|first = Rudy[/tpl]
