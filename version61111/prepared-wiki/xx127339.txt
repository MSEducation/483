==History==

Near the modern village of Lupfig was the source of a Roman aqueduct leading to the camp of Vindonissa.  Additionally, Alamanni graves have been discovered near the village.  The modern village of Lupfig is first mentioned about 1273 as Lupfanch.
The village was part of the Habsburgs core possessions ([tpl]lang-de|Eigenamt[/tpl]) and is near Habsburg Castle.  In the 14th Century, the rights to the low justice and property in the village went to Königsfelden Abbey.  When the abbey was dissolved, the property went to the city of Bern.  The municipality has owned a tavern since at least 1628.
Until 1526 it was part of the Windisch parish, then it went to the Birr parish and in 1715 Lupfig had its own parsonage.  Since 1966 the village has had a Catholic chapel of ease.
While agriculture was the main economic force, starting in the middle 18th Century home cotton production provided another source of income.  In the 19th Century two other industries came to Lupfig, straw goods manufacturing and stone cutting (from about 1880 until 1940) for the watch industry.  In 1936, the regional airport was opened at Birrfeld.  Due to good transportation links (A1 and A3 motorways and the Swiss Federal Railways Gotthard line) since the 1950s the village has become an industry and distribution center.  In the 1980s new residential buildings were built in Lupfig to house the growing number of commuters.
