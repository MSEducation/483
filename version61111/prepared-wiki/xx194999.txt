[[Barakoni wine]]

CATEGORIES: Georgian wine

Barakoni ([tpl]lang-ka|ბარაკონი[/tpl]) red wine is grown on the steep slopes of the Rioni gorge in the mountainous western region of Racha (modern-day Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti) in Georgia. This wine, made from Alexandreuli and Mudzhuretuli grapes (the same grapes from which Khvanchkara is made), is naturally semi-dry.  Barakoni contains 10-12% alcohol, 1.5-2.5% sugar and has 5-7% titrated acidity.
Produced since 1981, Barakoni wine is named after the Georgian Orthodox Barakoni Church of the Mother of God (Georgian: ბარაკონის ღვთისმშობლის ტაძარი), commonly known as Barakoni (ბარაკონი). It is an important surviving example of the medieval tradition of Georgian architecture.
