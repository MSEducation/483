[tpl]Nihongo|Gaara|我愛羅[/tpl] is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Kishimoto designed Gaara as a foil to the series' titular character, Naruto Uzumaki, as the two were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities as they deal with their troubled upbringing. Initially introduced as an antagonist, Gaara is a ninja affiliated with Sunagakure, and is the son of Sunagakure's leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born a demon's host as part of his father's intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. It is only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki that Gaara gains a change of perspective as he eventually becomes Sunagakure's Fifth Kazekage and gains acceptance by his people.
Gaara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including two of the featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and several video games. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Gaara's character. IGN labeled the disparity between Naruto and Gaara as "emotional" and "a tad creepy". Anime News Network called Naruto's fight against Gaara the high point of the entire series. Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls, and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains and action figures.

==Creation and conception==

Naruto author Masashi Kishimoto created Gaara as a foil to the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. He and Naruto have a similar background: he was rejected by his peers and fellow villagers for being the host of a tailed beast, Shukaku, a situation that Kishimoto describes as "very much like Naruto's". Gaara's development from this state into a highly withdrawn, sadistic character was intended to induce sympathy for him from readers, as it was contrasted against Naruto's development into a cheerful troublemaker.[tpl]cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=142[/tpl] Additionally, his design was designed to look like the Tanuki since Kishimoto thought that it would make him a good rival for Naruto's Nine-tailed Demon Fox since several parts from the Shukaku were considered by Kishimoto to be opposite ones from the Demon Fox.[tpl]cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=NARUTO|year=2009 |publisher=Shueisha |page=98 |isbn=978-4-08-874823-8[/tpl] Gaara's backstory became one of Kishimoto's favorite stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters in as he wanted readers to understand more Gaara's mental state.[tpl]cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=NARUTO―ナルト―［秘伝・闘の書］|year=2005 |publisher=Shueisha |pages=310–311 |isbn=4-08-873734-2[/tpl]
Gaara's initial attire, along with the costumes of his siblings, was difficult for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave the three of them simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings.[tpl]cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=127[/tpl]
