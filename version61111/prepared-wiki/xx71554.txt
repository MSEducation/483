[[Senior Minister]]

CATEGORIES: Government ministers of Singapore

Senior Minister (abbreviation: SM) is a political office in the Cabinet of Singapore. It is taken by a retired Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister. This, however, implies a reliance on a dominant-party system, and several opposition critics find this as evidence for contempt for the political opposition in Singapore.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Currently, this political post has been renamed as Emeritus Senior Minister (since May 2011), which is a new political post being taken by Singapore's second Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
The position of Senior Minister has only been held by four persons -- Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, who were the first and second Prime Ministers of Singapore respectively; and S. Rajaratnam and S. Jayakumar, who served as Deputy Prime Ministers. Lee Kuan Yew was Senior Minister from 1990 to 2004, after which he became Minister Mentor in the Cabinet of Singapore's third Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Goh Chok Tong replaced Lee Kuan Yew as Senior Minister in Lee Hsien Loong's Cabinet. On 26 March 2009, Lee Hsien Loong announced that S. Jayakumar would relinquish his post as Deputy Prime Minister and be appointed Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.
S. Rajaratnam retired from political office in 1988 and died in 2006. S. Jayakumar retired from politics prior to the 2011 General Elections. Seven days after the elections, on 14 May 2011, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew announced their retirement from the Cabinet.[ref]
