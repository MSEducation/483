[[Outline of software engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Outlines, Software engineering, Computing-related lists

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to software engineering:
Software engineering – application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is the application of engineering to software.[tpl]cite book | editors = Pierre Bourque and Robert Dupuis |   title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge - 2004 Version | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | year = 2004 | pages = 1–1 | isbn = 0-7695-2330-7 | url = http://www.swebok.org[/tpl]

==Technologies and practices==

Skilled software engineers use technologies and practices from a variety of fields to improve their productivity in creating software and to improve the quality of the delivered product.

===Software applications===

Software engineers build software (applications, operating systems, system software) that people use.
Applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways. For example, consumer software emphasizes low cost, medical software emphasizes high quality, and Internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development.

===Software engineering topics===

Many technologies and practices are (mostly) confined to software engineering,
though many of these are shared with computer science.

====Programming paradigm, based on a programming language technology====

====Databases====

====Graphical user interfaces====

====Programming tools====

====Libraries====

====Design languages====

====Patterns, document many common programming and project management techniques====

====Processes and methodologies====

====Platforms====

A platform combines computer hardware and an operating system. As platforms grow more powerful and less costly, applications and tools grow more widely available.

====Other Practices====

====Other tools====

===Computer science topics===

Skilled software engineers know a lot of computer science including what is possible and impossible, and what is easy and hard for software.

===Mathematics topics===

Discrete mathematics is a key foundation of software engineering.
Other

===Life cycle phases===

===Deliverables===

Deliverables must be developed for many SE projects. Software engineers rarely make all of these deliverables themselves. They usually cooperate with the writers, trainers, installers, marketers, technical support people, and others who make many of these deliverables.

===Business roles===

===Management topics===

===Business topics===

==Software engineering profession==

==History of software engineering==

===Pioneers===

Many people made important contributions to SE technologies, practices, or applications.
