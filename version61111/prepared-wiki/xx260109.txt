The Globe KD5G was an American target drone produced by Globe Aircraft Corporation that began development in 1949. 
"The XKD5G-1 was an early pulsejet-powered U.S. Navy target drone. The pulsejet was mounted externally, as on the German V-1 missile of World War II, but was smaller. The drone could fly 540 kilometers (335 miles) per hour and could be recovered by parachute for reuse."
"The XK5DG-1 originated in 1949 and was tested at the Naval Air Test Center, Point Mugu, California. By 1951-52, speed requirements for drones had increased, and pulsejets were not effective beyond an altitude of 9,144 meters (30,000 feet). Thus, further development of the XKD5G-1 was abandoned. The XKD5G-1 was one of the last uses of pulsejets by the U.S. military."
