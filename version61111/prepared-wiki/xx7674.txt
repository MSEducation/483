Microsoft Office is an office suite of desktop applications, servers and services for the Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems. It was first announced by Bill Gates of Microsoft on August 1, 1988 at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.
On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft’s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=Softpedia |publisher=SoftNews |date=10 July 2012[/tpl]

==Components==

===Word===

Microsoft Word is a word processor and was previously considered the main program in Office. Its proprietary DOC format is considered a de facto standard, although Word 2007 can also use a new XML-based, Microsoft Office-optimized format called .DOCX, which has been standardized by Ecma International as Office Open XML, and its SP2 update supports PDF and a limited ODF.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx | title= Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office | publisher=Microsoft | date= May 21, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] Word is also available in some editions of Microsoft Works. It is available for the Windows and OS X platforms. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and had the distinction of introducing the mouse to a broad population. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer WYSIWYG features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word.

===Excel===

Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that originally competed with the dominant Lotus 1-2-3, and eventually outsold it. It is available for the Windows and OS X platforms. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac OS in 1985, and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac and bundled with a standalone Windows run-time environment) in November 1987. It provided more functionality than the previous version

===Outlook===

Microsoft Outlook (not to be confused with Outlook Express) is a personal information manager and e-mail communication software. The replacement for Windows Messaging, Microsoft Mail, and Schedule+ starting in Office 97, it includes an e-mail client, calendar, task manager and address book.
On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with Microsoft Exchange Server. In Office 2001, it introduced an alternative application with a slightly different feature set called Microsoft Entourage. It reintroduced Outlook in Office 2011, replacing Entourage.[tpl]cite web |last=Fried |first=Ina |title=Next Mac Office, due by 2010's end, gets Outlook |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10308997-56.html | work=CNET News |publisher=CBS Interactive | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=August 28, 2009[/tpl]

===OneNote===

Microsoft OneNote is a note-taking and free-form information gathering program, used with both tablet and conventional PCs. It gathers users' notes (handwritten or typed), drawings, screen clippings and audio commentaries. Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the Internet or a network. OneNote was initially introduced as an optional that was not included in any of Microsoft Office 2003 editions. However, OneNote eventually became a core component of Microsoft Office; with the release of Microsoft Office 2013, OneNote was included in all Microsoft Office offerings. OneNote is available as a freeware web application on Office Online, as a Windows desktop app, as a mobile app for Windows Phone,  iOS, Android, and Symbians, and as a Metro-style app for Windows 8 or later.

===PowerPoint===

Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program for Windows and OS X. It is used to create slideshows, composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides.

===Other desktop applications===

Other desktop applications included in Microsoft Office suite include:
The following applications are no longer part of Microsoft Office family:

===Server applications===

===Web services===

==Common features==

Most versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own widget set and do not exactly match the native  operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard menus were replaced with a colored flat looking, shadowed menu style. The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. For example, the toolbar, colored buttons and the gray-colored '3D' look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95, and the ribbon, introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several programs bundled with Windows 7 and later.
Users of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in "Office Data Connection" (.odc) files.[tpl]cite book|last=DeMarco|first=Jim|authorlink=|title=Pro Excel 2007 VBA|date=2008-02-01|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-59059-957-0|page=361|quote= External data is accessed through a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file (.odc)[/tpl]
Both Windows and Office use service Packs to update software. Office had non-cumulative service releases, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1.
Past versions of Office often contained Easter eggs. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator. Office XP and later do not have any Easter eggs, in compliance with Trustworthy Computing guidelines.

==File formats and metadata==

Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE Compound File Binary Format.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft Office File Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313118.aspx|work=MSDN Library|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl] This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.[tpl]cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html | title=We Can Put an End to Word Attachments | last=Stallman | first = Richard M. | publisher=Free Software Foundation | date=2002, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the Open Specification Promise.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx | title=Microsoft Office Binary (doc, xls, ppt) File Formats documentation | publisher=Microsoft | date=February 15, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] Previously, Microsoft had supplied such documentation freely but only on request.
Starting with Office 2007, the default file format has been a version of Office Open XML, though different than the one standardized and published by Ecma International and by ISO/IEC. Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/ | title=Microsoft Open Specification Promise | publisher= Microsoft | date=February 1, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&displaylang=en | title=Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats | work=Microsoft Download Center | date=January 6, 2010 | accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl] and Office 2004 for OS X. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Windows platform (LibreOffice, all platforms), OS X platform (iWork '08, LibreOffice) and Linux (LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org 3.0). In addition, Office 2010 and Service Pack 2 for Office 2007 supports the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents.
Microsoft provides the ability to remove metadata from Office documents. This was in response to highly publicized incidents where sensitive data about a document was leaked via its metadata.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/02/microsoft_releases_metadata_removal_tool/ | title=Microsoft releases metadata removal tool | first=Jan | last=Libbenga | work=The Register | date=February 2, 2004 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] Metadata removal was first available in 2004, when Microsoft released a tool called Remove Hidden Data Add-in for Office 2003/XP for this purpose.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=144E54ED-D43E-42CA-BC7B-5446D34E5360&displaylang=en | title=Microsoft Download Center: Office 2003/XP Add-in: Remove Hidden Data | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 8, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] It was directly integrated into Office 2007 in a feature called the Document Inspector.

==Extensibility==

A major feature of the Office suite is the ability for users and third party companies to write add-ins (plug-ins) that extend the capabilities of an application by adding custom commands and specialized features. One of the new features is the Office Store.[tpl]cite web|first=Julie |last=Bort |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-office-2013-app-store-2012-8 |title=Microsoft Shows Off A New App Store For Office 2013 |work=Business Insider |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] Plugins and other tools can be downloaded by users.[tpl]cite web|first=Mark |last=Hachman |url=http://readwrite.com/2013/01/29/inside-the-new-microsoft-office-app-store-one-developers-story |title=Inside The New Microsoft Office App Store: One Developer's Story |work=small-biz |publisher=ReadWrite |date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] Developers can make money by selling their applications in the Office Store. The revenue is divided between the developer and Microsoft where developer gets 80% of the money.[tpl]cite web|first=Pete |last=Pachal |url=http://mashable.com/2012/08/07/office-2013-apps/ |title=Yes, Even Microsoft Office Has Apps Now |work=Mashable |date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] Developers are able to share applications with all Office users (who Microsoft says number at 1 billion).
One such example of Office app is a heat map for Excel. The app travels with the document, and it's up to the developer what the recipient will see when they open it. They'll either have the option to download the app from the Office Store for free, start a free trial or be directed to payment.
With Office's cloud abilities, IT department can create a set of apps for their business employees.[tpl]cite web|last=Murph |first=Darren |url=http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/06/microsoft-office-store-app-catalog-downloads-now-open-available/ |title=Microsoft's Office Store now open for business, productivity-boosting apps just a click away |work=Engadget |publisher=Aol |date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] When employees go to the Office Store, they'll see their company's apps under My Organization. The apps that employees have personally downloaded will appear under My Apps. Developers can use web technologies like HTML5, XML, CSS3, JavaScript, and APIs for building the apps.[tpl]cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/apps/jj220082%28v=office.15%29#StartBuildingApps_WhatIsApp |title=Overview of apps for Office |work=MSDN |publisher=Microsoft |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl]
An application for Office is a webpage that is hosted inside an Office client application. User can use apps to amplify the functionality of a document, email message, meeting request, or appointment. Apps can run in multiple environments and by multiple clients, including rich Office desktop clients, Office Web Apps, mobile browsers, and also on-premises and in the cloud. The type of add-ins supported differ by Office versions:

==Versions available==

===Compatibility===

Microsoft supports Office for the Windows and OS X platforms. Beginning with Mac Office 4.2, the OS X and Windows versions of Office share the same file format, and are interoperable. Visual Basic for Applications support was dropped in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/msuniversal/|date=2006-08-07|work=Macworld|title=WWDC: Microsoft updates Universal status of Mac apps|accessdate= 2007-05-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20121007070614/http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/msuniversal/ |archivedate =2012-10-07[/tpl] then reintroduced in Office for Mac 2011.
Microsoft tried in the mid-1990s to port Office to RISC processors such as NEC / MIPS and IBM / PowerPC, but they met problems such as memory access being hampered by data structure alignment requirements. Microsoft Word 97 and Excel 97 however did ship for the DEC Alpha platform. Difficulties in porting Office may have been a factor in discontinuing Windows NT on non-Intel platforms.[tpl]cite news|title=Can Linux break Intel's hold on the market?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/03/linux.alpha.idg/index.html|newspaper=CNN|date=September 3, 1999|author=Nicholas Petreley[/tpl]
Stuart Cohen, CEO of Open Source Development Labs, conjectured in 2006 that Microsoft would eventually release
a Linux port of Office,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/0608/47256.html|language=German|title=OSDL: Microsoft wird Office für Linux bringen|accessdate=7 May 2012|publisher=Golem.de|date=21 August 2006|first=Julius|last=Stiebert[/tpl] but no release was ever published.
Other operating systems were only supported by Microsoft Office Mobile, which supports the more popular features of Microsoft Office, and is available for Windows Mobile.

===Licensing===

In addition to supporting retail sales and site-wide installations, Microsoft offers a "Home Use Program" (HUP) permitting employees of a participating organization access to home-use Microsoft Office products.[ref]
</ref>
Post-secondary students may obtain academic software pricing on a University edition of Microsoft Office 365 subscription.  Despite the name, college students are also eligible.  It is limited to one user and two devices, plus the subscription price of $79.99 is valid for four years instead of just one.  Apart from this, the University edition is identical in features to the Home Premium version.  This marks the first time Microsoft does not offer physical or permanent software at academic pricing, in contrast to the University versions of Office 2010 and Office 2011.

===Support===

On October 15, 2002, Microsoft announced their Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy.[tpl]cite web | url= http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeoffice | title=Office Family Product Support Lifecycle FAQ | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 30, 2009 | accessdate=January 13, 2012[/tpl] Versions earlier than Office 2003 are no longer supported. For current and future versions of Office mainstream support will end five years after release, or two years after the next release, whichever time is later, and extended support will end five years after that.

====Microsoft Office 4.x====

Microsoft Office 4.0 was released containing Word 6.0, Excel 4.0a, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail in 1993.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] Word's version number jumped from 2.0 to 6.0 so that it would have the same version number as the MS-DOS and Macintosh versions (Excel and PowerPoint were already numbered the same as the Macintosh versions).
Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows NT was released in 1994 for i386, Alpha,[tpl]cite web|url=http://d2ca.org/ss-gallery-winnt2k-commercial.html |title=Windows NT/2000 Commercial Screen Shot Gallery: Dan's 20th Century Abandonware |publisher=D2ca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10[/tpl] MIPS and PowerPC [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+ANNOUNCES+WORD+6.0+AND+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+5.0+FOR+WINDOWS+NT...-a015839910 |title=Microsoft announced Word 6.0 and Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT Workstation |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1994-09-19 |accessdate=2012-03-10[/tpl] architectures, containing Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 (both 32-bit,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+READIES+SUPPORTING+VERSIONS+OF+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+AND+WORD+FOR...-a017013735 |title=Microsoft readies supporting versions of Microsoft Excel and Word for Windows NT The PowerPC |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1995-06-12 |accessdate=2012-03-10[/tpl] PowerPoint 4.0 (16-bit), and Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 (the precursor to the Office Shortcut Bar)).
Microsoft Office 4.2 (Standard Edition) and 4.3 (Professional Edition) were released as the last 16-bit version and so the last to support Windows 3.x, containing Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0. Office 4.2 is the Standard Edition, 4.3 the Professional Edition, which also includes Access 2.0.

====Microsoft Office 95====

Microsoft Office 95 was released on August 24, 1995. Again, the version numbers were altered to create parity across the suite—every program was called version 7.0 meaning all but Word missed out versions. It was designed as a fully 32-bit version to match Windows 95. Office 95 was available in two versions, Office 95 Standard and Office 95 Professional. The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus Access 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in CD-ROM form, it also included Bookshelf.

====Microsoft Office 97====

Microsoft Office 97 (Office 8.0), included hundreds of new features and improvements, and introduced command bars, a paradigm in which menus and toolbars were made more similar in capability and visual design. Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant.

====Microsoft Office 2000====

Microsoft Office 2000 (Office 9.0) introduced adaptive menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user. It also introduced a new security feature, built around digital signatures, to diminish the threat of macro viruses. Office 2000 automatically trusts macros (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. Office 2000 is the last version to support Windows 95.

====Microsoft Office XP====

Microsoft Office XP (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with Windows XP, and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the Safe Mode feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail. Safe Mode enables Office to detect and either repair or bypass the source of the problem, such as a corrupted registry or a faulty add-in. Smart tag is a technology introduced with Office XP. Some smart tags operate based on user activity, such as helping with typing errors. These smart tags are supplied with the products, and are not programmable. For developers, though, there is the ability to create custom smart tags. In Office XP, custom smart tags could work only in Word and Excel. Microsoft Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as handwriting recognition. Office XP is the last version to support Windows 98, ME and NT 4.0. It was the first version to require Product Activation as an anti-piracy measure, which attracted widespread controversy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/windows-2000/office-xp-product-activation-a-personal-saga.aspx | title=Office XP Product Activation: A Personal Saga | last=Chernicoff | first=David | work=Windows IT Pro | date=June 22, 2001 | accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl]

====Microsoft Office 2003====

Microsoft Office 2003 (Office 11.0) was released in 2003. It featured a new logo. Two new applications made their debut in Office 2003: Microsoft InfoPath and OneNote. It is the first version to use Windows XP style icons. Outlook 2003 provides improved functionality in many areas, including Kerberos authentication, RPC over HTTP, Cached Exchange Mode, and an improved junk mail filter. 2003 is the last Office version to support Windows 2000.

====Microsoft Office 2007====

Microsoft Office 2007 (Office 12.0) was released in 2007. Office 2007's new features include a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface,[tpl]cite web | url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/the-microsoft-office-fluent-user-interface-frequently-asked-questions-HA010167944.aspx | title= The Microsoft Office Fluent user interface frequently asked questions | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate = March 24, 2014[/tpl] replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon; new XML-based file formats called Office Open XML; and the inclusion of Groove, a collaborative software application.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/reviews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=194400938 | title= Review: A Comprehensive Look At Microsoft Office 2007 | first=Rick | last=Scott | first2=David | last2=DeJean | first3=Serdar | last3=Yegulalp | work=InformationWeek | date=November 20, 2006 | accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl] It is the last version to support Windows XP and Server 2003 x64 versions due to a lack of Windows Imaging Component for those OSs, which is needed by Office 2010.

====Microsoft Office 2010====
