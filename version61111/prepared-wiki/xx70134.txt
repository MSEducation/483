Walden's nickname, Snuffy, derives from the similarly-named Southern snuff manufacturer, Levi Garrett. In episode 1, of a four hour interview with the Archive of American Television, Walden explains that the nickname began to stick when he was away from home at summer camp, as his career began, fellow musicians preferred it over Garrett. His family and schoolmates address him as Garrett.

==Early music career==

In the late 1960s, Walden dropped out of school, quit his job, and devoted his energies to the guitar full-time. In 1972, he formed the group Stray Dog, a blues-based rock trio, and together they moved to England. Following the breakup of Stray Dog, Walden supplanted the ailing Paul Kossoff by providing guitar tracks for Free's final album Heartbreaker, which was released in 1973 (Walden plays on 'Common Mortal Man', 'Easy On My Soul' and 'Seven Angels'). In 1975, he joined The Eric Burdon Band and performed with them for a year.
In 1975, Walden moved to Los Angeles and spent the rest of the decade performing as a solo artist and supporting artists such as Stevie Wonder, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, and Eric Burdon. Notably, in 1975-6 he again depped for Paul Kossoff as a session musician on Back Street Crawler's Second Street album. By the mid-1980s, television agents and producers became aware of Walden through his local performances in Santa Monica. When approached to score a new television show, Walden had mixed feelings but accepted the offer.
"I could see the handwriting on the wall for touring," he would later remember, "and it wasn't pretty. I kept envisioning Holiday Inn at age 60." The television show he was hired for was thirtysomething, which turned out to be a major hit television series and dramatically altered Walden's music career.

==Professional success==

Following his successful debut as a television composer for thirtysomething, Walden was contacted by the producer on another new television show called The Wonder Years, which had the fortune of premiering right after Super Bowl XXII. Walden scored the pilot episode, and then went on to score the series, which also became a hit. For the end credits, he recorded his unique version of The Beatles' song "With a Little Help from My Friends".
Throughout the 1990s, Walden scored numerous television shows and series, including Roseanne, Ellen, My So-Called Life, Felicity, Early Edition, Sports Night, The West Wing, George Lopez, I'll Fly Away, The Stand, Huff, Once and Again, Friday Night Lights, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.
In the summer of 2001, Walden released a solo album of mainly acoustic guitar pieces titled Music by... W. G. Snuffy Walden. The "elegance and glowing warmth of the compositions" permeated the entire album. Avoiding the obvious temptation to release a greatest hits compilation of his television hits, Walden chose to explore and expand his musical vocabulary. Walden's playing always "evoked character and emotion through sometimes deceptively simple melodic motives." For example, "Felicity's Theme" surrounds the beautiful melody with "gentle harmonics" creating a poignant effect. The album also includes expanded or full versions of many of Walden's themes, such as "Once and Again", "Eugene's Ragtop", "Thirtysomething (Revisited)", and "West Wing Suite".
In 2002, Tom Guerra conducted a comprehensive interview of Walden for Vintage Guitar Magazine. Walden announced that he would team up with a 60-piece orchestra to compose the film adaptation of The Umbrella Academy. This will be the first time he has scored a movie since Leaving Normal.
Walden is now working with YouTube artists, including Jake Coco, to help them to produce covers and original songs. Walden serves as an artistic advisor to the BMI Foundation.
