Stuart Dangerfield (born 17 September 1971, and from Willenhall in the West Midlands) is an English racing cyclist who has been prominent in British individual time trial events during the 1990s and early 21st century.
Dangerfield won his first RTTC national  time trial championship in 1992 in the hill-climb event - a victory he repeated in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1997, he was also [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] time trial champion; he also won the event four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. He won his first national [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] championship in 2001, with repeat victories in 2003 and 2004. In 2001 he broke [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] competition record with a time of 18'19" (32.76Â mph), knocking eight seconds off the previous record, set by Graeme Obree in 1993.
At world championship level, he has represented Great Britain in the individual time trial event at Holland 1998, Brittany 2000, Portugal 2001 and Belgium 2002. He also represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Canada 1994, Malaysia 1998 and Manchester 2002.
Dangerfield was little known outside club cycling circles in Britain, having grown up in the shadow of firstly Chris Boardman and then David Millar. However, Millar's admission to using the illegal drug EPO and consequent expulsion from the Great Britain squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics meant that Dangerfield was called up into the Olympic squad to race the time trial. An injury to GB cyclist Jeremy Hunt also saw Dangerfield entered into the men's road race. Dangerfield finished 30th in the time trial, but did not finish the road race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/da/stuart-dangerfield-1.html |title=Stuart Dangerfield Biography and Statistics - Olympics at Sports-Reference.com |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06[/tpl]
