Making a Good Thing Better is an album by Olivia Newton-John, released 1977.

==Reception==

The album peaked at No. 34 Pop and No. 13 Country. It was Newton-John's first album not to reach the Country Top 10.  The album also ended Olivia's streak of six consecutive gold albums from 1974's "Let Me Be There" through 1976's "Don't Stop Believin'." It was a different story in the Netherlands, where it became her fourth chart-topping album.
Newton-John was in a dispute with MCA records at the time of the recording and was in negotiations to be released from MCA, thus the label did not promote the album.  At the time, Newton-John sued for her release from MCA, claiming they had not promoted her music, resulting in diminished chart placement. She attempted to promote the album and single, appearing on the cover of Us Weekly on 23 August 1977 and making a promotional clip of the song that aired on NBC's "The Midnight Special".
Olivia Newton-John went on to sign on to do the movie Grease, and came to agreement to stay with MCA Records, though her recordings from the movie were on RSO Records.

==Singles==

The soul-sounding title track was the album single (with "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina" and "Sad Songs") reaching a shockingly low No. 87 on the Pop chart and No. 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was Newton-John's first single not to reach the AC Top 10 since 1972's "What Is Life". The cover art is the same as what was re-issued for 2005's "Gold" CD. The original album featured a gatefold cover similar to her Greatest Hits packages, though only one vinyl LP album was contained inside.
