==History==

In 1977, Stafford schools broke away from the Fort Bend Independent School District, which caused several rounds of federal litigation and by 1981 it was finally declared that the Stafford Municipal School District was constitutional. Almost all of Stafford was in the Fort Bend District, with a minuscule portion in the Houston Independent School District."Comptroller Strayhorn to Review Stafford Municipal School District." Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Tuesday September 16, 2003. Retrieved on January 14, 2009. All of Stafford is now zoned to the Stafford Municipal School District, which is the only school district in all of Texas that is controlled by the city.

==Politics and geography==

While Stafford MSD is a part of the City of Stafford and took all of the land in the city in 1977 when it was created, Stafford MSD cannot annex any territory without the consent of the other school districts which own that territory. Because of this, the City of Stafford, for a period of over 20 years ending in 2006, did not annex any territory in its extraterritorial jurisdiction as that would mean portions of its territory would fall within the Alief Independent School District, the Fort Bend Independent School District, and/or the Houston Independent School District. The city government of Stafford wants its school district's territory to be the same as its city limits.Kumar, Seshadri. "Stafford, SMSD mull over annexation." Houston Chronicle. October 30, 2006.
