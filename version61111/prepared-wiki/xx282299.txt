Karsten Kruschel (born 1959 in Havelberg) is a German science fiction writer, essayist and critic, who lives near Leipzig. His best known works are the Deutscher Science Fiction Preis winning novels Vilm and Galdäa. Some of his short stories were nominated for the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis.
Kruschel is the younger son of the writer Heinz Kruschel (1929–2011). He grew up in Magdeburg and studied History and German Philology. Later he became a teacher and a copy editor (amongst others).
He received his doctorate in German Philology in 1991 by writing a dissertation about the science fiction literature in the GDR. "Karsten Kruschel refers to the ambivalence in ambiguous utopie in terms of 'the presence of a variety of possible interpretations'. He uses the category of ambiguous utopia to characterize those novels of this period that were neither utopia or dystopia", says Sonja Fritzsche about it.Sonja Fritzsche, Science Fiction Literature in East Germany, East German Studies vol. 15, Peter Lang, New York 2006, p. 124
His first professional publication was a short story, published in 1979 in German magazine neues leben. His books won the Deutscher Science Fiction Preis twice, in 2010 and 2012. In 2010 he became a freelance writer.
