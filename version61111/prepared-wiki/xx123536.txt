The Sulphur River is a [tpl]convert|175|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/| title=The National Map| publisher=U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate=March 8, 2011[/tpl] river in northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas in the United States.

==Geography==

The Sulphur River begins at the confluence of its north and south forks along the Deltaâ€“Lamar county line. This merger is about [tpl]convert|4.7|mi[/tpl] northeast of the town of Sulphur Bluff, [tpl]convert|95|mi[/tpl] northeast of Dallas, and [tpl]convert|16|mi[/tpl] downstream from the Cooper Lake dam.
The river flows generally eastward through several Texas counties and provides most of the water for Wright Patman Lake, on the border between Bowie and Cass counties. Below Wright Patman Dam, the river continues its generally eastward flow to the Arkansas state line. The river flows southeastward through Miller County in southwestern Arkansas for [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] until it joins the southbound Red River east of Doddridge, a few miles above the Louisiana border.

==Recreation==

The Sulphur River provides numerous opportunities for fishing, boating, and other activities.
Above Wright Patman Lake, the river has enough water for recreation most of the time. The flow is slow, and the river is murky, largely due to channelization upstream. Below Wright Patman Dam, the river flow depends on the amount of water being released from the dam; however, water quality is usually good.
Wright Patman Lake provides additional opportunities for camping, boating, swimming, and fishing.
