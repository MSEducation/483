==History==

Lexington was founded in June, 1775, in what was then Fincastle County, Virginia, 17 years before Kentucky became a state. A party of frontiersmen, led by William McConnell, camped on the Middle Fork of Elkhorn Creek (now known as Town Branch and rerouted under Vine Street) at the site of the present-day McConnell Springs. Upon hearing of the colonists' victory in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, they named their campsite Lexington. It was the first of what would be many American places to be named after the Massachusetts town.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Our Storehouse of Missouri Place Names | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Ramsay, Robert L. | year=1952 | pages=16[/tpl] The risk of Indian attacks delayed permanent settlement, though, for four years. In 1779, Col. Robert Patterson and 25 companions came from Fort Harrod and erected a blockhouse. Cabins and a stockade followed, establishing a settlement known as Bryan Station. In 1780, Lexington was made the seat of Virginia's Fayette County. Colonists defended it against a British and American Indian attack in 1782, during the last part of the American Revolution.
The town was chartered on May 6, 1782, by an act of the Virginia General Assembly.

By 1820, Lexington was one of the largest and wealthiest towns west of the Allegheny Mountains. So cultured was its lifestyle that the city gained the nickname "Athens of the West". One early prominent citizen, John Wesley Hunt, became the first millionaire west of the Alleghenies. The growing town was devastated by a cholera epidemic in 1833: 500 of 7,000 residents died within two months, including nearly one-third of the congregation of Christ Church Episcopal."Christ Church Episcopal", Lexington, National Park Service. Retrieved 21 August 2010. London Ferrill, second preacher of First African Baptist, was one of three clergy who stayed in the city to serve the suffering. Additional cholera outbreaks occurred in 1848–49 and the early 1850s. Cholera was spread by people using contaminated water supplies, but its transmission was not understood in those years. Often the wealthier people would flee town for outlying areas to try to avoid the spread of disease.
Planters held slaves for use as field hands, laborers, artisans, and domestic servants. In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and in a wide variety of trades. In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the state. It also had a population of free blacks. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by London Ferrill, a free black, had a congregation of 1820, the largest of any, black or white, in the state.H. E. Nutter, A Brief History of the First Baptist Church (Black) Lexington, Kentucky, 1940, accessed 22 Aug 2010
Many of 19th-century America's most important people spent part of their lives in the city, including U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis (who attended Transylvania University in 1823 and 1824); Confederate general John Hunt Morgan; U.S. Senator and Vice President John C. Breckinridge; and Speaker of the House, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State Henry Clay, who had a plantation nearby. Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln was born and raised in Lexington, and the couple visited the city several times after their marriage in 1842.
In 1935, Lexington founded one of the first drug rehabilitation clinics, known as the "Addiction Research Center".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |title=History of the Addiction Research Center |publisher=Drugabuse.gov |date=1935-05-15 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl] Expanded as the first alcohol and drug rehabilitation hospital in the United States, it was known as "Narco" of Lexington. The hospital was later converted into a federal prison, the Federal Medical Center, Lexington.
In 1806, Lexington was best written to its spirit and quality by the poet, Josiah Espy in the following letter:
"Lexington is the largest and most wealthy town in Kentucky, or indeed west of the Allegheny Mountains; the main street of Lexington has all the appearance of Market Street in Philadelphia on a busy day ... I would suppose it contains about five hundred dwelling houses was closer to three hundred, many of them elegant and three stories high. About thirty brick buildings were then raising, and I have little doubt but that in a few years it will rival, not only in wealth, but in population, the most populous inland town of the United States . . . The country around Lexington for many miles in every direction, is equal in beauty and fertility to anything the imagination can paint and is already in a high state of cultivation."Athens of the West; Lexington, Kentucky: The Athens of the West - A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary; National Park Service; 2009
Today, Lexington is widely referred to as "The Athens of the West" after the popularity of Espy's charming Poem dedicated to the city.

==Geography==

Lexington, which includes all Fayette County, consists of [tpl]convert|285.5|sqmi|km2|1[/tpl], mostly gently rolling plateau, in the center of the inner Bluegrass Region. The area is noted for its fertile soil, excellent pastureland, and horse and stock farms. Poa pratensis (bluegrass) thrives on the limestone beneath the soil's surface, playing a major role in the area's scenic beauty and in the development of champion horses. Numerous small creeks rise and flow into the Kentucky River.
The Lexington-Fayette Metro area is home to five counties: Clark, Jessamine, Bourbon, Woodford, and Scott. This is the second largest metro area in Kentucky. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|285.5|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. [tpl]convert|284.5|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it is land and [tpl]convert|1.0|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it (0.35%) is water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/21/21067.html |title=Fayette County |publisher=QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |accessdate=2010-12-29[/tpl]

===Planning===

Lexington faces a rare challenge among American cities in that it must manage a rapidly growing population while maintaining the character of the surrounding horse farms that give the region its identity. To do so Lexington enacted the nation's first Urban Growth Boundary in 1958, where new development could only occur in the Urban Service Area.  It set a strict minimum area requirement, currently [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2[/tpl], to maintain open space in the Rural Service Area.[tpl]cite press release | title = Greenbrier Small Area Plan | publisher = Lexington-Fayette Urban County, Kentucky | date = 2003-04-17 | url = ftp://ftp.lfucg.com/Planning/LongRange/greenbrier_plan.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-20|format=PDF[/tpl]  In 1967, the Urban Service Area was decreased in area; various zoning regulations were also amended from the original 1958 issue. Several years later, in 1973, the first Lexington Comprehensive Plan was completed.
In 1980, the Comprehensive Plan was updated and the Urban Service Area was modified to include Urban Activity Centers and Rural Activity Centers.[tpl]cite press release | title = Planning History | publisher = Lexington-Fayette Urban County, Kentucky | url = http://www.lfucg.com/planning/History.asp | accessdate = 2007-05-20[/tpl] The Urban Activity Centers were commercial and light-industrial districts in urbanized areas, while Rural Activity Centers were retail trade and light-industrial centers clustered around the Interstate 64/Interstate 75 interchanges. In 1996, the Urban Service Area was expanded when [tpl]convert|5300|acre|km2|0[/tpl] of the Rural Service Area was acquired through the Expansion Area Master Plan. This was not without controversy; the first major update to the Comprehensive Plan in over a decade was accompanied by arguments about the future of Lexington and the thoroughbred farms.
The Expansion Area Master Plan included impact fees, assessment districts, neighborhood design concepts, design overlays, mandatory greenways, major roadway improvements, stormwater management and open space mitigation for the first time; it also included a draft of the Rural Land Management Plan, which included large-lot zoning and traffic impact controls. A pre-zoning of the entire expansion area was refuted in the Plan. A [tpl]convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] minimum proposal was also defeated, although discussion of the proposal led to a deluge of [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] subdivisions in the Rural Service Areas.
Three years after the expansion was initiated, the Rural Service Area Land Management Plan was adopted, which increased the minimum lot size in the agricultural rural zones to [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] minimums. In 2000, a Purchase of Development Rights plan was adopted, which granted the city power to purchase the development rights of existing farms; in 2001, $40 million was allocated to the plan from a $25 million local, $15 million state grant. An Infill and Redevelopment study was also initiated during that time, along with design guidelines for the areas surrounding the new Fayette County courthouses.
