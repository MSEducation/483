Analysts had projected the device to be a strong competitor to Apple's iPad,[tpl]cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204422404576597141076634146.html |title=Amazon to Challenge iPad |first=John |last=Letzing |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate= 2011-10-01 |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc |date=September 28, 2011[/tpl] and that other Android device makers would suffer lost sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/column-post/amazons-kindle-fire-will-vaporize-android-leave-apple-unscathed-33340 |title=Amazon's Kindle Fire Will 'Vaporize' Android But Leave Apple Unscathed |publisher=TheWrap.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url = http://www.cnbc.com/id/44707441/Gene_Munster_Samsung_Others_Should_Worry_about_Kindle_Fire |title = Gene Munster: Samsung, Others Should Worry about Kindle Fire |date= 28 September 2011 |editor= Lee Brodie|work = cnbc.com |publisher =CNBC[/tpl]
In a review published by Project Gutenberg, the Kindle Fire was called a "huge step back in freedom from the Kindle 3"; the reviewer noted that Amazon introduced a "deliberate limitation" into the Fire that didn't exist in the previous version: it is no longer possible to download free e-books from websites such as Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive and Google Books and have them stored permanently in the same places where books from Amazon are kept.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Kindle_Fire_Review| title= Kindle Fire Review| date= 21 December 2012 (last modified) | publisher= Project Gutenberg| accessdate=2013-03-17| quote= You can get free ebooks to the Fire too, but the process is so cumbersome that it isn't worth the trouble given the alternative of buying a Nexus 7, which handles free ebooks with ease. To be specific, there is no way to download free books from the web and have the Kindle Fire store them permanently or in the same places where your books from Amazon are kept. This was easy with the Kindle 3. No more.[/tpl]
