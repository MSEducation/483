Castilleja, commonly known as Indian paintbrush or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in Siberia.  These plants are classified in the broomrape family, Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae).  They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs.  The generic name honours Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=esMPU5DHEGgC&  |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=I: A-C |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-2675-2 |page=455[/tpl]

==Ecology==

Castilleja species are eaten by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including Schinia cupes (which has been recorded on C. exserta) and Schinia pulchripennis (which feeds exclusively on C. exserta), and checkerspot butterflies, such as Euphydryas species.

==Uses==

The flowers of Indian paintbrush are edible, and were consumed in moderation by various Native American tribes as a condiment with other fresh greens.  These plants have a tendency to absorb and concentrate selenium in their tissues from the soils in which they grow, and can be potentially very toxic if the roots or green parts of the plant are consumed.  Highly alkaline soils increase the selenium levels in the plants.  Indian paintbrush has similar health benefits to consuming garlic if  only  the flowers are eaten in small amounts and in moderation.[tpl]cite book |title=Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West |first=Gregory L. |last=Tilford |year=1997 |publisher=Mountain Press Publishing |isbn=978-0-87842-359-0 |pages=82â€“83[/tpl]
The Ojibwe used a hairwash made from Indian paintbrush to make their hair glossy and full bodied, and as a treatment for rheumatism.  The high selenium content of this plant has been cited as the reason for its effectiveness for these purposes.   Nevada Indian tribes used the plant to treat sexually transmitted diseases and to enhance the immune system.
