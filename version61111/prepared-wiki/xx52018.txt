CATEGORIES: Historical and obsolete mental and behavioural disorders

In 19th-century psychiatry, monomania (from Greek monos, one, and mania, meaning "madness" or "frenzy") was a form of partial insanity conceived as single pathological preoccupation in an otherwise sound mind.[tpl]cite book |title=Console and Classify: The French Psychiatric Profession in the Nineteenth Century |author=Jan E.

Although, monomania was retained as one of seven recognized categories of mental illness in the 1880 US census,[tpl]cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR |publisher=American Psychiatric Society |edition=4th |year=2000 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=monomania&f=false |page=xxv |isbn=0-89042-025-4[/tpl] its importance as a psychiatric diagnostic category was in decline from the mid-19th century.Berrios's note states: "Monomania was a diagnosis invented by Esquirol which achieved certain popularity, particularly in forensic psychiatry. It was never fully accepted by those not belonging to Esquirol's school and after severe attack during the 1950s, it gradually disappeared." The reference to the 1950s is a typographical error and it should read the 1850s. This is evident from a reading of the section of Berrios's text which this note informs, the secondary and primary sources that Berrios uses to support this detail and other secondary and primary literature on the topic. For instance, at an earlier point in Berrios's text he writes: "...Esquirol's 'monomania' did not fare well ... and was killed in 1854 at a meeting of the Société Médico-Psychologique ..."

 But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. ... so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand-fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any reasonable object.
