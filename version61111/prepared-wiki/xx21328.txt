The Open Group is a vendor and technology-neutral industry consortium, currently with over four hundred member organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/overview/ |title=About The Open Group |publisher=Opengroup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] It was formed in 1996 when X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation. Services provided include strategy, management, innovation and research, standards, certification, and test development.
The Open Group is most famous as the certifying body for the UNIX trademark,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/ |title=The Open Brand |publisher=Opengroup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] and its publication of the Single UNIX Specification technical standard,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/ |title=The Online Single UNIX Specification |publisher=Unix.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] which extends the POSIX standards and is the official definition of a UNIX system. The Open Group also develops and manages the TOGAF standard, which is an industry standard 
enterprise architecture framework.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/ |title=TOGAF |publisher=Opengroup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl]
The Open Group members include a range of IT buyers and vendors as well as government agencies, for example Capgemini, Fujitsu, Oracle, Hitachi, HP, Orbus Software, IBM, Kingdee, NEC, SAP, US Department of Defense, NASA and others.

==History==

By the early 1990s, the major UNIX system vendors had begun to realize that the standards rivalries often termed as the Unix wars were causing all participants more harm than good, leaving the UNIX industry open to emerging competition from Microsoft.  The COSE initiative in 1993 can be considered to be the first unification step and the merger of the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and X/Open in 1996 as the ultimate step in the end of those skirmishes. OSF had previously merged with UNIX International in 1994, meaning that the new entity effectively represented all elements of the Unix community of the time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050601125916588 |title=The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin|last=Salus|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H.

In January 1997, the responsibility for the X Window System was transferred to The Open Group from the defunct X Consortium. In 1999, X.Org was formed to manage the X Window System, with management services provided by The Open Group. The X.Org members made a number of releases up to and including X11R6.8 while The Open Group provided management services. In 2004, X.Org and The Open Group worked together to establish the newly formed X.Org Foundation who then took control of the x.org domain name, and the stewardship of the X Window System. (See the history of the X Window System.)
