==Description==

The Molen van Vledder is what the Dutch describe as an "achtkante stellingmolen". It is a two-storey smock mill with a stage on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, [tpl]convert|6.20|m|ftin[/tpl] above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of [tpl]convert|11.20|m|ftin[/tpl] and are carried in a steel windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 31 cogs. This drives the wallower (24 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 58 cogs, drives the [tpl]convert|1.00|m|ftin[/tpl] diameter French Burr stones via a lantern pinion stone nut with 31 staves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=381 |title=Technische gegevens |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] (Click on "Technische gegevens" to view.)
