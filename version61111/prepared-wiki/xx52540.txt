Román Baldorioty de Castro[tpl]Spanish name|Baldorioty|de Castro[/tpl] (February 23, 1822 – September 30, 1889) is noted as one of Puerto Rico's foremost abolitionists and spokesman for the island's right to self-determination.  He received his primary and secondary education in San Juan. He received a scholarship and moved to Spain, where he continued his studies at the University of Madrid. In 1853, he returned to Puerto Rico and began working as a professor at the island's School of Commerce and the Seminario Concilar. Baldorioty de Castro was selected to represent Puerto Rico at the 1867 Universal Fair, which was organized in Paris, France. 
In 1870, he was elected as a deputy in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, where he promoted abolition of slavery. Baldorioty de Castro founded the Partido Autonomista in 1887, but he was only able to work within it for a few months. He was tried and imprisoned in Fort San Felipe del Morro, after being accused of publishing propaganda that affected the Spanish government's image. He was released after a brief period in jail, but his time in prison affected his health, which contributed to his death on September 30, 1889.

Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=23[/tpl] Before establishing a permanent residence in Madrid, the group traveled to several Spanish provinces, where they visited some of the country's tourist sites. Among the places visited were locations in Cordoba, Seville, Andújar and Bailén where they met Alberto Lista, one of Spain's most renowned educators.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=25[/tpl] 
The three other students (who traveled with Baldorioty de Castro) contracted smallpox shortly after beginning their academic studies in the Central University of Madrid. Baldorioty de Castro cared for them, but two of the youths died from complications of the disease.[tpl]cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=48–49[/tpl] Baldorioty de Castro was offered a chance to return to Puerto Rico but he declined. He continued his studies along with the only survivor and graduated with a degree in physics and mathematical sciences from the university. Dr. José Gualberto Padilla together with Román Baldorioty de Castro, founded the Puerto Rican chapter of the Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País and called it "La Sociedad de Amigos del País de Puerto Rico" (the Economic Friends of Puerto Rico).José Gualberto Padilla, “El Caribe” POR NADIA S.

==Political and professional careers==

In 1853, after seven years of study, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico and married Isabel Matilde Díaz y Ruiz, the granddaughter of Lieutenant Francisco Díaz, hero of the Battle of San Juan of 1797.Algunos de los participantes en las acciones ocurridas durante la invasión británica de 1797[tpl]cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=37[/tpl] Upon his return, he noticed that there was political tension, because of the differences between the governor in office and the political and educational groups in Puerto Rico. 
Baldorioty de Castro began promoting the restructuring of the social, political and educational establishments.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=51[/tpl] These contributions led Fernando Norzagaray, the colony's incumbent governor to offer him the position of mayor of one of the island's municipalities (towns). Baldorioty de Castro declined the offer, based on his ideals. At the time, the government displayed no interest in promoting education among the Criollos of the island.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=42[/tpl] Two years earlier, the governor had imposed the Reglamento del Jornalero, which promoted a more ample labor base by reducing the amount of unemployed citizens. However, this measure was criticized for its elements that were used to increase the wealth of employers.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=43[/tpl] As a consequence, the merits of said law were reconsidered and a group led by Baldorioty de Castro was selected to decide its validity. In 1853, he became a member of the Liberal Reform Party of Puerto Rico.  
Besides politics, Baldorioty de Castro also loved teaching. He taught Botany and Maritime Sciences at the School of Commerce, Agriculture and Maritime Studies in San Juan. On January 1854, the Councilor Seminary selected Baldorioty de Castro as its botany professor. On November of that year, Puerto Rico's Commerce and Foment Joint selected him to work as a professor in a Nautical School, where he taught Maritime Studies. 
The colonial government discovered that there was fertile terrain in the islands of Mona and Monito in 1856.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=56[/tpl] After the discovery, they selected Baldorioty de Castro as the supervisor of a series of experiments to determine the terrain's components.
In 1857, the cattle industry in Puerto Rico began having difficulties, when the number of animals diminished significantly. To resolve this problem, the island's Economic Society formed a commission composed of Baldorioty de Castro, José Julián Acosta and Juan Hernández Arbizu.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=57[/tpl]
Baldorioty de Castro proposed that geometry classes be included in the curriculum of elementary schools in Puerto Rico, which was accepted by the pertinent authority. On January 2, 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On June 4, 1860, the organization named him spokesman of a commission to promote conservation of the island's natural resources.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=58[/tpl] Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On September 17, 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=59[/tpl]
While working in the Spanish Parliament, he made the most of his position and encouraged the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and drafting a constitution to guarantee Puerto Ricans more political rights.The World of 1898, The Spanish-American War, Library of Congress On November 4, 1866, he was named Puerto Rico's representative to Paris' 1867 Universal Exposition.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=74[/tpl] He served as a critic and subsequently wrote a review titled Exposición Universal de París en 1967.

Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=75[/tpl] This led to protests and demands by the local Criollo population and influenced several revolutionaries, which led to the Grito de Lares. Baldorioty de Castro did not promote the armed revolution; instead he choose to debate the several conflicts and issues on diplomatic venues. After the revolution attempts, a new superior provisional government was established in the island.[tpl]cite book| title=Baldorioty, Apóstol| author=José A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=80[/tpl] This government promoted a union between the conflicting parties in order to establish reforms in the government's structure. In line with the proposed solution, Baldorioty de Castro proposed a conciliation of these groups, but the efforts to unify the opposing views was unsuccessful. After this, he traveled to Madrid, under political pressure, and presented the island's status situation to the respective authorities.[tpl]cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=52[/tpl]

Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertoriqueña| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=73[/tpl]

In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro co-founded, along with José de Diego, the Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico. He named a young and upcoming politician, Antonio R. Barceló, the position of party Secretary. The Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico became one of Puerto Rico's first political parties. Its credo was that Puerto Rico should pick its own government and should have a representative in the Spanish Parliament. 
The Spanish government, however, considered Baldorioty de Castro a dangerous person and a dissenter and had him jailed in Fort San Felipe del Morro in San Juan.[tpl]cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=57[/tpl] Although he was not in jail for long and was soon released, his health suffered greatly during this imprisonment.
