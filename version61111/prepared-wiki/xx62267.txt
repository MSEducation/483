==Plot==

Raj Malhotra (Shahrukh Khan) and Simran Singh (Kajol) are two non-resident Indians living in London. Although both value their Indian roots, they have experienced different parenting styles. Simran has been raised by her conservative father Baldev (Amrish Puri) while Raj's father (Anupam Kher) is more liberal.
Simran has always dreamt of meeting a perfect boy who is the one for her. Her mother Lajjo (Farida Jalal) warns her against this, saying these dreams will never come true. Her father Baldev soon receives a letter from his friend Ajit (Satish Shah) who lives in Punjab. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago — to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet (Parmeet Sethi). Simran is disappointed by this news — she does not want to marry somebody whom she has never met before. Meanwhile, Raj has failed his degree which strangely makes his father proud of him. Raj asks his father if he can go on a train trip with his friends around Europe. His father agrees. Later, Raj enters Baldev's shop and steals some beer which infuriates him; he calls Raj a disgrace to Indians. Simran is also invited by her friends to go on the train trip. Simran tells her father that she thinks she should be allowed to go because it will be her last chance to see the world before she marries a complete stranger. Baldev lets her go but tells her not to betray his trust.
On the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. Then, the two miss their train to Zurich and are separated from their friends. They start to travel with one another to catch back up and become friends in the process. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey and when they both part ways back in London, Simran realises that she is in love with him too. Simran tells her mother about the boy she met — Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes furious with her. He says that the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she is getting married soon. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her. Raj arrives at her house in London, only to find that she has already left for India. She left a souvenir they had bought together on their trip on her front porch, which encourages Raj to keep chasing her.
In India, Baldev is delighted to be reunited with his friend Ajit and all his relatives. Simran and her younger sister, Chutki, meet Kuljeet, Simran's fiance, and instantly dislike him due to his arrogance. Simran still cannot forget Raj and is miserable about having to marry Kuljeet. Her mother tells her to forget Raj because she knows that Baldev will never accept it. The next morning, Simran hears a familiar sound and runs out to the fields to find Raj there. She begs him to take her and run away because she knows her father will never let them be together. Raj refuses and says he will only marry Simran with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and quickly gets accepted by both families. Soon Raj's father arrives in India and also becomes good friends with everyone. Eventually Lajjo and Chutki realise that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo tells Raj and Simran to run away, but Raj still refuses. Baldev finally accepts Raj, until he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran in Europe, and realises that Raj is the boy Simran had told them about. He openly insults Raj, telling him to leave.
Raj and his father are waiting at the station when Kuljeet and his friends arrive and attack them. Eventually Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight.  Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran soon arrives with her mother and sister. She tries to join Raj on the train but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev thinks and realises that nobody can love his daughter more than Raj does. He lets her go, and she runs to catch the train as it takes off.

==Production==

Yash Chopra decided to launch his son Aditya, who had been working with him as an assistant director and producer, as a director with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Aditya had total editorial control and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Yash did not see major portions until it was nearly complete.[tpl]cite web |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2007/ddlj-601-weeks-050507.html |title=Celebrating DDLJ in its 601st week |publisher=Oneindia.in |date=5 May 2007 |accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl]
The film was among the first to be produced with the large and rich South Asian diaspora in the West as its target. Some films that later followed this trend include Pardes (1997), Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (2001), Kal Ho Na Ho (2003), and Salaam Namaste (2005); the diaspora market is seen as a safer financial investment than the desi market.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/11/25/stories/2007112550030100.htm |title=Bollywood needs to change its act |publisher=The Hindu|date=25 November 2007|accessdate=6 April 2011|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] Director Aditya Chopra originally wanted to cast Tom Cruise for the role of Raj, as he wanted it to be an Indo-American affair, but was dissuaded by his father/producer Yash, who did not want a foreign star.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-07/did-you-know-/28357481_1_tom-cruise-ddlj-yash-chopra |title=Cruise was the first choice for DDLJ! |publisher=Times of India|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=6 April 2011[/tpl] They decided to go with a theme of non-resident Indians (NRIs).

The two actors had previous worked together in Baazigar (1993) and Karan Arjun (1995).
The first sequence filmed was of Kajol for the "Ho Gaya" song.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/screen-exclusive--love-me-tender-shah-rukh-khan/1025796/0 |title=Screen exclusive!

Saroj Khan was the choreographer. After several disputes with Chopra, she was replaced by Farah Khan near the end of the shoot. Farah choreographed "Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane." Manish Malhotra was in charge of costume design, with help from Karan Johar. Sharmishta Roy was the art director.[tpl]cite book|author=Anupama Chopra|title=Dilwale dulhania le jayenge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PcyxbEnzPEAC&pg=PA50|accessdate=11 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-85170-957-4|pages=37, 46–48[/tpl] The film's title was suggested by one of the actors Kirron Kher, and was taken from the song "Le Jayenge Le Jayenge" from the 1974 film Chor Machaye Shor. The character of Raj sings small parts of this song throughout, and it recurs at the end. DDLJ is believed to be the only film with a "Title suggested by" credit.
After filming was complete, Chopra decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the filmmaking process, which had never been done before in India. Karan Johar and Chopra's brother Uday were put in charge. On 18 October, The Making of DDLJ was aired on Doordarshan, two days before the film's premiere.
DDLJ was the second Bollywood production and the first Yash Raj Film to be mixed in Dolby sound. It released in India with Dolby SR and a very limited release with Dolby Digital 5.1 which was brand new in India at the time.

==Themes==

Yash Raj Films was previously known for using foreign (non-Indian) locations for item numbers in their films. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge started the trend for films designed to appeal to the Indian diaspora, which have foreign locations as integral parts of the story. The characters are themselves diaspora, and tend to be able to move around with ease between India and the West. This film repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence.[tpl]cite book|author2=University of Oxford. Institute of Social Anthropology|author3=Research Centre on Social and Economic Development in Asia|author=Institute of Economic Growth (India)|title=Contributions to Indian sociology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-51IAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=1998|publisher=Mouton|page=305[/tpl] In fact, Raj (who was brought up in London) is the "good guy" of the story, whereas Kuljeet (raised in India) is seen as the "bad guy". This is a reversal from typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners.[tpl]cite book|author=Tejaswini Ganti|title=Bollywood: a guidebook to popular Hindi cinema|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTEa93azj9EC|accessdate=26 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28854-5|page=42[/tpl]
The story also aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism.[tpl]cite book|author=Jyotika Virdi|title=The cinematic imagiNation: Indian popular films as social history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u8PKObcYMDIC&pg=PA208|accessdate=24 October 2011|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3191-5|page=208[/tpl] Though Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over the father rather than simply eloping. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Individual desires have to take a back seat to moral values and rules of conduct.[tpl]cite book|author=Lars Eckstein|title=Multi-ethnic Britain 2000+: new perspectives in literature, film and the arts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JfP4L5UpNsoC&pg=PA67|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=22 November 2008|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2497-7|page=51[/tpl] The film implies that "Indianness" can be defined by the importance of family life: whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines being Indian.
Also there are themes of the purity/sanctity of women being related to the purity/sanctity of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: "You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl’s izzat (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night." This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack features 7 songs composed by Jatin Lalit, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi and voice rendered by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet, and Udit Narayan. Anand Bakshi won his third Filmfare Best Lyricist award after 14 years. Bhasker Gupta wrote for All Music that the soundtrack was the best of Jatin Lalit's career, and calls it the beginning of the fifth wave in Indian cinema soundtracks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/dilwale-dulhania-le-jayenge-saregama-r1023627/review |title=Dilwale Dulhania le Jayenge Saregama |author=Bhasker Gupta|publisher=All Music |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]

Perhaps it’s the way in which the film artfully reaffirms the patriarchal status quo and works for all constituencies—the NRI and the local viewer.

In 2001, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge overtook Sholay (1975) as the longest-running film in Indian cinema.[tpl]cite book|author1=Emory Elliott|author2=Jasmine Payne|author3=Patricia Ploesch|title=Global migration, social change, and cultural transformation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rvPP_xmUwyUC&pg=PA37|accessdate=3 March 2011|date=27 November 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-60054-6|page=54[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/broadband/2001/feb/05lead.htm|title=Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge Breaks Sholay's Record|publisher=rediff.com|date=5 February 2001|accessdate=27 December 2013[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], it is still playing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/oct/26/slide-show-1-weird-news-records-are-meant-to-be-broken.htm|title=Weird News: Records are meant to be broken|publisher=rediff.com|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl] Producer Yash Chopra decided to organise a celebration in February 2011, when the film completed 800 weeks of running, and theatre owner Manoj Desai said he has no plans to discontinue the screening of the film.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/DDLJ-to-complete-800-weeks-of-romance/Article1-582668.aspx |title=DDLJ to complete 800 weeks of romance |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=5 August 2010|accessdate=17 December 2011[/tpl] There are often people in the audience that have seen the film 50 times or more, but still clap, cheer, mouth the dialogues, and sing along with the songs, raising comparisons with Hollywood's longest running film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). People keep coming back not just to see the film, but also to be a part of an experience.[tpl]cite web|last=Marchive |first=Laurane |url=http://www.mid-day.com/specials/2009/apr/260409-Laurane-Marchive-French-born-Dilwale-Dulhaniya-Le-Jaayenge-14th-anniversary-Play-Mumbai.htm |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131228082715/http://www.mid-day.com/specials/2009/apr/260409-Laurane-Marchive-French-born-Dilwale-Dulhaniya-Le-Jaayenge-14th-anniversary-Play-Mumbai.htm |archivedate=28 December 2013 |title=DDLJ record Le Jayenge |publisher=Mid-day.com |date=10 May 2009 |accessdate=15 November 2011[/tpl] In early 2011, a theatre strike threatened the film's uninterrupted showing streak. Producer Yash Chopra contacted theatre owners to try and ensure that the film would continue. He hoped that the film would continue to run for at least 1000 weeks.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-26/news-interviews/29191729_1_ddlj-cinemax-screening |title=Raj, Simran's love uninterrupted |publisher=Times of India |date=26 March 2010|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]
Audiences appreciated the duo of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol so much that they went on to work together in several other successful films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), and My Name Is Khan (2010), and are often referred to as Indian cinema's most loved on-screen couple.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/slideshow/type/view/id/789 |title=10 Best Onscreen Romantic Couples of the Decade |publisher=Bollywoodhungama.com |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] Khan himself credits this film with making him a star, and says that the film "changed the entire scene for romantic movies of the 90s".[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/srk-doesn-t-mind-salman-copying-ddlj-scene-106887 |title=SRK Doesn't Mind Salman Copying DDLJ Scene |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |accessdate=7 December 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2014[/tpl] Some newer films have paid homage to classic scenes from the film. For example, Jab We Met (2007), Bodyguard (2011), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Chennai Express (2013) included scenes very similar to the train scene in DDLJ, wherein a girl is running to catch a moving train and is helped aboard by a boy with his outstretched arm.[tpl]cite news|last=Bohni|first=Bandyopadhyay|title=Trains and filmi romance|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-20/news-interviews/40694737_1_train-chennai-express-yeh-jawaani-hai-deewani|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=20 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-19/news-interviews/29556472_1_aditya-chopra-salman-khan-scene |title=Salman steals SRK's DDLJ scene — Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= 19 May 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl] The Western-made film Slumdog Millionaire also contains a scene where a young girl and young boy replace the adults usually seen in the "train scene". Also unlike the original, the scene does not end happily; the boy pulls his hand away and the girl is left behind.
The film's popularity has also led to numerous other references in contemporary films.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112870/movieconnections |title=Movie connections for Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge |publisher=IMDB |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]
