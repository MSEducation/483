Armistead Jones Maupin, Jr.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012|comment=no citation yet for this being his full name[/tpl]Pronounced "Mawpin' as read in English, rather than rhyming with the French "Gauguin." "Armistead Maupin" is an anagram of 'Is a Man I Dreamt Up.' (Armistead Maupin Is a Man I Dreamt Up was the title of a 1990 BBC documentary on him.) However, neither the name nor Maupin himself were actually invented. He recalls: "One person even wrote: 'I know for a fact that you don't exist. You're really a lesbian collective in Marin County.' (Sometimes I feel like a lesbian collective in Marin County, but I'm not.)" See: Oft Asked Questions.

Tales of the City is a series of novels, the first portions of which were published initially as a newspaper serial starting on August 8, 1974, in a Marin County newspaper, The Pacific Sun, picked up in 1976 by the San Francisco Chronicle, and later reworked into the series of books published by HarperCollins (then Harper and Row). The first of Maupin's novels, entitled Tales of the City, was published in 1978. Five more followed in the 1980s, ending with the last book, Sure of You, in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060515202422/www.literarybent.com/totc_04_timeline_01.html |title=Tales of the City graphic timeline |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 15, 2006[/tpl] A seventh novel published in 2007, Michael Tolliver Lives, continues the story of some of the characters.

===Maybe the Moon and The Night Listener===

Maupin has written two novels, Maybe The Moon and The Night Listener, which are not part of the Tales canon, though both books occasionally glance in that direction.
Maybe The Moon is a story Maupin describes as 'partly autobiographical', despite the main character being a female heterosexual Jewish dwarf. The character was also based on his friend Tamara De Treaux, who played the title character in the 1982 film E.T. the Extra-TerrestrialBehind the scenes: THE OUTSIDER – San Francisco Focus Magazine], October 1992.

The Night Listener has been adapted into a movie that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in late January 2006 and released by Miramax the following August.

===Michael Tolliver Lives===

Prior to the 2007 release of Michael Tolliver Lives, Maupin had been quoted on his website as saying that another Tales of the City novel was unlikely.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060213145457/www.literarybent.com/oftasked_01.html |title=Oft Asked Questions |work=Literary Bent .com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=February 13, 2006[/tpl] Although Maupin originally stated that this novel was "NOT a sequel to Tales the City and it's certainly not Book 7 in the series,"[tpl]cite web |author=Armistead Maupin |url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780060761356&itm=1 |title=Michael Tolliver Lives |publisher=Search.barnesandnoble.com |year=2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013[/tpl] he later conceded that "I’ve stopped denying that this is book seven in Tales of the City, as it clearly is ... I suppose I didn’t want people to be thrown by the change in the format, as this is a first person novel unlike the third person format of the Tales of the City books and it’s about one character who interrelates with other characters. Having said that, it is still very much a continuation of the saga and I think I realised it was very much time for me to come back to this territory."[tpl]Cite web |url=http://news.pinkpaper.com/Feature.aspx?id=73|title=I might well come back to Mr Tolliver one more time |first=Steve|last=Bustin |publisher=PinkPaper.com |date=10 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716163144/http://news.pinkpaper.com/Feature.aspx?id=73|archivedate=10 June 2008[/tpl]

However, as soon as I started writing, I found that, one by one, all the other characters stepped forward and asked to be present. It felt natural, so I went with it.""Tolliver's Travels" – Entertainment Weekly, June 7, 2007 He calls it "a smaller, more personal novel than I've written in the past." The book was released on June 12, 2007, declared 'Michael Tolliver Day' by the mayor of San Francisco.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,2101187,00.html |title=Latest Maupin tale tells of 'closet of age' |publisher=The Guardian | location=London |deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]"Reader, he married him" – Review in The Guardian
