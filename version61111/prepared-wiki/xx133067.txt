[[SD Gundam Musha Generation]]

CATEGORIES: SD Gundam

[tpl]Nihongo|SD Gundam Musha Generation|SDガンダム ムシャジェネレーション[/tpl] is the twelfth work of the Musha Gundam series. The Comic Bom Bom version is of the same title. The comic is the last Musha Gundam work by Masahiro Kanda and it has yet to be published as takubon. Running period, 2000.

==Outline==

Different from the other works, the musha gundams appear as giant robot in this work. This work is announced when the popularity of the SD Gundam G Generation game series is at its peak. Thus Musha Generation took on the concept as a Musha version of G Generation. But the work suffered because of its difference from the previous works and it ended in half a year. The ending suggest connection to the SD Sengokuden timeline.
The plotline is based on that of Turn A Gundam. In an alternate reality, humans began excavating giant mechanical mushas.
For this work the katakana is used in place of the usual ateji for the machine names. The BB Senshi for this work uses the same mold with its G Generation counterpart but with extra musha style decorations and usage of transparent plastic. Thus most of the mecha appearing strongly resemble the original designs just with the minor additions of Musha style elements. Most of the mecha who are not released as BB Senshi can be recreated by fixing parts from previous BB Senshis to non-Musha SD kits.
The protagonist, Loran and Musha Turn A Gundam appeared in the game "SD Gundam G Generation-F". After Musha Generation, the Knight Gundam series using similar concepts announced their tenth work, SD Gundam Eiyuden.
