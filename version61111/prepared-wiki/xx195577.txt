==Reception==

IGN reviewer Hilary Goldstein gave the Xbox Live Arcade version of Sea Life Safari a 4.5/10 review, stating, "Sea Life Safari could have been a decent offering for children, but it falls short in far too many areas -- it's not educational, the photo analysis is inaccurate and it's not very fun."[tpl]cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/882/882158p1.html|title=IGN Sea Life Safari review|author=Hilary Goldstein|work=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-17|date=2008-06-16[/tpl] Team Xbox reviewer Andy Eddy was more kind, scoring the game an 8.1/10 and praising the presentation which "is a good feel for what it’s like to be underwater—though not too photorealistic to make it dull and boring for the little ones".[tpl]cite web|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1521/SeaLife-Safari/p1/|title=SeaLife Safari Review (Xbox 360)|author=Andy Eddy|work=Team Xbox|accessdate=2008-06-13|date=2008-06-13[/tpl]
