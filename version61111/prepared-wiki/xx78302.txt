[[Flag of Rwanda]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Africa, National symbols of Rwanda, 2001 introductions

The flag of Rwanda was adopted on October 25, 2001.

==Details==

The flag has four colours: blue, green, and two forms of yellow (standard yellow for the middle band and what the Pantone system calls "sun yellow" for the sun). The blue band represents happiness and peace, the yellow band symbolizes economic development, and the green band symbolizes the hope of prosperity. The sun represents enlightenment.
The new flag represents national unity, respect for work, heroism, and confidence in the future. It was adopted to avoid connotations to the 1994 genocide. The flag was designed by Alphonse Kirimobenecyo.

==Previous flag==

Rwanda's previous flag was a red-yellow-green tricolour with a large black letter "R" (to distinguish it from the otherwise identical Flag of Guinea). Derived from the flag of Ethiopia, the colours green, yellow, and red represented peace; the nation's hope for its development; and the people. The colours were associated with Pan-African colours. The flag was changed because it had become associated with the brutality of the 1994 genocide.
