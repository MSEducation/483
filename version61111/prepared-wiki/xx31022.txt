Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premiership packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn.

===Sky Digital===

In 1997, BSkyB formed a partnership with Carlton and Granada to bid for the right for the new digital terrestrial network.

Sky's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital,  At this time the use of the Sky brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, Sky competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which help bolstered Sky's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999. By June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave Sky 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected Sky’s 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Annual Report 2000
New Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering — However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.
Originally Sky launched with a set top box known as the Sky digibox, using the Slogans "What do you want to watch?", "Entertainment your way" and the current slogan "Believe in Better".Believe in Better sky.com In more recent years the Sky+ and Sky+ HD boxes have launched alongside the original box. Sky+ is a digital video recorder with an internal hard drive which allows viewers to 'pause live television' (by switching from a live feed to a paused real-time recording that can be restarted at any point) and schedule programs to record in the future. Sky launched HDTV services in May 2006. The first photos of a prototype Sky HD receiver began appearing in magazines in August 2005. All Sky+ HD receivers incorporate a version of Sky+ using a 300GB, 500GB, or 1TB hard drive (of which 160GB, 250GB or 500GB are available to the user) to accommodate the necessary extra data.
In February 2003 BSkyB wished to renegotiate its deal with MTV to reduce its payment from £20m. Chief executive Tony Ball said "We're definitely prepared to stare them down if we can't get a sensible deal, MTV, and other channels, have done particularly well out of the growth of Sky but the opportunity for savings is now there and Sky will be taking it," he added.

===Virgin Media dispute===

Virgin Media (re-branded in 2007 from NTL:Telewest) started to offer a high-definition television (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, BBC HD, after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial.

In 2007, BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV. The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007. Virgin claimed that Sky had substantially increased the asking price for the channels, a claim which Sky denied, on the basis that their new deal offered "substantially more value" by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable.[tpl]cite web|author=27 February 2007, 21:25 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a43250/in-full-latest-sky-statement-on-virgin-dispute.html |title=Sky statement on Virgin dispute |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501105224/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a43250/in-full-latest-sky-statement-on-virgin-dispute.html| archivedate= 1 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In response, Sky ran a number of TV, radio and print advertisements claiming that Virgin media 'doubted the value' of the channels concerned, at first urging Virgin customers to call their cable operator to show their support for Sky, but later urging Virgin customers to migrate to Sky to continue receiving the channels. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom subsequently found these commercials in breach of their code.[tpl]cite web|author=27 October 2008, 15:12 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a133816/ofcom-sky-breached-code-over-virgin-promos.html |title=Sky breached code over Virgin promotions |work=Digital Spy |location=UK |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501105234/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a133816/ofcom-sky-breached-code-over-virgin-promos.html| archivedate= 1 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The availability (at an extra charge) of Sky's premium sport and movie services was not affected by the dispute, and Sky Sports 3 was offered as a replacement to Sky 1 on many Virgin Media packages. This impasse continued for twenty-one months, with both companies initiating High Court proceedings.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6549541.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110512012236/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6549541.stm| archivedate= 12 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Amongst Virgin's claims to the courtRapture TV[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] (denied by Sky) were that Sky had unfairly reduced the amount which it paid to VMTV for the carriage of Virgin's own channels on satellite.Rapture TV[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Eventually, on 4 November 2008 it was announced that an agreement had been struck for Sky's basic channels – including Sky1, Sky2, Sky3, Sky News, Sky Sports News, Sky Arts 1, Sky Arts 2, Sky Real Lives and Sky Real Lives 2 to return to Virgin Media from 13 November 2008 until 12 June 2011. In exchange, Sky would be provided continued carriage of Virgin Media Television's channels – Living, Livingit, Bravo, Bravo +1, Trouble, Challenge and Virgin1 for the same period.[ref]
</ref>
The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets. Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by Sky. As part of the agreements, both Sky and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels.[ref]

On 4 June 2010, BSkyB and Virgin Media announced that they had reached agreement for the acquisition by Sky of Virgin Media Television.
Virgin1 was also a part of the deal but was rebranded as Channel One on 3 September 2010, as the Virgin name was not licensed to Sky.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/06/04/virgin-secures-new-sky-carriage-deal-after-vmtv-sale/|title=Virgin secures new Sky carriage deal after VMtv sale|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=4 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/05/bskyb-virgin1-channel-one|title=BSkyB rebrands Virgin1 as Channel One|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 August 2010  | first=Mark | last=Sweney[/tpl] The new carriage deals are understood to be for up to nine years.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jun/04/bskyb-buys-virgin-media-channels|title=BSkyB buys Virgin Media TV channels for £160m|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 June 2010  | first=Jason | last=Deans[/tpl]

Confirming it had reached its target, the broadcaster said its reach into 36% of households in the UK and Ireland represented an audience of more than 25m people. The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to Sky's direct-to-home service.

 "Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and BSkyB agenda under his and Mrs Brooks’ leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from BSkyB and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom. I rejected those policies." "Opposition Day - Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB," Hansard: 13 July 2011 - Column 400 
On 13 July 2011, MP Chris Bryant stated to the House of Commons, in the Parliamentary Debate on the Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB that the company was anti-competitive:
 "The company has lots of technological innovation that only a robust entrepreneur could to bring to British society, but it has also often been profoundly anti-competitive. I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface—the operating system—has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110713/debtext/110713-0004.htm |title=Hansard, House of Commons Debates 13 July 2011:Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB (Column 416-417) |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament.uk[/tpl]  

==Corporate==

===Management===

The first CEO of BSkyB was Sam Chisholm, who was CEO of Sky TV before the merger. Chisholm served in this position until 1997. He was followed by Mark Booth who was credited with leading the company through the introduction of Sky. Tony Ball was appointed in 1999 and completed the company's analogue to digital conversion. He is also credited with returning the company to profit and bringing subscriber numbers to new heights. In 2003, Ball announced his resignation and James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch was announced as his successor. This appointment caused allegations of nepotism from shareholders.[ref]

On 7 December 2007, it was announced that Rupert Murdoch would be stepping down as BSkyB's non-executive chairman and would be replaced by his son, James. In turn, James stepped down as CEO of BSkyB, to be replaced by Jeremy Darroch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=104016&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1085142 |title=BSkyB – Investor Relations – Press Release |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]

===Attempted takeover by News Corp===

In June 2010, News Corporation made a bid for complete ownership of BSkyB. However, following the News International phone hacking scandal, critics and politicians began to question the appropriateness of the proposed takeover. The resulting reaction forced News Corp. to withdraw its bid for the company in July 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14142307|title=News Corp withdraws bid for BSkyB|publisher=BBC|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011[/tpl]

===Stake in ITV===

ITV plc has been the subject of a flurry of rumored take-over and merger bids since it was formed.  For example, on 9 November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger.[ref]

</ref>  The merger was effectively blocked by BSkyB on 17 November 2006 when it controversially bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc for £940&nbsp;million,<ref>
