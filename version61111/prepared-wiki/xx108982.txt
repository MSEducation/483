==Biography==

===Education and early career===

After receiving his BA in education from the University of Missouri in 1962, McCartney was named as an assistant football coach under his older brother, Tom, in the summer of 1965 at Holy Redeemer High School in Detroit, Michigan. The younger McCartney was also the head basketball coach at Redeemer from 1965 to 1969, taking the school to the Detroit City Championship during the 1968–1969 season. McCartney then served as the head football and basketball coach at Divine Child High School in Dearborn, Michigan before becoming the only high school coach ever hired by University of Michigan coaching legend Bo Schembechler.

===Head coach at Colorado===

After eight years as an assistant at Michigan, McCartney was hired to replace Chuck Fairbanks as head coach at the University of Colorado on June 9, 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=205304894&DB_OEM_ID=600 |title=Series Classic: Mac's First 'W' Was In '82 Vs. Wazzu - CUBuffs.com - Official Athletics Web site of the University of Colorado |publisher=CUBuffs.com |date= |accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl] In his first season in 1982, the Colorado Buffaloes compiled a record of 2–8–1. After improving to 4–7 in 1983, Colorado sustained a 1–10 campaign in 1984, but McCartney was given a contract extension nonetheless. In his fourth season in 1985, McCartney guided the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a berth in the Freedom Bowl, where they lost to the Washington Huskies. In the following season, 1986, McCartney's team earned its first victory over Big Eight Conference powerhouse Nebraska since 1967. After modestly successful seasons in 1987 and 1988, McCartney steered his team toward national prominence.
After the 1988 season, the Buffaloes' star quarterback Sal Aunese was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He died in the middle of the 1989 season. Nonetheless, Colorado won all 11 of its regular season games including victories over ranked Washington, Illinois, Nebraska, and Oklahoma teams. The Buffaloes faced Notre Dame on January 1, 1990 in the Orange Bowl, where they lost 21–6.
Colorado opened the 1990 season ranked fourth with a game against Tennessee in the inaugural Disney Pigskin Classic played in Anaheim, California. The contest ended in a 31–31 tie. A comeback win against Stanford and a one-point loss to Illinois leveled the Buffaloes' record at 1–1–1. Colorado then won the remainder of their regular season games. Their winning streak, highlighted by wins over ranked Washington, Oklahoma, and Nebraska opponents, was not without controversy. In a game against Missouri on October 6, referees mistakenly allowed an extra down on which Colorado scored the winning touchdown as time expired. The game, known as the Fifth Down Game, became one of the most notorious officiating gaffes in college football history. Contentions notwithstanding, Colorado rose to #1 in the rankings and once again faced Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. The Buffaloes won a closely played game 10–9, aided by a controversial clipping call that negated a late punt return touchdown by Rocket Ismail of Notre Dame,[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1118753/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=January 14, 1991[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-01-01/sports/9601010154_1_orange-bowl-stadium-hurricanes-home-field-joe-robbie-stadium | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Numerous Clip-and-save Memories At Orange Bowl | first=Joseph | last=Tybor | date=January 1, 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cfn.scout.com/2/598004.html |title=Scout.com: Top Heisman Non-Winners, Mistakes, & More |publisher=Cfn.scout.com |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl] and earned a share of the national title. Colorado was voted #1 by in AP Poll while Georgia Tech was voted the top ranking in the Coaches' Poll.
The following year, the Buffaloes tied Nebraska for the Big Eight title and lost to Alabama in the Blockbuster Bowl. In 1992, Colorado finished a 9–2–1 campaign with a loss to Syracuse in the Fiesta Bowl. In 1994, McCartney's final year, he coached the Buffaloes to a victory at Michigan, where McCartney had spent eight years as an assistant. Colorado won the game 27–26 on a 64-yard Hail Mary pass from Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook as time expired, which has since become known as The Miracle at Michigan. The Buffaloes posted an 11–1 record in 1994, capped by a win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. At the end of the 1994 season, McCartney retired from coaching.
McCartney holds records for the most games coached (153), most wins (93), and most conference wins (58) in the history of the Colorado Buffaloes football program.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/pdf7/39577.pdf?SPSID=3860&SPID=255&DB_OEM_ID=600 | title=2006 Colorado Buffaloes Media Guide, Records section | publisher=CUBuffs.com | accessdate=2007-01-05 | format=PDF[/tpl]
