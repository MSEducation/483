HMS ''Hogue'' (D74) was a Battle-class destroyer of the Royal Navy that was commissioned during the Second World War. She was named after the Battle of La Hogue, fought between the British and French in 1692. 
Hogue was built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead during the Second World and launched on 21 April 1944. After being commissioned on 24 July 1945, Hogue joined the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet.Mason, Geoffrey B. (2004), Service History of Royal Navy warships in World War 2: HMS HOGUE (H.74) - Battle-class Destroyer, naval-history.net. Retrieved 31 August 2010. She remained on station until withdrawn from service in 1947 and placed in reserve.
Selected for modernisation and refitted, Hogue returned to service in 1957 with the 1st Destroyer Squadron in  the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. With sister-ships Lagos and Solebay, Hogue patrolled the waters around Iceland.Yuletide Fare in "Drop" by Shackletons, The Glasgow Herald, 22 December 1958, p. 2 She operated against the Icelandic Coast Guard during the First Cod War. In September, it was claimed by Iceland that she had collided with the trawler Northern Foam while trying to prevent her being boarded by the Maria Julia.Trawler Hits Destroyer off Island, The Age, 1 October, p. 3. 
In 1959, Hogue almost collided while refuelling with the aircraft carrier [tpl]HMS|Centaur|R06|6[/tpl] in the Bay of Biscay.  Wettern, Desmond (1982), The decline of British seapower, p. 179.   She was used with [tpl]HMS|Cavalier|R73|6[/tpl] to depict the destroyer night attacks in the film "Sink the Bismarck!".     While participating in a night-time exercise with other navies off Ceylon on 25 August, Hogue collided with the Indian light cruiser INS Mysore (formerly HMS Nigeria). The Mysore rammed into Hogue, effectively crushing the destroyer's bow,Ships monthly, p. 11 killing a sailor and wounding three others.Wettern, Desmond (1982), The decline of British seapower, p. 171 So extensive was the damage that she was maintained in Singapore until broken up there in 1962, having been deemed to be a "Constructive Total Loss".
