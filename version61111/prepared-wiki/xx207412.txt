CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1888, Oaths of allegiance

The Oaths Act 1888 (51 & 52 Vict. c.46) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which set out provisions whereby the oath of allegiance taken to the Sovereign may be solemnly affirmed rather than sworn to God.  The Act was the culmination of a campaign by the noted atheist and secularist MP Charles Bradlaugh to take his seat.  It was a significant piece of secularist legislation. The Act was consolidated and repealed by the Oaths Act 1978.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/19/introduction
