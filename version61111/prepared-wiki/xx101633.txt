CATEGORIES: Children of Bodom albums, 1999 live albums

Tokyo Warhearts is the first live album by the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom which was recorded in 1999. It was recorded and filmed on July 10 and 11 of 1999 in Tokyo. The album was re-released on May 29, 2001. The band and their record label, Spinefarm Records, had plans to release the show as a DVD along with the CD, but they reached the conclusion that there were some mismatches between the video and the audio, as there was video footage from two different shows.
Two of the songs from this album have been released separately for promotional purposes and can be found on a Spinefarm DVD compilation: Silent Night, Bodom Night and Deadnight Warrior.
Track 1 covers a segment of Jan Hammer's "Crockett's Theme" from the Miami Vice soundtrack. At the end of track 6 a brief part of the riff of "Crazy Nights" by Loudness is played. Loudness is a Japanese band. They later covered the song and released it as a bonus track with the album Halo of Blood. The intro for track 9 is a strain of music called "Hummel Gets the Rockets" which was composed by Hans Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith for the 1996 film The Rock.
