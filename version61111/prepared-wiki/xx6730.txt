Baum has been credited as the editor of In Other Lands Than Ours (1907), a collection of letters written by his wife Maud Gage Baum.Facsimile edition, Delmar, NY, Scholars' Facsimiles & Reprints, 1983. ISBN 978-0-8201-1385-2

===Plays and adaptations===

Including those listed here and on the Oz books page, Michael Patrick Hearn has identified 42 titles of stage plays associated with Baum, some probably redundant or reflective of alternate drafts[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl], many for works that Baum may never have actually started.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]  Listed below are those either known to have been performed (such as the lost plays of his youth) or that exist in at least fragmentary or treatment form.
The Book Collector's Guide to L. Frank Baum and Oz by Paul R. Bienvenue and Robert E. Schmidt asserts in its entry on Manuel Weldman's edition of The Uplift of Lucifer that the two titles belong to the same work.[/ref]

===The Wizard of Oz on screen and back to stage===

Following early film treatments in 1910 and 1925 and Baum's own venture The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, Metro Goldwyn Mayer made the story into the now classic movie The Wizard of Oz (1939), starring Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale. It was only MGM's second feature-length film in three-strip Technicolor (the first having been Sweethearts (1938), based on the Victor Herbert operetta).  Among other changes the film was given an all-a-dream ending.  (Baum used this technique only once, in Mr. Woodchuck, and in that case the title character explicitly told the dreamer numerous times that she was dreaming.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl])
A completely new Tony Award-winning Broadway musical with an African-American cast, The Wiz, was staged in 1975 with Stephanie Mills as Dorothy.  It was the basis for a 1978 film by the same title starring Diana Ross as an adult Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow.
The Wizard of Oz continues to inspire new versions, such as Disney's Return to Oz (1985), The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, Tin Man (a re-imagining of the story televised in late 2007 on the Sci Fi Channel), and a variety of animated productions. Today's most successful Broadway show, Wicked, provides a backstory to the two Oz witches used in the classic MGM film. Gregory Maguire, author of the novel, Wicked, on which the musical is based, chose to honor L. Frank Baum by naming his main character Elphabaâ€”a phonetic take on Baum's initials.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) serves as an homage to MGM's film, The Wizard of Oz (1939),[tpl]cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brookes|title=One More Trip to Land of Oz|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/business/media/disney-gambles-on-box-office-wizardry-of-oz.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=March 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2013[/tpl] and stars James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams.
