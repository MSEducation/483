In 1843 he took over the company Brusveen Spiger- og Staaltraadfabrikk, founded by his father-in-law Hans Schikkelstad in 1832. It was located along the river Hunnselva in Vardal. Upon the takeover, Ole Mustad changed the name of the company to O. Mustad. He gradually expanded from wire and nail production to running a foundry and a sawmill. In 1874 his son Hans Mustad became co-owner, and the company name was changed to O. Mustad & Søn. The nail production was moved to Kristiania in 1876; instead the factory at Vardal started specializing in fish hook production.Timeline - Mustad.noHistory - Mustad Eiendom The company eventually became the world's largest producer of fish hooks.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Mustad & Søn AS, O. |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=686497 [/tpl]
