Since 1990[tpl]cite web | format = PDF | url = http://www.szasz.com/cv.pdf | title = Curriculum vitæ | publisher = Szasz[/tpl]. he had been professor emeritus of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. He was a well-known social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, and of the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as of scientism. His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments with which he is most associated.
Szasz argued that mental illnesses are not real in the sense that cancers are real. Except for a few identifiable brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, there are “neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying or  falsifying DSM diagnoses", i.e. there are no objective methods for detecting the presence or absence of mental illness.[tpl]cite web |title=Psychiatry:The Science of Lies |author= Thomas Szasz |year=2008 |pages=2–5 [/tpl]
His views on special treatment followed from libertarian roots which are based on the principles that each person has the right to bodily and mental self-ownership and the right to be free from violence from others, although he criticized the "Free World" as well as the communist states for their use of psychiatry. He believed that suicide, the practice of medicine, the use and sale of drugs and sexual relations should be private, contractual, and legal.
In 1973 the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year,[tpl]cite web | title = The Humanist of the Year|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year|publisher = American Humanist Association|accessdate=May 1, 2012[/tpl] and in 1979 he was honored with an honorary doctorate in behavioral science at Universidad Francisco Marroquín.[tpl]cite web| title = Honorary doctoral degrees|url= https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/Honorary_Doctoral_Degrees| publisher = Universidad Francisco Marroquín |accessdate=May 1, 2012[/tpl]

==Life==

Szasz was born to Jewish parents Gyula and Lily Szász on April 15, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary. In 1938, Szasz moved to the United States, where he attended the University of Cincinnati for his Bachelor of Science in medicine, and received his M.D. from the same university in 1944.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ftrbooks.net/psych/bios/thomas_szasz.htm |title=Thomas Stephen Szasz biography – psychiatrist, libertarian, renegade to psychiatry |publisher=FTR books |date=October 19, 1951 |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl] Szasz completed his residency requirement at the Cincinnati General Hospital, then worked at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1951–56, and then for the next five years was a member of its staff – taking 24 months out for duty with the U.S. Naval Reserve.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.szasz.com/intro.html | title = Introduction |publisher=Szasz |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl]
In 1962 Szasz received a tenured position in medicine at the State University of New York.article on Szasz  Szasz had first joined SUNY in 1956.
Szasz's views of psychiatry were influenced by the writings of Frigyes Karinthy.

==The rise of Szasz's arguments==

Szasz first presented his attack on "mental illness" as a legal term in 1958 in the Columbia Law Review. In his article he argued that mental illness was no more a fact bearing on a suspect's guilt than is possession by the devil.New Atlantis article on Szasz
In 1961 Szasz gave testimony before a United States Senate Committee in which he argued that the use of mental hospitals to incarcerate people defined as insane violated the general assumptions of patient-and-doctor relationships and turned the doctor into a warden and a keeper of a prison.ibid

==Szasz's main arguments==

As Szasz said, having become convinced of the metaphorical character of mental disorders, the frequent injuriousness of psychiatric treatments, the immorality of psychiatric coercions and excuses, he set himself a task to delegitimize the legitimating agencies and authorities and their vast powers, enforced by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, mental health laws, mental health courts, and mental health sentences.[tpl]cite journal|last=Phillips|first=James et al.|title=The Six Most Essential Questions in Psychiatric Diagnosis: A Pluralogue.

Szasz was a critic of the influence of modern medicine on society, which he considered to be the secularisation of religion's hold on humankind. Criticizing scientism, he targeted in particular psychiatry, underscoring its campaigns against masturbation at the end of the 19th century, its use of medical imagery and language to describe misbehavior, its reliance on involuntary mental hospitalization to protect society, or the use of lobotomy and other interventions to treat psychosis. To sum up his description of the political influence of medicine in modern societies imbued by faith in science, he declared:
 Since theocracy is the rule of God or its priests, and democracy the rule of the people or of the majority, pharmacracy is therefore the rule of medicine or of doctors.T. Szasz, Ceremonial Chemistry, 1974 
Szasz consistently paid attention to the power of language in the establishment and maintenance of the social order, both in small interpersonal as well as wider socio-political spheres:
 The struggle for definition is veritably the struggle for life itself. In the typical Western two men fight desperately for the possession of a gun that has been thrown to the ground: whoever reaches the weapon first shoots and lives; his adversary is shot and dies. In ordinary life, the struggle is not for guns but for words; whoever first defines the situation is the victor; his adversary, the victim. For example, in the family, husband and wife, mother and child do not get along; who defines whom as troublesome or mentally sick?...one who first seizes the word imposes reality on the other; one who defines thus dominates and lives; and one who is defined is subjugated and may be killed.The Second Sin. New York: Doubleday, 1973  
His main arguments can be summarised as follows:

==="The myth of mental illness"===

"Mental illness" is an expression, a metaphor that describes an offending, disturbing, shocking, or vexing conduct, action, or pattern of behavior, such as schizophrenia, as an "illness" or "disease". Szasz wrote: "If you talk to God, you are praying; If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic." While people behave and think in ways that are very disturbing, and that may resemble a disease process (pain, deterioration, response to various interventions), this does not mean they actually have a disease. To Szasz, disease can only mean something people "have," while behavior is what people "do". Diseases are "malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain" while "no behavior or misbehavior is a disease or can be a disease. That's not what diseases are." Szasz cited drapetomania as an example of a behavior which many in society did not approve of, being labeled and widely cited as a 'disease'; likewise, women who did not bend to a man's will were said to have hysteria.Psychiatry REVEALED!! Psychiatry actively obscures the difference between (mis)behavior and disease, in its quest to help or harm parties in conflicts. By calling certain people "diseased", psychiatry attempts to deny them responsibility as moral agents, in order to better control them.
People who are said (by themselves or others) to have a mental illness can only have, at best, a "fake disease." Diagnoses of "mental illness" or "mental disorder" (the latter expression called by Szasz a "weasel term" for mental illness) are passed off as "scientific categories" but they remain merely judgments (judgments of disdain) to support certain uses of power by psychiatric authorities. In that line of thinking, schizophrenia is not the name of a disease entity but a judgment of extreme psychiatric and social reprobation. Szasz calls schizophrenia "the sacred symbol of psychiatry" because those so labeled have long provided and continue to provide justification for psychiatric theories, treatments, abuses, and reforms. The figure of the psychotic or schizophrenic person to psychiatric experts and authorities, according to Szasz, is analogous with the figure of the heretic or blasphemer to theological experts and authorities. According to Szasz, to understand the metaphorical nature of the term "disease" in psychiatry, one must first understand its literal meaning in the rest of medicine. To be a true disease, the entity must first, somehow be capable of being approached, measured, or tested in scientific fashion. Second, to be confirmed as a disease, a condition must demonstrate pathology at the cellular or molecular level.
A genuine disease must also be found on the autopsy table (not merely in the living person) and meet pathological definition instead of being voted into existence by members of the American Psychiatric Association. "Mental illnesses" are really problems in living. They are often "like a" disease, argued Szasz, which makes the medical metaphor understandable, but in no way validates it as an accurate description or explanation. Psychiatry is a pseudo-science that parodies medicine by using medical sounding words invented especially over the last 100 years. To be clear, heart break and heart attack, or spring fever and typhoid fever belong to two completely different logical categories, and treating one as the other constitutes a category error, that is, a myth. Psychiatrists are the successors of "soul doctors", priests who dealt and deal with the spiritual conundrums, dilemmas, and vexations – the "problems in living" – that have troubled people forever.
Psychiatry's main methods are those of conversation or rhetoric, repression, and religion. To the extent that psychiatry presents these problems as "medical diseases," its methods as "medical treatments," and its clients – especially involuntary – as medically ill patients, it embodies a lie and therefore constitutes a fundamental threat to freedom and dignity. Psychiatry, supported by the State through various Mental Health Acts, has become a modern secular state religion according to Szasz. It is a vastly elaborate social control system, using both brute force and subtle indoctrination, which disguises itself under the claims of scientificity.

===The "patient" as malingerer===

According to Szasz, the many manifestations of so-called ″mental illness″ are essentially malingering. The so-called ″patient″ has something personally significant to communicate—their "problems in living"—but unable to express this via conventional means they resort to illness-imitation behaviour, a somatic protolanguage—a "body language—which psychiatrists and psychologists have misguidedly interpreted as the signs/symptoms of real illness.[tpl]cite book| last1 =  Szasz| first1 = Thomas S.| title = The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct| edition = revised| year = 1974| publisher = Harper & Row Publishers| location = New York| isbn = 0060911514| chapter = 7 Language and Protolanguage| pages = 117–19| url = http://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Myth_of_Mental_Illness.html?id=x__aAAAAMAAJ|quote=The significance of the affective use of body language—or generally, of the language of illness—can hardly be exaggerated...It is part of our social ethic that we ought to feel sorry for sick people and should try to be helpful to them. Communications by means of body signs may therefore be intended mainly to induce the following sorts of feelings in the recipient: "Aren't you sorry for me now?  You should be ashamed of yourself for having hurt me so!  You should be sad seeing how I suffer..." and so forth...The flamboyant "schizophrenic body feelings" encountered today, represent communications in the contexts of specific social situations. Their aim is to induce mood rather than to convey information. They thus make the recipient of the message feel as if he had been told: "Pay attention to me!  Pity me!  Scold me!" and so forth...Children and women often can get their way with tears where their words would fall on deaf ears—and so can patients with symptoms. The point is that when some persons in some situations cannot make themselves heard by means of ordinary language—for example, speech or writing—they may try to make themselves heard by means of protolanguage, for example, weeping or "symptoms"...We have come thus to speak of all these silent and not-so-silent cries and commands, pleas and reproaches—that is, of all these endlessly diverse "utterances"—as so many different menal illnesses![/tpl]

===Separation of psychiatry and the state===

If we accept that "mental illness" is a euphemism for behaviors that are disapproved of, then the state has no right to force psychiatric "treatment" on these individuals. Similarly, the state should not be able to interfere in mental health practices between consenting adults (for example, by legally controlling the supply of psychotropic drugs or psychiatric medication). The medicalization of government produces a "therapeutic state," designating someone as "insane" or as a "drug addict."
In Ceremonial Chemistry (1973), he argued that the same persecution which has targeted witches, Jews, Gypsies or homosexuals now targets "drug addicts" and "insane" people. Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as example obesity: instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts, and the social injunction not to be overweight is to be considered as a moral order, not as a scientific advice as it claims to be. As with those thought bad (insane people), those who took the wrong drugs (drug-addicts), medicine created a category for those who had the wrong weight (obeses).
Szasz argued that psychiatrics were created in the 17th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of social behavior; a new specialization, drogophobia, was created in the 20th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics, was created to deal with those who erred from the medical norms concerning the weight which the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970, the American Society of Bariatic Physicians (from the Greek baros, for "weight")  had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.

===Presumption of competence===

Just as legal systems work on the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty, individuals accused of crimes should not be presumed incompetent simply because a doctor or psychiatrist labels them as such. Mental incompetence should be assessed like any other form of incompetence, i.e., by purely legal and judicial means with the right of representation and appeal by the accused.

===Death control===

In an analogy to birth control, Szasz argued that individuals should be able to choose when to die without interference from medicine or the state, just as they are able to choose when to conceive without outside interference. He considered suicide to be among the most fundamental rights, but he opposed state-sanctioned euthanasia. In his 2006 book about Virginia Woolf he stated that she put an end to her life by a conscious and deliberate act, her suicide being an expression of her freedom of choice.http://www.szasz.com/woolf.html"The Nazis sought to prevent Jewish suicides. Wherever Jews tried to kill themselves – in their homes, in hospitals, on the deportation trains, in the concentration camps – the Nazi authorities would invariably intervene in order to save the Jews' lives, wait for them to recover, and then send them to their prescribed deaths."66 http://www.werkblatt.at/archiv/39PytellE.htm quotation from Kwiet, K.:  "Suicide in the Jewish Community," in Leo Baeck Yearbook, vol. 38. 1993.

===Abolition of the insanity defense===

Szasz believed that testimony about the mental competence of a defendant should not be admissible in trials. Psychiatrists testifying about the mental state of an accused person's mind have about as much business as a priest testifying about the religious state of a person's soul in our courts. Insanity was a legal tactic invented to circumvent the punishments of the Church, which, at the time included confiscation of the property of those who committed suicide, which often left widows and orphans destitute. Only an insane person would do such a thing to his widow and children, it was successfully argued. Legal mercy masquerading as medicine, said Szasz.

===Abolition of involuntary hospitalization===

No one should be deprived of liberty unless he is found guilty of a criminal offense. Depriving a person of liberty for what is said to be his own good is immoral. Just as a person suffering from terminal cancer may refuse treatment, so should a person be able to refuse psychiatric treatment.

===A person's right to drugs===

Drug addiction is not a "disease" to be cured through legal drugs but a social habit. Szasz also argues in favor of a drugs free-market. He criticized the war on drugs, arguing that using drugs was in fact a victimless crime. Prohibition itself constituted the crime. He argued that the war on drugs leads states to do things that would have never been considered half a century before, such as prohibiting a person from ingesting certain substances or interfering in other countries to impede the production of certain plants (e.g. coca eradication plans, or the campaigns against opium; both are traditional plants opposed by the Western world). Although Szasz was skeptical about the merits of psychotropic medications, he favored the repeal of drug prohibition.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Szasz also drawn analogies between the persecution of the drug-using minority and the persecution of Jewish and homosexual minorities. The Nazis spoke of having a "Jewish problem." We now speak of having a drug-abuse problem. Actually, "Jewish problem" was the name the Germans gave to their persecution of the Jews; "drug-abuse problem" is the name we give to the persecution of people who use certain drugs.The Second Sin (1973), p. 64 Szasz cites Rep. James M. Hanley referring to drug users as "vermin," using "the same metaphor for condemning persons who use or sell illegal drugs that the Nazis used to justify murdering Jews by poison gas—namely, that the persecuted persons are not human beings, but 'vermin.'"Ceremonial Chemistry (1974), p. 15

==Therapeutic State==

The "Therapeutic State" is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baker|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert A. Baker|title=Psychiatry's Gentleman Abolitionist|journal=The Independent Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=VII|issue=3|pages=455–460|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_baker.pdf|accessdate=February 12, 2012|issn=1086-1653[/tpl] The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the "therapeutic state", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions.Reason Magazine – Curing the Therapeutic State: Thomas Szasz interviewed by Jacob Sullum[tpl]cite book|last=Costigan|first=Lucy|title=Social Awareness in Counselling|year=2004|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0-595-75523-2|page=17|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wfCesrlvK-gC&pg=PA17[/tpl][tpl]rp|17[/tpl] Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.[tpl]rp|17[/tpl] When faced with demands for measures to curtail smoking in public, binge-drinking, gambling or obesity, ministers say that "we must guard against charges of nanny statism."[tpl]cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mike|title=From 'nanny state' to 'therapeutic state'|journal=The British Journal of General Practice|date=August 2004|volume=1|issue=54(505)|page=645|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1324868|accessdate=January 19, 2012|pmc=1324868|pmid=15517694[/tpl] The "nanny state" has turned into the "therapeutic state" where nanny has given way to counselor. Nanny just told people what to do; counselors also tell them what to think and what to feel. The "nanny state" was punitive, austere, and authoritarian, the therapeutic state is touchy-feely, supportive – and even more authoritarian.
According to Szasz, "the therapeutic state swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion."[tpl]cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|title=The Therapeutic State: The Tyranny of Pharmacracy|journal=The Independent Review|date=Spring 2001|volume=V|issue=4|pages=485–521|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_05_4_szasz.pdf|accessdate=January 20, 2012|issn=1086-1653[/tpl][tpl]rp|515[/tpl] Faced with the problem of "madness," Western individualism proved to be ill prepared to defend the rights of the individual: modern man has no more right to be a madman than medieval man had a right to be a heretic because if once people agree that they have identified the one true God, or Good, it brings about that they have to guard members and nonmembers of the group from the temptation to worship false gods or goods.[tpl]rp|496[/tpl] A secularization of God and the medicalization of good resulted in the post-Enlightenment version of this view: once people agree that they have identified the one true reason, it brings about that they have to guard against the temptation to worship unreason – that is, madness.[tpl]rp|496[/tpl]
Civil libertarians warn that the marriage of the State with psychiatry could have catastrophic consequences for civilization.Bush’s Brave New World In the same vein as the separation of church and state, Szasz believes that a solid wall must exist between psychiatry and the State.

==American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization==

Believing that psychiatric hospitals are like prisons not hospitals and that psychiatrists who subject others to coercion function as judges and jailers not physicians,[tpl]cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|title=The myth of mental illness: 50 years later|journal=The Psychiatrist|year=2011|volume=35|pages=179–182|doi=10.1192/pb.bp.110.031310|url=http://www.psychiatry.freeuk.com/Szasz50.pdf|accessdate=April 27, 2012|issue=5[/tpl] Szasz has made efforts to abolish involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for over two decades, and in 1970 took a part in founding the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH).[tpl]cite book|last=Fuller Torrey|first=Edwin|authorlink=Edwin Fuller Torrey|title=Surviving schizophrenia: a family manual|year=1988|publisher=Perennial Library|isbn=0-06-055119-4|page=315|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uYJHAAAAMAAJ[/tpl] Its founding was announced by Szasz in 1971 on the American Journal of Psychiatry[tpl]cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|title=American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=June 1, 1971|volume=127|issue=12|page=1698|pmid=5565860|publisher=American Psychiatry Association[/tpl] and American Journal of Public Health.[tpl]cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|title=To the editor|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1971|volume=61|page=1076|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jVUqAQAAMAAJ|publisher=American Public Health Association|doi=10.2105/AJPH.61.6.1076-a|issue=6[/tpl] The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, The Abolitionist.[tpl]cite book|title=Szasz Under Fire: A Psychiatric Abolitionist Faces His Critics|year=2004|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=0-8126-9568-2|page=xiv|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ts6cxoiO-o4C&pg=PR14|editor=Schaler, Jeffrey[/tpl]

==Relationship to Citizens Commission on Human Rights==

In 1969, Szasz and the Church of Scientology co-founded the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments. Szasz served on CCHR's Board of Advisors as Founding Commissioner.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cchr.org/index.cfm/7075 |title=CCHR's Board of Advisors |work=Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) |accessdate=July 29, 2006[/tpl] In the keynote address at the 25th anniversary of CCHR, Szasz stated, "We should all honor CCHR because it is really the organization that for the first time in human history has organized a politically, socially, internationally significant voice to combat psychiatry. This has never been done in human history before."Scientology – Church of Scientology Official Site In a 2009 interview aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Szasz explained his reason for collaborating with CCHR and lack of involvement with Scientology:
 Well I got affiliated with an organisation long after I was established as a critic of psychiatry, called Citizens Commission for Human Rights, because they were then the only organisation and they still are the only organisation who had money and had some access to lawyers and were active in trying to free mental patients who were incarcerated in mental hospitals with whom there was nothing wrong, who had committed no crimes, who wanted to get out of the hospital. And that to me was a very worthwhile cause; it's still a very worthwhile cause. I no more believe in their religion or their beliefs than I believe in the beliefs of any other religion. I am an atheist, I don't believe in Christianity, in Judaism, in Islam, in Buddhism and I don't believe in Scientology. I have nothing to do with Scientology.Broadcasting Corporation, http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/thomas-szasz-speaks-part-2-of-2/3138880, All In The Mind,URL accessed January 2, 2013. 

==Criticism==

===Kendell's critique===

Kendell presents (in Schaler (2005)) a critique of Szasz's conception of disease and the contention that mental illness is "mythical" as presented in The Myth of Mental Illness. Kendell's arguments include the following:
