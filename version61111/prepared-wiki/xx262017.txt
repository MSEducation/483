[[Nearly Kähler manifold]]

CATEGORIES: Topology, Differential geometry, Manifolds

In particular, a Kähler manifold is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true.

In applications, it is apparent that nearly Kähler manifolds are most interesting in dimension 6; in 2002. Paul-Andi Nagy
proved that indeed any strict and complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over Kähler manifolds and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds.
Nearly Kähler manifolds are an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with
parallel totally antisymmetric torsion
A nearly Kähler manifold should not be confused with an almost Kähler manifold.
