Warburg Dillon Read was an investment bank created by the Swiss Bank Corporation ("SBC"), following its 1997 acquisition of S. G. Warburg & Co. which it merged with Dillon, Read & Co., a firm it had acquired in 1995.  SBC itself merged with the Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, creating UBS AG.   Warburg Dillon Read was subsequently renamed UBS Warburg and eventually just UBS Investment Bank.
