John Biagio Rebecca (died 1847), the son of Italian-born decorative painter Biagio Rebecca (1735–1808), was an architect of many buildings in Sussex and London.[tpl]sfn|Colvin|1954|p=not cited[/tpl] He lived in London's Leicester Square from 1825 to 1827[tpl]sfn|Sheppard|1966|pp=507–514[/tpl] but many of his buildings were built in the seaside town of Worthing in Sussex and he is credited[tpl]by whom|date=December 2011[/tpl] as being the town's principal Georgian architect. 
In Worthing Rebecca designed St. Paul's Chapel of Ease (now St. Paul's Church), Beach House and 19-20 Marine Parade, which housed Stafford's Marine Library in the 19th century. 19 Marine Parade was known as Rebecca House as it was believed that the architect himself stayed in the building.[tpl]sfn|Elleray|1998|p=not cited[/tpl] Rebecca was also the architect of Worthing's Royal Baths (now demolished) and several other buildings around the town.[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=105–108[/tpl] The Royal Sea House in Worthing, later the Royal Hotel, with Ionic columns and pilasters was rebuilt to Rebecca's designs in 1829 (and destroyed by fire in 1901).[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=105–108[/tpl]
Rebecca designed Castle Goring at Goring-by-Sea for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. Howard Colvin called the house "an extraordinary fantasy, suavely neo-classical on one side and romantically castellated on the other".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Around 1813–16Colvin noted a contract at Knebworth dated 18 September 1813.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Rebecca designed the facade of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Also in the 1820s he restored Penshurst Place, Kent, in Tudor Gothic style, and it was probably to Rebecca's designs that Sir John Shelley Sidney rebuilt the Sidney Chapel.[tpl]sfn|Colvin|1954|p=not cited[/tpl]
Around 1820 Buckingham House (originally 'Buckinghams' or 'Buckingham Place') in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex was rebuilt to John Rebecca's designs.[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=149–154[/tpl] Its grounds are now Buckingham Park but the house itself lies in ruins.[tpl]cite web |url= http://shoreham.adur.org.uk/buckingham_house.htm |work=Shoreham by Sea |title=Shoreham – Buckingham House |publisher=Pastfinder |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl]
