The R1 was the first New York City Subway car type built for the IND. 300 cars were manufactured between 1930 and 1931 by the American Car and Foundry Company, numbered 100 through 399. Future passenger stock orders – including contracts R4, R6, R7, R7A, and R9 – were virtually identical, with minor mechanical and cosmetic variations. Therefore, these car classes are frequently referred to collectively as Arnines, or R1-9s.
The R1s were also specifically sometimes referred to as City Cars.
They introduced several improvements to subway car design that greatly sped up the flow of passengers in and out of trains.

==Service History and Preservation==

The first R1 cars to see passenger service were twenty individual cars to serve for two 8 car trains plus spares that were placed in revenue service on the BMT Sea Beach Line from July to November, 1931 for testing and then returned to the IND the same year.http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?47727 The BMT was to have been paid by the City of New York for the testing but since they were fairly extensively used in service (made up as two 8-car trains), the BMT and City called it even.
Most R1s were retired between 1969 and 1970 and were replaced by the R42s, but some remained later into the 1970s until those cars were retired and replaced by the R44s. Following their removal from service, the majority of the fleet was scrapped. Few cars remained as work cars and were used until the 1980s. Several other cars have been preserved and remain today, including:

==Description==

The R1s were the first "R" type contract order (referring to the practice of naming a car class by the letter "R" - which stands for revenue - followed by a number derived from the actual contract number). Note: The R2 contract order was for trucks and motors for the R1 fleet. In 1930, each new car cost $39,201: $30,483 for the carbody under contract R1, and $8,718 for trucks and motors under contract R2.
