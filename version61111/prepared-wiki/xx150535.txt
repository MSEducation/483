[[Sistrurus miliarius barbouri]]

CATEGORIES: Crotalinae

Sistrurus miliarius barbouri is a venomous pitviper subspecies[tpl]ITIS |id=209507 |taxon=Sistrurus miliarius barbouri |accessdate=1 March 2007[/tpl] endemic to the southeastern United States.

==Etymology==

The subspecific name, barbouri, is in honor of American herpetologist Thomas Barbour.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011. The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. ISBN 978-1-4214-0135-5. (Sistrurus miliarius barbouri, p. 16).

==Description==

left|thumb|240px|S. m. barbouri Adults grow to between [tpl]convert|35.5|and|76|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in total length, which includes the tail (Klauber, 1943). In a study that involved 103 males and 80 females, the average total length was [tpl]convert|53.5|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Snellings and Collins (1997) reported a specimen measuring [tpl]convert|80.3|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in total length, but it had been in captivity for over 12 years. The largest reported by Gloyd (1940) was one measuring [tpl]convert|63.8|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in total length from St. Petersburg, Florida.Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp. 1500 plates. ISBN 0-8014-4141-2.
Regarding the coloration, this subspecies has dorsal spots that are more rounded, usually has a whitish belly that is heavily flecked or mottled with black or dark brown, and generally has 23 rows of dorsal scales at midbody.

==Common names==

Florida ground rattlesnake, southeastern ground rattlesnake, pigmy rattlesnake, Barbour's pigmy rattlesnake, dusky pigmy rattlesnake, ground rattlesnake, hog-nosed rattler, pigmy ground rattlesnake, pigmy rattler, small rattlesnake.

==Geographic range==

This subspecies is found in the United States from extreme southern South Carolina through southern Georgia, all of Florida, west through southern Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. 
The type locality listed is "Royal Palm Hammock, 12 miles west of Homestead, Dade County, Florida" (USA).

==Reproduction==

Adult females give birth to between 5 and 7 young at a time. In a brood of 8 from Silver Springs, Marion County, Florida, the neonates measured between [tpl]convert|157|and|173|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in total length.

==Venom==

Wright and Wright (1957) include excerpts from Allen (1938) that describe how an assistant was bitten in the Everglades and suffered severe pain and swelling for about 24 hours despite treatment. Allen also quotes some statistics: according to the Florida Reptile Institute, 28 people were bitten by this subspecies in Florida between 1935 and 1937 with no deaths.
Brown (1973) gives an average venom yield of 18 mg (dried venom) (Klauber, 1956) and [tpl]LD50[/tpl] values of 2.8,12.6 mg/kg IV, 6.0,6.8 mg/kg IP and 24.2 mg/kg SC for toxicity.Brown JH. 1973.

The venom contain disintegrins, notably barbourin which has a KGD (Lys-Gly-Asp) amino acid motif rather than the more common RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif. This single amino acid alteration gives barbourin higher binding affinity for the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.Markland FS. 1998. Snake Venoms and the Hemostatic System. Toxicon 36: 1749-1800.[tpl]cite pmid|2033037[/tpl] This receptor plays an important role in the aggregation of platelets, which then leads to the formation of a blood clot â€“ competitive inhibition of this receptor by barbourin will decrease platelet aggregation, and thus reduce clotting.Cahill M, Mistry R, Barnett DB. 1992.
