Acetazolamide, usually sold under the trade name Diamox in some countries, is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used for the medical treatment of glaucoma, epileptic seizure, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, altitude sickness, cystinuria, periodic paralysis, central sleep apnoea, and dural ectasia. Acetazolamide is a diuretic, and it is available as a generic drug in the United States. Diamox is now available as Diamox Sequels in the United States since the original product is no longer made or sold there.[tpl]cite web|title=Diamox Sequels (acetazolamide) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=10 April 2014|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/diamox-acetazolamide-342809#showall[/tpl]
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

It is used in the treatment of glaucoma, drug-induced oedema, heart failure-induced oedema, centrencephalic epilepsy and in reducing intraocular pressure after surgery. It has also been used in the treatment of mountain sickness,[tpl]cite journal|last=Low|first=EV|coauthors=Avery, AJ; Gupta, V; Schedlbauer, A; Grocott, MP|title=Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ|date=October 2012|volume=345|pages=e6779|doi=10.1136/bmj.e6779|pmid=23081689|url=http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/609427/field_highwire_article_pdf/0/bmj.e6779|format=PDF|pmc=3475644[/tpl] Ménière's disease, increased intracranial pressure and neuromuscular disorders.

By increasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the urine, the blood becomes more acidic. As the body equates acidity of the blood to its CO2 concentration, artificially acidifying the blood fools the body into thinking it has an excess of CO2, and it excretes this imaginary excess CO2 by deeper and faster breathing, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood.[tpl]cite web |title=Altitude.org |year=2004 |url=http://www.altitude.org |accessdate=2009-06-05[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Leaf DE, Goldfarb DS |title=Mechanisms of action of acetazolamide in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute mountain sickness |journal=J.

It has also been used to prevent methotrexate-induced kidney damage by alkalinalising one's urine, hence speeding up methotrexate excretion by increasing its soluble in the urine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shamash|first=J|coauthors=Earl, H; Souhami, R|title=Acetazolamide for alkalinisation of urine in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.|journal=Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology|date=1991|volume=28|issue=2|pages=150-1|doi=10.1007/BF00689708|pmid=2060085[/tpl]

===Pregnancy and lactation===

Acetazolamide is pregnancy category B3 in Australia, which means that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which acetazolamide was given intravenously or orally caused an increased risk of foetal malformations, including defects of the limbs. Despite this there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence. It is also excreted in breast milk and hence breastfeeding is advised against in mothers taking this drug.

==Side-effects==

Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, black faeces, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia).[tpl]cite isbn|9780980579093[/tpl] Whereas less common adverse effects include: stevens-johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.

===Contraindications===

It is possible that it might interact with:

==Mechanism of action==

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, hence causing the accumulation of carbonic acid[tpl]cite web|title=Acetazolamide|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-2301-x.htm|editor=Brayfield, A[/tpl] Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in red blood cells that catalyses the following reaction:[tpl]cite web|title=January 2004: Carbonic Anhydrase|work=RCSB PDB Protein Data Bank|date=January 2004|accessdate=10 April 2014|url=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/download/CarbonicAnhydrase.pdf|format=PDF|author=Dutta, S; Goodsell, D[/tpl]
hence lowering blood pH, by means of the following reaction that carbonic acid undergoes:
which has a pKa of 6.3.[tpl]cite web|title=Carbonic Anhydrase 2|work=UC Davis Chemwiki|publisher=University of California|author=Larsen, D|accessdate=10 April 2014|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/@api/deki/pages/2479/pdf?stylesheet=default&deep=false&showtoc=false[/tpl]
In the eye this results in a reduction in aqueous humour.
The mechanism of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation, increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.[tpl]mcn|date=May 2014[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

The tablets are made with acetazolamide in its original form, whereas the injection is in the sodium salt form. Its free form is fairly insoluble in water and alcohol. Its free form is white-faintly yellow, in colour. It also degrades upon contact with light.
