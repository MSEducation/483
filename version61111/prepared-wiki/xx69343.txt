CATEGORIES: Scottish malt whisky

Island single malts is a general term for single malt Scotch whiskies produced on the islands around the perimeter of the Scottish mainland. The exception is Islay, which is considered a separate whisky producing region (see Islay whisky). The islands are not a recognized whisky producing region[tpl]clarification needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] as such, but are considered to be part of the Highland region.
The whiskies produced on the Islands are extremely varied and have few similarities.
