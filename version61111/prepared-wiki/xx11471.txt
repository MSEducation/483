The Venice Film Festival or Venice International Film Festival ([tpl]lang-it|Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia[/tpl], "International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the Venice Biennale") is the oldest international film festival in the world. Founded by Count Giuseppe Volpi in 1932 as the "Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica", the festival has since taken place every year in late August or early September on the island of the Lido, Venice, Italy. Screenings take place in the historic Palazzo del Cinema on the Lungomare Marconi and in other venues nearby. It is one of the world's most prestigious film festivals and is part of the Venice Biennale [tpl]in it|Biennale di Venezia[/tpl], for over a century one of the most prestigious cultural institutions in the world (founded in 1895). It is known world-wide for the International Film Festival, the International Art Exhibition and the International Architecture Exhibition, and continues the tradition of the Festival of Contemporary Music, the Theatre Festival, now flanked by the Festival of Contemporary Dance.
The 70th Festival took place from 28 August to 7 September 2013.
