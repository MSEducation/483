The RT-1 was an early intercontinental ballistic missile design that was tested but not deployed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  It was not assigned a NATO reporting name, but did carry the industry designation 8K95.
Development was led by OKB-1 (S. P. Korolev), and a total of five flight tests were carried out, of which two were successful.  Two versions of the RT-1 were developed, with the first failing its first flight, but succeeding in its second in 1961.  A second version was tested in 1965 with three flights, of which two failed.  The RT-1 program was cancelled before any service.
