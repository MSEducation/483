[tpl]nihongo|Yokoi Yayū|横井 也有||extra=October 24, 1702 – July 15, 1783[/tpl] was a Japanese samurai best known for his haibun, a scholar of Kokugaku, and haikai poet. He was born [tpl]nihongo|Yokoi Tokitsura|横井 時般[/tpl], and took the pseudonym Tatsunojō. His family are believed to be descendants of Hōjō Tokiyuki.

==Life==

Yayū was born in Nagoya, the first son of [tpl]nihongo|Yokoi Tokitsura|時衡[/tpl] who served the Owari Domain. He inherited the Yokoi House's patrimony at twenty-six and held important posts of the Owari Domain. He was for example yōnin (manager of general affairs), Ōbangashira (chief of guard) and Jisha-Bugyō (manager of  religious affairs). In 1754, at age 53, he retired for health reasons. Yayū moved to [tpl]nihongo|Maezu|前津[/tpl] (now in Naka-ku, Nagoya), and lived in the [tpl]nihongo|Chiutei|知雨亭[/tpl] hermitage. He was a prolific and respected composer of haibun, Classical Chinese poems, waka and Japanese satirical poems, and was an adept of the Japanese tea ceremony.

==Works==

Yayū also excelled in Japanese martial arts, studied Confucianism and learned haikai from Mutō Hajaku (武藤巴雀) and Ōta Hajō (太田巴静). Hajaku and Hajō were pupils of Kagami Shikō (各務支考), a leading disciple of Matsuo Bashō. Mori Senzō (森銑三), a student of old Japanese literature, compared his hokku to senryū, and said they were not as interesting as his haibun. Yayū has been described as a master of haibun, and Nagai Kafū 永井荷風　called Yayū's haibun a model of Japanese prose.
