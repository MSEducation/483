According to NIST, when WTC 1 (the North Tower) collapsed, falling debris struck 7 World Trade Center and ignited fires on multiple floors. The uncontrolled fires ultimately led to the progressive collapse of the structure. Portions of the South Tower also damaged the nearby Deutsche Bank Building, which soon became filled with toxic dust. By 2002, Deutsche Bank determined that its building was unsalvageable. By January 2011, the Deutsche Bank Building was finally completely demolished.[ref]

Cleanup workers trucked most of the building materials and debris from Ground Zero to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. Some people, such as those affiliated with World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial, were worried that human remains might also have been (inadvertently) transported to the landfill.
In August 2008, New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company. The beam, mounted atop a platform shaped like the Pentagon, was erected outside the Shanksville firehouse near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93.[tpl]cite news |last=Gaskell |first=Stephanie |title=Pa. site of 9/11 crash gets WTC beam |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/08/24/2008-08-24_pa_site_of_911_crash_gets_wtc_beam.html |date=2008-08-25 |work=New York Daily news |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl]
In December 2001, a temporary viewing platform at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, opened to the public.[ref]

On March 11, 2002, 88 searchlights were installed and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky. This is called the Tribute in Light, and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the two-year anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then.[ref]

===Archaeology===

In July 2010 a team of archaeologists at the site discovered the remains of a [tpl]convert|32|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl]-long boat over 200 years old; it was probably made in the 18th century and dumped there along with wooden beams and trash in about 1810 to make up the land.Daily Telegraph, Friday 16 July 2010, page 16; http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/07/16/ship-found-at-ground-zero-site-in-new-york-115875-22416662/, with images, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/15/world-trade-centre-hull-ship, http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100715/ap_on_re_us/us_ground_zero_buried_ship, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2010/jul/15/new-york-ground-zero-ship, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/15/world-trade-centre-hull-ship The boat had been weighted to make it sink as part of foundations for a new pier. Samples of its wood have been taken for dendrochronology.

==New buildings==

Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center site. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani proclaimed, "We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0926/today.html |title=Rebuilding in New York |date=September 26, 2001 |author=Taylor, Tess |publisher=Architecture Week[/tpl] During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of cleanup workers through a megaphone. An individual in the crowd shouted, "I can't hear you," to which Bush replied, "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."[ref]

In a later address before Congress, the president declared, "As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City."[tpl]cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |publisher=The White House |date=September 20, 2001[/tpl] The immediate response from World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein was that "it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York. It would give the terrorists the victory they seek."[tpl]cite news |title=In place of the Trade Center; Ideas range from building new towers to playground |author=Litt, Steven |publisher=Plain Dealer (Cleveland) |date=September 17, 2001[/tpl]  However, ten years after the attacks, only one building, 7 World Trade Center, had been rebuilt. Two buildings are in the construction phase currently, One World Trade Center and 150 Greenwich Street (known as Four World Trade Center). The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished, and 5 years from the beginning planning stages.   However, given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts, they are often cited as an example of a successful public-private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations.Cornell Real Estate Review, Volume 10, Number 1 (July 2012), 39-53, http://cip.cornell.edu/cpre.crer/1342144023; http://www.cornell.edu/video/?videoID=1680

===Lower Manhattan Development Corporation===

Governor Pataki established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in November 2001, as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process.[ref]
