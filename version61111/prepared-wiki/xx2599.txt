A drum kit, drum setPeckman, Jonathan (2007). Picture Yourself Drumming, p.30. ISBN 1-59863-330-9. or trap set  is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments set up to be played/struck by a single player.http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/drumkit.html retrieved 29 January 2012
The traditional drum kit consists of a mix of drums (classified as  classically as  membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones (Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1, most significantly cymbals but also including the woodblock and cowbell for example).Remnant, M. (1989). Musical instruments. (pp. 159-174). London: B.T. Batsford Ltd. More recently kits have also included electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53), with both hybrid and entirely electronic kits now in common use.
A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in many music schools,For example Trinity College London http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1794 retrieved 20 March 2012 contains:
All of these are  classed as non-pitched percussion, allowing  for the music to be scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for the drum kit. If some or all of them are replaced by electronic drums, the scoring and most often positioning remains the same, allowing a standard teaching approach. The drum kit is usually played seated on a drum stool or throne. The drum kit differs in general from those traditional instruments that produce melody or chords/pitch per se: even though drums are often placed musically alongside others that do, such as the piano or stringed instruments. (See Peter Magadini "The Drummers Guide to Music theory",2004,published by Hal Leonard, on the 'Elements of Music' & 'Form'pp.6-18;48-52)
Many drummers extend their kits from this basic pattern, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments including pitched percussion. In some styles of music particular extensions are normal, for example double bass drums in heavy metal music. On the other extreme but more rarely, some performers omit elements from even the basic setup, also dependent on the style of music and individual preferences.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The first recognizable ancestors of the modern drum kit were born in the Vaudeville era and specifically the 1920's of New Orleans's (Jon Cohan "Star Sets" page 2.,ISBN 0-7935-3489-5 publisher Hal Leonard, 1995). Pecuniary and theater space considerations demanded that fewer percussionists covered more percussion parts. In military and orchestral music settings, drums and cymbals were traditionally played separately by one or many percussionists. The bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, and other percussion instruments were all played using hand-held drum sticks. Circa 1890, experimentation with foot pedals began. Many patented their systems such as Dee Dee Chandler of New Orleans 1904-05.Porter/Hullman/Hazel (1993).  Jazz - From its Origins to the Present, p.18. ISBN 0-13-512195-7. Liberating the hands for the first time, this evolution saw the bass drum played with the foot of a standing percussionist (thus the term "kick drum") and became the central piece around which every other percussion instruments would later revolve. Ludwig-Musser, William F. Ludwig, Sr., and his brother, Theodor Ludwig, founded the Ludwig & Ludwig Co. in 1909 and patented the first workable bass drum pedal system, paving the way for what was to become the modern drum kit.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]  It was the golden age of drum building for many famous drum company's with Ludwig introducing... "The ornately engraved Black Beauty Brass Snare drum; Slingerland premiered it's Radio King solid Maple shell; Leedy invented the floating drum head & self-aligning lug;& Gretsch originated the three-way tensioning system of the Gladstone snare drum". (Latter Quote from pages 5-6 of Jon Cohan's "Star Sets- Drum kits of the Great Drummers", with a forward by Bill Bruford).
