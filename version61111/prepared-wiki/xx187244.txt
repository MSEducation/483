==History==

===Civil War===

The 41st United States (Colored) Infantry Regiment was one of six segregated regiments (2 cavalry and 4 infantry) created in 1867 following the American Civil War to provide for African American participation in the defense of the United States. It was consolidated in 1869 with the 38th (Colored) Infantry Regiment to form the 24th (Colored) Infantry Regiment.

===20th century===

The modern 41st Infantry Regiment was initially formed on 20 June 1917 as Company A, 41st Infantry at Fort Snelling, Minnesota from soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 36th Infantry Regiment. On 9 July 1918, the Regiment was assigned to the 10th Division at Camp Funston, Kansas, which was commanded by Leonard Wood. Here the 41st prepared for deployment to Europe to fight in World War I. In October 1918, the regiment sent an advance party to France to prepare for the deployment, however, the war ended in November so the regiment did not deploy. As part of the general demobilization following the war, the regiment was deactivated on 22 September 1921 at Camp Meade, Maryland.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-41in.htm 
It was reactivated on 15 July 1940 when the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry was activated as Company A, 41st Infantry (Armored) at Fort Benning, Georgia. The 41st Infantry Regiment constituted the organic infantry of the newly formed 2nd Armored Division. The association between the 41st Infantry and the 2nd Armored Division lasted throughout World War II and continued through Operation Desert Storm  The regimental motto is "Straight and Stalwart", the crest shows a blue shield with a round yellow circle and a castle representing its birthplace at Fort Snelling Minnesota.  In the upper left corner a star representing a previous fort in Texas is depicted.
The regiment has received four Presidential Unit Citations from WWII including one for leading the initial breakout in the Normandy Campaign and a later citation for actions in the invasion of Germany itself.
