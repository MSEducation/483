==CERN==

In 1968, Steinberger left Columbia University and accepted a position as a department director at CERN. He constructed an experiment there utilizing multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC), recently invented by Georges Charpak.  The MWPC's, augmented by micro-electronic amplifiers, allowed much larger samples of events to be recorded.  Several results for neutral kaons were obtained and published in the early 1970s, including the observation of the rare decay of the neutral kaon to a muon pair, the time-dependence of the asymmetry for semi-leptonic decays, and a more precise measurement of the neutral kaon mass difference.  A new era in experimental technique was opened.
These new techniques proved crucial for the first demonstration of direct CP-violation.  The NA31 experiment at CERN was built in the early 1980s using the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton synchrotron.  Aside from banks of MWPC's and a hadron calorimeter, it featured a liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter with exceptional spatial and energy resolution. NA31 showed that direct CP violation is real.

==Nobel Prize==

Jack Steinberger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 1988, "for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino".  He shares this prize with Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz.  At the time, all three experimenters were at Columbia University.
The experiment used charged pion beams generated with the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The pions decayed to muons which were detected in front of a steel wall; the neutrinos were detected in spark chambers installed behind the wall.  The coincidence of muons and neutrinos demonstrated that a second kind of neutrino was created in association with muons.  Subsequent experiments proved this neutrino to be distinct from the first kind (electron-type). Steinberger, Lederman and Schwartz published their work in Physical Review Letters in 1962.
He gave his Nobel medal to New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois (USA), of which he is an alumnus.
