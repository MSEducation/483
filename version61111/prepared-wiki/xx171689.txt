==History==

===World War II===

After shakedown, Lawrence C. Taylor departed New York 6 August 1944 for the central Pacific, arriving Pearl Harbor 29 August. Sailing 16 October, the destroyer escort joined [tpl]USS|Anzio|CVE-57|6[/tpl] and her hunter-killer group in the Philippine Sea.
During operations near Leyte, her ASW patrols were rewarded 18 November after a 14-hour search for a Japanese submarine. Joining two planes from Anzio in a coordinated attack, Lawrence C. Taylor sent enemy [tpl]Ship|Japanese submarine|I-41[/tpl] to the bottom.
During December the hunter-killer group searched the seas off Leyte and Luzon relentlessly, despite a violent typhoon which struck the islands. She was the only ship in her unit to remain on course and undamaged during this massive storm. On 3 January 1945 Lawrence C. Taylor sortied with ships of the U.S. 3rd Fleet to support the landings in Lingayen Gulf on the 9th. Remaining on patrol, she searched for enemy submarines off Luzon and prevented their closing the shipping lanes to the island.
When Iwo Jima, needed as a stopover base for B-29s, was selected as the next target on the road to Tokyo, the destroyer escort departed Saipan 12 February to join the fight. She arrived off the tiny volcanic island 16 February and for 3 days guarded a group of escort carriers as they softened up the island prior to the landings. After the marines hit the beach the 19th, Lawrence C. Taylor stood by on patrol and support duty. Two days after the initial landings, she assisted [tpl]USS|Bismarck Sea|CVE-95|6[/tpl] after the carrier was hit by a kamikaze. Her fearless captain remained in the area even throughout the night, leaving the search lights on in danger of further suicide attacks. Under the constant threat of air raids, Lawrence C. Taylor continued operations off Iwo until early March.
The inspiring victory at Iwo Jima set the stage for the next campaign, Okinawa. Arriving off Okinawa 26 March, she performed ASW sweeps prior to the Easter Sunday assault in Japan's own backyard. Once again her task was to keep the shipping lanes free of enemy submarines, and she continued this duty through June.
Then Lawrence C. Taylor accompanied Admiral Mitscher's mighty Fast Carrier Task Force as it pounded the Japanese mainland. The submarine patrol brought results, because Anzio's planes sighted an enemy submarine on the night of 15 July. At 0240 the following morning the destroyer escort registered her second kill when her depth charge attack sent [tpl]Ship|Japanese submarine|I-13[/tpl] to Davy Jones’ Locker.
Lawrence C. Taylor continued operations with the 3d Fleet until the Japanese surrendered, then departed Okinawa 5 September to join the U.S. 7th Fleet as it landed occupation troops in Korea and China. She remained with the occupation units until 26 December when she departed Okinawa for home.

==Fate==

Arriving San Francisco, California, 15 January 1946, Lawrence C. Taylor remained on the west coast and decommissioned at San Diego, California, 23 April. She joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet and was struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1972. She was sold for scrapping 12 September 1973.
