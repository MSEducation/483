Eating your own dog food, also called dogfooding, is a slang term used to reference a scenario in which a company uses its own product to demonstrate the quality and capabilities of the product.[tpl]cite news |author=Miguel Helft |coauthors= |title=Google Appears Closer to Releasing Its Own Phone |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/google-appears-closer-to-releasing-its-own-phone/ |quote=On Saturday morning, Google confirmed that it was testing a new concept in mobile phones, writing in a blog post that it was 'dogfooding' the devices, an expression that comes from the idea that companies should eat their own dog food, or use their own products. |work=New York Times |date=December 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-12 [/tpl]

==Introduction==

Dogfooding can be a way for a company to demonstrate confidence in its own products. The idea is that if the company expects customers to buy its products, it should also be willing to use those products. Hence dogfooding can act as a kind of testimonial advertising.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5047467.html|title=Microsoft tests its own 'dog food'|work=Tech News on ZDNet|accessdate=2009-11-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2217007,00.asp|title=The Problem with Eating Your Own Dog Food|last=Dvorak|first=John C.|date=15 November 2007|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=17 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]
InfoWorld commented that this needs to be transparent and honest: "watered-down examples, such as auto dealers' policy of making salespeople drive the brands they sell, or Coca-Cola allowing no Pepsi products in corporate offices ... are irrelevant."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/if-its-good-enough-fido-%E2%80%A6-990 | title=If it's good enough for Fido … | last=Yager | first=Tom | accessdate=2013-06-15 | date=2003-05-30[/tpl]  In this sense, a corporate culture of not supporting the competitor is not the same as a philosophy of "eating your own dog food".  The latter focuses on the functional aspects of the company's own product. Compare this to fictional cases where Google employees used Microsoft Outlook to execute the functional task of sending emails, or Microsoft employees writing documents with WordPerfect.
One perceived advantage beyond marketing is that dogfooding allows employees to test their company's products in real-life scenarios, and gives management a sense of how the product will be used, all before launch to consumers.[tpl]cite book|last=Ash|first=Lydia|title=The Web testing companion: the insider's guide to efficient and effective tests|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tUYo644-SYcC&pg=PR37|series=ITPro collection|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-43021-8|page=17[/tpl] In software development, the practice of dogfooding with build branches, private (or buddy) builds, and private testing can allow several validation passes before the code is integrated with the normal daily builds. The practice leads to more stable builds,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] and proactive resolution of potential inconsistency and dependency issues, especially when several developers or teams work on the same product.  For example, the websites of the Wikimedia Foundation engage in this sort of build testing, with the public stable branches of MediaWiki being based off public betatesting of the Wikimedia alpha builds between stable releases.  In fact, these same builds are made accessible to the public alongside the stable, proven builds so that the public may become as involved in beta testing the MediaWiki software as the official development staff.
The risks of public dogfooding, specifically that a company may have difficulties using its own products, may reduce the frequency of publicized dogfooding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/if-its-good-enough-fido-%E2%80%A6-990|title=If it's good enough for Fido … Vendors need to follow Microsoft's playbook|last=Yager|first=Tom|date=30 May 2003|work=Developer World|publisher=InfoWorld|accessdate=17 May 2010[/tpl]

==Origin of the term==

The editor of IEEE Software recounts that in the 1970s television advertisements for Alpo dog food, Lorne Greene pointed out that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. Another possible origin is the president of Kal Kan Pet Food, who was said to eat a can of his dog food at shareholders' meetings.[tpl]cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Warren|date=May–June 2006|title=From The Editor: Eating Your Own Dog Food|journal=IEEE Software|publisher=IEEE|volume=23|issue=3|pages=5–7|doi=10.1109/MS.2006.72|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2006/03/s3005.html[/tpl]
In 1988, Microsoft manager Paul Maritz sent Brian Valentine, test manager for Microsoft LAN Manager, an email titled "Eating our own Dogfood", challenging him to increase internal usage of the company's product. From there, the usage of the term spread through the company.Inside Out: Microsoft—In Our Own Words (ISBN 0446527394)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&fpid=25874&rid=1|title=VMworld 2009: Virtualization, controversy and eating your own dog food|last=Brodkin|first=John|date=4 September 2009|work=Network World|accessdate=17 May 2010[/tpl] Quote: "Paul Maritz also poked fun at himself by claiming that one of his only contributions to the IT world is coining the commonly used "eat your own dog food" phrase. "You can read about it on Wikipedia, so it must be true," Maritz said.

Apple Computer president Michael Scott in 1980 wrote a memo announcing that "EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!! NO MORE TYPEWRITERS ARE TO BE PURCHASED, LEASED, etc., etc." by the computer company, with a goal to eliminate typewriters by 1 January 1981.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19811001/2033.html | title=An Apple On Every Desk | accessdate=March 6, 2011 | author=Ditlea, Steve | date=1981-10-01 | publisher=Inc.[/tpl]
The development of Windows NT at Microsoft involved over 200 developers in small teams, and it was held together by Dave Cutler's insistence in February 1991 on dogfooding, developing the operating system on computers running on NT using a daily build, initially text only, then with graphics, and finally with networking. It was initially crash prone, but the immediate feedback of code breaking the build, the loss of pride, and the knowledge of impeding the work of others were all powerful incentives.[tpl]cite book|last1=Bolman|first1=Lee G.|last2=Deal|first2=Terrence E.|title=Reframing organizations: artistry, choice, and leadership|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsFj7wgczvYC&pg=PA64|edition=3|series=Jossey-Bass business & management series; Jossey-Bass higher and adult education series|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-7879-6426-3|page=64[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Zachary|first=Pascal G.|title=Showstopper! the Breakneck Race to Create Windows Nt and the Next Generation|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZWakyeSnG7AC|year=2009 |publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=0-7592-8578-0|page=135[/tpl] Infoworld reported in 2005 that a tour of Microsoft's network operations center "showed pretty much beyond a reasonable doubt that Microsoft does run its 20,000-plus node, international network on 99 percent Windows technology, including servers, workstations, and edge security."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/microsoft-machine-churns-911|title=The Microsoft machine churns on|last=Rist|first=Oliver|date=29 December 2005|work=InfoWorld|accessdate=17 May 2010[/tpl] InfoWorld argued that "Microsoft's use of Windows for its high-traffic operations tipped many doubters over to Windows' side of the fence".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/if-its-good-enough-fido-%E2%80%A6-990|title=If it's good enough for Fido...[/tpl]

==Criticism and alternative terms==

Forcing those who design products to actually use and rely on them is often thought to improve quality and usability, but software developers may be blind to usability and may have knowledge to make software work that an end user will lack. Microsoft's chief information officer noted in 2008 that, previously, "We tended not to go through the actual customer experience. We were always upgrading from a beta, not from production disk to production disk."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/12/12/cio-microsoft-scott-tech-cio-cx_es_1215microsoft.html|title=Eating Their Own Dog Food|last=Sperling|first=Ed|date=15 December 2008|work=Forbes|accessdate=17 May 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/U8Dz|archivedate=18 Sep 2012[/tpl] Dogfooding may happen too early to be viable, and those forced to use the products may assume that someone else has reported the problem or they may get used to applying workarounds. Dogfooding may be unrealistic, as customers will always have a choice of different companies' products to use together, and the product may not be being used as intended. The process can lead to a loss of productivity and demoralisation, or at its extreme to "Not Invented Here syndrome"; i.e., only using internal products.
