As neither the Byzantines nor the Muslims carried out any large-scale population resettlement projects, the Christians were the offspring of the Jewish and Samaritan farmers who converted to Christianity in the Byzantine period; while the Muslim fellaheen in Palestine in modern times are descendants of those Christians who were the descendants of Jews, and had turned to Islam before the Crusaders’ conquest.’ Moshe Gil, A History of Palestine,634-1099 Cambridge University Press, (1983) 1997 pp.222-3'The process of Arabization and Islamization was gaining momentum there. It was one of the mainstays of Umayyad power and was important in their struggle against both Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula.... Conversions arising from convenience as well as conviction then increased. These conversions to Islam, together with a steady tribal inflow from the desert, changed the religious character of Palestine’s inhabitants. The predominantly Christian population gradually became predominantly Muslim and Arabic-speaking.

Moreover, after Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 the population by and large remained in situ, and did so again after Bar Kochba's revolt in AD 135. When the vast majority of the population became Christian during the Byzantine period, no vast number were driven out, and similarly in the seventh century, when the vast majority became Muslim, few were driven from the land. Palestine has been multi-cultural and multi ethnic from the beginning, as one can read between the lines even in the biblical narrative. Many Palestinian Jews became Christians, and in turn Muslims. Ironically, many of the forebears of Palestinian Arab refugees may well have been Jewish.'Michael Prior,Zionism and the State of Israel: A Moral Inquiry, Psychology Press 1999 p.201'the word 'Arab' needs to be used with care. It is applicable to the Bedouin and to a section of the urban and effendi classes; it is inappropriate as a description of the rural mass of the population, the fellaheen. The whole population spoke Arabic, usually corrupted by dialects bearing traces of words of other origin, but it was only the Bedouin who habitually thought of themselves as Arabs. Western travelers from the sixteenth century onwards make the same distinction, and the word 'Arab' almost always refers to them exclusively. . .Gradually it was realized that there remained a substantial stratum of the pre-Israelite peasantry, and that the oldest element among the peasants were not 'Arabs' in the sense of having entered the country with or after the conquerors of the seventh century, had been there already when the Arabs came.'

Genetic analysis suggests that a majority of the Muslims of Palestine, inclusive of Arab citizens of Israel, are descendants of Christians, Jews and other earlier inhabitants of the southern Levant whose core may reach back to prehistoric times.

Though Palestinian Jews made up part of the population of Palestine prior to the creation of the State of Israel, few identify as "Palestinian" today. Acculturation, independent from conversion to Islam, resulted in Palestinians being linguistically and culturally Arab. The vernacular of Palestinians, irrespective of religion, is the Palestinian dialect of Arabic. Many Arab citizens of Israel including Palestinians are bilingual and fluent in Hebrew.
The history of a distinct Palestinian national identity is a disputed issue amongst scholars. Legal historian Assaf Likhovski states that the prevailing view is that Palestinian identity originated in the early decades of the 20th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Likhovski|first=Assaf|title=Law and identity in mandate Palestine|year=2006|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-3017-8|page=174[/tpl] "Palestinian" was used to refer to the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people by the Arabs of Palestine in a limited way until World War I. The first demand for national independence of the Levant was issued by the Syrian–Palestinian Congress on 21 September 1921.Porath, 1974, p. 117.

==Etymology==

The Greek toponym Palaistínē (Παλαιστίνη), with which the Arabic Filastin (فلسطين) is cognate, first occurs in the work of the 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, where it denotes generallyWith the exception of Bks. 1, 105; 3.91.1, and 4.39, 2. the coastal land from Phoenicia down to Egypt.Herodotus describes its scope in the Fifth Satrapy of the Persians as follows: "From the town of Posidium, ... on the border between Cilicia and Syria, as far as Egypt – omitting Arabian territory, which was free of tax, came 350 talents. This province contains the whole of Phoenicia and that part of Syria which is called Palestine, and Cyprus. This is the fifth Satrapy." (from Herodotus Book 3, 8th logos).http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txtCohen, 2006, p. 36.
Herodotus also employs the term as an ethnonym, as when he speaks of the 'Syrians of Palestine' or 'Palestinian-Syrians',Herodotus, The Histories, Bks. 2:104 (Φοἰνικες δἐ καὶ Σὐριοι οἱ ἑν τᾔ Παλαιστἰνῃ); 3:5; 7:89. an ethnically amorphous group he distinguishes from the Phoenicians.Kasher, 1990, p. 15.David Asheri, A Commentary on Herodotus, Books 1-4, Oxford University Press,2007 p.402:"'the Syrians called Palestinians',  at the time of Herodotus were a mixture of Phoenicians, Philistines, Arabs, Egyptians, and perhaps also other peoples. . . Perhaps the circumcized 'Syrians called Palestinians' are the Arabs and Egyptians of the Sinai coast; at the time of Herodotus there were few Jews in the coastal area." Herodotus makes no distinction between the Jews  and other inhabitants of Palestine.W.W. How, J.Wells (eds.A Commentary on Herodotus, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1928, vol.1 p.219. The Greek word bears comparison to a congeries of ancient ethnonyms and toponyms. In Ancient Egyptian Peleset/Purusatipwlɜsɜtj.John Strange, Caphtor/Keftiu: a new investigation, Brill, 1980 p. 159. refers to one of the Sea Peoples. Among Semitic languages, Assyrian Palastu generally refers to southern Palestine.Thomas L.Thompson, 'Introduction:Can a History of Ancient Jerusalem and Palestine be written?,' in T.L. Thompson (ed.) Jerusalem In Ancient History And Tradition, Continuum Publishing, 2003, pp. 1-15, pp. 3-4. Biblical Hebrew's cognate word  Plištim,Plištim is often compared to the semitic root palash or falash meaning "rolling and spreading" or "migratory". usually translated Philistines, does not distinguish them and the other Sea Peoples, who settled in Palestine around 1100 BCE.Strange 1980 p.159.
Syria Palestina continued to be used by historians and geographers and others to refer to the area between the Mediterranean sea and the Jordan river, as in the writings of Philo, Josephus and Pliny the Elder. After the Romans adopted the term as the official administrative name for the region in the 2nd century CE, "Palestine" as a stand alone term came into widespread use, printed on coins, in inscriptions and even in rabbinic texts.Cohen, 2006, p. 37. The Arabic word Filastin has been used to refer to the region since the time of the earliest medieval Arab geographers. It appears to have been used as an Arabic adjectival noun in the region since as early as the 7th century CE.Kish, 1978, p. 200. The Arabic language newspaper Filasteen (est. 1911), published in Jaffa by Issa and Yusef al-Issa, addressed its readers as "Palestinians".[tpl]cite web|title=Palestine Facts|publisher=PASSIA: Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs|url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/chronology/14001962.htm[/tpl]
In the beginning of the 1900s, a group led by Theodor Herzl founded the Jewish Colonial Trust. The group's aim was to establish a financial institution to promote Zionist colonization in the Palestine region.http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/company.html?company=bank_leumi_le_israel On 27 February 1902, a subsidiary of this Trust called the "Anglo-Palestine Company" (APC) was established in London with the assistance of Zalman David Levontin. This Company was to become the future Bank Leumi.http://english.leumi.co.il/LEPrivate/The_History_of_Bank_Leumi/5491/
During the Mandatory Palestine period, the term "Palestinian" was used to refer to all people residing there, regardless of religion or ethnicity, and those granted citizenship by the British Mandatory authorities were granted "Palestinian citizenship".[tpl]cite journal | author = Government of the United Kingdom | title = REPORT by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Council of the League of Nations on the Administration of PALESTINE AND TRANS-JORDAN FOR THE YEAR 1930 | publisher = League of Nations | date = 31 December 1930 | url = http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/a47250072a3dd7950525672400783bde/c2feff7b90a24815052565e6004e5630!OpenDocument | accessdate = 2007-05-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070222095422/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/a47250072a3dd7950525672400783bde/c2feff7b90a24815052565e6004e5630!OpenDocument |archivedate = February 22, 2007[/tpl] Other examples include the use of the term Palestine Regiment to refer to the Jewish Infantry Brigade Group of the British Army during World War II, and the term "Palestinian Talmud", which is an alternative name of the Jerusalem Talmud, used mainly in academic sources.
Following the 1948 establishment of Israel, the use and application of the terms "Palestine" and "Palestinian" by and to Palestinian Jews largely dropped from use. For example, the English-language newspaper The Palestine Post, founded by Jews in 1932, changed its name in 1950 to The Jerusalem Post. Jews in Israel and the West Bank today generally identify as Israelis. Arab citizens of Israel identify themselves as Israeli and/or Palestinian and/or Arab.[tpl]cite web|title=Noted Arab citizens call on Israel to shed Jewish identity|author=Isabel Kershner|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/08/africa/web.0208israel.php|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl]
The Palestinian National Charter, as amended by the PLO's Palestine National Council in July 1968, defined "Palestinians" as "those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or stayed there. Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian father – whether in Palestine or outside it – is also a Palestinian."[tpl]cite web|title=The Palestinian National Charter|publisher=Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations|url=http://www.un.int/palestine/PLO/PNAcharter.html[/tpl] Note that "Arab nationals" is not religious-specific, and it implicitly includes not only the Arabic-speaking Muslims of Palestine, but also the Arabic-speaking Christians of Palestine and other religious communities of Palestine who were at that time Arabic-speakers, such as the Samaritans and Druze. Thus, the Jews of Palestine were/are also included, although limited only to "the Arabic-speaking Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the pre-state Zionist invasion." The Charter also states that "Palestine with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate, is an indivisible territorial unit."[tpl]cite web|title=Constitution of the State of Palestine|author=Constitution Committee of the Palestine National Council Third Draft, 7 March 2003, revised on March 25, 2003|publisher=Jerusalem Media and Communication Center|date=March 25, 2003|accessdate=2007-08-21|url=http://www.jmcc.org/documents/palestineconstitution-eng.pdf|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070708061923/http://www.jmcc.org/documents/palestineconstitution-eng.pdf |archivedate = July 8, 2007[/tpl] The most recent draft of the Palestinian constitution would amend that definition such that, "Palestinian nationality shall be regulated by law, without prejudice to the rights of those who legally acquired it prior to May 10, 1948 or the rights of the Palestinians residing in Palestine prior to this date, and who were forced into exile or departed there from and denied return thereto. This right passes on from fathers or mothers to their progenitor. It neither disappears nor elapses unless voluntarily relinquished."

==History==

===Palestinian history and nationalism===

The timing and causes behind the emergence of a distinctively Palestinian national consciousness among the Arabs of Palestine are matters of scholarly disagreement. Some argue that it can be traced as far back as the 1834 Arab revolt in Palestine (or even as early as the 17th century), while others argue that it did not emerge until after the Mandatory Palestine period. According to legal historian Assaf Likhovski, the prevailing view is that Palestinian identity originated in the early decades of the 20th century.
In his 1997 book, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness, historian Rashid Khalidi notes that the archaeological strata that denote the history of Palestine – encompassing the Biblical, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Fatimid, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman periods – form part of the identity of the modern-day Palestinian people, as they have come to understand it over the last century.Khalidi, 1997, p. 18. Noting that Palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one, with "Arabism, religion, and local loyalties" playing an important role, Khalidi cautions against the efforts of some Palestinian nationalists to "anachronistically" read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact "relatively modern".Khalidi, 1997, p. 149.Khalidi, 1997, pp. 19–21.
Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal consider the 1834 revolt of the Arabs in Palestine as constituting the first formative event of the Palestinian people. From 1516 to 1917, Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire save a brief period In the 1830s when an Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali, and his son Ibrahim Pasha asserted their own rule over the area. The revolt by Palestine's Arabs was precipitated by popular resistance against heavy demands for conscripts, with the peasants well aware that conscription was little more than a death sentence. Starting in May 1834 the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus and Ibrahim Pasha's army was deployed, defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron.Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 6–11 Benny Morris argues that the Arabs in Palestine nevertheless remained part of a larger pan-Islamist or pan-Arab national movement.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, pp.40–42 in the French edition. Walid Khalidi argues otherwise, writing that Palestinians in Ottoman times were "acutely aware of the distinctiveness of Palestinian history ..." and "although proud of their Arab heritage and ancestry, the Palestinians considered themselves to be descended not only from Arab conquerors of the seventh century but also from indigenous peoples who had lived in the country since time immemorial, including the ancient Hebrews and the Canaanites before them."Khalidi, W., 1984, p. 32
Rashid Khalidi argues that the modern national identity of Palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among the peoples of the Ottoman empire in the late 19th century that sharpened following the demarcation of modern nation-state boundaries in the Middle East after World War I. Khalidi also states that although the challenge posed by Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, that "it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism." Conversely, historian James L. Gelvin argues that Palestinian nationalism was a direct reaction to Zionism. In his book The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War he states that "Palestinian nationalism emerged during the interwar period in response to Zionist immigration and settlement."Gelvin, 2005, pp. 92–93. Gelvin argues that this fact does not make the Palestinian identity any less legitimate:
 "The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some "other." Why else would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose." 
David Seddon writes that "the creation of Palestinian identity in its contemporary sense was formed essentially during the 1960s, with the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization". He adds, however, that "the existence of a population with a recognizably similar name ('the Philistines') in Biblical times suggests a degree of continuity over a long historical period (much as 'the Israelites' of the Bible suggest a long historical continuity in the same region)."David Seddon (ed.)A political and economic dictionary of the Middle East, Taylor & Francis, 2004. p. 532.
Bernard Lewis argues it was not as a Palestinian nation that the Arabs of Ottoman Palestine objected to Zionists, since the very concept of such a nation was unknown to the Arabs of the area at the time and did not come into being until very much later. Even the concept of Arab nationalism in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, "had not reached significant proportions before the outbreak of World War I." Tamir Sorek, a sociologist, submits that, "Although a distinct Palestinian identity can be traced back at least to the middle of the nineteenth century (Kimmerling and Migdal 1993; Khalidi 1997b), or even to the seventeenth century (Gerber 1998), it was not until after World War I that a broad range of optional political affiliations became relevant for the Arabs of Palestine."[tpl]cite journal|title=The Orange and the Cross in the Cresent|journal=Nations and Nationalism|url=http://plaza.ufl.edu/tsorek/articles/orange.pdf|author=Tamir Sorek|volume=10 (3)|year=2004|pages=269–291|format=PDF[/tpl]
Whatever the differing viewpoints over the timing, causal mechanisms, and orientation of Palestinian nationalism, by the early 20th century strong opposition to Zionism and evidence of a burgeoning nationalistic Palestinian identity is found in the content of Arabic-language newspapers in Palestine, such as Al-Karmil (est. 1908) and Filasteen (est. 1911).Khalidi, 1997, pp. 124–127. Filasteen initially focused its critique of Zionism around the failure of the Ottoman administration to control Jewish immigration and the large influx of foreigners, later exploring the impact of Zionist land-purchases on Palestinian peasants ([tpl]lang-ar|فلاحين[/tpl], fellahin), expressing growing concern over land dispossession and its implications for the society at large.
The first Palestinian nationalist organisations emerged at the end of the World War I.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 48 in the French edition. Two political factions emerged. al-Muntada al-Adabi, dominated by the Nashashibi family, militated for the promotion of the Arabic language and culture, for the defense of Islamic values and for an independent Syria and Palestine. In Damascus, al-Nadi al-Arabi, dominated by the Husayni family, defended the same values.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p.49 in the French edition.
The historical record continued to reveal an interplay between "Arab" and "Palestinian" identities and nationalism. The idea of a unique Palestinian state separated out from its Arab neighbors was at first rejected by Palestinian representatives. The First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations (in Jerusalem, February 1919), which met for the purpose of selecting a Palestinian Arab representative for the Paris Peace Conference, adopted the following resolution: "We consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds."[tpl]cite book|title=Palestinian Arab National Movement: From Riots to Rebellion: 1929–1939, vol. 2|author=Yehoshua Porath|publisher=Frank Cass and Co., Ltd|year=1977|pages=81–82[/tpl]
After the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the San Remo conference and the failure of Faisal to establish the Kingdom of Greater Syria, a distinctive form of Palestinian Arab nationalism took root between April and July 1920.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, pp. 49–50 in the French edition.Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete, p. 139n. With the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the French conquest of Syria, the formerly pan-Syrianist mayor of Jerusalem, Musa Qasim Pasha al-Husayni, said "Now, after the recent events in Damascus, we have to effect a complete change in our plans here. Southern Syria no longer exists. We must defend Palestine".Khalidi, 1997, p. 165.
Conflict between Palestinian nationalists and various types of pan-Arabists continued during the British Mandate, but the latter became increasingly marginalized. Two prominent leaders of the Palestinian nationalists were Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem,appointed by the British, and Izz ad-Din al-Qassam.[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Palestinian Revolts|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=9 December 2003|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9A489B74-6477-4E67-9C22-0F53A3CC9ADF.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215061527/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9A489B74-6477-4E67-9C22-0F53A3CC9ADF.htm |archivedate=2005-12-15 [/tpl]

===Struggle for self-determination===

Palestinians have not exercised full sovereignty over the land in which they have lived during the modern era. Palestine was administered by the Ottoman Empire until World War I, and then overseen by the British Mandatory authorities. Israel was established in parts of Palestine in 1948, and in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the West Bank were occupied by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip by Egypt, with both countries continuing to administer these areas until Israel occupied them in the Six-Day War. Historian Avi Shlaim states that the Palestinians' lack of sovereignty over the land has been used by Israelis to deny Palestinians their rights self-determination.[tpl]cite web|date=16 June 2004|title=Interview With Middle East Scholar Avi Shlaim: America, Israel and the Middle East|author=Don Atapattu|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/interview-middle-east-scholar-avi-shlaim|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=2008-03-09[/tpl]
Today, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination has been affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of JusticeOnly "peoples" are entitled to self-determination in contemporary international law (See Self-determination and National Minorities, Oxford Monographs in International Law, Thomas D. Musgrave, Oxford University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-19-829898-6, p. 170). In 2004, the International Court of Justice said that Israel had recognized the existence of a "Palestinian people" and referred a number of times to the Palestinian people and its "legitimate rights" in international agreements. The Court said those rights include the right to self-determination(See paragraph 118 of Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf). Judge Koroma explained "The Court has also held that the right of self-determination as an established and recognized right under international law applies to the territory and to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, the exercise of such right entitles the Palestinian people to a State of their own as originally envisaged in resolution 181 (II) and subsequently confirmed." Judge Higgins also said "that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and to have their own State"(See paragraph 5, Separate opinion of Judge Koroma http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1679.pdf and paragraph 18, Separate opinion of Judge Higgins http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1681.pdf). Paul De Waart said that the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice in 2004 "ascertained the present responsibility of the United Nations to protect Palestine’s statehood. It affirmed the applicability of the prohibition of acquisition of Palestinian territory by Israel and confirmed the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Moreover, the existence of the Palestinian people as the rightful claimant to the Occupied Palestinian Territory is no longer open to question (See De Waart, Paul J. I. M., "International Court of Justice Firmly Walled in the Law of Power in the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process", Leiden Journal of International Law, 18 (2005), pp. 467–487). and several Israeli authorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/07fc0614021668418525736b005c8a82!OpenDocument |title=John Dugard's "Situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967" |publisher=Domino.un.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230193956/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/07fc0614021668418525736b005c8a82!OpenDocument |archivedate = December 30, 2007[/tpl] A total of 122 countries recognize Palestine as a state.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4100886,00.html|title=Abbas: 122 countries recognize Palestinian state in '67 borders|author=Israel News|newspaper=Ynet News|date=27 July 2011|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl] However, Palestinian sovereignty over the areas claimed as part of the Palestinian state remains limited, and the boundaries of the state remain a point of contestation between Palestinians and Israelis.

====British Mandate (1917–1948)====

Article 22 of The Covenant of the League of Nations conferred an international legal status upon the territories and people which had ceased to be under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire as part of a 'sacred trust of civilization'. Article 7 of the League of Nations Mandate required the establishment of a new, separate, Palestinian nationality for the inhabitants. This meant that Palestinians did not become British citizens, and that Palestine was not annexed into the British dominions.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=GniaXe2wnRQC&pg=PA49&dq= |title=International Law Reports: Cases 1938–1940, H.

Consequently government censuses in 1922 and 1931 would categorize Palestinians confessionally as Muslims, Christians and Jews, with the category of Arab absent.Weldon Matthews, Confronting an Empire, Constructing a Nation,I.B. Tauris, 2006, p. 33. Both Weldon Matthews and Prasenjit Duara interpret this aspect of the mandate system as tailored to the needs of imperial powers, which found it useful to avoid classifying colonies as nations: "This outlook was carried over to Palestine from India and Egypt where British administrators did not merely doubt the existence of a unifying national identity, but thwarted its development by creating sectarian institutions as a matter of policy."
After the British general, Louis Bols, read out the Balfour Declaration in February 1920, some 1,500 Palestinians demonstrated in the streets of Jerusalem. A month later, during the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the protests against British rule and Jewish immigration became violent and Bols banned all demonstrations. In May 1921 however, further anti-Jewish riots broke out in Jaffa and dozens of Arabs and Jews were killed in the confrontations.
The articles of the Mandate mentioned the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, but not their political status. At the San Remo conference, it was decided to accept the text of those articles, while inserting in the minutes of the conference an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of any of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. In 1922, the British authorities over Mandatory Palestine proposed a draft constitution that would have granted the Palestinian Arabs representation in a Legislative Council on condition that they accept the terms of the mandate. The Palestine Arab delegation rejected the proposal as "wholly unsatisfactory," noting that "the People of Palestine" could not accept the inclusion of the Balfour Declaration in the constitution's preamble as the basis for discussions. They further took issue with the designation of Palestine as a British "colony of the lowest order."[tpl]cite web|title=Correspondence with the Palestine Arab Delegation and the Zionist Organization|publisher=United Nations (original from His Majesty's Stationery Office)|date=21 February 1922|accessdate=2007-08-01|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0145a8233e14d2b585256cbf005af141/48a7e5584ee1403485256cd8006c3fbe!OpenDocument |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016050752/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0145a8233e14d2b585256cbf005af141/48a7e5584ee1403485256cd8006c3fbe!OpenDocument |archivedate = October 16, 2007[/tpl] The Arabs tried to get the British to offer an Arab legal establishment again roughly ten years later, but to no avail."Palestine Arabs."

After the killing of sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam by the British in 1935, his followers initiated the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, which began with a general strike in Jaffa and attacks on Jewish and British installations in Nablus. The Arab High Committee called for a nationwide general strike, non-payment of taxes, and the closure of municipal governments, and demanded an end to Jewish immigration and a ban of the sale of land to Jews. By the end of 1936, the movement had become a national revolt, and resistance grew during 1937 and 1938. In response, the British declared martial law, dissolved the Arab High Committee and arrested officials from the Supreme Muslim Council who were behind the revolt. By 1939, 5,000 Arabs had been killed in British attempts to quash the revolt; more than 15,000 were wounded.

====The "lost years" (1948–1967)====

After the 1948 Palestine war and the accompanying Palestinian exodus, known to Palestinians as Al Nakba (the "catastrophe"), there was a hiatus in Palestinian political activity. Khalidi attributes this to the tramautic events of 1947-49, which included the depopulation of over 400 towns and villages and the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.Khalidi, 1997, pp. 178-180. Those parts of British Mandatory Palestine which did not become part of the newly declared Israeli state were occupied by Egypt or annexed by Jordan. During what Khalidi terms the "lost years" that followed, Palestinians lacked a center of gravity, divided as they were between these countries and others such as Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere.Khalidi, 1997, p. 179.
Israeli historian Efraim Karsh takes the view that the Palestinian identity did not develop until after the 1967 war because the Palestinian exodus had fractured society so greatly that it was impossible to piece together a national identity. Between 1948 and 1967, the Jordanians and other Arab countries hosting Arab refugees from Palestine/Israel silenced any expression of Palestinian identity and occupied their lands until Israel's conquests of 1967. The formal annexation of the West Bank by Jordan in 1950, and the subsequent granting of its Palestinian residents Jordanian citizenship, further stunted the growth of a Palestinian national identity by integrating them into Jordanian society.Karsh, Efraim. Arafat's War: The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest. New York: Grove Press, 2003. p. 43. "Upon occupying the West Bank during the 1948 war, King Abdallah moved quickly to erase all traces of corporate Palestinian identity."
In the 1950s, a new generation of Palestinian nationalist groups and movements began to organize clandestinely, stepping out onto the public stage in the 1960s.Khalidi, 1997, p. 180. The traditional Palestinian elite who had dominated negotiations with the British and the Zionists in the Mandate, and who were largely held responsible for the loss of Palestine, were replaced by these new movements whose recruits generally came from poor to middle-class backgrounds and were often students or recent graduates of universities in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. The potency of the pan-Arabist ideology put forward by Gamal Abdel Nasser—popular among Palestinians for whom Arabism was already an important component of their identityKhalidi, 1997, p. 182.—tended to obscure the identities of the separate Arab states it subsumed.Khalidi, 1997, p. 181.

====1967–present====

Since 1967, Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have lived under military occupation, creating, according to Avram Bornstein, a carceralization of their society.Avram Bornstein, 'Military Occupation as Carceral Society: Prisons, Checkpoints, and Wall in the Israeli-Palestinian Struggle,' in Avram Bornstein, Paul E. Farmer (et al.)An Anthropology Of War: Views from the Frontline, Berghahn Books, 2009 pp.106-130, p.108:'On the whole, the Israeli Occupation has created an increasing prison-like society for Palestinians'.  In the meantime, pan-Arabism has waned as an aspect of Palestinian identity. The Israeli capture of the Gaza Strip and West Bank triggered a second Palestinian exodus and fractured Palestinian political and militant groups, prompting them to give up residual hopes in pan-Arabism. They rallied increasingly around the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been formed in Cairo in 1964. The group grew in popularity in the following years, especially under the nationalistic orientation of the leadership of Yasser Arafat.[tpl]cite web|title=The PNC program of 1974|publisher=Mideastweb.org|date=8 June 1974|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/plo1974.htm[/tpl]The PNC adopted the goal of establishing a national state in 1974. Mainstream secular Palestinian nationalism was grouped together under the umbrella of the PLO whose constituent organizations include Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, among other groups who at that time believed that political violence was the only way to liberate Palestine. These groups gave voice to a tradition that emerged in the 1960s that argues Palestinian nationalism has deep historical roots, with extreme advocates reading a Palestinian nationalist consciousness and identity back into the history of Palestine over the past few centuries, and even millennia, when such a consciousness is in fact relatively modern.Khalidi, 1997, p. 149. Khalidi writes: 'As with other national movements, extreme advocates of this view go further than this, and anachronistically read back into the history of Palestine over the past few centuries, and even millennia, a nationalist consciousness and identity that are in fact relatively modern.'
The Battle of Karameh and the events of Black September in Jordan contributed to growing Palestinian support for these groups, particularly among Palestinians in exile. Concurrently, among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a new ideological theme, known as sumud, represented the Palestinian political strategy popularly adopted from 1967 onward. As a concept closely related to the land, agriculture and indigenousness, the ideal image of the Palestinian put forward at this time was that of the peasant (in Arabic, fellah) who stayed put on his land, refusing to leave. A strategy more passive than that adopted by the Palestinian fedayeen, sumud provided an important subtext to the narrative of the fighters, "in symbolizing continuity and connections with the land, with peasantry and a rural way of life."Schulz and Hammer, 2003, p. 105.
In 1974, the PLO was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the Arab nation-states and was granted observer status as a national liberation movement by the United Nations that same year.[tpl]cite web|title=Security Council|publisher=WorldMUN2007 – United Nations Security Council|date=30 March 2007|accessdate=2007-07-31|url=http://www.worldmun.org/MUNBase2007/files/downloads/guides/SCGuideA.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808101615/http://www.worldmun.org/MUNBase2007/files/downloads/guides/SCGuideA.pdf |archivedate = August 8, 2007[/tpl] Israel rejected the resolution, calling it "shameful".[tpl]cite web |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/MFADocuments/Yearbook2/Pages/48%20Statement%20in%20the%20Knesset%20by%20Deputy%20Premier%20and.aspx |title=48 Statement in the Knesset by Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Allon - 26 November 1974 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel) |date=26 November 1974 |accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] In a speech to the Knesset, Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Yigal Allon outlined the government's view that: "No one can expect us to recognize the terrorist organization called the PLO as representing the Palestinians—because it does not.

In 1975, the United Nations established a subsidiary organ, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to recommend a program of implementation to enable the Palestinian people to exercise national independence and their rights to self-determination without external interference, national independence and sovereignty, and to return to their homes and property.See Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/qpal/committee_background.htm
The First Intifada (1987–93) was the first popular uprising against the Israeli occupation of 1967. Followed by the PLO's 1988 proclamation of a State of Palestine, these developments served to further reinforce the Palestinian national identity. After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait.Kuwait Expels Thousands of Palestinians The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein.
The Oslo Accords, the first Israeli-Palestinian interim peace agreement, were signed in 1993. The process was envisioned to last five years, ending in June 1999, when the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area began. The expiration of this term without the recognition by Israel of the Palestinian State and without the effective termination of the occupation was followed by the Second Intifada in 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=Report of the Independent Fact Finding Committee On Gaza: No Safe Place|url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/picture_gallery/reportfullFINAL.pdf|publisher=The League of Arab States|accessdate=20 September 2010|page=145|date=30 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Palestine and the Palestinians: a social and political history|last1=Farsoun|first1=Samih|last2=Hasan Aruri|first2=Naseer|year=2006|publisher=Westview Press|page=275[/tpl] The second intifada was more violent than the first.[tpl]cite book|last=Gordon|first=Neve|title=Israel's occupation|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-25531-3|pages=198|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4RX7t4X8_RMC&lpg=PA198&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The International Court of Justice observed that since the government of Israel had decided to recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people, their existence was no longer an issue.

===Ancestral origins===

Like the Lebanese, Syrians, Egyptians, Maghrebis, and most other people today commonly called Arabs, the Palestinians are an Arab people in linguistic and cultural affiliation. Since the Islamic conquest in the 7th century, Palestine, a then Hellenized location, came under the influence of an Arabic-speaking Kurdish Muslim dynasty known as the Ayyubids, whose culture and language through the process of Arabization was adopted by the people of Palestine. Genetic research studies suggests that some or perhaps most of the present-day Palestinians have roots that go back to before the 7th century, maybe even ancient inhabitants of the area.[tpl]cite journal|title=High-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs reveal geographic substructure and substantial overlap with haplotypes of Jews|author=Nebel|publisher=Human Genetics|year=2000|volume=107|pages=630–641|display-authors=1|author2=[/tpl]"According to historical records part, or perhaps the majority, of the Muslim Arabs in this country descended from local inhabitants, mainly Christians and Jews, who had converted after the Islamic conquest in the seventh century AD (Shaban 1971; Mc Graw Donner 1981). These local inhabitants, in turn, were descendants of the core population that had lived in the area for several centuries, some even since prehistorical times (Gil 1992)... Thus, our findings are in good agreement with the historical record..."

Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, explains:
 "Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabataeans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and Western European Crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and the Mongol raids of the late 1200s, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes ... Like shooting stars, the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine. The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture." 
George Antonius, founder of modern Arab nationalist history, wrote in his seminal 1938 book The Arab Awakening:  " The Arabs' connection with Palestine goes back uninterruptedly to the earliest historic times, for the term 'Arab' Palestine denotes nowadays not merely the incomers from the Arabian Peninsula who occupied the country in the seventh century, but also the older populations who intermarried with their conquerors, acquired their speech, customs and ways of thought and became permanently arabised."Antonius, The Arab Awakening, p390 American historian Bernard Lewis writes:  "Clearly, in Palestine as elsewhere in the Middle East, the modern inhabitants include among their ancestors those who lived in the country in antiquity. Equally obviously, the demographic mix was greatly modified over the centuries by migration, deportation, immigration, and settlement. This was particularly true in Palestine..."Lewis, 1999, p. 49. 
Eric M. Meyers, a Duke University historian of religion, writes:
 "What is the significance of the Palestinians really being descended from the Canaanites? In the early and more conservative reconstruction of history, it might be said that this merely confirms the historic enmity between Israel and its enemies. However, some scholars believe that Israel actually emerged from within the Canaanite community itself (Northwest Semites) and allied itself with Canaanite elements against the city-states and elites of Canaan. Once they were disenfranchised by these city-statres and elites, the Israelites and some disenfranchised Canaanites joined together to challenge the hegemony of the heads of the city-states and forged a new identity in the hill country based on egalitarian principles and a common threat from without. This is another irony in modern politics: the Palestinians in truth are blood brothers or cousins of the modern Israelis."Eric M. Meyers, "Revisionist History and the Quest for History in the Middle East Today", in Seymour Gitin, J. Edward Wright, J. P. Dessel (eds), Confronting the Past: Archeological and Historical Essays in Honor of William G. Dever, Eisenbrauns, 2006, pp. 255-263; p. 260. 

===Politicized lineages===

Salim Tamari notes the paradoxes produced by the search for "nativist" roots among Zionist figures and the so-called Canaanite followers of Yonatan Ratosh. For example, Ber Borochov, one of the key ideological architects of Socialist Zionism, claimed as early as 1905 that, "The Fellahin in Eretz-Israel are the descendants of remnants of the Hebrew agricultural community,"Ber Borochov, Writings of Ber Borochov, Volume 1, Kibbuts Meukhad Publishing, 1955, p. 10. believing them to be descendants of the ancient Hebrew and Canaanite residents 'together with a small admixture of Arab blood'". He further believed that the Palestinian peasantry would embrace Zionism and that the lack of a crystallized national consciousness among Palestinian Arabs would result in their likely assimilation into the new Hebrew nationalism. David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Ben Zvi, later becoming Israel's first Prime Minister and second President, respectively, tried to establish in a 1918 paper written in Yiddish that Palestinian peasants and their mode of life were living historical testimonies to Israelite practices in the biblical period.David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Ben Zvi, The Land of Israel in the Past and the Present, Yad Ben-Zvi, 1980, pp. 196–198. Tamari notes that "the ideological implications of this claim became very problematic and were soon withdrawn from circulation."
Ahad Ha'am believed that, "the Moslems Palestine are the ancient residents of the land ... who became Christians on the rise of Christianity and became Moslems on the arrival of Islam." Israel Belkind, the founder of the Bilu movement also asserted that the Palestinian Arabs were the blood brothers of the Jews. In his book on the Palestinians, The Arabs in Eretz-Israel, Belkind advanced the idea that the dispersion of Jews out of the Land of Israel after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Roman emperor Titus is a "historic error" that must be corrected. While it dispersed much of the land's Jewish community around the world, those "workers of the land that remained attached to their land," stayed behind and were eventually converted to Christianity and then Islam. He therefore, proposed that this historical wrong be corrected, by embracing the Palestinians as their own and proposed the opening of Hebrew schools for Palestinian Arab Muslims to teach them Arabic, Hebrew and universal culture.Israel Belkind, Arabs in Eretz Israel, Tel Aviv: Hermon Publishers, 1969, p. 8. Tsvi Misinai, an Israeli researcher, entrepreneur and proponent of a controversial alternative solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, asserts that nearly 90% of all Palestinians living within Israel and the occupied territories (including Israel's Arab citizens and Negev Bedouin)The lost Palestinian Jews- August 20, 2009 are descended from the Jewish Israelite peasantry that remained on the land, after the others, mostly city dwellers, were exiled or left.A tragic misunderstanding – Times online, January 13, 2009.
Claims emanating from certain circles within Palestinian society and their supporters, proposing that Palestinians have direct ancestral connections to the ancient Canaanites, without an intermediate Israelite link, has been an issue of contention within the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Bernard Lewis wrote that "the rewriting of the past is usually undertaken to achieve specific political aims...In bypassing the biblical Israelites and claiming kinship with the Canaanites, the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Palestine, it is possible to assert a historical claim antedating the biblical promise and possession put forward by the Jews."Bernard Lewis, Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry Into Conflict and Prejudice, W. W. Norton & Company, 1999, ISBN 0-393-31839-7, p. 49.
Some Palestinian scholars, like Zakariyya Muhammad, have criticized pro-Palestinian arguments based on Canaanite lineage, or what he calls "Canaanite ideology". He states that it is an "intellectual fad, divorced from the concerns of ordinary people."[tpl]cite journal|title=Lepers, Lunatics and Saints: The Nativist Ethnography of Tawfiq Canaan and his Jerusalem Circle|author=Salim Tamari|publisher=Jerusalem Quarterly|volume=Issue 20|date=Winter 2004|accessdate=2010-03-31|url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/images/ArticlesPdf/20_lebers.pdf|format=[/tpl] By assigning its pursuit to the desire to predate Jewish national claims, he describes Canaanism as a "losing ideology", whether or not it is factual, "when used to manage our conflict with the Zionist movement" since Canaanism "concedes a priori the central thesis of Zionism. Namely that we have been engaged in a perennial conflict with Zionism—and hence with the Jewish presence in Palestine—since the Kingdom of Solomon and before ... thus in one stroke Canaanism cancels the assumption that Zionism is a European movement, propelled by modern European contingencies..."

===DNA and genetic studies===

In recent years, many genetic studies have demonstrated that, at least paternally, most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and the Palestinians – and in some cases other Levantines – are genetically closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews to non-Jewish Europeans.
One DNA study by Nebel found genetic evidence in support of historical records that "part, or perhaps the majority" of Muslim Palestinians descend from "local inhabitants, mainly Christians and Jews, who had converted after the Islamic conquest in the seventh century AD".Nebel et al., High-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs reveal geographic substructure and substantial overlap with haplotypes of Jews. Human Genetics Vol. 107, No. 6, (December 2000), pp. 630–641 They also found substantial genetic overlap between Muslim Palestinians and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, though with some significant differences that might be explainable by the geographical isolation of the Jews and by immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium.
In a genetic study of Y-chromosomal STRs in two populations from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area: Christian and Muslim Palestinians showed genetic differences. The majority of Palestinian Christians (31.82%) were a subclade of E1b1b, followed by G2a (11.36%), and J1 (9.09%). The majority of Palestinian Muslims were haplogroup J1 (37.82%) followed by E1b1b (19.33%), and T (5.88%).

The haplogroup J1, the ancestor of subclade M267, originates south of the Levant and was first disseminated from there into Ethiopia and Europe in Neolithic times. In Jewish populations, J1 has a rate of around 15%, with haplogroup J2 (M172) (of eight sub-Haplogroups) being almost twice as common as J1 among Jews (}}
Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA) includes the modal haplotype of the Galilee Arabs and of Moroccan ArabsBosch et al. 2001. and the sister Modal Haplotype of the Cohanim, the "Cohan Modale Haplotype", representing the descendents of the priestly caste Aaron.Map of J1 Cohen Modale Haplotype clade and Arab sisters clusters at The Y-Haplogroup J DNA Project at Family Tree DNA http://www.familytreedna.com/public/Y-DNA_J/default.aspx?section=resultsNebel et al. 2001, Fig 3-Simplified netword of CMH and sisters Galilee MH and Bedoin MH http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1274378&rendertype=figure&id=FG3The Arabian Peninsula Project at Family Tree DNA
J2 is known to be related to the ancient Greek movements and is found mainly in Europe and the central Mediterranean (Italy, the Balkans, Greece).
According to a 2010 study by Behar et al. titled "The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people", some Palestinians tested clustered genetically close to Bedouins, Jordanians and Saudi Arabians which could indicate a common ancestry or some recent ancestral influx from the Arabian Peninsula.[tpl]cite journal |author1= Doron M.

A study found that the Palestinians, like Jordanians, Syrians, Iraqis, Turks, and Kurds have what appears to be Female-Mediated gene flow in the form of Maternal DNA Haplogroups from Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 117 Palestinian individuals tested, 15 carried maternal haplogroups that originated in Sub-Saharan Africa. These results are consistent with female migration from eastern Africa into Near Eastern communities within the last few thousand years. There have been many opportunities for such migrations during this period. However, the most likely explanation for the presence of predominantly female lineages of African origin in these areas is that they may trace back to women brought from Africa as part of the Arab slave trade, assimilated into the areas under Arab rule as a result of miscegenation and manumission.Martin Richards, Chiara Rengo, Fulvio Cruciani, Fiona Gratrix, James F. Wilson, Rosaria Scozzari, Vincent Macaulay, and Antonio Torroni, "Extensive Female-Mediated Gene Flow from Sub-Saharan Africa into Near Eastern Arab Populations", in American Journal of Human Genetics, April 2003; 72(4): 1058–1064.
According to a 2002 study by Nebel et al. titled "Genetic Evidence for the Expansion of Arabian Tribes", the highest frequency of Eu10 (i.e. J1) (30%–62.5%) has been observed so far in various Muslim Arab populations in the Middle East.Semino et al. 2000; Nebel et al. 2001.Almut Nebel et al., "Genetic Evidence for the Expansion of Arabian Tribes into the Southern Levant and North Africa", Am J Hum Genet, June 2002; 70(6): 1594–1596 http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=379148
The term "Arab", as well as the presence of Arabs in the Syrian Desert and the Fertile Crescent, is first seen in the Assyrian sources from the 9th century BCE (Eph'al 1984).
A 2013 study of Haber and et al. found that "The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen." The authors explained that "religious affiliation had a strong impact on the genomes of the Levantines. In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations." The authors also reconstructed the genetic structure of pre-Islamic Levant and found that "it was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners."http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003316

====Arabian origins of local Bedouin====

The local Bedouins of Palestine originate from the Arabian Peninsula and speak a distinct variety of Arabic.Andrew Forbes and David Henley‏, People of Palestine Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books, 2012. Arabic onomastic elements began to appear in Edomite inscriptions starting in the 6th century BC and the inscriptions of the Nabataeans who arrived in today’s Jordan in the 4th-3rd centuries BC.Healey, 2001, pp. 26–28.
A few Bedouin are found as far north as Galilee; however, these seem to be much later arrival, rather than descendants of the Arabs that Sargon II settled in Samaria in 720 BC. The term "Arab", as well as the presence of Arabs in the Syrian Desert and the Fertile Crescent, is first seen in the Assyrian sources from the 9th century BCE (Eph'al 1984).Eph`al I (1984) The Ancient Arabs.

====Samaritan descent in Nablus====

Much of the local Palestinian population in Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam.[tpl]cite web|title=The Samaritans – A Jewish Sect in Israel: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm[/tpl] Even today, certain Nabulsi surnames including Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others, are associated with a Samaritan origin.

==Demographics==

In the absence of a comprehensive census including all Palestinian diaspora populations, and those that have remained within what was British Mandate Palestine, exact population figures are difficult to determine. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) announced on 20 October 2004 that the number of Palestinians worldwide at the end of 2003 was 9.6 million, an increase of 800,000 since 2001.Statistical Abstract of Palestine No. 5
In 2005, a critical review of the PCBS figures and methodology was conducted by the American-Israel Demographic Research Group (AIDRG).American-Israel Demographic Research Group (AIDRG), is led by Bennett Zimmerman, Yoram Ettinger, Roberta Seid, and Michael L. Wise In their report,[tpl]cite web|title=The Million Person Gap: The Arab Population in the West Bank and Gaza|author=Bennett Zimmerman, Roberta Seid & Michael L. Wise|publisher=Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/Besa/MSPS65.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] they claimed that several errors in the PCBS methodology and assumptions artificially inflated the numbers by a total of 1.3 million. The PCBS numbers were cross-checked against a variety of other sources (e.g., asserted birth rates based on fertility rate assumptions for a given year were checked against Palestinian Ministry of Health figures as well as Ministry of Education school enrollment figures six years later; immigration numbers were checked against numbers collected at border crossings, etc.). The errors claimed in their analysis included: birth rate errors (308,000), immigration & emigration errors (310,000), failure to account for migration to Israel (105,000), double-counting Jerusalem Arabs (210,000), counting former residents now living abroad (325,000) and other discrepancies (82,000). The results of their research was also presented before the United States House of Representatives on 8 March 2006.Bennett Zimmerman, Roberta Seid, and Michael L. Wise, "Voodoo Demographics", Azure, Summer 5766/2006, No. 25.
The study was criticised by Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Sergio DellaPergola, Letter to the editor, Azure, 2007, No. 27, http://www.azure.org.il/magazine/magazine.asp?id=29 http://www.azure.co.il/download/magazine/AZ%2027%20letters.pdf DellaPergola accused the authors of the AIDRG report of misunderstanding basic principles of demography on account of their lack of expertise in the subject, but he also acknowledged that he did not take into account the emigration of Palestinians and thinks it has to be examined, as well as the birth and mortality statistics of the Palestinian Authority.You can count on them, Haaretz
He also accused AIDRG of selective use of data and multiple systematic errors in their analysis, claiming that the authors assumed the Palestinian Electoral registry to be complete even though registration is voluntary, and they used an unrealistically low Total Fertility Ratio (a statistical abstraction of births per woman) to reanalyse that data in a "typical circular mistake." DellaPergola estimated the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza at the end of 2005 as 3.33 million, or 3.57 million if East Jerusalem is included. These figures are only slightly lower than the official Palestinian figures.
The AIDRG study was also criticized by Ian Lustick, who accused its authors of multiple methodological errors and a political agenda.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ian Lustick | title = What Counts is the Counting: Statistical Manipulation as a Solution to Israel’s "Demographic Problem" | journal = Middle East Journal | volume = 67 | number = 2 | season = Spring | year = 2013 | pages = 185–205[/tpl]

In total, an estimated 600,000 Palestinians are thought to reside in the Americas. Palestinian emigration to South America began for economic reasons that pre-dated the Arab-Israeli conflict, but continued to grow thereafter.Farsoun, 2004, p. 84.

===Refugees===

In 2006, there were 4,255,120 Palestinians registered as refugees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This number includes the descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war, but excludes those who have since then emigrated to areas outside of UNRWA's remit. Based on these figures, almost half of all Palestinians are registered refugees. The 993,818 Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and 705,207 Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, who hail from towns and villages now located within the borders of Israel, are included in these figures.[tpl]cite web|title=Publications and Statistics|publisher=UNRWA|date=31 March 2006|accessdate=2007-05-30|url=http://www.un.org/unrwa/publications/index.html[/tpl]
UNRWA figures do not include some 274,000 people, or 1 in 5.5 of all Arab residents of Israel, who are internally displaced Palestinian refugees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.badil.org/Publications/Monographs/Palestinian.IDPs.pdf|title=Badil Resource Centre for Palestinian Refugee and Residency Rights|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/F11200E8ECD83F71802570B8005A7276?OpenDocument |title=Internal Displacement Monitoring Center |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-22[/tpl]
Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank are organized according to a refugee family's village or place of origin. Among the first things that children born in the camps learn is the name of their village of origin. David McDowall writes that, "... a yearning for Palestine permeates the whole refugee community and is most ardently espoused by the younger refugees, for whom home exists only in the imagination."McDowall, 1989, p. 90.
Israeli policy to prevent the refugees returning to their homes was initially formulated by David Ben Gurion and Joseph Weitz and formally adopted by the Israeli cabinet in June 1948.[tpl]cite book|last=Gibney|first=Mathew|title=Immigration and Asylum: From 1900 to the Present|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576077962|pages=469–470|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2c6ifbjx2wMC&lpg=PA470&dq=Israel%20refused%20to%20allow%20refugees%20to%20return%20to%20their%20homes%20242&pg=PA470#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]  In December of that year the UN adopted resolution 194, which resolved "that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible."[tpl]cite book|last=Muslih|first=Muhammad|title=The Middle East in 2015 The Impact of Regional Trends on U.S. Strategic Planning|year=2002|publisher=Diane Publishing reprint.

In the intervening years Israel has consistently refused to change its position and has introduced further legislation to hinder Palestinians refugees from returning and reclaiming their land and confiscated property.
In keeping with an Arab League resolution in 1965, most Arab countries have refused to grant citizenship to Palestinians, arguing that it would be a threat to their right of return to their homes in Palestine. In 2012, Egypt deviated from this practice by granting citizenship to 50,000 Palestinians, mostly from the Gaza Strip.'Egypt grants citizenship to 50,000 Palestinians', Jerusalem Post

===Religion===

93% of Palestinians are Muslim,[tpl]cite web|title=Are all Palestinians Muslim?|url=http://imeu.net/news/article0042.shtml|work=Institute for Middle East Understanding|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] the vast majority of whom are followers of the Sunni branch of Islam,Lybarger, 2007, p. 114. with a small minority of Ahmadiyya.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137789#.U1vh-_ldUdk | title=PA's Moderate Muslims Face Threats | date=May 31, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2014| publisher=Israel National News[/tpl]
Palestinian Christians represent a significant minority of 6%, followed by much smaller religious communities, including Druze and Samaritans. Palestinian Jews – considered Palestinian by the Palestinian National Charter adopted by the PLO which defined them as those "Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion" – today identify as Israelis[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] (with the exception of a very few individuals). Palestinian Jews almost universally abandoned any such identity after the establishment of Israel and their incorporation into the Israeli Jewish population, largely composed of Jewish immigrants from around the world.
Until the end of the 19th century, most Palestinian Muslim villagers in the countryside did not have local mosques. Cross-cultural syncretism between Christian and Islamic symbols and figures in religious practice was common. Popular feast days, like Thursday of the Dead, were celebrated by both Muslims and Christians and shared prophets and saints include Jonah, who is worshipped in Halhul as both a Biblical and Islamic prophet, and St. George, who is known in Arabic as el Khader. Villagers would pay tribute to local patron saints at a maqam – a domed single room often placed in the shadow of an ancient carob or oak tree.[tpl]cite web|title=Palestinian Cave Dwellers and Holy Shrines: The Passing of Traditional Society|author=Dr. Ali Qleibo|publisher=This Week in Palestine|date=28 July 2007|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=2208&ed=144&edid=144These[/tpl] Saints, taboo by the standards of orthodox Islam, mediated between man and Allah, and shrines to saints and holy men dotted the Palestinian landscape. Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, states that this built evidence constitutes "an architectural testimony to Christian/Moslem Palestinian religious sensibility and its roots in ancient Semitic religions."
Religion as constitutive of individual identity was accorded a minor role within Palestinian tribal social structure until the latter half of the 19th century. Jean Moretain, a priest writing in 1848, wrote that a Christian in Palestine was "distinguished only by the fact that he belonged to a particular clan. If a certain tribe was Christian, then an individual would be Christian, but without knowledge of what distinguished his faith from that of a Muslim."
The concessions granted to France and other Western powers by the Ottoman Sultanate in the aftermath of the Crimean War had a significant impact on contemporary Palestinian religious cultural identity. Religion was transformed into an element "constituting the individual/collective identity in conformity with orthodox precepts", and formed a major building block in the political development of Palestinian nationalism.
The British census of 1922 registered 752,048 inhabitants in Palestine, consisting of 660,641 Palestinian Arabs (Christian and Muslim Arabs), 83,790 Palestinian Jews, and 7,617 persons belonging to other groups. The corresponding percentage breakdown is 87% Christian and Muslim Arab and 11% Jewish. Bedouin were not counted in the census, but a 1930 British study estimated their number at 70,860.[tpl]cite web|title=The Demographic War for Palestine|author=Janet Abu-Lughod|publisher=Americans for Middle East Understanding|url=http://www.ameu.org/getattachment/0ac57681-cb8e-44cd-af80-36a90f4520b1/The-Demographic-War-for-Palestine.aspx[/tpl]

It is not directed at Arab countries or Arab nationality or the Palestinian people, and does not express sharing any fate with them. From this point of view, their identity is Israel, and this identity is stronger than their Arab identity".Nissim Dana, The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status, Sussex Academic Press, 2003, p. 201.

===Current demographics===

According to the PCBS, there is an estimated 4,420,549 Palestinians in the Palestinian territories as of 2013, of which 2,719,112 live in the West Bank and 1,701,437 in the Gaza Strip. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, there is 1,658,000 Arab citizens of Israel. Both figures include Palestinians in East Jerusalem.
In Jordan, there is no official census data for how many inhabitants are Palestinians but they are estimated to constitute half of the population,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66302 |title=Assessment for Palestinians in Jordan |publisher=Minorities at Risk |year=2006 |accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.minorityrights.org/4945/jordan/palestinians.html |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Jordan |publisher=Minority Rights Group International |year=2008 |accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] which in 2008 amounted to about 3 million. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics put their number at 3.24 million in 2009.

==Language==

Palestinian Arabic is a subgroup of the broader Levantine Arabic dialect. Prior to the 7th century Islamic Conquest and Arabization of the Levant, the primary languages spoken in Palestine, among the predominately Christian and Jewish communities, were Aramaic, Greek, and Syriac.[tpl]cite book|last=Bonfil, Irshai, Stroumsa, Talgam|title=Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures|year=2011|pages=317, 335, 320|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=4DNz3y7Wep4C&pg=PA320#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9789004203556[/tpl]  Arabic was also spoken in some areas.[tpl]cite book|last=Scribner's|title=Cyril Mango. Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome.|year=1980|pages=13|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/mango.asp[/tpl]    Palestinian Arabic, like other variations of the Levantine dialect, exhibits substantial influences in lexicon from Aramaic.Greenfield et al., 2001, p. 158.
Palestinian Arabic has three primary sub-variations, Rural, Urban, and Bedouin, with the pronunciation of the Qāf serving as a shibboleth to distinguish between the three main Palestinian sub-dialects: The urban variety notes a Q sound, while the rural variety (spoken in the villages around major cities) have a K for the Q.  The Bedouin variety of Palestine (spoken mainly in the southern region and along the Jordan valley) use a G instead of Q.[tpl]cite book|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|title=Sociolinguistics/Soziolinguistik 3: An International Handbook of the Science|year=2006|pages=1922|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&lpg=PA1922&dq=levantine%20arabic%20influences&pg=PR4#v=onepage&q=levantine%20arabic%20influences&f=false|isbn=9783110184181[/tpl]
Barbara McKean Parmenter has noted that the Arabs of Palestine have been credited with the preservation of the indigenous Semitic place names for many sites mentioned in the Bible that were documented by the American archaeologist Edward Robinson in the early 20th century.Parmenter, 1994, p. 11.
Palestinians who live or work in Israel generally can also speak Modern Hebrew, as do some who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

==Culture==

Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, has critiqued Muslim historiography for assigning the beginning of Palestinian cultural identity to the advent of Islam in the 7th century. In describing the effect of such a historiography, he writes:  Pagan origins are disavowed. As such the peoples who populated Palestine throughout history have discursively rescinded their own history and religion as they adopted the religion, language, and culture of Islam.  That the peasant culture of the large fellahin class showed features of cultures other than Islam was a conclusion arrived at by some Western scholars and explorers who mapped and surveyed Palestine during the latter half of the 19th century,Parkes, 1970, pp. 209–210. and these ideas were to influence 20th century debates on Palestinian identity by local and international ethnographers.
The contributions of the 'nativist' ethnographies produced by Tawfiq Canaan and other Palestinian writers and published in The Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society (1920–48) were driven by the concern that the "native culture of Palestine", and in particular peasant society, was being undermined by the forces of modernity. Salim Tamari writes that:  "Implicit in their scholarship (and made explicit by Canaan himself) was another theme, namely that the peasants of Palestine represent—through their folk norms ... the living heritage of all the accumulated ancient cultures that had appeared in Palestine (principally the Canaanite, Philistine, Hebraic, Nabatean, Syrio-Aramaic and Arab)." 
Palestinian culture is closely related to those of the nearby Levantine countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, and the Arab World. Cultural contributions to the fields of art, literature, music, costume and cuisine express the characteristics of the Palestinian experience and show signs of common origin despite the geographical separation between the Palestinian territories, Israel and the diaspora.[tpl]cite web|title=Book records Palestinian art history|author=Ismail Elmokadem|date=10 December 2005|accessdate=2008-04-18|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=17014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Manchester Festival of Palestinian Literature|publisher=Manchester Festival of Palestinian literature|url=http://www.fabrikation.co.uk/mlpf/about.html|author=Danny Moran|accessdate=2008-04-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031413/http://www.fabrikation.co.uk/mlpf/about.html |archivedate = March 31, 2008[/tpl]Regev Motti (1993), Oud and Guitar: The Musical Culture of the Arabs in Israel (Institute for Israeli Arab Studies, Beit Berl), ISBN 965-454-002-9, p. 4.
Al-Quds Capital of Arab Culture is an initiative undertaken by UNESCO under the Cultural Capitals Program to promote Arab culture and encourage cooperation in the Arab region. The opening event was launched in March 2009.

===Art===

Similar to the structure of Palestinian society, the Palestinian field of arts extends over four main geographic centers: the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel, the Palestinian diaspora in the Arab world, and the Palestinian diaspora in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.[tpl]cite web|title=Hagar: Contemporary Palestinian Art|author=Tal Ben Zvi|publisher=Hagar Association|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-05|url=http://www.hagar-gallery.com/Catalogues/docs/PArt_eng_final.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

Palestine's history of rule by many different empires is reflected in Palestinian cuisine, which has benefited from various cultural contributions and exchanges. Generally-speaking, modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs and the Turks.Revisiting our table... Nasser, Christiane Dabdoub, This week in Palestine, Turbo Computers & Software Co. Ltd. June 2006. Retrieved 2008-01-08. The Arabs who conquered Syria and Palestine had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice, lamb and yogurt, as well as dates.ABC of Arabic Cuisine ArabNet. Retrieved 2007-12-25. The already simple cuisine did not advance for centuries due to Islam's strict rules of parsimony and restraint, until the rise of the Abbasids, who established Baghdad as their capital. Baghdad was historically located on Persian soil and henceforth, Persian culture was integrated into Arab culture during the 9th-11th centuries and spread throughout central areas of the empire.
There are several foods native to Palestine that are well known in the Arab world, such as, kinafe Nabulsi, Nabulsi cheese (cheese of Nablus), Ackawi cheese (cheese of Acre) and musakhan. Kinafe originated in Nablus, as well as the sweetened Nabulsi cheese used to fill it.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Mezze describes an assortment of dishes laid out on the table for a meal that takes place over several hours, a characteristic common to Mediterranean cultures. Some common mezze dishes are hummus, tabouleh, baba ghanoush, labaneh, and zate 'u zaatar, which is the pita bread dipping of olive oil and ground thyme and sesame seeds.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Entrées that are eaten throughout the Palestinian territories, include waraq al-'inib – boiled grape leaves wrapped around cooked rice and ground lamb. Mahashi is an assortment of stuffed vegetables such as, zucchinis, potatoes, cabbage and in Gaza, chard.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Cinema===

Palestinian cinematography, relatively young compared to Arab cinema overall, receives much European and Israeli support. Palestinian films are not exclusively produced in Arabic; some are made in English, French or Hebrew.[ref]http://www.palestinefilm.org/default.asp[tpl]dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl]
[/ref] More than 800 films have been produced about Palestinians, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and other related topics,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] examples include Divine Intervention and Paradise Now.

===Handicrafts===

A wide variety of handicrafts, many of which have been produced in the area of Palestine for hundreds of years, continue to be produced today. Palestinian handicrafts include embroidery and weaving, pottery-making, soap-making, glass-making, and olive-wood and Mother of Pearl carvings, among others.Jacobs et al., 1998, p. 72.Karmi, 2005, p. 18.

===Education===

Palestinian intellectuals, among them May Ziade and Khalil Beidas, were an integral part of the Arab intelligentsia. Educational levels among Palestinians have traditionally been high. In the 1960s the West Bank had a higher percentage of its adolescent population enrolled in high school education than did Lebanon.West Bank 44.6% versus 22.8% in Lebanon. See Elias H.Tuma, Haim Darin-Drabkin, The Economic case for Palestine, London: Croom Helm, 1978, p 48. Claude Cheysson, France’s Minister for Foreign Affairs under the first Mitterrand Presidency, held in the mid eighties that, ‘even thirty years ago, (Palestinians) probably already had the largest educated elite of all the Arab peoples.’Interview with Elias Sanbar. Claude Cheysson, "The Right to Self-Determiniation", Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 16, no. 1 (Autumn 1986), pp. 3–12; p. 3.
Contributions to Palestinian culture have been made by diaspora figures like Edward Said and Ghada Karmi, Arab citizens of Israel like Emile Habibi, and Jordanians like Ibrahim Nasrallah.Jordanian Poets: Samer Raimouny, Mustafa Wahbi, Haider Mahmoud, Ibrahim Nasrallah[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pontas-agency.com/Autors/ENG/Ibrahim_Nasrallah_Ibrahim_Nasrallah_6955.asp|title=Biography Ibrahim Nasrallah|publisher=Pontas literary & film agency|accessdate=14 December 2010[/tpl]

===Literature===

Palestinian literature forms part of the wider genre of Arabic literature. unlike its Arabic counterparts, Palestinian literature is defined by national affiliation rather than territorially. Thus Egyptian literature is that literature produced in Egypt. This too was the case for Palestinian literature up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, but following the Palestinian Exodus of 1948 it has become a "a literature written by Palestinians" regardless of their residential status.[tpl]cite web|title=Hebrew Translations of Palestinian Literature — from Total Denial to Partial Recognition|author=Hannah Amit-Kochavi|publisher=Beit Berl College, Israel|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ttr/2000/v13/n1/037393ar.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Literature and Nation in the Middle East|author=Ibrahim Muhawi et al.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zlbtyGIZyZQC&pg=PP6&dq=%22palestinian+literature%22+%22arabic+literature%22+palestine|isbn=978-0-7486-2073-9[/tpl]
Contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common.[tpl]cite web|title=Palestinian Literature and Poetry|publisher=Palestinian National Information Center|accessdate=2007-07-28|url=http://www.pnic.gov.ps/english/Media_culture/Literature_Poetry.html[/tpl] Palestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers like Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian "collective identity" and the "just case" of their struggle.[tpl]cite web|title=Art of Resistance|author=Adnan Soueif|date=21 October 2006|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://www.arabworldbooks.com/News/artofresistance.htm[/tpl] There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have "rebelled" against the demand that their art be "committed". Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that "poetry is not a civil servant, it's not a soldier, it's in nobody's employ." Rula Jebreal's novel Miral tells the story of Hind al-Husseini's effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Deir Yassin massacre,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3949069,00.html |title=Jewish filmmaker tells Palestinian story |publisher=Ynetnews |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/jewish-film-maker-directs-palestinian-story-in-miral-1.317857 |title=Jewish film maker directs Palestinian story in 'Miral' - Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-25[/tpl] and the establishment of the state of Israel.
Since 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three "branches" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.[tpl]cite journal|title=Scattered like seeds: Palestinian prose goes global|author=Steven Salaita|date=1 June 2003|journal=Studies in the Humanities|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-17848_ITM[/tpl]
Hannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside (ibid., p. 11). She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in Studies in the Humanities, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as "writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine."

===Poetry===

Poetry, using classical pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town.Shahin, 2005, p. 41. After the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel after the passage of the Citizenship Law in 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad. The work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon, published an anthology of their work in 1966. Palestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. Among the new generation of Palestinian writers, the work of  Nathalie Handal an award-winning poet, playwright, and editor has been widely published in literary journals and magazines and has been translated into twelve languages.http://imeu.net/news/article002665.shtml

==Folklore==

Palestinian folklore is the body of expressive culture, including tales, music, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and comprising the traditions (including oral traditions) of Palestinian culture. There was a folklorist revival among Palestinian intellectuals such as Nimr Sirhan, Musa Allush, Salim Mubayyid, and the Palestinian Folklore Society during the 1970s. This group attempted to establish pre-Islamic (and pre-Hebraic) cultural roots for a re-constructed Palestinian national identity. The two putative roots in this patrimony are Canaanite and Jebusite. Such efforts seem to have borne fruit as evidenced in the organization of celebrations like the Qabatiya Canaanite festival and the annual Music Festival of Yabus by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture.

===Costumes===

Foreign travelers to Palestine in late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the area's inhabitants, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman's economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or "thoub" in Arabic.[tpl]cite web|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|date=January–February 1991|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm[/tpl]
New styles began to appear the 1960s. For example the "six-branched dress" named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist.Weir, Shelagh (1989) Palestinian Costume. British Museum. ISBN 0-7141-1597-5. p. 112.  These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable "Palestinian" style.Skinner, Margarita (2007) PALESTINIAN EMBROIDERY MOTIVES. A Treasury of Stitches 1850-1950. Melisende. ISBN 978-1-901764-47-5.  p. 21. The shawal, a style popular in the West Bank and Jordan before the First Intifada, probably evolved from one of the many welfare embroidery projects in the refugee camps. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.Weir, Shelagh (1989) Palestinian Costume. British Museum. ISBN 0-7141-1597-5. pp. 88, 113.

===Dance===

A common form of Palestinian dancing known as the Dabke is a native folk dance of possible Canaanite[tpl]cite book|last=Kaschl|first=Elke|title=Dance and Authenticity in Israel and Palestine: Performing the Nation|date=2003|publisher=BRILL|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OfRAsefaeVEC&dq[/tpl]  or Phoenician[tpl]cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=[/tpl] origin.  It is marked by synchronized jumping, stamping, and movement, similar to tap dancing. One version is performed by men, another by women.

===Palestinian Hikaye===

The Palestinian Hikaye is a form of narration often told by women for children and others. The tales are fictitious but usually deal with real concerns of Middle Eastern Arab society and family issues. In this way, the Hikaye offers a critique of society from the women’s perspective and draws a portrait of the social structure that directly touch the lives of women. The majority of conflicts narrated in the tales describe women torn between duty and desire.http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/30arb_uk.htm
The Hikaye can be told at home during winter evenings, at spontaneous and convivial events attended by small groups of mothers and children. Men rarely attend as this is considered inappropriate. The expressive power of the narration lies in the use of language, emphasis, speech rhythms and vocal inflections as well as in the ability to capture the attention of the listeners and successfully convey them into a world of imagination and fantasy. Many Palestinian women over the age of 70 are Hikaye tellers, and the tradition is mainly carried on by elder women. However, it is not unusual for girls and young boys to tell tales to one another for practice or pleasure. However, some say the Hikaye is in decline due to the influence of television and other mass media.

===Folk tales===

Traditional storytelling among Palestinians is prefaced with an invitation to the listeners to give blessings to God and the Prophet Mohammed or the Virgin Mary as the case may be, and includes the traditional opening: "There was, or there was not, in the oldness of time..."Muhawi, 1989. Formulaic elements of the stories share much in common with the wider Arab world, though the rhyming scheme is distinct. There are a cast of supernatural characters: djinns who can cross the Seven Seas in an instant, giants, and ghouls with eyes of ember and teeth of brass. Stories invariably have a happy ending, and the storyteller will usually finish off with a rhyme like: "The bird has taken flight, God bless you tonight," or "Tutu, tutu, finished is my haduttu (story)."

===Music===

Palestinian music is well known throughout the Arab world.[tpl]cite web|title=Palestininan music|publisher=Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|author=Christian Poche|url=http://phonoarchive.org/grove/Entries/S47332.htm|accessdate=2008-03-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl] After 1948, a new wave of performers emerged with distinctively Palestinian themes relating to dreams of statehood and burgeoning nationalist sentiments. In addition to zajal and ataaba, traditional Palestinian songs include: Bein Al-dawai, Al-Rozana, Zarif – Al-Toul, and Al-Maijana, Dal'ona, Sahja/Saamir, Zaghareet. Over three decades, the Palestinian National Music and Dance Troupe (El Funoun) and Mohsen Subhi have reinterpreted and rearranged traditional wedding songs such as Mish'al (1986), Marj Ibn 'Amer(1989) and  Zaghareed (1997).http://www.el-funoun.org/productions/zaghared.html  Ataaba is a form of folk singing that consists of four verses, following a specific form and meter. The distinguishing feature of ataaba is that the first three verses end with the same word meaning three different things, and the fourth verse serves as a conclusion. It is usually followed by a dalouna.
The Diaspora Palestinian Reem Kelani is one of the foremost researchers and performers in the present day of music with a specifically Palestinian narrative and heritage.http://www.globalrhythm.net/WorldMusicCDReviews/MiddleEastNorthAfrica/ReemKelani.cfm Her 2006 debut solo album Sprinting Gazelle – Palestinian Songs from the Motherland and the Diaspora comprised Kelani's research and arrangement of 5 traditional Palestinian songs, whilst the other 5 songs were her own musical settings of popular and resistance poetry by the likes of Mahmoud Darwish, Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Rashid Husain and Mahmoud Salim al-Hout.http://reemkelani.com/album.asp All the songs on the album relate to 'pre-1948 Palestine'.

===Palestinian hip hop===

Palestinian hip hop reportedly started in 1998 with Tamer Nafar's group DAM.[tpl]cite news | first=Dion | last=Nissenbaum | coauthors= | title='Palestinians' embracing hip-hop to push 'perspective of the victims' | date=September 29, 2005 | publisher= | url =http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JyqZXknKWLwJ:www.jewishworldreview.com/0905/arab_hip-hop.php3+palestinian+hip+hop&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=us&client=firefox-a | work =Jewish World Review | pages = | accessdate = April 25, 2007 | language = [/tpl] These Palestinian youth forged the new Palestinian musical sub-genre, which blends Arabic melodies and hip hop beats. Lyrics are often sung in Arabic, Hebrew, English, and sometimes French. Since then, the new Palestinian musical sub-genre has grown to include artists in the Palestinian territories, Israel, Great Britain, the United States and Canada.
Borrowing from traditional rap music that first emerged in New York in the 1970s, "young Palestinian musicians have tailored the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work." Palestinian hip hop works to challenge stereotypes and instigate dialogue about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[tpl]cite web|url=http://angelingo.usc.edu/issue03/politics/a_palhiphop.php |title=Palestinian Conflict Bounces to a New Beat |accessdate=April 25, 2007 |last=El-Sabawi |first=Taleed |year=2005 |work=Angelingo |archiveurl=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8vQslE3snugJ:angelingo.usc.edu/issue03/politics/a_palhiphop.php+palestinian+hip+hop&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=10&gl=us&client=firefox-a |archivedate=April 19, 2007 [/tpl] Palestinian hip-hop artists have been strongly influenced by the messages of American rappers. Tamar Nafar says, “When I heard Tupac sing 'It’s a White Man’s World' I decided to take hip hop seriously”.[tpl]cite journal|last=Maira|first=Sunaina|title=We Ain't Missing: Palestinian Hip Hop - A Transnational Youth Movement|journal=CR: the New Centennial Review|year=2008|volume=8|issue=2|pages=161–192|doi=10.1353/ncr.0.0027[/tpl] In addition to the influences from American hip hop, it also includes musical elements from Palestinian and Arabic music including “zajal, mawwal, and saj” which can be likened to Arabic spoken word, as well as including the percussiveness and lyricism of Arabic music.
Historically, music has served as an integral accompaniment to various social and religious rituals and ceremonies in Palestinian society (Al-Taee 47). Much of the Middle-Eastern and Arabic string instruments utilized in classical Palestinian music are sampled over Hip-hop beats in both Israeli and Palestinian hip-hop as part of a joint process of localization. Just as the percussiveness of the Hebrew language is emphasized in Israeli Hip-hop, Palestinian music has always revolved around the rhythmic specificity and smooth melodic tone of Arabic. “Musically speaking, Palestinian songs are usually pure melody performed monophonically with complex vocal ornamentations and strong percussive rhythm beats”.Al-Taee, Nasser. "Voices of Peace and the Legacy of Reconciliation: Popular Music, Nationalism, and the Quest for Peace in the Middle East." Popular Music 21 (2002): 41–61. JSTOR. EBSCO. Brandeis University, Waltham. April 1, 2008. The presence of a hand-drum in classical Palestinian music indicates a cultural esthetic conducive to the vocal, verbal and instrumental percussion which serve as the foundational elements of Hip-hop. This hip hop is joining a “longer tradition of revolutionary, underground, Arabic music and political songs that have supported Palestinian Resistance”. This sub genre has served as a way to politicize the Palestinian issue through music.
