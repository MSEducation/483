The Northallerton to Eaglescliffe Line runs between the towns of Northallerton and Eaglescliffe. It connects the East Coast Main Line to the Tees Valley Line. It was built by the Leeds Northern Railway as part of their main line from Leeds to Stockton (via Harrogate and Ripon) which opened on 2 June 1852,[tpl]cite book|author=Body, G|title=PSL Field Guides - Railways of the Eastern Region Volume 2|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|location=Wellingborough|isbn=1-85260-072-1|year=1988|page=137[/tpl] although the connection to the ECML at the Northallerton end was not opened for a further four years.

===Closed===

A number of old stations that used to serve towns and villages on the line were closed between 1954 and the end of local passenger services over the route on 6 September 1965, with those at Picton, Yarm and Brompton being the last to go. The station at Yarm was subsequently reopened by TPE in 1996.

==Services==

Services are run by TransPennine Express between Manchester Airport and Middlesbrough (and to Newcastle using the Durham Coast Line during diversions - it usually travels via Darlington and Durham on the East Coast Main Line). Services are roughly hourly. This is part of the North TransPennine route.
The line is also part of the Grand Central route between Sunderland and London Kings Cross and sees use by a variety of heavy freight services to/from Teesside, including the ICI plants around Seal Sands, the Freightliner terminal at Wilton and potash trains from Boulby Mine.
