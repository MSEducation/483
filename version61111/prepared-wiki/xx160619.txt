==Etymology==

Neblinichthys is derived from the Latin nebula which means mist or vapor, and ichthys for fish.

==Appearance and anatomy==

Neblinichthys species are unique in that the breeding males have a snout brush formed by elongate, bristle-like odontodes pointing forwards on the snout. More fairly elongated odontodes are found on the top of the head and on the body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/neblin/neblin.html|title=Neblinichthys|first=Jonathan W.|last=Armbruster|accessdate=2007-06-01[/tpl] Otherwise they appear rather similar to Lasiancistrus species. Females and juveniles may be differentiated from Lasiancistrus species by the lack of cheek whiskers. Neblinichthys species also have their pectoral fin and pelvic fin spines the same length.
