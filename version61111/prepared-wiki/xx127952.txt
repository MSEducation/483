[[Poling (horse)]]

CATEGORIES: Horse training, Show jumping, Hunt seat

Poling or Rapping is the practice of hitting a horse on the legs as it goes over a jump, to make it think it hit the fence hard (due to the pain), so the animal will pick his legs up higher the next time. It is usually performed using a long bamboo stick, which is smacked on the cannon bones of the horse. 
Poling is illegal under FÉI rules, as well as under many national rules."CA PENAL § 597g", 1951, "http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscacalpencode597g.htm", 09/13/10 Show jumpers and hunt seat competitors were the most common users of this technique, as a rail down is often a deciding factor in winning a class. However, the practice is rarely seen today.

==In popular culture==

Poling can be seen in a scene of the movie National Velvet, when Mi Taylor hits the Pie on the legs as Velvet rides him over an obstacle in a training session.
