George Ray Tweed (July 2, 1902 â€“ January 16, 1989) was a radioman in the United States Navy at the outbreak of World War II.

==Biography==

A sixteen-year veteran of the Navy, Tweed was the chief radioman on Guam when the Japanese invaded the island on December 10, 1941.  He and five other men slipped into the Guam jungle rather than become prisoners of war.
When the Japanese became aware of these men on the island, they began to hunt for them.  The Japanese issued an order demanding that they surrender within a 30 day period or be beheaded when captured.  None of the men surrendered and the Japanese eventually captured and executed all of them except Tweed.  The Japanese also executed local Chamorro natives whom they suspected of helping the missing Americans.
Tweed managed to elude the Japanese for two years and seven months, until just before the start of the Battle of Guam. On July 10, 1944, he was able to signal two destroyers involved in preparations for the impending US invasion. He was rescued by a whaleboat from the USS McCall (DD-400).
For his heroism, Tweed was awarded the Legion of Merit and promoted.
According to a newspaper article (Le Petit Journal, Montreal) from August 25, 1946, George Tweed had promised a local native, Antonio Artero, a brand new car if he evaded capture and returned to the United States. Tweed, with the help of General Motors, sent a car to Antonio Artero from San Francisco. 
George Tweed died in an automobile accident in 1989.  He is buried at Eagle Point National Cemetery in Oregon.
George Tweed's story is told in short in the official US Navy documentary on the Battle of Guam, as well as in the 1944 book Robinson Crusoe, USN. His story was also dramatized in the 1962 movie No Man Is an Island starring Jeffrey Hunter as Tweed.
