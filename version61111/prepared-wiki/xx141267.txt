State Route 44 (SR 44) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It runs from U.S. Route 11E/U.S. Route 19W/State Route 34 in Bluff City, just south of the split of US 19W and U.S. Route 19E, northeast via Hickory Tree and Holston Valley to the Virginia state line, where it becomes Virginia State Route 75.
Except for the overlap with State Route 34/U.S. Route 421), SR 44 is a secondary state route.
