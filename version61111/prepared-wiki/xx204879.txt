==Plot==

In 1961 London, Jenny Mellor is a 16-year-old schoolgirl on track to get accepted to Oxford University when she meets a charming Jewish businessman, David Goldman, who pursues her romantically. He takes her to concerts, clubs, and fine restaurants, and easily charms her parents into approving of the relationship. Later, Jenny discovers that David is a con man who makes money through a variety of shady practices. She is initially shocked but silences her misgivings in the face of David's persuasive charm.
Soon, David takes Jenny to Paris as a birthday gift. Jenny's parents invite Graham, a boy Jenny knows from Youth Orchestra, to Jenny's birthday party, but David arrives and Graham goes home. When David proposes marriage, Jenny accepts and leaves school. She then discovers David is already married. When she reveals her discovery to David, he drops out of sight. Jenny despairs, feeling she has thrown her life away, but with the help of her favourite teacher, resumes her studies and is accepted at Oxford the following year.

===Writing===

Nick Hornby created the screenplay based on an autobiographical essay by the British journalist Lynn Barber about her schoolgirl affair with Jewish conman Simon Prewalski, referred to by her as Simon Goldman, which was published in the literary magazine Granta."An edited extract from the introduction to An Education: The Screenplay by Nick Hornby (Penguin). Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 2011-03-31."An Education" by Lynn Barber, Granta 82. Published Summer 2003. Pages 203-223. Both the memoir and the film also allude briefly to Peter Rachman, the notorious post-war London property speculator, who Goldman is working for.  Barber's full memoir, An Education, was not published in book form until June 2009, when filming had already been completed. Hornby said that what appealed to him in the memoir was that "She's a suburban girl who's frightened that she's going to get cut out of everything good that happens in the city. That, to me, is a big story in popular culture. It's the story of pretty much every rock 'n' roll band."Christy Grosz "Nick Hornby takes pen to screen with 'An Education'". Los Angeles Times. September 13, 2009. Retrieved September 14, 2009. Although the screenplay involved Hornby writing about a teenage girl, he did not feel it was more challenging than writing any other character: "I think the moment you're writing about somebody who's not exactly you, then the challenge is all equal. I was glad that everyone around me on this movie was a woman so that they could watch me carefully. But I don't remember anyone saying to me, 'That isn't how women think.'"

===Recreating 1961 England===

Although Jenny's family home and her school are supposed to be in the suburb of Twickenham, Middlesex (incorrectly referred to as 'Twickenham, London' - Twickenham did not become part of Greater London until 1965), the residential scenes featured in the film were shot on Carbery Avenue[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/02/top-10-films-on-london |title=10 of the best films set in London |date=2 June 2011 |first=Steve |last=Rose |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/7244237/Your-property-as-a-film-location-Home-set-home.html |title=Your property as a film location: Home, set, home |date=18 February 2010 |first=David |last=Nicholls |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl] in the Gunnersbury area of Ealing, west London as well as Mattock Lane in West Ealing and The Japanese School in Acton, which used to be the site of the girls' school called Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jun/07/lynn-barber-virginity-relationships |title=Educating Lynn: take one |publisher=The Observer (June 8, 2008) |accessdate=November 23, 2009 |location=London |first=Lynn |last=Barber |date=2009-06-07[/tpl] The area is convincingly arranged to appear as it would have in the 1960s, with the only noticeable exception being the 1990s-era street lighting. There are several other anachronisms, such as a police two-tone horn at a time when bells were still used, the skirt lengths and hairstyles of the schoolgirls, and the fact that St John's Smith Square was not opened as a concert hall until 1969. The Pentax camera featured in the film (at 1.02.11) appears to be a Pentax S1 (or similar), which was available at the time.
