The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It is a standardized measure of demand for natural capital that may be contrasted with the planet's ecological capacity to regenerate.[tpl]cite web|title=Ewing et al. 2001|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/National_Footprint_Accounts_Method_Paper_2010.pdf|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=25 February 2001[/tpl] It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area necessary to supply the resources a human population consumes, and to assimilate associated waste. Using this assessment, it is possible to estimate how much of the Earth (or how many planet Earths) it would take to support humanity if everybody followed a given lifestyle. For 2007, humanity's total ecological footprint was estimated at 1.5 planet Earths; that is, humanity uses ecological services 1.5 times as quickly as Earth can renew them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/world_footprint/|title= Data Sources|date=2010-06-05|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=2012-03-17[/tpl] Every year, this number is recalculated to incorporate the three-year lag due to the time it takes for the UN to collect and publish statistics and relevant research.
Although the term ecological footprint is widely used and well known,United Nations Environment Programme UNEP reports. http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/media/ it goes beyond the metaphor. It represents an accounting system for biocapacity that tracks how much biocapacity there is, and how much biocapacity people use. Calculation methods have converged thanks to standards released in 2006 and updated in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.footprintstandards.org |title=http |publisher=//www.footprintstandards.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl]

==Overview==

The first academic publication about the ecological footprint was by William Rees in 1992.[tpl]cite journal |last=Rees |first=William E. |authorlink=William Rees (academic) |date=October 1992 |title=Ecological footprints and appropriated carrying capacity: what urban economics leaves out |journal=Environment and Urbanisation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–130 |doi=10.1177/095624789200400212 [/tpl] The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of Mathis Wackernagel, under Rees' supervision at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990–1994.[tpl]Cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=Ecological Footprint and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: A Tool for Planning Toward Sustainability |author=Wackernagel, M. |year=1994 |publisher=School of Community and Regional Planning. The University of British Columbia |location=Vancouver, Canada |url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/7132/ubc_1994-954027.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |oclc=41839429 [/tpl] Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "appropriated carrying capacity".Wackernagel, Mathis, 1991. "Land Use: Measuring a Community's Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator for Sustainability"; and "Using Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator, Measuring the Sustainability of a Community." Report I & II to the UBC Task Force on Healthy and Sustainable Communities, Vancouver. To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's "small footprint on the desk".William Safire, On Language: Footprint, New York Times Magazine, February 17, 2008 In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth.
Ecological footprint analysis compares human demands on nature with the biosphere's ability to regenerate resources and provide services. It does this by assessing the biologically productive land and marine area required to produce the resources a population consumes and absorb the corresponding waste, using prevailing technology. Footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon, Food, Housing, and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to life cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy, biomass (food, fiber), building material, water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares (gha).
Per capita ecological footprint (EF), or  ecological footprint analysis (EFA), is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and over-consumption, with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 global hectares (gha) per capita. The U.S. footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of Switzerland was 5.6 gha, while China's was 1.8 gha.http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/footprint_for_nations or http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding Living Planet Report 2008 outlines scenarios for humanity's future.

Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.Wackernagel, Mathis & Rees, William (1996)"Our Ecological Footprint" (New Society Press)
A number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators (see Footprint Calculator, below).
Ecological footprint analysis is now widely used around the Earth as an indicator of environmental sustainability.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] It can be used to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy. It can be used to explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions and nations.Global Footprint Network "Ecological Footprint: Overview." Retrieved on August 1, 2007. Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. They are available at www.footprintstandards.org and were developed in a public process facilitated by Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations.

==Methodology==

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described in the Footprint Atlas 2010[tpl]cite web|title=Ewing et al. 2010|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/ecological_footprint_atlas_2010|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=21 January 2011[/tpl] or in greater detail in the Calculation Methodology for the National Footprint Accounts.[tpl]cite web|title=Ewing et al. 2010|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/National_Footprint_Accounts_Method_Paper_2010.pdf|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=13 June 2011[/tpl] The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how the method will be improved.A Research Agenda for Improving National Ecological Footprint Accounts Retrieved: 2007-11-11 [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl]
There have been differences in the methodology used by various ecological footprint studies. Examples include how sea area should be counted, how to account for fossil fuels, how to account for nuclear power (many studies[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=May 2009[/tpl] simply consider it to have the same ecological footprint as fossil fuels),[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] which data sources used, when average global numbers or local numbers should be used when looking at a specific area, how space for biodiversity should be included, and how imports/exports should be accounted for. However, as new footprint standards emerge, the calculation methodologies are converging.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]
In 2003, Jason Venetoulis, Carl Mas, Christopher Gaudet, Dahlia Chazan, and John Talberth developed Footprint 2., which offers a series of theoretical and methodological improvements to the standard footprint approach. The four primary improvements were that they included the entire surface of the Earth in biocapacity estimates, allocated space for other (i.e., non-human) species, updated the basis of equivalence factors from agricultural land to net primary productivity (NPP), and refined the carbon component of the footprint based on the latest global carbon models.World in Motion: The Globalization and the Environment Reader, Venetoulis and Talberth (2009), edited by Gary Kroll and Richard Howard Robbins"Redefining the Footprint (footprint 2.0)" in Sustainable Development: Principles, Frameworks, and Case Studies, CRC, Routledge (2010).

==Studies in the United Kingdom==

The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England). Two recent studies have examined relatively low-impact small communities. BedZED, a 96-home mixed-income housing development in South London, was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the Peabody Trust. Despite being populated by relatively "mainstream" home-buyers, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site London's first carsharing club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in 2002. Findhorn Ecovillage, a rural intentional community in Moray, Scotland, had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of Cluny Hill College. However, the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized worldFindhorn eco-footprint is ‘world’s smallest’ Sunday Herald, August 11, 2008."A new expert study says the multinational community's ecological footprint is half the UK average. This means Findhorn uses 50% fewer resources and creates 50% less waste than normal."Tinsley, S. and George, H. (2006) Ecological Footprint of the Findhorn Foundation and Community. Moray. Sustainable Development Research Centre, UHI Millennium Institute. Keveral Farm, an organic farming community in Cornwall, was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha, though with substantial differences in footprints among community members.Radical Routes (2006) How to work out your Ecological Footprint.

Grazi et al. (2007) have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental externalities, agglomeration effects and trade advantages.[tpl]cite journal |author=F. Grazi, J.C.J.M. van den Bergh and P. Rietveld |title=Welfare economics versus ecological footprint: modeling agglomeration, externalities and trade |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=135–153 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10640-006-9067-2[/tpl] They find that the two methods can lead to very distinct, and even opposite, rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity. However, this should not be surprising, since the two methods address different research questions.
Calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as "parasitic". This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large hinterlands. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade.  Therefore, the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W. Richardson |publisher=Pam.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]
The method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being "penalized" with a larger ecological footprint.Lenzen, M., C. Borgstrom Hansson and S. Bond (2006) On the bioproductivity and land-disturbance metrics of the Ecological Footprint. University of Sydney, ISA Research Paper, June, 06, in collaboration with WWF. Retrieved: 2007-06-04. Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for biodiversity, the problem could maybe be solved. Indeed, WWF's Living Planet Report complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Loh, J., R. Green, T. Ricketts, J.

Although the ecological footprint model prior to 2008 treated nuclear power in the same manner as coal power,Questions and Answers, Global Footprint Network the actual real world effects of the two are radically different. A life cycle analysis centered on the Swedish Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant estimated carbon dioxide emissions at 3.10 g/kWhVattenfall 2004, Forsmark EPD for 2002 and SwedPower LCA data 2005. and 5.05 g/kWh in 2002 for the Torness Nuclear Power Station.Energy Analysis of Power Systems accessed 20 October 2007  This compares to 11 g/kWh for hydroelectric power, 950 g/kWh for installed coal, 900 g/kWh for oil and 600 g/kWh for natural gas generation in the United States in 1999.Electric Power Industry CO2 Emissions accessed 20 October 2007 Figures released by Mark Hertsgaard, however, show that because of the delays in building nuclear plants and the costs involved, investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies have seven times the return on investment of investments in nuclear energy.Hertsgaard, Mark (2011) "Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)
The Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study of full life cycle emissions of Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per KW-Hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO2 of any of their electricity sources.nuclearinfo.net. Greenhouse Emissions of Nuclear Power
Claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste.[ref]
