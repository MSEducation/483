===Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications[tpl]anchor|Antilogarithm[/tpl]===

By simplifying difficult calculations, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, and especially of astronomy. They were critical to advances in surveying, celestial navigation, and other domains. Pierre-Simon Laplace called logarithms
A key tool that enabled the practical use of logarithms before calculators and computers was the table of logarithms.[tpl]Citation | last1=Campbell-Kelly | first1=Martin | title=The history of mathematical tables: from Sumer to spreadsheets | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=Oxford scholarship online | isbn=978-0-19-850841-0 | year=2003[/tpl], section 2 The first such table was compiled by Henry Briggs in 1617, immediately after Napier's invention. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope and precision were written. These tables listed the values of logb(x) and bx for any number x in a certain range, at a certain precision, for a certain base b (usually [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]b = 10[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]). For example, Briggs' first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range 1–1000, with a precision of 8 digits. As the function [tpl]nowrap|f(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] bx[/tpl] is the inverse function of logb(x), it has been called the antilogarithm.[tpl]Citation|editor1-last=Abramowitz|editor1-first=Milton|editor1-link=Milton Abramowitz|editor2-last=Stegun|editor2-first=Irene A.|editor2-link=Irene Stegun|title=Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-61272-0|edition=10th|year=1972[/tpl], section 4.7., p. 89 The product and quotient of two positive numbers c and d were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product cd or quotient c/d came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, also via the same table:
and
For manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as prosthaphaeresis, which relies on trigonometric identities. Calculations of powers and roots are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by

Many logarithm tables give logarithms by separately providing the characteristic and mantissa of x, that is to say, the integer part and the fractional part of log10(x).[tpl]Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006[/tpl], p. 264 The characteristic of [tpl]nowrap|10 · x[/tpl] is one plus the characteristic of x, and their significands are the same. This extends the scope of logarithm tables: given a table listing log10(x) for all integers x ranging from 1 to 1000, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by
Another critical application was the slide rule, a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation, as illustrated here:
The non-sliding logarithmic scale, Gunter's rule, was invented shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it to create the slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists  until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.

==Analytic properties==

A deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a function. A function is a rule that, given one number, produces another number.[tpl]Cite book | last1=Devlin | first1=Keith | author1-link=Keith Devlin | title=Sets, functions, and logic: an introduction to abstract mathematics | publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC | location=Boca Raton, Fla | edition=3rd | series=Chapman & Hall/CRC mathematics | isbn=1-58488-449-5 | year=2004 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uQHF7bcm4k4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl], or see the references in function An example is the function producing the [tpl]nowrap|x-th[/tpl] power of b from any real number x, where the base b is a fixed number. This function is written

===Logarithmic function===

To justify the definition of logarithms, it is necessary to show that the equation
has a solution x and that this solution is unique, provided that y is positive and that b is positive and unequal to 1. A proof of that fact requires the intermediate value theorem from elementary calculus.[tpl]Citation|last1=Lang|first1=Serge|author1-link=Serge Lang|title=Undergraduate analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, New York|edition=2nd|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|isbn=978-0-387-94841-6|mr=1476913|year=1997[/tpl], section III.3 This theorem states that a continuous function that produces two values m and n also produces any value that lies between m and n. A function is continuous if it does not "jump", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.
This property can be shown to hold for the function [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]f(x) = bx[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]. Because f takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number [tpl]nowrap|y > 0[/tpl] lies between f(x0) and f(x1) for suitable x0 and x1. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation f(x) = y has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function f is strictly increasing (for [tpl]nowrap|b > 1[/tpl]), or strictly decreasing (for {{nowrap|0 The unique solution x is the logarithm of y to base b, logb(y). The function that assigns to y its logarithm is called logarithm function or logarithmic function (or just logarithm).
The function logb(x) is essentially characterized by the above product formula
More precisely, the logarithm to any base [tpl]nowrap|b > 1[/tpl] is the only increasing function f from the positive reals to the reals satisfying [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]f(b) = 1[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] and [tpl]cite book| title=Foundations of Modern Analysis |volume=1 |last=Dieudonné |first=Jean |page=84 |year=1969 |publisher=Academic Press [/tpl] item (4.3.1)

===Inverse function===

The formula for the logarithm of a power says in particular that for any number x,
In prose, taking the [tpl]nowrap|x-th[/tpl] power of b and then the [tpl]nowrap|base-b[/tpl] logarithm gives back x. Conversely, given a positive number y, the formula
says that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back y. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or composing) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base b is the inverse function of [tpl]nowrap|f(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] bx[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007[/tpl], section 1.6
Inverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their graphs correspond to each other upon exchanging the x- and the y-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line x = y), as shown at the right: a point (t, u = bt) on the graph of f yields a point (u, t = logbu) on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, logb(x) diverges to infinity (gets bigger than any given number) if x grows to infinity, provided that b is greater than one. In that case, logb(x)  is an increasing function. For {{nowrap|b b(x) tends to minus infinity instead. When x approaches zero, logb(x) goes to minus infinity for [tpl]nowrap|b > 1[/tpl] (plus infinity for {{nowrap|b 
===Derivative and antiderivative===

Analytic properties of functions pass to their inverses. Thus, as [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]f(x) = bx[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] is a continuous and differentiable function, so is logb(y). Roughly, a continuous function is differentiable if its graph has no sharp "corners". Moreover, as the derivative of f(x) evaluates to ln(b)bx by the properties of the exponential function, the chain rule implies that the derivative of logb(x) is given by[tpl]Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2[/tpl][tpl]cite web |work=Wolfram Alpha |title=Calculation of d/dx(Log(b,x)) |publisher=Wolfram Research |accessdate=15 March 2011 |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d/dx(Log(b,x)) [/tpl]
That is, the slope of the tangent touching the graph of the [tpl]nowrap|base-b[/tpl] logarithm at the point [tpl]nowrap|(x, logb(x))[/tpl] equals [tpl]nowrap|1/(x ln(b))[/tpl]. In particular, the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which implies that the antiderivative of 1/x is [tpl]nowrap|ln(x) + C[/tpl]. The derivative with a generalised functional argument f(x) is
The quotient at the right hand side is called the logarithmic derivative of f. Computing f(x) by means of the derivative of ln(f(x)) is known as logarithmic differentiation.[tpl]Citation | last1=Kline | first1=Morris | author1-link=Morris Kline | title=Calculus: an intuitive and physical approach | publisher=Dover Publications | location=New York | series=Dover books on mathematics | isbn=978-0-486-40453-0 | year=1998[/tpl], p. 386 The antiderivative of the natural logarithm ln(x) is:[tpl]cite web |work=Wolfram Alpha |title=Calculation of Integrate(ln(x)) |publisher=Wolfram Research |accessdate=15 March 2011 |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Integrate(ln(x)) [/tpl]
Related formulas, such as antiderivatives of logarithms to other bases can be derived from this equation using the change of bases.[tpl]Harvard citations|editor1-last=Abramowitz|editor2-last=Stegun|year=1972 |nb=yes|loc=p. 69[/tpl]

===Integral representation of the natural logarithm===

The natural logarithm of t agrees with the integral of 1/x dx from 1 to t:
In other words, ln(t) equals the area between the x axis and the graph of the function 1/x, ranging from [tpl]nowrap|1=x = 1[/tpl] to [tpl]nowrap|1=x = t[/tpl] (figure at the right). This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fact that derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. The right hand side of this equation can serve as a definition of the natural logarithm. Product and power logarithm formulas can be derived from this definition.[tpl]Citation|last1=Courant|first1=Richard|title=Differential and integral calculus. Vol. I|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|series=Wiley Classics Library|isbn=978-0-471-60842-4|mr=1009558|year=1988[/tpl], section III.6 For example, the product formula [tpl]nowrap|1=ln(tu) = ln(t) + ln(u)[/tpl] is deduced as:
The equality (1) splits the integral into two parts, while the equality (2) is a change of variable ([tpl]nowrap|1=w = x/t[/tpl]). In the illustration below, the splitting corresponds to dividing the area into the yellow and blue parts. Rescaling the left hand blue area vertically by the factor t and shrinking it by the same factor horizontally does not change its size. Moving it appropriately, the area fits the graph of the function [tpl]nowrap|1=f(x) = 1/x[/tpl] again. Therefore, the left hand blue area, which is the integral of f(x) from t to tu is the same as the integral from 1 to u. This justifies the equality (2) with a more geometric proof.
The power formula [tpl]nowrap|1=ln(tr) = r ln(t)[/tpl] may be derived in a similar way:
The second equality uses a change of variables (integration by substitution), [tpl]nowrap|1=w = x1/r[/tpl].
The sum over the reciprocals of natural numbers,
is called the harmonic series. It is closely tied to the natural logarithm: as n tends to infinity, the difference,
converges (i.e., gets arbitrarily close) to a number known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant. This relation aids in analyzing the performance of algorithms such as quicksort.[tpl]Citation|last1=Havil|first1=Julian|title=Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09983-5|year=2003[/tpl], sections 11.5 and 13.8
There is also another integral representation of the logarithm that is useful in some situations.
This can be verified by showing that it has the same value at [tpl]nowrap|1=x = 1[/tpl], and the same derivative.

===Transcendence of the logarithm===

==Calculation==

Logarithms are easy to compute in some cases, such as [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]log10(1,000) = 3[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]. In general, logarithms can be calculated using power series or the arithmetic-geometric mean, or be retrieved from a precalculated logarithm table that provides a fixed precision.[tpl]Citation | last1=Muller | first1=Jean-Michel | title=Elementary functions | publisher=Birkhäuser Boston | location=Boston, MA | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8176-4372-0 | year=2006[/tpl], sections 4.2.2 (p. 72) and 5.5.2 (p. 95)[tpl]Citation|author=Hart, Cheney, Lawson et al.|year=1968|publisher=John Wiley|location=New York|title=Computer Approximations|series=SIAM Series in Applied Mathematics[/tpl], section 6.3, p. 105–111
Newton's method, an iterative method to solve equations approximately, can also be used to calculate the logarithm, because its inverse function, the exponential function, can be computed efficiently.[tpl]Citation|last1=Zhang|first1=M.|last2=Delgado-Frias|first2=J.G.|last3=Vassiliadis|first3=S.|title=Table driven Newton scheme for high precision logarithm generation|url=http://ce.et.tudelft.nl/publicationfiles/363_195_00326783.pdf|doi=10.1049/ip-cdt:19941268  |journal=IEE Proceedings Computers & Digital Techniques|issn=1350-2387|volume=141|year=1994|issue=5|pages=281–292[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl], section 1 for an overview Using look-up tables, CORDIC-like methods can be used to compute logarithms if the only available operations are addition and bit shifts.[tpl]Citation |url= |first=J. E.|last=Meggitt|title=Pseudo Division and Pseudo Multiplication Processes|journal=IBM Journal|date=April 1962|doi=10.1147/rd.62.0210[/tpl][tpl]Citation |last=Kahan |first=W. |authorlink= William Kahan |title=Pseudo-Division Algorithms for Floating-Point Logarithms and Exponentials |date= May 20, 2001 |publisher= |journal= |doi= [/tpl] Moreover, the binary logarithm algorithm calculates lb(x) recursively based on repeated squarings of x, taking advantage of the relation

===Power series===

For any real number z that satisfies {{nowrap|0 z − 1 This is a shorthand for saying that ln(z) can be approximated to a more and more accurate value by the following expressions:
For example, with [tpl]nowrap|z [tpl]=[/tpl] 1.5[/tpl] the third approximation yields 0.4167, which is about 0.011 greater than [tpl]nowrap|ln(1.5) [tpl]=[/tpl] 0.405465[/tpl]. This series approximates ln(z) with arbitrary precision, provided the number of summands is large enough. In elementary calculus, ln(z) is therefore the limit of this series. It is the Taylor series of the natural logarithm at [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]z = 1[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]. The Taylor series of ln z provides a particularly useful approximation to ln(1+z) when z is small, |z| For example, with z = 0.1 the first-order approximation gives ln(1.1) ≈ 0.1, which is less than 5% off the correct value 0.0953.
Another series is based on the area hyperbolic tangent function:
for any real number z > 0.[tpl]#tag:ref|The same series holds for the principal value of the complex logarithm for complex numbers z with positive real part.|group=nb[/tpl] Using the Sigma notation, this is also written as
This series can be derived from the above Taylor series. It converges more quickly than the Taylor series, especially if z is close to 1. For example, for [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]z = 1.5[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl], the first three terms of the second series approximate ln(1.5) with an error of about [tpl]val|3|e=-6[/tpl]. The quick convergence for z close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation [tpl]nowrap|y ≈ ln(z)[/tpl] and putting
the logarithm of z is:
The better the initial approximation y is, the closer A is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. A can be calculated  using the exponential series, which converges quickly provided y is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger z can be reduced to smaller values of z by writing [tpl]nowrap|z [tpl]=[/tpl] a · 10b[/tpl], so that [tpl]nowrap|ln(z) [tpl]=[/tpl] ln(a) + b · ln(10)[/tpl].
A closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers. From the above series, it follows that:
If the logarithm of a large integer n is known, then this series yields a fast converging series for log(n+1).

===Arithmetic-geometric mean approximation===

The arithmetic-geometric mean yields high precision approximations of the natural logarithm. ln(x) is approximated to a precision of 2−p (or p precise bits) by the following formula (due to Carl Friedrich Gauss):[tpl]Citation |first1=T. |last1=Sasaki |first2=Y. |last2=Kanada |title=Practically fast multiple-precision evaluation of log(x) |journal=Journal of Information Processing |volume=5|issue=4 |pages=247–250 |year=1982 | url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002673332 | accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]Citation |first1=Timm |last1=Ahrendt|title=Fast computations of the exponential function|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, New York|series=Lecture notes in computer science|doi=10.1007/3-540-49116-3_28|volume=1564|year=1999|pages=302–312[/tpl]
Here M denotes the arithmetic-geometric mean. It is obtained by repeatedly calculating the average (arithmetic mean) and the square root of the product of two numbers (geometric mean). Moreover, m is chosen such that
Both the arithmetic-geometric mean and the constants π and ln(2) can be calculated with quickly converging series.

==Applications==

Logarithms have many applications inside and outside mathematics. Some of these occurrences are related to the notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral.[ref]
