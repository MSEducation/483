100 Huntley Street is a Christian daily talk show and the flagship program of Crossroads Christian Communications based in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. Created in 1976 by Rev. David Mainse, it first aired on June 15, 1977 from its first studios located at 100 Huntley Street in the St. James Town area of Downtown Toronto.
In 1992, the show left its eponymous address and relocated to new studios in Burlington, located on an expressway service road near the northwest quadrant of the "Crossroads Interchange", Exit 100 on the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 403, that also became home to the Crossroads Television System (CTS) and is flagship, CITS-DT. The original studio location on Huntley Street is now part of the Rogers Building, the corporate head office of Rogers Communications.
The show airs on television stations throughout Canada and the United States in syndication. Within Canada, the show airs on the ministry's own CTS, and as brokered programming on several local stations, including all Global Television Network stations.

==Scandal==

In the Summer of 2009, Host Ron Mainse and his brother Reynold Mainse (who hosted on Monday's) were pulled off the show for a period of over six months, after he and other staff were connected to a ponzi scheme by a one-time (circa 1977) technical employee named Gordon Driver. Ron Mainse returned on air prior to Christmas while Reynold had not returned to air until a live phone link regarding his role of representing Crossroads Missions in Haiti. Jim Cantelon & David Mainse filled in as Hosts during Ron's absence, Jim remained on the hosting team for a season following Ron's return.[tpl]cite web |title=Ron Mainse of 100 Huntley Street makes statement on alleged ponzi scheme | Bene Diction Blogs On  |url=http://www.benedictionblogson.com/2009/09/15/ron-mainse-of-100-huntley-street-makes-statement-on-alleged-ponzi-scheme/ |work= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65ydITF31|archivedate=2012-03-06 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-03-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Religious Right Alert | Ron and Reynold Mainse removed from 100 Huntley Street, victims of ponzi scheme? |url=http://www.religiousrightalert.ca/2009/06/06/ron-and-reynold-mainse-removed-from-100-huntley-street-victims-of-ponzi-scheme/|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65ydJMudV|archivedate=2012-03-06|deadurl=no|accessdate=2012-03-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.benedictionblogson.com/2009/06/05/100-huntley-street-mainse-brothers-victims-of-ponzi-scheme/ |title=100 Huntley Street Mainse brothers victims of ponzi scheme? |author=Bene Diction |work=Bene Diction Blogs On |date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themiraclechannel.ca/article.php?story=20090612122056375 |title=The Love of Money Seems to be the Mainse Problem! |author=marina |work=The Miracle Channel Review |date=June 12, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100824235826/http://www.themiraclechannel.ca/article.php?story=20090612122056375 |archivedate=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2012-03-15[/tpl]
