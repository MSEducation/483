In 1932 the group was registered as the  Jacobite Syrian Christian Union. The first priest was appointed in 1936 when the T. I. Joseph was appointed vicar for Malaya.
In 1984 Fr. Philip Thomas was ordained as the first Malaysian Orthodox priest by Thomas Mar Thimotheos, Metropolitan of the Diocese of Malabar.
