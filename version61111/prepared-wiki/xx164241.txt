 [tpl]bquote|In the spirit of the 15th century artist and visionary [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the Da Vinci Awards honor the most innovative developments and research in adaptive and [[assistive technology]] that embrace the Universal Design Principle - an approach to the design of products, services and environments to be usable by as many people as possible regardless of age, ability or circumstance.<ref>[http://www.nmssmi.org/davinci/ceremony/index.html Da Vinci Awards Ceremony Overview]</ref>[/tpl] Particular consideration is given to innovations exceeding legally mandated requirements, such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], to further empower people with disabilities.
Michael Rokosz, formerly a Research Scientist for Ford Motor Company, and member of the Board or Trustees for the National MS Society, Michigan Chapter, instituted these Awards in cooperation with the Society, which maintains its affiliation to date.
Annually, the award process begins with a call for nominations by the Awards Search Committee composed of educators, engineers, scientists and designers. Upon close of the nomination process, an Awards Committee of similarly qualified members selects finalists who receive the Da Vinci Award at an annual presentation ceremony in Dearborn, Michigan.
