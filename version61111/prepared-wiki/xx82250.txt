[[Organolithium reagent]]

CATEGORIES: Organolithium compounds

Organolithium reagents are organometallic compounds that contain carbon â€“ lithium bonds. They are important reagents in organic synthesis, and are frequently used to transfer the organic group or the lithium atom to the substrates in synthetic steps, through nucleophilic addition or simple deprotonation.[ref]
