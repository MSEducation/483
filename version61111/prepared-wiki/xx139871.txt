J. & G. Meakin was an English pottery manufacturing company founded in 1851J & G Meakin thepotteries.org and based in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

==History==

In the 19th century, J. & G. Meakin was known for the vast quantities of cheap ironstone china it produced for the domestic English market and for export to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.
From around 1970, designs included Liberty, Sterling, Trend, Classic and Heirloom. Some of these were influenced from earlier designs. The newer wares can be distinguished by backstamp markings such as 'permanent colours' or 'dishwasher proof'.
J & G Meakin had close family and corporate affiliations to the pottery Johnson Brothers, and Alfred Meakin, which explains why many patterns are similar, if not almost exactly the same.
The firm was taken over by the Wedgwood Group in 1970. In 2000 production under the Meakin name ceased and their long-established works, Eagle Pottery, was then used for the production of Johnson Bros pottery. Eagle Pottery closed in 2004 when production was transferred abroad in 2004; the works were demolished in 2005.
