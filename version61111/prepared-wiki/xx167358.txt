Parachromis dovii, the Guapote, is a species of cichlid native to Central America where it occurs on both slopes of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  This species grows to a length of [tpl]convert|72|cm|in[/tpl] TL.  This carnivorous species is important to local commercial fisheries and is sought after as a gamefish.[tpl]FishBase species |genus= Parachromis|species= dovii| month = April | year = 2013[/tpl]  This species is known as the Wolf cichlid in the aquarium trade.

==Aquarium Care==

===Breeding===

Breeding can be achieved with very little effort and no specific requirements are needed for breeding purposes. As long as water conditions are maintained at a desirable high quality, a breeding pair of such fish will readily spawn. To enhance the likelihood of acquiring a breeding pair, purchase several healthy and active juveniles at a young age (between 6 -10) and grow these specimens until sexual maturity. Generally, you should be left with a breeding pair or two. These fish will noticeably become more aggressive and territorial, Remove all other fish at this point and keep the newly formed breeding pair separate. When a breeding pair had been successfully established, the male will begin to court the female by displaying his erect finnage to the female as he tries to impress her in an attempt for her to accept his mating invitation. The pair will begin to clean a flat surface if the female is responsive of the male's previous courting behavior. The female will then lay approximately 1000 - 2000 orange coloured eggs which will then be fertilized by the male. The eggs will be ferociously guarded by both parents and a high degree of parental care is show to the eggs and fry. When the eggs 'hatch' after approximately 5 -7 days, the offspring (known as wrigglers at this stage in development) are defenseless and are unable to swim. They are often transported to pre dug pits by both parents, and are guarded. The fry will begin to swim in approximately 7 days and should be fed with baby brine shrimp or alike. If you would like to rear these fry, they should be removed at this point as they will later be consumed by both parents as the female becomes due to spawn once more. Feed the fry baby brine shrimp until the stage where they are large enough to consume blood worm, daphnia and other live foods. 
When purchasing fish in an attempt to acquire a breeding pair, try to buy fish from different sources. There is a high probability that when buying fish from the same source, fish will be from the same parents (siblings). Breeding fish in this manner may form offspring with genetic disease usually associated with interbreeding. Also, buy fish of a similar size.

===Aquarium===

The aquarium should be large (800l+) for a breeding pair of wolf cichlids. As with all members of its genus, these fish are large and heavily built cichlids who are aggressive and highly territorial. Decor should be kept to a minimum in such an aquarium and a sand or fine gravel should be used as the main substrate. Many pieces of flat slate or rock should also be included for the female to lay her eggs upon.

===Diet===

The Parachromis are not fussy eaters and will readily accept most food substances offered. The fish's ability to protrude its jaw 9.9% standard length allows it to have a diet composed of 95% evasive prey. [tpl]Cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00987.x[/tpl]  Cichlid pellets are a good daily food. Diet should be varied however. Offer a variety of insect, including blood worm, earthworm, mysis, crickets (for larger specimens). Chopped meat can also be offered along with beef heart (offer vary sparingly due to its high fat content) along with prawn and fish (live/frozen). Frozen fish is a much preferred method of feeding fish as many "feeder fish" carry the risk of the introducing disease into your aquarium, possibly harming your fish.

===Sexing===

Females tend to be smaller than males but in some cases can grow just as big or bigger than spawn mates. The gold/yellow colouration is more prominent in the females, especially during courtship, breeding and raising fry. The male's dorsal and ventral fins are also much more elongated than the female's. Males tend to have more spots and blue. Comport varies on individual females or males and situations but aggression is usually to be expected during courtship and spawing periods.

===Water chemistry===

pH of 7.0 - 8.0 preferably. Temperature of 27* C
