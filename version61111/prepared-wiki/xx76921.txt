[[Earl De La Warr]]

CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of Great Britain, West family

Earl De La Warr is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1761 for John West, 7th Baron De La Warr. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles of Viscount Cantelupe (1761) in the Peerage of Great Britain,  Baron De La Warr (1572) in the Peerage of England, and Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex (1864) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The barony and earldom are both pronounced "De La Ware", as in the American state.Debrett's Peerage 1968, p.333Pronounced as "Delaware".

==Baronies of De La Warr==

The barony De La Warr is of the second creation; however, it bears the precedence of the first creation, 1299, and has done so since shortly after the death of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr. The precise legal situation concerning the second creation is murky. The modern rules attempt to regularize medieval practice, but there are many cases that cannot easily be made to fit, whether because a local custom was involved, or because an exception was made, or because the rules were still in flux.  This is such a case. William was heir male but not heir general. Because the original barony was created by writ, descent is presumed to be to the heir (or heirs) general, wherefore it fell into abeyance between the daughters of Sir Owen West (and their heirs in turn).  The second creation can be fairly viewed in at least three ways.

==American connections==

In the United States, Thomas West, 3rd (or 12th) baron is often named in history books simply as Lord Delaware.  He served as governor of the Jamestown Colony, and the Delaware Bay was named after him.  The state of Delaware, the Delaware River and the Delaware Indians, a name for the Lenape were so called after the bay, and thus ultimately derive their names from the barony. Many other US counties, townships and the like derive their names directly or indirectly from this connection; see Delaware (disambiguation). As the legend goes, Lord Delaware was the first of a noble kin. He laid the keystone on which the prestigious University of Delaware was built. The Lord is also attributed with developing the first genetically modified Blue Hen, which has since become the University of Delaware mascot.
