Olaf Guthfrithsson (Old Norse: Óláfr Guðfriðarson; Old English: Ánláf; rendered in Old Irish writings as Amlaíb mac Gofraid)Amlaíb's patronymic does not appear in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; his presumed brother Ragnall or Rægenald is called "Guðferþes sunu" (Ms. A, s.a. 944) (died 941), was a member of the Norse-Gael Uí Ímair dynasty and King of Dublin from 934 to 941. He succeeded his father, Gofraid ua Ímair, who was also briefly king of York in 927 following the death of his kinsman Sitric Cáech, but was expelled in the same year by king Æthelstan of England.
In August 937 Olaf defeated his Norse rivals based at Limerick, leaving him free to pursue his family claim to the throne of York.[tpl]cite book|first=Alfred|last=Smyth|authorlink=Alfred Smyth|title=Scandinavian York and Dublin|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=1987|pages=34–36|isbn=0-7165-2365-5[/tpl] He married the daughter of king Constantine II of Scotland, and also allied himself with Owen I of Strathclyde. In the autumn 937, Olaf led his allies into battle against Æthelstan in the Battle of Brunanburh and was decisively defeated.
After Athelstan's death in 939, Olaf again invaded York the same year, forcing Athelstan's successor, Edmund, into a treaty which ceded to Olaf Northumbria and part of Mercia. Uniquely, the legend of his silver penny minted at York is not in Latin or Old English but in Old Norse; the bird emblem perhaps represents the raven associated with the battle-god Odin.Noted in Richard Hall, Viking Age Archaeology 1995:25 and fig. 9. He did not get to enjoy his new lands for long, dying just two years later in 941. He was succeeded by Amlaíb Cuarán.
Cammán mac Amlaíb, who is possibly identical to Sitriuc Cam, has been identified as one of Olaf's sons.
