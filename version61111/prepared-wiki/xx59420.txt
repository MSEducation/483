In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation.<ref name="ims-1984">[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2307/3673140|last1=Juvik |first1=J.

Contact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect.

===Alpine environment===

The summit of Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and consists of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and is known as the Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.
Plant species found at this elevation include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea Silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants,[ref]
</ref> Mauna Kea Silversword was thought to be restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.<ref name=esa-1940 />
The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau.[tpl]cite web|title=Mauna Kea Ice Age|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/dofaw/nars/reserves/big-island/maunakeaiceage|publisher=Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources|accessdate=August 13, 2010[/tpl] This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened [tpl]okina[/tpl]Ua[tpl]okina[/tpl]u (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and also the center of a study on Wēkiu bugs (Nysius wekiuicola).
Wēkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus Nysius, which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to [tpl]convert|4200|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first1=Peter D.|last1=Ashlock|first2=Wayne C.|last2=Gagné|title=A Remarkable New Micropterous Nysius Species from the Aelion Zone of Muana Kea, Hawaii island|journal=International Journal of Entomology|publisher=Bernice P.

They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, as the effect summit observatories on Mauna Kea have on the species is not well understood; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related Nysius aa lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and Forest Tent Caterpillar Moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies.[tpl]cite web|title=Wekiu bugs-life on top of a volcano|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_05_20.html|work=Volcano Watch|publisher=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory – United States Geological Survey|accessdate=August 14, 2010[/tpl]

===Māmane–naio forest===

The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of [tpl]convert|2000|-|3000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], is dominated by Māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and Naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and Naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the Palila (Loxioides bailleui). The Palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.
The largest threat to the ecosystem is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius),[tpl]cite journal |author= Scrowcroft, Paul G. |year= 1983 |url= http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/651/3/v37n2-109-119.pdf.txt |format= PDF |title= Tree Cover Changes in Mamane (Sophora chrysophylla) Forests Grazed by Sheep and Cattle |journal= Pacific Science |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages=109–20|accessdate=August 11, 2010[/tpl] and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.
Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was introduced from 1962–1964,[tpl]cite web |author=Hess, Steven; Kawakami, Jr., Ben; Okita, Davivd; Medeiros, Keola  |year=2006 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA454051 |title=A Preliminary Assessment of Mouflon Abundance at the Kahuku Unit of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park |publisher=United States Geological Survey |page=1[/tpl] See: [tpl]cite web |last=Giffin |first=J.G. |year=1982 |title=Ecology of mouflon sheep on Mauna Kea |publisher=Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife |location=Honolulu, HI[/tpl] and a plan to release Axis Deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who said that they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).[tpl]cite court |litigants=Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land & Natural Resources |vol=639 F.2d 495 |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint=79-4636 |court=United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit |date=February 9, 1981 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8158542596159694344&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr|accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl]
The court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside. This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem.Banko, Paul et al. Surveys reveal decline of the palila. Endangered Species Bulletin, Fall 2008. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.
The Mauna Kea Forest Reserve protects [tpl]convert|52500|acre|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] of māmane-naio forest under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. Ungulate hunting is allowed year-round. A small part of the māmane–naio forest is encompassed by the Mauna Kea State Recreation Area.[tpl]cite web|title=Mauna Kea State Recreation Area|url=http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/hawaii/maunakea.cfm|work=Hawaii State Parks|publisher=Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources|accessdate=August 15, 2010[/tpl]

===Lower environment===

A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was formerly Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhi[tpl]okina[/tpl]a) forest. Its destruction was driven by an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugar plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and those parts of the forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugar plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui.[tpl]cite book|title=Alteration of native Hawaiian vegetation-Effects of humans, their activities and introductions|year=1990|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1308-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u0RFAQAAIAAJ|format=PDF|first1=Charles P.|last1=Stone|first2=Linda W. |last2=Cuddihy|accessdate=September 15, 2010|chapter=Changes in Vegetation Since 1850[/tpl] With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.[tpl]cite web|title=Economic Impact of Shutting Down Hawaii's Sugar Industry|url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/EI-6.pdf|format=PDF|work=Economic Issues|publisher=College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources|accessdate=September 27, 2010|first1=Junning|last1=Cai |first2=Ping Sun|last2=Leung|date=April 2004[/tpl]
The Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a major koa forest reserve on Mauna Kea's windward slope. It was established in 1985, covering [tpl]convert|32733|acre|ha|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of ecosystem remnant. Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered Hawaiian Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota. The reserve has been the site of an extensive replanting campaign since 1989.[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome to Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.fws.gov/hakalauforest/|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=August 16, 2010|date=April 6, 2010[/tpl] Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem, as much of the land in the upper part of the reserve is abandoned farmland.
Bird species native to the acacia koa–[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhi[tpl]okina[/tpl]a forest include the Hawaiian Crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the [tpl]okina[/tpl]Akepa (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii Creeper (Oreomystis mana), ʻAkiapōlāʻau (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian Hawk (Buteo solitarius), all of which are endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian Crow in particular is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.

==Summit observatories==

Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation because a number of factors create favorable observing conditions. The atmosphere above the volcano is extremely dry, which is important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy because water vapor absorbs radiation in most of this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer that separates lower maritime air from upper atmospheric air, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable; this lack of turbulence creates some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects.[tpl]cite web|title=About Mauna Kea Observatories|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/about_maunakea.shtml|publisher=Institute for Astronomy – University of Hawaii|accessdate=August 19, 2010[/tpl] These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.
In the 1950s, solar observatories were built on Haleakalā on Maui, as Mauna Kea was inaccessible by road above [tpl]convert|12000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the early 1960s, the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce began encouraging astronomical development of Mauna Kea, as an economic stimulus; this coincided with University of Arizona astronomer Gerard Kuiper's search for sites at which to use the newly improved detectors of infrared light, spurred by the rapid development of infrared astronomy. Site testing by Kuiper's assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit's outstanding suitability. An intense three-way competition for NASA funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper, Harvard University, and the University of Hawaii (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy. This culminated in funds being awarded to the "upstart" UH proposal.[tpl]cite web|title=Timeline of Astronomy in Hawai'i|url=http://mkooc.org/css-timeline.html|publisher=Mauna Kea Observatories Outreach Committee|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=Andrew|last=Pickles|year=2003[/tpl] UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy, and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65-year lease for all land within a [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|1|0|abbr=on[/tpl] radius of its telescope, essentially that above [tpl]convert|11500|ft|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. On its completion in 1970, the UH [tpl]convert|88|in|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] was the seventh largest optical/infrared telescope in the world. 
Other groups began requesting subleases on the newly accessible mountaintop. By 1970, two [tpl]convert|24|in|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] telescopes had been constructed by the US Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea. However, local organisations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the UH Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site.  In 1998, [tpl]convert|2033|acre|ha|0|abbr=on[/tpl] were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management,[tpl]cite web|title=Mauna Kea Science Reserve Astronomy Development Plan 2000–2020 – Summary|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/appendix_a.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Institute for Astronomy – University of Hawaii|accessdate=August 19, 2010|date=August 1999[/tpl] designated [tpl]convert|525|acre|ha|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for astronomy, and shifted the remaining [tpl]convert|10763|acre|ha|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to "natural and cultural preservation". This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural values of the mountain.[tpl]cite web|title=Mauna Kea Comprehensive Management Plan: UH Management Areas|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/occl/mauna-kea-management-plan/comprehensive-management-plan|format=PDF|last=Institute for Astronomy – University of Hawaii|publisher=Hawai`i State Department of Land and Natural Resources  |accessdate=August 19, 2010|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Today the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries. It is one of the world's premier observatories for optical, infrared, and submillimeter astronomy,  and in 2009 was the largest measured by light gathering power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/occl/random-files/mauna-kea-files/Mauna_Kea_CMP-Sect5-7.pdf|title=Mauna Kea Comprehensive Management Plan|last=University of Hawai`i|date=January 2009|publisher=Hawai`i State Department of Land and Natural Resources |pages=6–1|accessdate=January 18, 2012[/tpl] There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from [tpl]convert|0.9|to|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

There are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, is a common activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail.

Mauna Kea's great elevation and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The high elevation with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.
Today, multiple hiking trails exist, including the Mauna Kea Trail, and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy. The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at [tpl]convert|2804|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness;[ref]
