CATEGORIES: Magnet (musician) albums, 2000 albums

Quiet & Still is Magnet's debut album, first released in Norway in October 2000 after the dissolution of his previous band Libido. In the US, the album was released under his birth name, Even Johansen, and featured his picture on the album cover (whereas the Norwegian release featured a logo). The album features early versions of "Where Happiness Lives" and "Nothing Hurts Now," which he would re-record for the follow-up album On Your Side. It also features a cover of "Dancing in the Moonlight," written by Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott.
