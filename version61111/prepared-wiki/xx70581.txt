Comparisons showed strong affinities with DNA from Siberian sites, and virtually ruled out any close affinity with European sources (the so-called "[[Solutrean hypothesis]]").  The DNA also showed strong affinities with all existing Native American populations, which indicated that all of them derive from an ancient population that lived in or near Siberia, the Upper Palaeolithic [[Mal'ta]] population.<ref name="Rasmussen2014"/> The data indicate that Anzick-1 is from a population directly ancestral to present South American and Central American Native American populations, ruling out hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas.

===Problems with Clovis migration models===

Significant problems arise with the Clovis migration model. If Clovis people radiated south after entering the New World and eventually reached the southern tip of South America by 11,000 years ago, this leaves only a short time span to populate the entire hemisphere.[tpl]cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee |year=1991 |publisher=Radius |isbn=978-0-09-174268-3 |oclc=21594215 |authorlink=Jared Diamond |page=308[/tpl]  Another complication for the Clovis-only theory arose in 1997, when a panel of authorities inspected the Monte Verde site in Chile. They concluded that the radiocarbon evidence predates Clovis sites in the North American Midwest by at least 1,000 years.[tpl]cite book|last=Dillehay|first=Thomas|title=The Settlement of the Americas: A New Prehistory|date=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07669-6[/tpl] This supports the theory of a primary coastal migration route people used to move south along the coastline faster than those who migrated inland into the central areas of the Americas. Many excavations have uncovered evidence that subsistence patterns of early Americans included foods such as turtles, shellfish, and tubers. This is a change of diet from the big game mammoths, long-horn bison, horse, and camels that early Clovis hunters apparently followed east into the New World.
At the Topper archaeological site (located along the banks of the Savannah River near Allendale, South Carolina) investigated by University of South Carolina archaeologist Dr. Albert Goodyear, charcoal material recovered in association with purported human artifacts returned radiocarbon dates of up to 50,000 years before the present (BP). This would indicate the presence of humans well before the last glacial period. Considerable doubt over the validity of these findings has been raised by many other researchers, and the pre-Clovis Topper dates remain controversial. Charcoal could have originated from forest fires, and the crude stone artifacts may be misinterpreted geofacts.
Pre-Clovis dates have been claimed for several sites in South America, but these early dates have not been verified unequivocally.

==Watercraft migration theories==

Earlier finds have led to a pre-Clovis culture theory encompassing different migration models with an expanded chronology to supersede the "Clovis-first" theory.

===Pacific coastal models===

Pacific models propose that people first reached the Americas via water travel, following coastlines from northeast Asia into the Americas. Coastlines are unusually productive environments because they provide humans with access to a diverse array of plants and animals from both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. While not exclusive of land-based migrations, the Pacific 'coastal migration theory' helps explain how early colonists reached areas extremely distant from the Bering Strait region, including sites such as Monte Verde in southern Chile and Taima-Taima in western Venezuela. Two cultural components were discovered at Monte Verde near the Pacific Coast of Chile. The youngest layer is radiocarbon dated at 12,500 radiocarbon years (~14,000 cal BP) [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] and has produced the remains of several types of seaweeds collected from coastal habitats. The older and more controversial component may date back as far as 33,000 years, but few scholars currently accept this very early component.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Other coastal models, dealing specifically with the peopling of the Pacific Northwest and California coasts, have been advocated by archaeologists Knut Fladmark, Roy Carlson, James Dixon, Jon Erlandson, Ruth Gruhn, and Daryl Fedje. In a 2007 article in the Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology, Erlandson and his colleagues proposed a corollary to the coastal migration theory—the "kelp highway hypothesis"—arguing that productive kelp forests supporting similar suites of plants and animals would have existed near the end of the Pleistocene around much of the Pacific Rim from Japan to Beringia, the Pacific Northwest, and California, as well as the Andean Coast of South America. Once the coastlines of Alaska and British Columbia had deglaciated about 16,000 years ago, these kelp forest (along with estuarine, mangrove, and coral reef) habitats would have provided an ecologically similar migration corridor, entirely at sea level, and essentially unobstructed.

===East Asians: Paleoindians of the coast===

The boat-builders from Southeast Asia may have been one of the earliest groups to reach the shores of North America.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] One theory suggests people in boats followed the coastline from the Kurile Islands to Alaska down the coasts of North and South America as far as Chile 62; 7 54, 57. The Haida nation on the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia may have originated from these early Asian mariners between 25,000 and 12,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Early watercraft migration would also explain the habitation of coastal sites in South America such as Pikimachay Cave in Peru by 20,000 years ago and Monte Verde in Chile by 13,000 years ago 30; 8 383.

===Atlantic coastal model===

Archaeologists Dennis Stanford and Bruce Bradley champion the coastal Atlantic route. Their Solutrean Hypothesis is also based on evidence from the Clovis complex, but instead traces the origins of the Clovis toolmaking style to the Solutrean culture of Ice Age Western Europe.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Xwx6WQaoTJkC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20first%20Americans%3A%20race%2C%20evolution%2C%20and%20the%20origin%20of%20Native%20Americans&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=The first Americans: race, evolution, and the origin of Native Americans|page=123|author=Joseph F. Powell|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=November 14, 2005|isbn=978-0-521-82350-0[/tpl] The theory suggests that early European people (or peoples) may have been among the earliest settlers of the Americas.[tpl]cite journal|title=The North Atlantic ice-edge corridor: a possible Palaeolithic route to the New World|author1=Bruce Bradley|author2=Dennis Stanford|journal=World Archaeology|year=2004|volume=36(4)|pages=459–478|url=http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Conservation%20Biology/Karen%20PDF/Clovis/Bradley%20&%20Stanford%202004.pdf | doi = 10.1080/0043824042000303656[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Carey, Bjorn|date=2006-02-19|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/060219_first_americans.html|title=First Americans may have been European|publisher=Life Science.com|accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] Citing evidence that the Solutrean culture of prehistoric Europe may have provided the basis for the tool-making of the Clovis culture in the Americas, the theory suggests that Ice Age Europeans migrated to North America by using skills similar to those possessed by the modern Inuit peoples and followed the edge of the ice sheet that spanned the Atlantic. The hypothesis rests upon particular similarities in Solutrean and Clovis technology that have no known counterparts in Eastern Asia, Siberia or Beringia, areas from which, or through which, early Americans are known to have migrated. Most professionals discount the theory for a variety of reasons—including the fact that the differences between the two tool-making traditions far outweigh the similarities, the several thousand miles of the Atlantic Ocean they would have had to cross, and the 5,000-year-span that separates the two cultures.[tpl]citation|url=http://smu.edu/anthro/faculty/dMeltzer/pdf%20files/World_Archaeology_2005_Ice_Age_Atlantis.pdf|title=Ice Age Atlantis? Exploring the Solutrean-Clovis ‘connection’|author1=Lawrence Guy Straus|author2=David J. Meltzer|author3=Ted Goebel|accessdate=2011-04-24|quote=Bradley and Stanford (2004) have raised now, in several instances, the claim that European Upper Paleolithic Solutrean peoples colonized North America, and gave rise to the archaeological complex known as Clovis. They do so in the face of some obvious challenges—notably the several thousand miles of ocean and the 5000 radiocarbon years that separate the two. And yet they argue in their recent paper that the archaeological evidence in support of a historical connection is ‘overwhelming’. We are profoundly skeptical of this claim; we believe that the many diﬀerences between Solutrean and Clovis are far more significant than the few similarities, the latter being readily explained by the well-known phenomenon of technological convergence or parallelism. The origin and arrival time of the ﬁrst Americans remain uncertain, but not so uncertain that we need to look elsewhere other than north-east Asia.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=P2HKD9PgC6wC&lpg=PP1&dq=ATLAS%20OF%20THE%20NORTH%20AMERICAN%20INDIAN&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=ATLAS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN|page=2|edition=3|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8160-6858-6|author=Carl Waldman[/tpl] Genetic studies of Native American populations have also shown that the Solutrean theory is unlikely, showing instead that the five main mtDNA haplogroups found in the Americas were all part of one gene pool migration from Asia.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B8JDD-4RY1NS0-3&_user=10&_coverDate=03/03/2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e975f3fe5a7184b122e664d8bf1892be&searchtype=a|title=Mitochondrial Population Genomics Supports a Single Pre-Clovis Origin with a Coastal Route for the Peopling of the Americas|publisher=Elsevier|date=2008-03-03|author1=Nelson J.R.

===Problems with evaluating coastal migration models===

The coastal migration models provide a different perspective on migration to the New World, but they are not without their own problems. One of the biggest problems is that global sea levels have risen over 100 metres since the end of the last glacial period, and this has submerged the ancient coastlines that maritime people would have followed into the Americas. Finding sites associated with early coastal migrations is extremely difficult—and systematic excavation of any sites found in deeper waters is challenging and expensive. If there was an early pre-Clovis coastal migration, there is always the possibility of a "failed colonization". Another problem that arises is the lack of hard evidence found for a "long chronology" theory. No sites have yet produced a consistent chronology older than about 12,500 radiocarbon years (~14,500 calendar years) [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl], but research has been limited in South America related to the possibility of early coastal migrations.
