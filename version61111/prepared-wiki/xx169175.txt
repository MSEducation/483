Before he signed for the club he was on trial at English League Two side Stockport County who were managed by former Lillywhites boss Jim Gannon.

===Dundalk===

Mulvenna was given a senior contract with Dundalk by manager John Gill in 2006 following a striker crisis at Oriel Park. In November 2006, Mulvenna was an unused substitute in a promotion/relegation play-off against Waterford United at the RSC. He had to wait until May 2007 to make his debut for the club when he came on as a substitute in the last five minutes against Athlone Town in a First Division match which Dundalk won 2-0 at Lissywoollen thanks to goals from Shaun Williams and Philip Hughes. His first ever career goal came at Oriel Park in September 2007 when he netted in a 4-0 win over Kilkenny City in the First Division. He made his name at the club when he scored twice in a 3-0 win over Monaghan United in the League of Ireland Cup First Round at Oriel Park in March 2008. He played a big part[tpl]cite web|title=Dundalk Results and scorers, 2000-2009|url=http://www.dundalkfc.com/history/all-time-results-scorers/results-scorers-200001-2009/|work=All-time results and scorers at Dundalk FC|publisher=Dundalk FC[/tpl] in Dundalk's First Division title winning season in 2008 as the Lillywhites got promoted to the Premier Division. Mulvenna was offered a full-time contract by the board of Dundalk for the 2009 season which he accepted. In the 2009 season Mulvenna played 29 league games but he played most this out on the wing which resulted in him only scoring 3 goals. Then in the 2010 season he found it hard to break into the team only making 7 league appearances which resulted in Mulvenna terminating his contact on the 19th of August 2010 citing lack of first team football as the reason behind leaving his home town club. After leaving Dundalk Mulvenna had been rumoured to join Newry City but then made the shock move to join local Dundalk side Woodview Celtic. Mulvenna signed for Shelbourne but there was a problem with his registration and found himself unable to sign for a club until June.

===Drogheda United===

In June he signed for Drogheda United and made his debut on 10 June 2011 against his former club Dundalk, in Oriel Park. Drogheda won 2-1. His first goals for the club came in a 3-1 win against U.C.D on 21 June 2011.

===Return to Dundalk===

Mulvenna re-joined Dundalk for the 2013 season.

===Glenavon===

On 13 January 2014, Mulvenna completed a move to Glenavon in the NIFL Premiership. He signed an 18-month deal for the club.[tpl]cite web |url=http://glenavonfc.com/blog/?p=20983 |title=Glenavon sign Dundalk Striker  |publisher=Glenavon FC |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]
