"You Better Sit Down Kids'" is a major hit single release by American singer/actress Cher in 1967. The song was written by her then-husband, Sonny Bono, and reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in Canada #7.Cher's song chart entries Retrieved September 28, 2011
The song dealt with divorce, a somewhat taboo subject in the 1960s, and garnered much attention in the media.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] It was meant to be sung by the father, however, Cher sang the song as the father.  Also, at the end of the song, the wild, fast sounds of a jazz saxophone playing were reminiscent of a Spike Jones recording, suggesting the fussing that the kids would be doing as a result of the separation and the divorce of the couple.
Along with the likes of "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" and "Where Do You Go" this song was one of many solo hits for Cher in the 1960s to be written by Bono and it became Cher's second solo top ten of the decade. Along with the Sonny & Cher hit "The Beat Goes On," this was a temporary comeback to the U.S. top ten for Cher and neither she nor the duo would reach those heights again until 1971.
Singer Roy Drusky brought the song to country music audiences in 1968. His version peaked at #28, spending 10 weeks on the Billboard country chart.
Gary Puckett & The Union Gap also released a version of the song on their 1968 album, Woman, Woman.Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Woman, Woman Retrieved September 28, 2011
Toward the end of Sonny & Cher touring together, Sonny Bono performed You Better Sit Down Kids live in 1973.  A studio version with Sonny on lead vocals is available on "All I Ever Need: The Kapp/MCA Anthology".
