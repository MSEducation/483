==Life and career==

Biswas was born on 12 September 1972 in Sutia, North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal. His parents, Gita Biswas and Jagadish Biswas, migrated from Faridpur, Bangladesh after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to Acharipara, Panchpota, in North 24 Parganas.  His father worked as a labourer during the day and sang for a local theatre group at night to pay for his children's education.
Barun Biswas attended Panchpota Bharadanga High School.  He completed his schooling at Khatra Boys High School. He received his B.A. in Bengali from Gobardanga Hindu College, his masters degree from Calcutta University, and his B. Ed. from B.T. College, New Barrackpore.
After his education, Biswas passed the West Bengal Civil Service exam, and chose a career in social work and education. In 1998, he started his career as a school teacher at Mitra Institution (Main) of Kolkata, where he worked till his death.

==Activism==

===Ichhamati river and water===

In 2000, Biswas started a campaign for the construction of a canal to check flooding of the Ichamati and Jamuna rivers.  The rivers were causing widespread flooding in Sutia, Bongaon, Swarupnagar, and Gaighata.  Biswas drew up a blueprint for the canal.  Though initially his plan met with little enthusiasm from local leaders, the government later built the canal.  Later, he was involved in the fight against gangs who were illegally blocking and diverting the Ichamati river for their businesses, causing floods in the village area.

===2000—2012: Anti-rape activism===

Sutia and neighbouring villages were engulfed by a criminal gang during the late 1990s and early 2000s. From 2000—2002, 33 rapes and 12 murders were committed in Sutia.  Biswas formed a group of villagers to fight crime and to demand arrests. In 2000, at age 28, he co-founded "Sutia Gonodhorshon Pratibad Mancha". The organisation started to hold public meetings to protest the rapes. During such a meeting, Biswas said:
Biswas' group helped rape victims give reports to the police that led to arrests of the gang members, including the leader of the gangs, Sushanta Choudhury. Biswas also counseled the raped women.

==Death==

At 7:20 pm on 5 July 2012, when returning from Kolkata, Biswas was shot from behind in a parking lot outside the Gobardanga railway station. Subsequently, police from Habra, Gaighata, and Gopal Nagar arrested five men with ties to the Sutia gang.  This included the alleged hired killer, Sumanta Debnath, alias Fotke, Debashish Sarkar, Bishwajit Biswas, and Raju Sarkar, most of whom were local students. The alleged assassin reportedly confessed to the police that he was contracted by gang leader Sushanta Choudhury, who was serving life imprisonment in Dum Dum Central Jail.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/man-who-gave-the-poor-a-voice-now-silenced/972707/2 |title=Man who gave the poor a voice now silenced | newspaper=Indian Express |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl]

==Legacy==

In August 2013, a Bengali film called Proloy was made on the life of Biswas. Actor Parambrata Chatterjee portrayed the role of Barun Biswas.[tpl]cite news|title=Mother says Parambrata in Proloy looks exactly like Barun Biswas|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/bengali/news-interviews/Mother-says-Parambrata-in-Proloy-looks-exactly-like-Barun-Biswas/articleshow/21728126.cms|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=9 August 2013[/tpl]
In the 2013 Durga Puja, Panchpota Avijan Sangha Durga Puja Committee used Biswas' life ans struggle as their puja's festive theme. They also named their puja platform Barun Mancha (Barun platform). Manobendra Biswas, joint secretary of the puja committee told—[tpl]cite news|title=Theme for Puja dream|accessdate=22 September 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=22 September 2013[/tpl] 
 Barun's mamabari (maternal house) was in Sutia Panchpota and he had spent his childhood here. When Sutia was virtually ruled by rapists and criminals, he started a movement to help villagers fight the reign of terror through Sutia Pratibadi Mancha... Durga Puja marks the victory of Durga over Mahishasura and Barun's fight epitomizes the victory of good over evil.
