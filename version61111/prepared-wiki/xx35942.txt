==Climate==

Roma has a humid subtropical climate, which gets enough precipitation to avoid the semi-arid climate. Its location on the far south of the Carnarvon Range at an elevation of 299 meters above sea level means that it is cooler and wetter than the plains to the south and west, while being warmer and drier than areas to the north and east. Temperatures in Roma range from 34 °C in summer to 20 °C in winter and winter minimums can drop below freezing; however, it seldom gets colder than -3 °C. Rainfall is mild and distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, with an annual average of 587.9 mm (23.15 in), however it peaks in summer due to frequent showers and thunderstorms. Roma is usually too far inland to experience the influence of tropical cyclones and associated rain depressions, however there are exceptions, and these systems have caused significant flooding in the town. Extremes have ranged from 45.8 °C (114.4 °F) to -5.8 °C (21.5 °F).[tpl]BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_043091_All|site_name=ROMA AIRPORT|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=January 2014[/tpl]January 2014 Daily Weather Observations
