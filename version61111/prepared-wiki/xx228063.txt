===The Story of Egmo===

The Story of Egmo is the first novel written and illustrated by Ben Cormack. In early 2007 the London Library Development Agency promoted the book, which was made available for free download, as part of its first literacy campaign targeted at children and young adults. The book received over 25,000 downloads within the first year and achieved national recognition from The Independent, N.U.T. magazine and Viz comic.
The book's protagonist, 'Egmo' is an ill-fated anti hero whose many eccentricities put him firmly out of step with the world. When he unearths the global domination plans of local would-be-criminal-mastermind Krapodkin he sets out on a fantastical mission to restore relative normality.
'Francis and Bunty', a short story set in the 'Story of Egmo' universe, was used to front the 2009 'Best Writer in the Universe' short story competition. It was narrated for the Story of Egmo podcast by popular comedian and BBC presenter Adam Buxton.

===Cartoon Clinic===

Cartoon clinic is an instruction drawing manual aimed at younger artists. Cartoon Clinic places more emphasis on narrative drive by using several fictional cartoon characters which lead the reader through the book whilst dispensing advice in an informal manner.
The funny thing about books on cartooning is that they're usually not very funny. Cormack's is not only witty, but it's surprisingly well written and comprehensive. The first four chapters explore tools and equipment, drawing basic elements, inking and coloring techniques, and composition and layout. Each chapter contains tutorials that deal with different areas to practice. The tutorials are interspersed with "clinics" where common cartooning problems are highlighted and solutions suggested. The final chapter consists of a very useful gallery of work in a variety of styles from a wide range of professionals. Cormack's chapters on cartoons and computers, hand gestures, and cartoon heads and facing are especially good. You have to love an art instruction book that covers "Hygiene Tips" and "Making Good Your Screw-Ups." Highly recommended. - Library Journal
