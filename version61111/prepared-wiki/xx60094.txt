==History==

The school is located on [tpl]convert|19|acre|m2[/tpl], the centerpiece of which is the Ponce de Leon Hall, built in 1888 as a luxury hotel. The architects were John Carrere and Thomas Hastings, working  for Henry Morrison Flagler, the industrialist, oil magnate and railroad pioneer. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Lawrence Lewis, Jr., was the driving force behind the development of Flagler College. It was his vision to create a small, private liberal arts college on the grounds of the old hotel.  Lewis served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Flagler College for more than 20 years, guiding the College through a re-organization in 1971. He directed millions of dollars through foundations, family and personal funds into new construction, restoration projects, endowment and various other programs to  ensure the continued success of Flagler College. Lewis was related to Henry Flagler through his mother, Louise Wise Lewis Francis, who was the niece of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, who married Henry Flagler in 1901."Remembering Molly Wiley" Flagler College Magazine

==Campus==

Flagler's campus is located in the heart of St. Augustine, just four miles (6 km) from the Atlantic Ocean. The campus comprises fifteen buildings, some of which are located throughout the historic district of Saint Augustine. Ponce de Leon Hall is the focal point of the campus, where the female dormitories, as well as the dining hall, are located. The individual rooms consist of the former hotel rooms along with the former hotel employees' rooms. The male dormitories are located at Lewis House, which opened in 1987, and Cedar Hall, which was constructed in 2004. Most classes are taught in Kenan Hall, which is adjacent to Ponce de Leon Hall. Classes not taught here can be located in the Ringhaver Student Center, Proctor Library, the Communications Building at 31 Cordova Street, the Art Building directly behind Kenan Hall or the Flagler College Auditorium at 14 Granada Street. The campus is located in historical downtown St. Augustine. The College recently acquired the former Florida East Coast Railway buildings on Malaga Street, which opened as men's and women's dormitories for 2008 fall semester.
Since it was founded in 1968, the college has spent more than $43 million restoring the historic campus and adding new buildings. The  newest buildings are the three-part former headquarters of the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) buildings on Malaga St. which have been converted into one female, one male dorm building, and one coed dorm building where each gender is separated by floors; Cedar Hall male dorm rooms on the corner of Cedar Street and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue; and the Ringhaver Student Center.  Flagler's [tpl]convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] athletic field is two miles (3 km) from campus.  While the college has recycled some historic buildings into new uses, it has also stirred up much controversy by seeking to demolish historic buildings surrounding the campus.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

In 2006 and 2007, there were several allegations of censorship or alteration of articles in the Gargoyle by the college administration. In 2006, one issue of the newspaper was removed from circulation due to an alleged error in its headlines about rising tuition."Newspapers Pulled from Shelves at Flagler" WJXT Jacksonville."College confiscates newspapers" The St. Augustine Record."College paper pulled from stands for faulty headline" Student Press Law Center. In April 2007, the college administration again exercised editorial control over the paper due to alleged fact errors."Administration, newspaper staff at odds at Flagler College" Florida Times-Union. Students rallied and organized a protest against any type of censorship of the newspaper, calling for a free and independent student press."Cry of censorship rallied Flagler College students to protest decision" The St. Augustine Record. 
After September 2007, working on The Gargoyle was no longer required of communication majors. An advisory board and operating guidelines were set up to handle any situations which may arise and to help outline the function of The Gargoyle."Gargoyle establishes advisory board" The St. Augustine Record.
