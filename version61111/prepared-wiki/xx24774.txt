[[Geography of Iceland]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Iceland

The geography of Iceland entails the geographic features of Iceland, an island country at the confluence of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  Iceland is located east of Greenland and immediately south of the Arctic Circle, atop the constructive boundary of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It lies about [tpl]convert|860|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Scotland and [tpl]convert|4200|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from New York City. One of the world's most sparsely populated countries, the republic of Iceland is almost completely coterminous with the main island – the world's 18th largest in area and possessing almost all of the country's area and population.
Iceland has extensive volcanic and geothermal activity.  The rift associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which marks the division between the European and North American tectonic plates, runs across Iceland from the southwest to the northeast. This geographic feature is prominent at the Þingvellir National Park, where the promontory creates an extraordinary natural amphitheatre. The site was the home of Iceland's parliament, the Alþing, which was first convened in 930. It is a common misconception that Þingvellir are located at the juncture between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. However, they are in fact at the juncture of the North American continental plate and a smaller plate (approx. 10,000 km2) called the Hreppar Microplate (Hreppaflekinn).[tpl]cite web|title=Plate boundaries, rifts and transforms in Iceland|url=http://jardvis.hi.is/sites/jardvis.hi.is/files/Pdf_skjol/Jokull58_pdf/jokull58-einarsson.pdf|work=JÖKULL No. 58, 2008|publisher=Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl]
About half of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin, consists of a mountainous lava desert (highest elevation [tpl]convert|2119|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level) and other wasteland. Eleven percent is covered by three large glaciers:
and several smaller ones:
Twenty percent of the land is used for grazing, and only 1% is cultivated. An ambitious reforestation program is under way. Fossilized tree pollen and descriptions by the early settlers indicate that prior to human settlement in the 9th–10th century, trees covered about 30 – 40 percent of the island. Today, however, there are only small patches of the original birch forests left, the most prominent are Hallormsstaðarskógur and Vaglaskógur.
The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest; the central highlands are totally uninhabited.
Because of the Gulf Stream's moderating influence, the climate is characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. In Reykjavík, the average temperature is [tpl]convert|11|°C|°F|1[/tpl] in July and [tpl]convert|0|°C|°F[/tpl] in January (Köppen: Cfc).

==Statistics==

==Antipodes==

Iceland is not antipodal to any land mass. The closest are the Balleny Islands off Antarctica, claimed by New Zealand. The antipodes of the northernmost of these, Young Island, lie between Flatey and Grímsey Islands off the north central Icelandic coast, about 10 km from either.
