CATEGORIES: 1966 births, Living people

Chris Stillwell is the bassist for the band The Greyboy Allstars. He was born to David and Cheryle Stillwell on June 4, 1966 in Seattle, Washington. The family moved to San Diego when Chris was about 6 months old. He stole his first guitar from his older sister's closet and didn't put it down for anything. He acquired an old telephone transcriber which he was able to slow the pitch down to his favorite guitarists' solos: Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, and Django Reinhardt. Soon he was playing in neighborhood bands on bass, doing Yardbirds, Jeff Beck, Zeppelin tunes. After reading interviews of said artists, he was turned on to blues, folk, jazz, Indian music, etc. John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin bassist) kept mentioning the name James Jamerson. Thus started Chris' study of R&B, Soul, and Funk bass styles. James Brown was always in the mix as well.
