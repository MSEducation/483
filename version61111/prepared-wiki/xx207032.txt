[[Back on Track (DeBarge album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1991 albums, DeBarge albums

Back on Track is the title of a gospel-oriented 1991 album by the family soul music group DeBarge, released on Truth Ministries. The "DeBarge" name is a bit misleading, as the album consisted of contributions from various members of the DeBarge family as opposed to being an official release by the "band" DeBarge.
Because of limited promotion from the little label and no other attention brought into the El-less lineup, the album fizzled.
