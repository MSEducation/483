[[Minor second]]

CATEGORIES: Minor intervals, Seconds

In modern Western tonal music theory a minor second is the interval between two notes on adjacent staff positions, or having adjacent note letters, whose alterations cause them to be one semitone or half-step apart, such as B and C or C and D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]. The interval is also called a diatonic semitone.
Its inversion is a major seventh.
A helpful way to recognize a minor second is to hum the first two notes of Rosemary's Lullaby.
