==Gameplay==

Celebrity sound-(or look)-a-likes compete for cash and prizes. Each contestant is introduced by their real name and the singer they are emulating. They are each given roughly 3 minutes to impress the studio audience with their singing ability and/or likeness to the celebrity. The performances are accompanied by elaborate stage sets, dancers and full costuming. The winner of each show is determined by electronic-voting courtesy of the audience members, with each winner returning at a later date to compete in the grand finals.
