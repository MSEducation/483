Baqueira-Beret is a ski resort located in the heart of the Pyrenees, in the Aran Valley and Àneu Valley Lleida, Spain. The ski area extends from 1,500 to the 2,510 meters.

==The resort==

Baqueira-Beret-Bonaigua is the largest Winter resort in Spain,  with 120km of marked pistes, 11km of marked off piste,  and 7km of cross-country ski and 1.922 hectares of ski area. It is located in the highest part of the Aran Valley (Naut Arán), and Pallars Sobirá (Valls d'Aneu). It has long and wide ski runs, some through trees. It is divided into three different zones, Baqueira, Beret and Bonaigua. Due to its westerly aspect, the resort of Baqueira-Beret has a good snow record throughout the winter.  In addition, there is more than 1,000 meters of vertical drop and an extensive skiable zone.
Much of the region of the Aran Valley and Àneu Valley is made up of over 50 small rural populations, each one with stone and wood houses and ancient Romanesque churches. The resort was founded 60 years ago on the initiative of the local authorities in the Aran Valley.  A group of people commanded by Jorge Jordana Pozas, Jesús Serra Santamanas and Luis Arias (after whom a slope is named after he died in a dramatic accident) founded the ski resort in the municipality of Naut given the good snow conditions found there. Baqueira-Beret, with over 110 kilometers of ski runs, is the most visited and extensive station on the Iberian Peninsula.
