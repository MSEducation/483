Major Charles Heaphy VC (1821 – 3 August 1881) was a New Zealand explorer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Charles Heaphy was born in London, England the son of the artist Thomas Heaphy. He was just seventeen years old when he was appointed as resident Artist and Surveyor to the first New Zealand Company expedition to New Zealand, sailing with William Wakefield on the Tory and arriving in what later became known as Wellington late in 1839.

==In New Zealand==

In 1841 he joined Arthur Wakefield on the expedition that led to the founding of Nelson. From here he took part in several expeditions to explore the north west corner of the South Island.  In 1848 he was appointed gold fields commissioner at Coromandel.

==Military career==

In 1859 he joined the Armed Constabulary as a volunteer.  He was approximately 43-years-old, and a major in the Auckland Militia, New Zealand Military Forces, during the Invasion of the Waikato of 1863–64 (one of the campaigns of the New Zealand Wars).

For this action he was awarded the Victoria Cross; the first colonial soldier to receive it.  Von Tempsky wrote that “Heaphy has the (Victoria) Cross and I want it”, which may have caused the reckless action leading to his own death.

In 1865 he was appointed Chief Surveyor for Auckland and in 1867 elected to the House of Representatives for Parnell, a suburb of Auckland. In 1878 he was appointed as a judge of the Native Land Court but retired two years later due to ill health.

==Later life==

Charles Heaphy was an accomplished artist and his watercolours are an important record of many scenes in the early days of European settlement in New Zealand. However, his name is most known now through the Heaphy Track in the north west corner of the South Island. He and Thomas Brunner were probably the first Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and although he never followed the route of the Heaphy Track, it is named in his honour.
He died in Brisbane, Australia, in 1881 and is buried at Toowong Cemetery. His grave, built and maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves, is located in Portion 1 Church of England of the Toowong (old Brisbane General) Cemetery). His grave is approximately 20 metres north east up the hill from the "8th Avenue" roadway, (an internal cemetery roadway), which forms the western boundary of Portion 1.[tpl]cite web|url=https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=133378|title=Brisbane City Council – Online – Grave Location Search|publisher=Brisbane City Council|accessdate=29 October 2011[/tpl]
