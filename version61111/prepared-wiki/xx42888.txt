CATEGORIES: Bacterial diseases, Pediatrics, Pertussis

Pertussis — commonly called whooping cough ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|uː|p|ɪ|ŋ[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|p|ɪ|ŋ|[/tpl], or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|uː|p|ɪ|ŋ|_|k|ɒ|f[/tpl]) — is a highly contagious bacterial disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. In some countries, this disease is called the 100 days' cough or cough of 100 days.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carbonetti NH |title=Immunomodulation in the pathogenesis of Bordetella pertussis infection and disease |journal=Curr Opin Pharmacol |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=272–8 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17418639 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2006.12.004 [/tpl]
Symptoms are initially mild, and then develop into severe coughing fits, which produce the namesake high-pitched "whoop" sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing.Symptoms, sounds, and a video WhoopingCough.net The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding.  Prevention by vaccination is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children. Although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected, antibiotics are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness. It is currently estimated that the disease annually affects 48.5 million people worldwide, resulting in nearly 295,000 deaths.

==Signs and symptoms==

The classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting and/or vomiting after coughing.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cornia PB, Hersh AL, Lipsky BA, Newman TB, Gonzales R |title=Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? |journal=JAMA |volume=304 |issue=8 |pages=890–6 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20736473 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1181 [/tpl] The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, post-cough fainting, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. If there is vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, the likelihood almost doubles that the illness is pertussis. On the other hand, the absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis makes it almost half as likely.
The incubation period is typically seven to ten days with a range of four to 21 days and rarely may be as long as 42 days,Pertussis (whooping cough), New York State Department of Health, Updated: January 2012, retrieved 8 June 2013. after which there are usually mild respiratory symptoms, mild coughing, sneezing, or runny nose. This is known as the catarrhal stage. After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, each with five to ten forceful coughs, followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound in younger children, or a gasping sound in older children, as the patient struggles to breathe in afterwards (paroxysmal stage).
Fits can occur on their own or can be triggered by yawning, stretching, laughing, eating or yelling; they usually occur in groups, with multiple episodes on an hourly basis throughout the day. This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to two weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, both in frequency and severity, and a cessation of vomiting.
A tendency to produce the "whooping" sound after coughing may remain for a considerable period after the disease itself has cleared up.

==Diagnosis==

Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on Bordet-Gengou medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct immunofluorescence (DFA), and serological methods. The bacteria can be recovered from the patient only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.
For most adults and adolescents, who often do not seek medical care until several weeks into their illness, serology may be used to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another component of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the patient. By this stage they have been contagious for some weeks and may have spread the infection to many people. Because of this, adults, who are not in great danger from pertussis, are increasingly being encouraged to be vaccinated.
A similar, milder disease is caused by B. parapertussis.[tpl]cite book | author = Finger H, von Koenig CHW | title = Bordetella–Clinical Manifestations.

==Prevention==

The primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed but are without symptoms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Altunaiji|first=S|coauthors=Kukuruzovic, R, Curtis, N, Massie, J|title=Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis).|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007-07-18|issue=3|pages=CD004404|pmid=17636756|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004404.pub3[/tpl] Prophylactic antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).

===Vaccine===

Pertussis vaccines are effective, routinely recommended by the World Health Organization[tpl]cite web |title=Annex 6 whole cell pertussis|url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/publications/trs/areas/vaccines/whole_cell_pertussis/Annex%206%20whole%20cell%20pertussis.pdf|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl] and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,[tpl]cite web|title=Pertussis: Summary of Vaccine Recommendations|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/recs-summary.htm|work=Centre for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl] and are estimated to have saved over half a million lives in 2002. The multi-component acellular pertussis vaccine, for example, is between 71-85% effective with greater effectiveness for more severe disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhang L, Prietsch SOM, Axelsson I, Halperin SA |title=Acellular vaccines for preventing whooping cough in children |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2012 |issue=3 |pages=CD001478 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001478.pub5 |pmid=22419280 |volume=3[/tpl] Despite widespread use of the vaccine, however, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today "one of the most prevalent vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries." The recent resurgences in pertussis infections are attributed to a combination of waning immunity and new mutations in the bacteria that existing vaccines are unable to effectively control.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Pertussis resurgence: waning immunity and pathogen adaptation - two sides of the same coin.|date = Feb 2013|doi = 10.1017/S0950268813000071|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8836751|last = Mooi et al.|journal = Epidemiology and Infection|publisher = Oxford University Press|pages = 1–10[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Resurgence of pertussis calls for re-evaluation of pertussis animal models.|date = Sep 2012|url = http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/erv.12.83?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&|last = van der Ark et al.|journal = Expert Reviews|issue = 9|volume = 11|doi = 10.1586/erv.12.83[/tpl]
Immunization against pertussis does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 study by the CDC indicated that the duration of protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Versteegh FGA, Schellekens JFP, Fleer A, Roord JJ. | title = Pertussis: a concise historical review including diagnosis, incidence, clinical manifestations and the role of treatment and vaccination in management. | journal = Rev Med Microbiol | year = 2005 | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 79–89 | url= http://www.revmedmicrobiol.com/pt/re/revmedmicrob/abstract.00013542-200508000-00001.htm [/tpl] For children, the immunizations are commonly given in combination with immunizations against tetanus, diphtheria, polio and haemophilus influenzae type B at ages two, four, six, and 15–18 months. A single later booster is given at four to six years of age. (US schedule). In the UK, pertussis vaccinations are given at 2, 3 and 4 months, with a pre-school booster at 3 years 4 months.
Paul Offit, chief of the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, comments that the last pertussis vaccination people receive may be their booster at age 11 or 12 years old. However, he states that it is important for adults to have immunity as well to prevent transmission of the disease to infants.[tpl]cite web|last=Rettner|first=Rachael|title=Whooping Cough Vaccine Protection Fades After 3 Years|url=http://www.myhealthnewsdaily.com/whopping-cough-pertussis-vaccine-immunity-2025/|publisher=My Health News Daily|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] While adults rarely die if they contract pertussis after the effects of their childhood vaccinations have worn off, they may transmit the disease to people at much higher risk of injury or death. To reduce morbidity and spread of the disease, Canada, France, the U.S. and Germany have approved pertussis vaccine booster shots. In 2012, a federal advisory panel recommended that all U.S. adults receive vaccination.http://apnews.myway.com/article/20120222/D9T2I3JG4.html Later that year, health officials in the UK recommended the vaccination of pregnant women (between 28 – 38 weeks of pregnancy) in order to protect their unborn children. Designed to protect babies from birth until their first standard vaccination at eight weeks of age, this vaccine was introduced in response to the ongoing outbreak of pertussis in the UK, the worst in over a decade.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19729989#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa |title=BBC News - Whooping cough outbreak: Pregnant women to be vaccinated[/tpl]
The pertussis booster for adults is combined with a tetanus vaccine and diphtheria vaccine booster; this combination is abbreviated "Tdap" (Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis). It is similar to the childhood vaccine called "DTaP" (Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis), with the main difference that the adult version contains smaller amounts of the diphtheria and pertussis components — this is indicated in the name by the use of lower-case "d" and "p" for the adult vaccine. The lower-case "a" in each vaccine indicates that the pertussis component is acellular, or cell-free, which improves safety by dramatically reducing the incidence of side effects. Adults should request the Tdap instead of just a tetanus vaccination in order to receive the multi-vaccine. The pertussis component of the original DPT vaccine accounted for most of the minor local and systemic side effects in many vaccinated infants (such as mild fever or soreness at the injection site). The newer acellular vaccine, known as DTaP, has greatly reduced the incidence of adverse effects compared to the earlier "whole-cell" pertussis vaccine, however the efficacy of the acellular vaccine declines faster than the whole-cell vaccine.[tpl]cite web | title=Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed, ADACEL, Aventis Pasteur Ltd | url=http://www.fda.gov/Cber/products/tdapave061005.htm | accessdate = 2006-05-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216224327/http://www.fda.gov/Cber/products/tdapave061005.htm  |archivedate = 2007-02-16[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.341.6145.454[/tpl]

==Management==

People with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.
A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age The antibiotic erythromycin or azithromycin is a front-line treatment Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides. Effective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed.
Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are preferred for the treatment of pertussis in persons ≥1 month of age.

==Prognosis==

Common complications of the disease include pneumonia, encephalopathy, earache, or seizures.
Most healthy older children and adults will have a full recovery from pertussis, however those with comorbid conditions can have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.
Infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 1.6% of hospitalized infants who are under one year of age.[tpl]cite web |title=Pertussis: Complications |url=http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=24 August 2012 [/tpl] Infants under one are also more likely to develop complications, such as: pneumonia (20%), encephalopathy (0.3%), seizures (1%), failure to thrive, and death (1%) — perhaps due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress immune response against it.[tpl]cite journal |last=Carbonetti |first=Nicholas H |title=Pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase toxin: key virulence factors of Bordetella pertussis and cell biology tools |journal=Future Microbiol. |date=March 2010 |volume=5 |pages=455–469 |accessdate=23 May 2013 |pmc=2851156[/tpl] Pertussis can cause severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia and 50% of infants admitted to hospital will suffer apneas.
