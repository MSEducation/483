[[Boron group]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table, Groups in the periodic table

The boron group are the chemical elements in group 13 of the periodic table, comprising boron (B), aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), thallium (Tl), and ununtrium (Uut). The elements in the boron group are characterized by having three electrons in their outer energy levels (valence layers).[tpl]cite book|title = Chemistry and chemical reactivity |author=Kotz, John C.; Treichel, Paul and Townsend, John Raymond |publisher = Thomson Books| year = 2009 |location = Belmont, Ca, USA|isbn = 0-495-38712-6|volume= 2 | page=351|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jcn6sgt7RpoC&pg=PA351[/tpl] These elements have also been referred to as icosagens[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/39266984/Earth-Metals|title=Earth Metals, Aluminium|publisher = Scribd | accessdate = March 11, 2013[/tpl] and triels.
Boron is classified as a metalloid while the rest, with the possible exception of ununtrium, are considered other metals. Ununtrium has not yet been confirmed to be an other metal and, due to relativistic effects, might not turn out to be one. Boron occurs sparsely, probably because bombardment by the subatomic particles produced from natural radioactivity disrupts its nuclei. Aluminium occurs widely on earth, and indeed is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (8.3%).[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=1960 |title=Soviet Aluminium from Clay |journal=The New Scientist |volume=8 |issue=191 |page=89 |publisher=One Shilling Weekly |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vPmlBbHCOTIC&pg=PA89[/tpl] Gallium is found in the earth with an abundance of 13 ppm. Indium is the 61st most abundant element in the earth's crust, and thallium is found in moderate amounts throughout the planet. Ununtrium is never found in nature and therefore is termed a synthetic element.
Several group 13 elements have biological roles in the ecosystem. Boron is a trace element in humans and is essential for some plants. Lack of boron can lead to stunted plant growth, while an excess can also cause harm by inhibiting growth. Aluminium has neither a biological role nor significant toxicity and is considered safe. Indium and gallium can stimulate metabolism; gallium is credited with the ability to bind itself to iron proteins. Thallium is highly toxic, interfering with the function of numerous vital enzymes, and has seen use as a pesticide.[tpl]cite book |title=Clinical neurotoxicology: syndromes, substances, environments |last=Dobbs |first=Michael |year=2009 |publisher=Saunders |pages=276–278 |location=Philadelphia, Pa |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pmcy24y2HyMC&pg=PA277|isbn=978-0-323-05260-3[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior:
The boron group is notable for trends in the electron configuration, as shown above, and in some of its elements' characteristics. Boron differs from the other group members in its hardness, refractivity and reluctance to participate in metallic bonding. An example of a trend in reactivity is boron's tendency to form reactive compounds with hydrogen.[tpl]cite book |title=Elements of the p block |last=Harding, A.

===Chemical reactivity===

====Hydrides====

Most of the elements in the boron group show increasing reactivity as the elements get heavier in atomic mass and higher in atomic number. Boron, the first element in the group, is generally unreactive with many elements except at high temperatures, although it is capable of forming many compounds with hydrogen, sometimes called boranes.[tpl]cite book |title=Concepts And Problems In Inorganic Chemistry  |author=Raghavan, P. S.  |year=1998 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81-7141-418-4 |page=43 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pBiS0jc-kWIC&pg=PA43[/tpl] The simplest borane is diborane, or B2H6. Another example is B10H14.
The next group-13 elements, aluminium and gallium, form fewer stable hydrides, although both AlH3 and GaH3 exist. Indium, the next element in the group, is not known to form many hydrides, except in complex compounds such as  the phosphine complex H3InP(Cy)3.[tpl]cite doi|10.1039/A908418E[/tpl] No stable compound of thallium and hydrogen has been synthesized in any laboratory.

====Oxides====

All of the boron-group elements are known to form a trivalent oxide, with two atoms of the element bonded covalently with three atoms of oxygen. These elements show a trend of increasing pH (from acidic to basic).[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.433959|url=http://cnx.org/content/m32460/latest/?collection=col11124/latest|accessdate=June 16, 2011|title=Determinations of structure and bonding in vitreous B2O3 by means of B10, B11, and O17 NMR|year=1977|last1=Jellison|first1=G. E.|last2=Panek|first2=L. W.|last3=Bray|first3=P. J.|last4=Rouse|first4=G. B.|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=66|issue=2|pages=802|bibcode = 1977JChPh..66..802J [/tpl] Boron oxide (B2O3) is slightly acidic, aluminium and gallium oxide (Al2O3 and Ga2O3 respectively) are amphoteric, indium(III) oxide (In2O3) is nearly amphoteric, and thallium(III) oxide (Tl2O3) is a Lewis base because it dissolves in acids to form salts. Each of these compounds are stable, but thallium oxide decomposes at temperatures higher than 875 °C.

====Halides====

The elements in group 13 are also capable of forming stable compounds with the halogens, usually with the formula MX3 (where M is a boron-group element and X is a halogen.) The only exception to this is thallium(III) iodide.Henderson, p. 60 Fluorine, the first halogen, is able to form stable compounds with every element that has been tested (except neon and helium),[tpl]cite journal|last1=Young|first1=J.

It is even hypothesized that ununtrium could form a compound with fluorine, UutF3, before spontaneously decaying due to ununtrium's radioactivity. Chlorine also forms stable compounds with all of the elements in the boron group, including thallium, and is hypothesized to react with ununtrium. All of the elements will react with bromine under the right conditions, as with the other halogens but less vigorously than either chlorine or fluorine. Iodine will react with all natural elements in the periodic table except for the noble gases, and is notable for its explosive reaction with aluminium to form 2AlI3.[tpl]cite journal|last=Francis |first=William |title=The Chemical Gazette, or Journal of Practical Chemistry |volume=XVI |page=269 |year=1918 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-KwRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA269|location=Boston, Ma[/tpl] Astatine, the heaviest halogen, has only formed a few compounds, due to its radioactivity and short half-life, and no reports of a compound with an At–B, –Al, –Ga, –In, –Tl, or –Uut bond have been seen, although scientists think that it should form salts with metals.[tpl]cite book |title=The Halogen Elements: Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, Astatine |last=Roza |first=Greg|year=2010 |publisher=The Rozen Publishing Group, Inc. |location=NY, New York, USA |isbn=978-1-4358-3556-6 |page=33 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=twdXz1jfVOsC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl]

===Physical properties===

It has been noticed that the elements in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, all of the other elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do have in common is having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.[tpl]cite book |title=Criminalistics: Forensic Science, Crime and Terrorism |last=Girard |first=James E. |year=2010 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |page=221 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JRe7qd5u0yAC&pg=PA221|isbn=978-0-7637-7731-9[/tpl]

===Oxidation states===

The inert s-pair effect is significant in the group-13 elements, especially the heavier ones like thallium. This results in a variety of oxidation states. In the lighter elements, the +3 state is the most stable, but the +1 state becomes more prevalent with increasing atomic number, and is the most stable for thallium.Henderson, p. 57 Boron is capable of forming compounds with lower oxidization states, of +1 or +2, and aluminium can do the same.[tpl]cite book |title=Structure and bonding |last= Barrett |first=Jack |year=2001 |publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-85404-647-X |page=91 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-zIM6J1gEJkC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] Gallium can form compounds with the oxidation states +1, +2 and +3. Indium is like gallium, but its +1 compounds are more stable than those of the lighter elements. The strength of the inert-pair effect is maximal in thallium, which is only stable in the oxidation state of +1, although the +3 state is seen in some compounds.

===Periodic trends===

There are several trends that one could notice as they look at the properties of Boron group members. The Boiling Points of these elements drop from period to period, while densities tend to rise.

===Nuclear===

With the exception of the synthetic ununtrium, all of the elements of the boron group have stable isotopes. Because all their atomic numbers are odd, boron, gallium and thallium have only two stable isotopes, while aluminium and indium are monoisotopic, having only one. 10B and 11B are both stable, as are 27Al, 69Ga and 71Ga, 113In, and 203Tl and 205Tl.[tpl]cite book |title= The Group 13 Metals Aluminium, Gallium, Indium and Thallium: Chemical Patterns and Peculiarities |last= Aldridge |first= Simon |first2=Anthony J.|last2=Downs|first3=Tony|last3=Downs |year= 2011 |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |page= ii|url= http://books.google.com/?id=0AazLrNPoMEC|isbn= 978-0-470-68191-6[/tpl] All of these isotopes are readily found in macroscopic quantities in nature. In theory, though, all isotopes with an atomic number greater than 40 are supposed to be unstable to such decay modes as spontaneous fission and alpha decay. Conversely, all isotopes whose atomic numbers are less than 40 are theoretically supposed to be energetically stable to all forms of decay (with the exception of proton decay, which has never been observed).
Like all other elements, the elements of the boron group have radioactive isotopes, either found in trace quantities in nature or produced synthetically. The longest-lived of these unstable isotopes is the indium isotope 115In, with its extremely long half-life of [tpl]j|4.41 × 1014 y[/tpl]. This isotope is relatively important among indium's radioisotopes. The shortest-lived is 7B, with a half-life of a mere [tpl]j|350±50 × 10−24 s[/tpl], being the boron isotope with the fewest neutrons and a [tpl]not a typo|half-life long[/tpl] enough to measure. Some radioisotopes have important roles in scientific research; a few are used in the production of goods for commercial use or, more rarely, as a component of finished products.Downs, pp. 19–24

==History==

The boron group has had many names over the years. According to former conventions it was Group IIIB in the European naming system and Group IIIA in the American. The group has also gained two collective names, "earth metals" and "triels". The latter name is derived from the Latin prefix tri- ("three") and refers to the three valence electrons that all of these elements, without exception, have in their valence shells.
Boron was known to the ancient Egyptians, but only in the mineral borax. The metalloid element was not known in its pure form until 1808, when Humphry Davy was able to extract it by the method of electrolysis. Davy devised an experiment in which he dissolved a boron-containing compound in water and sent an electric current through it, causing the elements of the compound to separate into their pure states. To produce larger quantities he shifted from electrolysis to reduction with sodium. Davy named the element boracium. At the same time two French chemists, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard, used iron to reduce boric acid. The boron they produced was oxidized to boron oxide.[tpl]cite book |title=The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide |last=Krebs |first=Robert E. |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Press |page= 176 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-313-33438-2[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1386|title = The discovery of the elements.

Aluminium, like boron, was first known in minerals before it was finally extracted from alum, a common mineral in some areas of the world. Antoine Lavoisier and Humphry Davy had each separately tried to extract it. Although neither succeeded, Davy had given the metal its current name. It was only in 1825 that the Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted successfully prepared a rather impure form of the element. Many improvements followed, a significant advance being made just two years later by Friedrich Wöhler, whose slightly modified procedure still yielded an impure product. The first pure sample of aluminium is credited to Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, who substituted sodium for potassium in the procedure. At that time aluminium was considered precious, and it was displayed next to such metals as gold and silver.Downs, p. 15 The method used today, electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite, was developed by Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult in the late 1880s.
Thallium, the heaviest stable element in the boron group, was discovered by William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy in 1861. Unlike gallium and indium, thallium had not been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev, having been discovered before Mendeleev invented the periodic table. As a result, no one was really looking for it until the 1850s when Crookes and Lamy were examining residues from sulfuric acid production. In the spectra they saw a completely new line, a streak of deep green, which Crookes named after the Greek word θαλλός (thallos), referring to a green shoot or twig. Lamy was able to produce larger amounts of the new metal and determined most of its chemical and physical properties.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the elements: technical data, history, processing, applications |last=Enghag |first=Per |year=2004 |page= 71|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aff7sEea39EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-3-527-30666-4[/tpl]
Indium is the fourth element of the boron group but was discovered before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking in a sample of the mineral zinc blende, also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.[ref]
