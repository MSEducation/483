==Ethnicity==

The island of Madagascar is predominantly populated by people broadly classified as belonging to the  Malagasy ethnic identity. This group is further sub-divided a number of sub-groups, often given as numbering eighteen.
In addition, communities of Indians and Arabs have long been established on the island and have assimilated into local communities to varying degrees, in some places having long since become identified "Malagasy" ethnic groups, and in others maintaining distinct identities and cultural separation. More recent arrivals include Europeans and Chinese immigrants.
Madagascar was probably uninhabited prior to Austronesian settlement in the early centuries AD.
Austronesian features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the Merina (3 million[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]year needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]) and the Betsileo (2 million[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]year needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]); the remaining 16 tribal groupings are coastal peoples who are predominantly of East African origin, with various Malay, Arab, European and Indian admixtures. 
The largest coastal groups are the Betsimisaraka (1.5 million) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the people along the coast. For example in the 1970s there was widespread opposition among coastal ethnics against the policy of Malgachisation which intended to phase out the use of the French language in public life in favour of a more prominent position for the Malagasy language, whose orthography is based on the Merina dialect. Identity politics were also at the core of the brief civil unrest during 2002.
Indians in Madagascar descend mostly from traders who arrived in the newly independent nation looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the west coast of India known as Karana (Muslim) and Banian (Hindu). The majority speak Hindi or Gujarati, although some other Indian dialects are also spoken. [tpl]As of|2007|alt=Nowadays[/tpl] the younger generations speak at least three languages, including French, Gujarati and Malagasy. A large number of the Indians in Madagascar have a high level of education, particularly the younger generation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
A sizeable number of Europeans also reside in Madagascar, mostly of French descent.
