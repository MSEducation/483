Jess is a rule engine for the Java platform that was developed by Ernest Friedman-Hill of Sandia National Labs.[tpl]cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KepsLbpWe-0C&pg=PA47&dq=Jess,+Java&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Sqh2T9H2KabniAKh_cynDg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Jess%2C%20Java&f=false | title=Expert Systems in Chemistry Research | publisher=CRC Press | date=2008 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | author=Hemmer, Markus C. | pages=47-48[/tpl] ISBN 978-1-4200-5323-4 It is a superset of the CLIPS programming language. It was first written in late 1995. The language provides rule-based programming for the automation of an expert system, and is frequently termed as an expert system shell. In recent years, intelligent agent systems have also developed, which depend on a similar capability.
Rather than a procedural paradigm, where a single program has a loop that is activated only one time, the declarative paradigm used by Jess continuously applies a collection of rules to a collection of facts by a process called pattern matching. Rules can modify the collection of facts, or they can execute any Java code.
The Jess rules engine utilizes the Rete algorithm, and can be utilized to create:
