==Plot==

The Underdog is about Cameron Wolfe, a 15-year-old and a down-and-out character, his family, and a girl he falls for. Cameron shares a room with his older brother, Ruben, who is always coming up with petty criminal activities he never follows through with, such robbing a dentist only to be distracted by the beautiful nurse working there. His sister, Sarah, is always "going at it" with her boyfriend, until they break up. His brother, Steve, is successful and thinks he is above the rest of his family. His mother works hard all week and still manages to complete motherly duties, and his father is a plumber. Cameron starts working for his father on weekends, where he meets Rebecca Conlon, a girl who he thinks is perfect. The story is about boys' dirty habits, family sticking together and being an underdog.

==Reception==

In a review of Underdogs, Los Angeles Times reviewer Susan Carpenter notes Zusak's earlier works "share many of the same stylistic hallmarks and themes of belonging and survival" with his better-known novels including the Michael L. Printz Award-winning The Book Thief. The Age commented that Zusak's writing style was "relaxed and confident" and did not "try to explore social issues."Cameron Wolfe, lost and found", The Age, 14 May 2003. (accessed 15 November 2012)
