[[Active audience theory]]

CATEGORIES: Media theories

Active audience theory argues that media audiences do not just receive information passively but are actively involved, often unconsciously, in making sense of the message within their personal and social contexts.[tpl]cite book|last=Munday|first=Daniel Chandler, Rod|title=A dictionary of media and communication|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956875-8|edition=1st ed.[/tpl] Decoding of a media message may therefore be influenced by such things as family background, beliefs, values, culture, interests, education and experiences. 
Other theories and models are compatible with active audience theory, including the Encoding/Decoding model and the Uses and gratifications theory, which states that audiences are actively involved in determining what media they engage with and how, in order to gratify specific needs or desires.[tpl]cite book|last=McQuail,|first=D., Blumler, J. G., & Brown, J. R.|title=The television audience: A revised perspective. Media studies: A reader|year=1972|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=271–284[/tpl] The Mass media article refers to a Culturalist theory, however there is little evidence of its use in relation to (mass) media. 
Active audience theory is seen as a direct contrast to the Effects traditions, however Jenny Kitzinger argues against discounting the effect or influence media can have on an audience, acknowledging that an active audience does not mean that media effect or influence is not possible.[tpl]cite book|last=Kitzinger|first=J|title=A sociology of media power: key issues in audience reception research. Message Received.|year=1999|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow|pages=238, 207–43[/tpl] Supporting this view, other theories combine the concepts of active audience theory and the effects model, such as the 
two step flow theory where Katz and Lazarsfeld argue that persuasive media texts are filtered through opinion leaders who are in a position to 'influence' the targeted audience through social networks and peer groups.
