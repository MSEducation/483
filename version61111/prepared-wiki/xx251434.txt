CATEGORIES: Chinese literature, Chinese mythology

Shi Yi Ji ([tpl]zh|c=拾遺記|p=Shíyí Jì[/tpl]) is a Chinese mythological / historical treatise compiled by the  Taoist scholar Wang Jia (died 390). The title of the work has been variously translated into English as Record of Heretofore Lost Works,Empresses and consorts: selections from Chen Shou's Records of the Three ...  Researches into Lost Records,
Record of Gleanings,Alexander Wylie, Chinese researches 
or Forgotten Tales.
The verb shiyi (拾遺) is translated by modern dictionaries as "to appropriate lost property", or, when used in book titles, "to make up for omissions". Accordingly, the  work is based on "apocryphal" versions of early (legendary) Chinese history, which must have been produced during the Eastern Han Dynasty. For example, Shi Yi Jis version of the story of Yu the Great has a yellow dragon and a black turtle helping Yu to create the geographical features of China, and to name them - details not found in Shan Hai Jing.[ref]
