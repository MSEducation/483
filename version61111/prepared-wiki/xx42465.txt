As a child, Firth travelled a lot due to his parents' work, spending some years in Nigeria.Stated in interview on Inside the Actors Studio, 2011 He also lived in St. Louis, Missouri when he was 11.  Firth described this as a difficult time.[tpl]cite web|title=Press Releases Colin Firth Desert Island DiscsCategory: Radio 4  Date: 4 December 2005|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/12_december/04/did_firth.shtml|work=BBC Press Office releases|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl] On returning to the UK he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (now Kings' School), which at the time was a state comprehensive school in Winchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and was the target of bullying.  To counter this he adopted the local working class Hampshire accent, and affected a lack of interest in schoolwork.Biography.com By the time he was fourteen, Firth had already decided he wanted to be a professional actor, having attended drama workshops from the age of ten. Until further education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview "I didn't like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all." However, at Barton Peveril Sixth form college in Eastleigh he became instilled with a love of English literature thanks to an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that "My two years at Barton Peveril were among the two happiest years of my life".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fenews.co.uk/fe-news/college-saved-me-reveals-actor-colin-firth |title=College 'saved me', reveals actor Colin Firth |author=Jason Rainbow |date= 15 June 2010  |work= FE News |accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl]

==Career==

===1983–1994, "Brit Pack" boy===

Playing Hamlet in the Drama Centre end of year production, Firth was spotted by playwright Julian Mitchell, who cast him as the gay, ambitious public schoolboy Guy Bennett in the 1983 West End production of Another Country. In 1984, Firth made his film debut in the role of Tommy Judd, Guy Bennett's straight, Marxist school friend in the screen adaptation of the play (opposite Rupert Everett as Guy Bennett).[tpl]cite web|title=Another Country|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69a34447|work=BFI Film|publisher=BFI|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|title=How we met: Colin Firth & Julian Mitchell|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-colin-firth--julian-mitchell--rupert-everett-was-a-complete-bd-to-me-9202649.html|accessdate=14 April 2014 | work=The Independent|first=Adam|last=Jacques|date=23 March 2014[/tpl] This was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was later resolved.[tpl]cite news|last=Fenton|first=Andrew|title=Colin Firth has ended his feud with Rupert Everett|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/firth-class-bully/story-e6frf9h6-1111115901547|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=27 March 2008|quote="Everett publicly branded Firth 'boring' and classified him as 'a ghastly guitar-playing redbrick socialist who was going to give his first half-million away to charity'. 'We didn't get along very well the first time we worked together, Firth says simply. 'I think he was probably terribly threatened because I was an awful lot better than him.'" There is some truth to this because in Everett's 2006 autobiography, the gay actor admits he fancied, and felt threatened by, Firth at the time.[/tpl] He starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in Lost Empires'' (1986), a TV adaptation of J. B. Priestley's novel.  
In 1987, Firth along with other up and coming British actors such as Tim Roth, Bruce Payne and Paul McGann were dubbed the 'Brit Pack'.[tpl]cite journal|last=Van Poznak|first=Elissa|title=The Brit Pack|journal=The Face|date=January 1987|issue=81|pages=36–39|url=http://brucesangels.com/britpack.html|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brucepayne.de/press/articles/facearticle1987.html |title=The Brit Pack |publisher=Brucepayne.de |accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl] That same year he appeared alongside Kenneth Branagh in the film version of J. L. Carr's A Month in the Country.  Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early works of playing those traumatised by war. Firth portrayed real-life British soldier Robert Lawrence MC in the 1988 BBC dramatisation Tumbledown.  Lawrence was severely injured at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown during the Falklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and the public.

===1995–2003, English romantic (Pride and Prejudice)===

It was through his role as the aloof and haughty aristocrat Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC television adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that Firth finally became a household name.  He was producer Sue Birtwistle's first choice for the part, eventually being persuaded to take it, despite initial reluctance as he was unfamiliar with Austen's writing.[tpl]cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=An Austen Tale of Sex and Money in Which Girls Kick Up Their Heels|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/tv/cover-story-an-austen-tale-of-sex-and-money-in-which-girls-kick-up-their-heels.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 January 1996[/tpl] Firth and co-star Jennifer Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.[tpl]cite news |last=Steiner |first=Susie |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/mar/31/features.weekend |title=Twice Shy |work=The Guardian |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl]thumb|left|A scene from Pride and Prejudice with Firth as Mr. Darcy in wet clothes after a swim in a lake was recognised as "one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history".[tpl]cite news |last=Gibbons |first=Fiachra |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/jun/02/broadcasting.guardianhayfestival2003 |title=Universally acknowledged hunk vetoed nude scene |work=The Guardian |date=2 June 2003 |accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth's approach to the part "lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes."

He had parts in light romantic period pieces such as Shakespeare in Love (1998), Relative Values (2000) and The Importance of Being Earnest (2002).
