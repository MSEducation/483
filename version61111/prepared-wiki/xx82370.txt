From age 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates.Nightline Playlist: Michael Bublé ABC News 11 October 2007.Bierly, Mandi. Six Things You Should Know About Michael Bublé Entertainment Weekly. Posted 4 May 2007. Published in issue No. 933; 11 May 2007. Bublé described his work experience as "The most deadly physical work I’ll ever know in my lifetime. We’d be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man."
His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at the age of 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà, a plumber originally from the small town of Preganziol, in the district of Treviso, who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson. Bublé's grandfather also paid for his singing lessons. One of his vocal instructors was Joseph Shore, the opera baritone. His maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Michael's grandmother was also Italian from Abruzzo, Italy. His original brush with entertainment was as a children's entertainer using the name Mickey Bubbles.http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Michael-Buble/biography/
Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. "My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock 'n' roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing."Bubling along nicely icLiverpool. 2 July 2004. Bublé never stopped believing that he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be "an opening act for somebody in Las Vegas".Smooth Operator. sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au. 8 October 2009.

At the age of 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won. But after winning, he was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich because he was underage. After that, Delich entered Bublé in the Canadian Youth Talent Search, which he won. Following that win, Bublé asked Delich to be his manager. Delich signed on and represented Bublé for the next seven not-so-fruitful years. According to Delich, Bublé would do every gig imaginable, including talent shows, conventions, cruise ships, malls, hotel lounges, bars, clubs, corporate gigs, musical revues, singing telegrams, and even the occasional singing Santa Claus gig.IMDb Biography/triviahttp://podcasts.magic.co.uk/magic/interviews/michael_buble_podcast_02.mp3
In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's "Death Game" (aka Mortal Challenge) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of The X-Files as a Submarine Sailor.IMDb Filmography
Bublé's first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson.
Beginning in 1997, Bublé also became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network.  During its first season the Vancouver-based program aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour.  When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer (Mark Fuller) often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute.  On one occasion, Bublé shared guest duties with fellow British Columbian Diana Krall, who was already a Grammy-nominated jazz musician.  According to Fuller, Krall was suitably impressed with Bublé's performance.  The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest.  In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.
Bublé received two Genie Award-nominations in 2000 for two songs he wrote for the film Here's to Life!

==Music career==

===2000–02: Musical beginnings===

Bublé's career breakthrough came in 2000 from a quite surprising chain of events. Michael McSweeney, an aide to former Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, saw Bublé's performance at a business party and received a copy of Bublé’s self-financed independent album.  McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife, and his cousin, Jim. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney's daughter, Caroline, where he sang Kurt Weill's "Mack the Knife". At the wedding Bublé was introduced to David Foster, a multi-Grammy Award-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as Madonna, Brandy Norwood, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, Kenny G., Cher, Josh Groban, and Andrea Bocelli.[tpl]cite web|author=Jeff Bateman |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002992 |title=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada: David Foster |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |accessdate=7 December 2010[/tpl]
Initially, Foster was reluctant to sign Bublé to his 143 Records label because he "didn’t know how to market this kind of music." Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production in the end under his label, with no assurances of support from Warner Brothers, and after Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster's friend, Paul Anka. After David Foster agreed to produce Bublé’s debut album, Bruce Allen, whom Bublé had pursued for years to be his manager, also signed Bublé.jazzyutopia.com. Michaelbuble.jazzyutopia.com.

Capitalizing on Bublé's newfound stardom, DRG Records basically ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover making it appear as if this was a proper Michael Bublé release. The slight misrepresentation was not lost on Bublé who has stated on his website that he did not want these songs released, but that it was out of his control.[tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael bublé|chart=all[/tpl] | publisher=Billboard | title=Discography – Michael Bublé | work=AllMusic [/tpl] His version of "Come Fly with Me" is used in Looney Tunes: Back in Action.''
