In 2018, humans and wizards live together in Tokyo.

At age seventeen, half-Japanese, half-Canadian Cecile Sudou, has just become the youngest wizard barrister after passing the bar exam at age fifteen, and begins work at the Butterfly Law Offices. While she hasn't realized it yet, she has tremendous magical potential.
