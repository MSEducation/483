A toucan crossing is a type of pedestrian crossing found in the United Kingdom that also allows bicycles to be ridden across.The Highway Code, Rule 80  Since two-can, both pedestrians and cyclists, cross together, the name toucan was chosen.
In the UK, toucan crossings are normally 4 metres (13 feet) wide, instead of the 2.8-metre (9 feet) width of a pelican crossing or puffin crossing. 
There are two types of Toucan crossing: on more recent ones a "green bicycle" is displayed next to the "green man" when cyclists and pedestrians are permitted to cross and a red bicycle and man are show at other times; older ones do not have a red bicycle – bicycles are permitted to cross at any time (if it is safe to do so).Cyclecraft, p199.
Unlike the pelican crossing, before the lights for vehicles go back to green, a steady red and amber are displayed instead of a flashing amber.
The pedestrian/cyclist signal lights may be on the near side of the crossing (like a puffin crossing), or on the opposite side of the road (like a pelican crossing).
A related crossing type pegasus crossing for horse riders.
