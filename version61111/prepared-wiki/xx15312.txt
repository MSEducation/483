A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. They are often referred to as twisters or cyclones,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyclone |title=merriam-webster.com |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl] although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low pressure circulation. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.  Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than [tpl]convert|110|mph|km/h|sigfig=3[/tpl], are about [tpl]convert|250|ft|0[/tpl] across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than [tpl]convert|300|mph|km/h|sigfig=3[/tpl], stretch more than [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|spell=in[/tpl] across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).[tpl]cite web|url=http://cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm|title=Doppler On Wheels|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Wurman, Joshua|publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research|date=2008-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/archive/hallam/hallam.php|title=Hallam Nebraska Tornado|accessdate=2009-11-15|work=National Weather Service| publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2005-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|accessdate=2006-09-08|author=Roger Edwards|date=2006-04-04|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[/tpl]
Various types of tornadoes include the landspout, multiple vortex tornado, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/15Jan2009/overview.shtml|title=15 January 2009: Lake Champlain Sea Smoke, Steam Devils, and Waterspout: Chapters IV and V|author=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-06-21|authorlink=National Weather Service[/tpl] Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes, though their action is dissimilar.
Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. However, the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|archivedate=2006-08-25|title=Tornado Alley, USA|accessdate=2006-09-20|author=Sid Perkins|date=2002-05-11|publisher=Science News|pages=296–298[/tpl] They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.
There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale.  An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/ECSS_Slide_Show/2004%20SPAIN%20ECSS%20Post-FINAL%20slide%20show.html|title=Wind Scales: Beaufort, T — Scale, and Fujita's Scale|author=Meaden, Terrance|publisher=Tornado and Storm Research Organisation|year=2004|accessdate=2009-09-11[/tpl] Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.[tpl]cite web|title=Enhanced F Scale for Tornado Damage|work=Storm Prediction Center|date=2007-02-01|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/ef-scale.html|accessdate=2009-06-21[/tpl] Edwards, Roger et al.

==Etymology==

The word tornado is an altered form of the Spanish word tronada, which means "thunderstorm". This in turn was taken from the Latin tonare, meaning "to thunder". It most likely reached its present form through a combination of the Spanish tronada and tornar ("to turn"); however, this may be a folk etymology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tornado|title=Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary| accessdate=2009-12-13|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tornado|author=Frederick C Mish|edition=10th|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|isbn=0-87779-709-9[/tpl] A tornado is also commonly referred to as a "twister", and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term cyclone.[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_faq.shtml| title =Frequently Asked Questions about Tornadoes | date =2009-07-20| publisher =National Severe Storms Laboratory[/tpl] The term "cyclone" is used as a synonym for "tornado" in the often-aired 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The term "twister" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 tornado-related film Twister.

==Definitions==

A tornado is "a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud".[tpl]cite book|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=t&p=34|title=Section:T|author=Glossary of Meteorology|edition=2|accessdate=2009-11-15|publisher=American Meteorological Society|year=2000[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.[tpl]cite web|author=Charles A Doswell III|url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/a_tornado/atornado.html|title=What is a tornado?|accessdate=2008-05-28|publisher=Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies|date=2001-10-01[/tpl]

===Funnel cloud===

A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually causes water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nilton O. Renno|title=A thermodynamically general theory for convective vortices|journal=Tellus A |volume=60|issue=4|pages=688–99|publisher=International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm|date=2008-07-03|url=http://vortexengine.ca/misc/Renno_2008.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0870.2008.00331.x|accessdate=2009-12-12|bibcode = 2008TellA..60..688R [/tpl]
There is some disagreement over the definition of funnel cloud and condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition.[tpl]cite book|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=funnel-cloud1|title=Funnel cloud|author=Glossary of Meteorology|edition=2|accessdate=2009-02-25|date=2000-06-30|publisher=American Meteorological Society[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Among many meteorologists, the funnel cloud term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.
Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes.  Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.

===Outbreaks and families===

Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession.  Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a "tornado family".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php#t|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather Terms for Storm Spotters|accessdate=2007-02-27|author=Michael Branick|year=2006|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030803230231/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php#t |archivedate=2003-08-03[/tpl]  Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term "tornado outbreak" has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/81933.pdf|title=Tornado Outbreak Day Sequences: Historic Events and Climatology (1875–2003)|accessdate=2007-03-20|author=Russell S Schneider, Harold E. Brooks, and Joseph T. Schaefer|year=2004|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Size and shape===

Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground.  Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.
Small, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a "stovepipe" tornado.  Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as "wedge tornadoes" or "wedges".  The "stovepipe" classification is also used for this type of tornado, if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground.  Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/binger.htm|title=Wedge Tornado|author=Roger Edwards|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2008-07-18|accessdate=2007-02-28[/tpl]
thumb|left|A rope tornado in its dissipating stage, Tecumseh, Oklahoma.Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be "roping out", or becoming a "rope tornado".  When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum.[tpl]cite journal|pages=57–58|journal=Bible of Weather Forecasting|volume=1|issue=4|title=27.0.0 General Laws Influencing the Creation of Bands of Strong Bands|author=Singer, Oscar|date=May–July 1985 |publisher=Singer Press[/tpl] Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/el_reno.htm|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2008-07-18|title=Rope Tornado|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Roger Edwards[/tpl]
In the United States, tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across on average and travel on the ground for [tpl]convert|5|mi|km[/tpl].  However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long.  On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004, was up to [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km[/tpl] wide at the ground.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/archive/hallam/hallam.php|title=Hallam Nebraska Tornado|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2009-11-15[/tpl]
In terms of path length, the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925, was on the ground continuously for [tpl]convert|219|mi|km[/tpl]. Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of [tpl]convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado.[tpl]cite book|author=Thomas P Grazulis|title=Significant Tornadoes 1680–1991|date=July 1993|publisher=The Tornado Project of Environmental Films|location=St. Johnsbury, VT|isbn=1-879362-03-1[/tpl] In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] further west than previously thought.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/ams/AMS%20VP/Storm%20Conference/NESC%20Presentations/32ndNESC_Presentation/Banquet/Doswell.ppt| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604203605/http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/ams/AMS+VP/Storm+Conference/NESC+Presentations/32ndNESC_Presentation/Banquet/Doswell.ppt|archivedate=2007-06-04|title=The Tri-State Tornado of 18 March 1925 Reanalysis Project|accessdate=2007-04-07|author= Dr. Charles A, III Doswell|format=Powerpoint Presentation[/tpl]

===Appearance===

Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form.  Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel.  Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white.  While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn very white or even blue.  Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris.  Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.
Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado.  A tornado which is "back-lit" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.[tpl]cite web|author=Tim Marshall|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/tttttttt.htm|title=The Tornado Project's Terrific, Timeless and Sometimes Trivial Truths about Those Terrifying Twirling Twisters!|accessdate=2008-11-09|publisher=The Tornado Project|date=2008-11-09[/tpl][tpl]cite video|people=Linda Mercer Lloyd|date=1996|title=Target: Tornado|medium=Videotape|publisher=The Weather Channel[/tpl]
Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/stormspotting/basics.php |work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|title=The Basics of Storm Spotting|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-11-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20031011045434/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/stormspotting/basics.php |archivedate = 2003-10-11[/tpl] making them visible.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=tornadoes+visible+location+within+updraft&q=tornadoes%20visible%20location%20within%20updraft|journal=Popular Science|title=Tornado Factory — Giant Simulator Probes Killer Twisters|volume=213|issue=1 |year=1978|accessdate=2009-11-17|page=77[/tpl] Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.
There is mounting evidence, including Doppler On Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc99/5_15_99/fob1.htm|title=Oklahoma Tornado Sets Wind Record|accessdate=2006-10-20|author=R.

===Rotation===

Tornadoes normally rotate cyclonically (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern).  While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers.  Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected.[tpl]cite journal|author=Robert Davies-Jones|authorlink=Robert Davies-Jones|title=Streamwise Vorticity: The Origin of Updraft Rotation in Supercell Storms|journal=J.

Approximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_9262.html|title=anticyclonic tornado in El Reno, OK|publisher=The Weather Channel|date=2006-04-26|accessdate=2006-12-30|author=Greg Forbes[/tpl] On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/StormChasing/Cases/Sunnyvale/Sunnyvale.html|title=Sunnyvale and Los Altos, CA Tornadoes 1998-05-04|accessdate=2006-10-20|author=John Monteverdi|date=2003-01-25[/tpl]

===Sound and seismology===

Tornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms.  Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar.  Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these.  Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature and propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.
The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies, as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds.  Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of "noise".[tpl]cite journal|author=Abdul Abdullah|title=The "Musical" Sound Emitted by a Tornado"|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=94|issue=4|pages=213–20|date=April 1966|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1966)0942.3.CO;2 |bibcode = 1966MWRv...94..213A [/tpl]
Since many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not reliable warning of a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.[tpl]cite journal|author=David K. Hoadley|title=Tornado Sound Experiences|journal=Stormtrack|volume=6|issue=3|pages=5–9|date=1983-03-31|url=http://www.stormtrack.org/archive/0636.htm[/tpl]
Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures.[tpl]cite journal|author=A. J. Bedard|title=Low-Frequency Atmospheric Acoustic Energy Associated with Vortices Produced by Thunderstorms|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=133|issue=1|pages=241–63|date=January 2005|doi=10.1175/MWR-2851.1|bibcode = 2005MWRv..133..241B [/tpl]
Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation.  Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.[tpl]cite journal|author=Frank Tatom, Kevin R. Knupp, and Stanley J. Vitto|title=Tornado Detection Based on Seismic Signal|journal=J. Appl. Meteorol.|volume=34|issue=2|pages=572–82|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1995)0342.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1995JApMe..34..572T|year=1995 [/tpl]

===Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects===

Tornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected.[tpl]cite journal|author=John R Leeman, E.D. Schmitter|title=Electric signals generated by tornados|journal=Atmos. Res.|volume=92|issue=2|pages=277–9|date=April 2009|doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2008.10.029[/tpl][tpl]cite conference |author=Timothy M.

Severe Local Storms|publisher=American Meteorological Society|date=October 2004|location=Hyannis, MA|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/11aram22sls/techprogram/paper_81153.htm[/tpl] There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado reaches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado lifts. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges.[tpl]cite journal|author=Antony H Perez, Louis J. Wicker, and Richard E. Orville|title=Characteristics of Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Associated with Violent Tornadoes|journal=Wea. Forecast.|volume=12|issue=3|pages=428–37|doi=10.1175/1520-0434(1997)0122.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1997WtFor..12..428P|year=1997 [/tpl] Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.
Luminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.[tpl]cite conference|author=Julian J. Lee, Timothy P. Samaras, Carl R.

==Life cycle==

===Supercell relationship===

Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1–6 miles (2–10 km) across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.
Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.

===Formation===

As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. This convergence of warm air in the updraft, and this cool air, causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to siphon air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.

===Maturity===

Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the "mature stage". This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.

===Dissipation===

As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the "dissipating stage", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, like the ice skater who pulls her arms in to spin faster, winds can increase at this point.
As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop cyclically. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.
Although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2003)0602.0.CO;2|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0469%282003%29060%3C0795:TRFTTO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Tornadogenesis Resulting from the Transport of Circulation by a Downdraft: Idealized Numerical Simulations|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Markowski, Straka, and Rasmussen|date=2002-10-14|journal=J. Atmos. Sci. | volume= 60 |issue= 6|year=2003|page=28|bibcode = 2003JAtS...60..795M [/tpl]

==Types==

===Multiple vortex===

A multiple-vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf|title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide|accessdate=2006-09-20|author=Doswell, Moller, Anderson et al.|year=2005|publisher = US Department of Commerce |format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] This is a distinct phenomenon from a satellite tornado, which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "orbit" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.

===Waterspout===

A waterspout is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish "fair weather" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly.  They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea.[tpl]cite  news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/0504tornb.htm|title=Tornado Chase 2000|accessdate=2007-05-19|author=Dave Zittel|date=2000-05-04|newspaper=USA Today[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspouts.htm|title=Waterspouts are tornadoes over water|date=2007-11-01|accessdate=2007-05-19|author=Joseph Golden|newspaper=USA Today[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Thomas P. Grazulis, Dan Flores|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman OK|year=2003|page=256|isbn=0-8061-3538-7[/tpl] In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water.  They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/?n=waterspouts|title=About Waterspouts|accessdate=2009-12-13|date=2007-01-04|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[/tpl] In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.[tpl]cite web|url=http://essl.org/cgi-bin/eswd/eswd.cgi?action=showdefinitions&lang=en_0|title=European Severe Weather Database definitions|author=No author given|date=2012-01-02[/tpl]

===Landspout===

A landspout, or dust-tube tornado, is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a "fair weather waterspout on land". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.

===Similar circulations===

====Gustnado====

A gustnado, or gust front tornado, is a small, vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a "rolling" effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado.[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=gustnado1|title=Gustnado|accessdate=2006-09-20|publisher=American Meteorological Society|work=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.

====Dust devil====

A dust devil resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds.  However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage in arid areas.[tpl]cite book|author=Walter A Lyons|title=The Handy Weather Answer Book|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Visible Ink press|location =Detroit, Michigan|isbn=0-7876-1034-8|pages=175–200|chapter=Tornadoes[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ssd/techmemo/sr207.htm|title=Severe Weather Climatology for New Mexico|accessdate=2006-09-29|author =Charles H Jones, Charlie A. Liles|year=1999[/tpl]

====Fire whirls and steam devils====

Small-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source.  Those that occur near intense wildfires are called fire whirls. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above.  Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage. A steam devil is a rotating updraft that involves steam or smoke. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.

==Intensity and damage==

The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyrvy2Nr|title=Goshen County Tornado Given Official Rating of EF2|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2009-11-21[/tpl][tpl]cite conference|author=David C Lewellen, M I Zimmerman|date=2008-10-28|title=Using Simulated Tornado Surface Marks to Decipher Near-Ground Winds|conference=24th Conf.

Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434%282004%29019%3C0310%3AOTROTP%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=On the Relationship of Tornado Path Length and Width to Intensity|author=Harold E Brooks|date=2004|journal=Wea.

In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/basicspot.pdf|title=Basic Spotters’ Field Guide|accessdate=2006-11-01|author=Edwards, Moller, Purpura et al.|date=1998-03-31|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.essl.org/people/dotzek/pdf/ecss02p.pdf|title=Statistical modeling of tornado intensity distributions|accessdate=2007-04-06|author=Dotzek, Nikolai, Jürgen Grieser, Harold E.

==Climatology==

The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nikolai Dotzek|date=2003-03-20|title=An updated estimate of tornado occurrence in Europe | journal=Atmos.

North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong,[tpl]cite web|author=Huaqing Cai|title=Dryline cross section|date=2001-09-24|accessdate=2009-12-13|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~caihq/pic/fig23.html|publisher=University of California Los Angeles[/tpl] while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/air/summersevere/ae00s02.en.html|title=Tornadoes|work=Prairie Storm Prediction Centre|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2009-12-13[/tpl] Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.
The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km2), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km2), per year),[tpl]cite journal|author=J Holden, A Wright|title=UK tornado climatology and the development of simple prediction tools|journal=Q.

===Associations with climate and climate change===

Associations with various climate and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.[tpl]cite conference|author=Roger Edwards, Steven J.

Severe Local Storms|publisher=American Meteorological Society|date=1996-02-23|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/edwards/sstsvr.htm[/tpl]
Some evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña.[tpl]cite conference|author=Ashton Robinson Cook, Joseph T. Schaefer|title=The Relation of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to Winter Tornado Outbreaks|booktitle=19th Conf.

Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes.  Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity,[tpl]cite journal|author=Robert J Trapp, NS Diffenbaugh, HE Brooks, ME Baldwin, ED Robinson, and JS Pal|title=Changes in severe thunderstorm environment frequency during the 21st century caused by anthropogenically enhanced global radiative forcing|journal=Proc.

==Detection==

Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes.[tpl]cite web|year=2008|title=The First Tornadic Hook Echo Weather Radar Observations|publisher=Colorado State University|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/CHILL_history#The_First_Tornadic_Hook_Echo_Weather_Radar_Observations|accessdate=2008-01-30[/tpl] By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.[tpl]cite journal|author=Paul M. Markowski|authorlink=Paul Markowski|title=Hook Echoes and Rear-Flank Downdrafts: A Review|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=130 |issue=4|pages=852–76|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(2002)1302.0.CO;2|year=April 2002|bibcode = 2002MWRv..130..852M [/tpl]

===Radar===

Today, most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which remains the main method of detecting signatures probably associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/163.pdf|title=Flight Briefing Notes: Adverse Weather Operations Optimum Use of Weather Radar|page=2|author=Airbus|publisher=SKYbrary|date=2007-03-14|accessdate=2009-11-19 |format=PDF|authorlink=Airbus[/tpl] Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Also, most populated areas on Earth are now visible from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), which aid in the nowcasting of tornadic storms.

===Storm spotting===

In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.
Usually spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and forward the report to the NWS.[tpl]cite journal|author=Charles A. Doswell, III, Alan R.

Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_detecting.html|title=Detecting Tornadoes: What Does a Tornado Look Like?|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2006-11-15|accessdate=2009-12-13|authorlink=National Severe Storms Laboratory[/tpl] Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stormeyes.org/tornado/verf/|title=Proposals For Changes in Severe Local Storm Warnings, Warning Criteria and Verification|year=2003|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Roger and Elke Edwards[/tpl] The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.

===Visual evidence===

Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/basicspot.pdf|title=Basic Spotters’ Field Guide|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|format=PDF|date=1998-03-31|accessdate=2006-11-01[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a "beaver tail", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf|title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2009-12-13|date=2003-01-03|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.[tpl]cite web |title=Questions and Answers about Tornadoes|work=A Severe Weather Primer|publisher=National Severe Storms Laboratory|date=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|accessdate=2007-07-05[/tpl]

==Extremes==

The most record-breaking tornado in recorded history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/damage/tdam1.html|title=Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890–1999|journal=Wea. Forecast.|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Harold E Brooks, Charles A. Doswell III|date=2000-10-01|authorlink=Harold E. Brooks[/tpl]
The deadliest tornado in world history was the Daultipur-Salturia Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1300 people. Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history kill more than 100 people, almost half of the total in the rest of the world.
The most extensive tornado outbreak on record was the Super Outbreak, which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern Ontario in Canada on April 3 and 4, 1974. This outbreak, which saw 148 tornadoes develop in 18 hours, included six of F5 intensity and twenty-four that peaked at F4 strength. Sixteen tornadoes were on the ground at the same time during its peak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/1999/april/TornOut.pdf|title=Tornado Outbreak of April 3–4, 1974; Synoptic Analysis|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Lee R Hoxit, Charles F Chappell|date=1975-11-01|format=PDF|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[/tpl]
While direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people.Anatomy of May 3's F5 tornado, The Oklahoman Newspaper, May 1, 2009 Though the reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes.
Storms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding [tpl]convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance.

==Safety==

Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued.  When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/safety.html|title=Tornado Safety|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2009-11-17|author=Roger Edwards|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[/tpl] In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |title=Storm Shelters|accessdate=2009-12-13|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2002-08-26|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060223072127/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |archivedate = 2006-02-23[/tpl]
Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.

==Myths and misconceptions==

[tpl]Main|Tornado myths[/tpl][tpl]See also|List of common misconceptions[/tpl]
Folklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Knight |first=Meredith |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming |title=Fact or Fiction?: If the Sky Is Green, Run for Cover—A Tornado Is Coming |journal=Scientific American |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl] It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.[tpl]cite book|author=Thomas P Grazulis|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3258-2|chapter=Tornado Myths[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/myths/myths.htm|title=Myths and Misconceptions about Tornadoes|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Tim Marshall|publisher=The Tornado Project|date=2005-03-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew and several other people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by.[tpl]cite web|last=National Weather Service Forecast Office, Dodge City, Kansas|title=Overpasses and Tornado Safety: Not a Good Mix|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ddc/?n=over|work=Tornado Overpass Information|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl] However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado: the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadosafety.html |title=Tornado Myths, Facts, and Safety|publisher=National Climatic Data Center |date=2006-08-17|author=Climate Services and Monitoring Division|accessdate=2012-03-27[/tpl] Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/basics/tornado-underpass.htm|title=Overpasses are tornado death traps|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Chris Cappella|date=2005-05-17|newspaper=USA Today[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=safety-overpass |title=Highway Overpasses as Tornado Shelters|accessdate=2007-02-28|date=2000-03-01|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20000616093920/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/papers/overpass.html |archivedate = 2000-06-16[/tpl]
An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.
Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces.[tpl]cite web|title=Tornado Myths & Tornado Reality|url=http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/nebraska/tornado-myths.html|author=Kenneth F Dewey|publisher=High Plains Regional Climate Center and University of Nebraska–Lincoln|date=2002-07-11|accessdate=2009-11-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611013128/http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/nebraska/tornado-myths.html |archivedate = June 11, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/RockwellPassTornado/index.html|title=Tornado, Rockwell Pass, Sequoia National Park, 2004-07-07|author=John Monteverdi, Roger Edwards, Greg Stumpf, Daniel Gudgel|date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl] affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.

==Ongoing research==

Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/noaastory/book.html|title=VORTEX: Unraveling the Secrets|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2006-10-30|authorlink=National Severe Storms Laboratory[/tpl] Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones,[tpl]cite book|title=Extreme Weather|author=Michael H Mogil|year=2007|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publisher|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57912-743-5|pages=210–211[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Mesocyclone Climatology Project|publisher=University of Oklahoma|author=Kevin McGrath|date=1998-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-19|url=http://mesocyclone.ou.edu/[/tpl] and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell (or other respective formative processes) to tornadogenesis and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.
Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.[tpl]Cite book |last = Seymour |first = Simon |title = Tornadoes |publisher = HarperCollins |year= 2001 |location = New York City |page = 32 | isbn = 978-0-06-443791-2[/tpl]
In particular, the role of downdrafts, particularly the rear-flank downdraft, and the role of baroclinic boundaries, are intense areas of study.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=intense+tornadoes+without+a+mesocyclone&q=intense%20tornadoes%20without%20a%20mesocyclone|title=The tornado: nature's ultimate windstorm|author=Thomas P.

Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with mesovortices within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.[tpl]cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik N.

Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/naturalevents/tornadoes.html|title=Tornadoes|date=2009-09-30|accessdate=2009-11-20|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency[/tpl] Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions.

Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=intense+tornadoes+without+a+mesocyclone&q=intense%20tornadoes%20without%20a%20mesocyclone|title=The tornado: nature's ultimate windstorm|author=Grazulis, Thomas P.|pages=65–69|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8061-3258-7|accessdate=2009-11-20[/tpl]
