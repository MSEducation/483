==History of American Bibliographies==

Charles Evans(1850-1935), supported by a myriad people, wrote the first book on the history of printing and books, from Colonial times to the Federal Era, entitled American Bibliography.[tpl]cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in Bibliographical Civics|journal=Libraries & Culture|year=2005|volume=3|page=239[/tpl] Almost 50 years following Evans, Ralph Shaw (1902–72) and Richard Shoemaker (1907–70) began to catalogue  where Evan left off.
This began a regional catalogue that evolved into a national catalogue called the National Union catalogue.[tpl]cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in bibliographical civics|journal=Libraries & Culture|date=Summer 2005|volume=40|issue=3|pages=239–50[/tpl]
