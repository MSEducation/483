Norbert Haupert (born 2 April 1940 in Schifflange) is a retired Luxembourgish athlete and currently a politician, sitting in the Chamber of Deputies for the Christian Social People's Party.  Like Josy Barthel before him, Haupert spanned the divide between sport and politics by heading the Luxembourg Athletics Federation and the Luxembourgian Olympic and Sporting Committee.
As an athlete, he ran middle distance, dominating Luxembourgian middle distance running in the early 1960s and twice doubling up to win both the 800 metres and 1500 metres at the Luxembourgian national championships.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/nc/lux.htm |first=Georges |last=Klepper |title=Luxembourgish Championships |accessdate=2007-08-03 |date= |publisher=Athletics Weekly [/tpl]  He also won the bronze medal at the 800 metres at the 1963 World Student Games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/wsgm.htm |title=World Student Games (Universiade - Men) |accessdate=2007-08-03 |date= |publisher=Athletics Weekly [/tpl]
