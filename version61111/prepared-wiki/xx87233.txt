The UK Singles Chart is a weekly record chart based on single sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom; [tpl]As of|2014|4|28|lc=y[/tpl], 1259 singles have reached number one. The chart was founded in 1952 by Percy Dickins of New Musical Express (NME), who telephoned 20 record stores to ask what their top 10 highest-selling singles were. Dickins aggregated the results into a top 12 hit parade, which was topped by "Here in My Heart" by Al Martino. NME[tpl]'[/tpl]s chart was published each week in its eponymous magazine.
The calendar year that has featured the most UK number ones is 2000, which featured 43 singles reaching the top spot; the year with the fewest number ones is 1954, with 11 songs topping the chart, just ahead of 1992, with 12. The act that has achieved the most number ones is American entertainer Elvis Presley, who has topped the chart 21 times – Presley's second number one, "Jailhouse Rock" was the first single ever to debut at the top of the chart.[tpl]Cite journal|last=|first=|editor1-first=|editor1-last=|date=29 January 2005|title=Return of the king|journal=Music Week|issue=29.01.05|page=|publisher=CMP|location=London|issn=0265-1548|oclc=60620772|url=http://business.highbeam.com/411456/article-1G1-128204894/return-king|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] The most successful band are The Beatles, who have achieved 17 number ones on the chart.

In 2000, when turnover of number ones was high, tracks could often sell between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in a single week. By May 2007, a single needed to sell just 20,000 copies in order to reach number one.[tpl]Cite news|title=Asda axes the CD single as pop fans hit the download button|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-457032/Asda-axes-CD-single-pop-fans-hit-download-button.html|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Associated Newspapers|location=London|date=23 May 2007|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] UK chart commentator James Masterton remarked in 2003: "When record sales are high, public interest in a song expires very quickly and this creates a need for ever more new product to take its place."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dotmusic.com/charts/commentary/content.asp|title=dotmusic.com – Chart Commentary|first=James|last=Masterton|authorlink=James_Masterton|date=31 March 2003|publisher=dotmusic|location=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030401094446/http://www.dotmusic.com/charts/commentary/content.asp|archivedate=1 April 2003|deadurl=yes|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] Sales improved in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and by 2013 were regularly selling over 100,000 copies weekly again.
