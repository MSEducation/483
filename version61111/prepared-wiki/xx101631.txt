[[Demarcation dispute]]

CATEGORIES: Labor

A demarcation dispute occurs when two labour unions claim the right to represent the same class or group of workers.  This is particularly important in compulsory arbitration systems of industrial relations, as in Australia; where only one union may be the registered representative of a particular type of worker.
