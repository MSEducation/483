The Honda NS500 is a 500cc Grand Prix racing motorcycle of the early 1980s, powered by a two-stroke V3 engine. Created as a replacement for the innovative but unsuccessful four-stroke NR500, the bike went against Honda's preference for four-stroke machines but proved very effective and quickly won the 1983 500cc World Championship with Freddie Spencer on board.[tpl]cite book| last = Young| first = Roger| title = American MotorcyclistVol. 51, No. 8| url = http://books.google.com/?id=KfYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34| year = 1997| publisher = American Motorcyclist| page = 34| issn = 0277-9358 [/tpl] Spencer was able to use the lower weight and superior handling of the NS500 to achieve higher cornering speeds, and getting on the power earlier leaving corners.[tpl]cite book| last = Walker| first = Mick| title = Mick Walker's Japanese Grand Prix Racing Motorcycles| year = 2002| publisher = Redline Books| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 9780953131181| pages = 220 [/tpl]
