==Overview==

The cover artwork is from an anti-fascist, World War II-era poster designed by the artist John Heartfield for the Communist Party of Germany, which was contemporary with and directly against the Third Reich. The text on the original poster is: "5 fingers has a hand! With these 5 grab the enemy!" This slogan inspired part of the text contained on the back of the System of a Down album: "The hand has five fingers, capable and powerful, with the ability to destroy as well as create". Later, it is written in bold letters: "Open your eyes, open your mouths, close your hands and make a fist". (used later by Serj Tankian in the song "Uneducated Democracy")

==Reception==

Q magazine (10/01, p.Â 152) - 4 stars out of 5 - "This remains an excellent starting point for this most curious bands".
The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

==Footnotes==

Before some of the lyrics in the booklet for the album, footnotes appear.
 "Your thoughts, and dreams are no longer sacred, as they are exposed to a
weapon known as remote viewing and monitoring." 
 "For those that control the central nervous system,
control society, and the world." 
 "We first fought the heathens in the name of religion, then Communism, and now in
the name of drugs and terrorism. Our excuses for global domination always change." 
 "Mind control technology has been used by the CIA since the 1950s as part of
their non-lethal, covert weapons program." 
 "The February 18 edition of Britain's NEW SCIENTIST Magazine reports that the
Geneva-based World Health Organization suppressed, under political pressure,
a report which confirmed that marijuana is safer than either alcohol or tobacco." 
 "Why do old societies hold the pantheon of 12 gods to be true,
while modern societies generally have one God?" 
 "System of a Down would like to dedicate this song to the memory of the 1.5
million victims of the Armenian Genocide, perpetrated by the Turkish
Government in 1915." 

==Booklet message==

In the booklet, underneath the band member's photos, the text reads in all capitals:
"Announce your anthems on the ceiling. We dance, annexed by power. Casual neckties embrace, the hungry hunger further, images rule through the media, commercial Orwellianism, producing unveiled icebergs, running transparent electrical cables, curving string ensembles, witnessed by hangings from flagpoles of souls avenged by Dr. Clock. Fresh paint, naked melting figures mixing the revolution against T.V. sentencing, at the hands of brutal men and their military business world. 'Let us instigate the revolt, down with the system!'" This message was also found in some of the Toxicity booklets.
