Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America is a non-fiction book by Dan Savage, first published in 2002 by Dutton. The book examines the concept of happiness in American culture, as obtained by indulging in each of the Seven Deadly Sins.
Skipping Towards Gomorrah was selected for inclusion in The Best American Sex Writing 2004, and won a Lambda Literary Award in 2003. The book received a favorable reception from reviews in Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Kirkus Reviews. A review in Flagpole Magazine was critical of the book's organization, and observed that the writing wandered a bit, while a review in Gay Today commented, "Those who agree with Savage's views will like his book while those who disagree will hate it; in either case there will be no converts."

The book's title is a reference to Robert Bork's 1996 book, Slouching Towards Gomorrah (itself a reference to Yeats's poem The Second Coming), in which Bork decried what he saw as modern moral corruption caused by liberalism, especially social liberalism.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://gaybookreviews.info/review/3345/824|accessdate=May 25, 2011|publisher=gaybookreviews.info|journal=Gay Today|title=Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America|first=Jesse|last=Monteagudo|volume=VI|issue=214[/tpl] alternate link Skipping Towards Gomorrah examines the concept of happiness in American culture, as obtained by indulging in each of the Seven Deadly Sins.[tpl]cite book|title=Library in a Book: Gay Rights|last=Kranz|first=Rachel|coauthors=Tim Cusick|year=2005|page=218|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0-8160-5810-5[/tpl] In each chapter, Savage explores a different subculture in an attempt to understand how its participants gain happiness, and contrasts this with religious conservatism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2005/09/30/savage/|publisher=www.salon.com|work=Salon|title=Being told we can't is making a lot of homos wanna|date=September 30, 2005|last=Bayard|first=Louis|accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl] Regarding his experience of gambling, Savage notes, "You know the only thing worse than losing big the first time you go into a casino?

At least one of these pieces will undoubtedly land in an anthology for future students of the essay." The review concluded, "The explicit nature of this book will make it a difficult purchase for many libraries in the age of Ashcroft, but the justifying argument should be made that any library owning Bork's book needs this one as an antidote."[tpl]cite journal|journal=Library Journal|title=Book Review: Skipping Towards Gomorrah|year=2002|first=David (University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia)|last= Azzolina|publisher=Reed Business Information, Inc.[/tpl] Kirkus Reviews wrote, "Common sense is Savage’s strong suit, and he makes more of it than a preening moralist ever could."[tpl]cite journal|journal=Kirkus Reviews|title=Book Review: Skipping Towards Gomorrah|date=October 1, 2002|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/dan-savage/skipping-towards-gomorrah/#review|publisher=www.kirkusreviews.com|accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl] Kelly Darrah of The Gonzaga Bulletin noted, "'Skipping' does a powerful job of taking a raw look at the embarrassing facets of our society that we often will ourselves not to see.

A review by Flagpole Magazine writer Jyl Inov concluded, "This book wanders. It talks more about some sins than others and often takes a long time to get to a particular point. But in the end, it is wildly amusing and makes a lot of sense. Skipping Towards Gomorrah is not going to make converts of conservatives, but if they are willing to read, it just might make them think. As for everybody else, it is reaffirming and potentially motivating."[tpl]cite news|work=Flagpole Magazine|first=Jyl|last=Inov|url=http://flagpole.com/Weekly/Features/DanSavageForPresident.8Jan03|accessdate=May 26, 2011|publisher=flagpole.com|title=Dan Savage For President|date=January 8, 2003[/tpl] In his book Reordered Love, Reordered Lives: Learning the Deep Meaning of Happiness, author David K. Naugle commented, "This book is an irreverent attack on the 'virtuecrats' who hypocritically impose their moral values on others." Writing in a review for Gay Today, Jesse Monteagudo observed, "Those who agree with Savage's views will like his book while those who disagree will hate it; in either case there will be no converts. Still, in a literary genre dominated by the Borks and Bennetts it is good to hear a dissenting voice. Reading Skipping Towards Gomorrah reminds us that there is still some sanity left in this world." Rebecca Flint of Entertainment Weekly wrote, "Skipping follows the writer as he tackles each of the seven deadlies, hanging out with everyone from gamblers to adulterers to the filthy rich. Lacing his anecdotes with persuasive arguments for the freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness in all its sinful forms, he takes readers on a journey that's as insightful as it is hilarious."[tpl]cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Flint|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384103,00.html|publisher=www.ew.com|accessdate=May 26, 2011|date=November 1, 2002|title=Book Review: Skipping Towards Gomorrah[/tpl]
