[[Manganese(II) oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Manganese compounds, Oxides

Manganese(II) oxide (systematically named manganese(2+) oxide(2−)) is an inorganic compound with chemical formula MnO.Arno H. Reidies "Manganese Compounds" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2007; Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_123[/tpl] It forms green crystals and is odorless. Manganese(II) oxide is the simplest ionic manganese oxide. Although it is classified as a very strong base, dissolved manganese(II) oxide is non-corrosive and does not attack the skin.

==Chemical properties==

===Basicity===

The oxide anion (O2−) in ionic manganese oxides such as manganese(II) oxide can assimilate a proton by recombination:
Because of this capture of a proton (H+), manganese(II) oxide has basic character. In aqueous solution, it has a pKb value of ~−38. Oxide's conjugate acid is hydroxide (OH−). A saturated solution has a near neutral pOH, indicating that most oxide ions are associated.

===Structure===

MnO has the NaCl, rock salt structure, where cations and anions are both octahedrally coordinated. The composition of MnO can vary from MnO to MnO1.045.
 Below 118 K MnO is antiferromagnetic. MnO has the distinction of being one of the first compoundsJ.E Greedon, (1994), Magnetic oxides in  Encyclopedia of Inorganic chemistry Ed. R. Bruce King,  John Wiley & Sons ISBN 0-471-93620-0 to have its magnetic structure determined by neutron diffraction in 1951.Neutron Diffraction by Paramagnetic and Antiferromagnetic Substances C. G. Shull, W. A. Strauser, and E. O. Wollan, Phys. Rev. 83, 333 - 345 (1951), [tpl]doi|10.1103/PhysRev.83.333[/tpl] This study  showed that the Mn2+ ions form a face centered cubic magnetic sub-lattice where there are ferromagnetically coupled sheets which are anti-parallel with adjacent sheets.

===Chemical reactions===

Manganese(II) oxide undergoes the typical chemical reactions of an ionic manganese oxide. Upon treatment with a standard acid, it converts to a manganese(II) salt and water. Oxidation of manganese(II) oxide gives manganese dioxide.

==Preparation and occurrence==

MnO can be prepared by the reduction of any higher oxide with hydrogen[tpl]greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] e.g.:
Commercially it is prepared by reduction of MnO2 with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or methane:
MnO can also be prepared by heating MnCO3:W.H. McCarroll (1994) Oxides- solid sate chemistry,  Encyclopedia of Inorganic chemistry Ed. R. Bruce King,  John Wiley & Sons ISBN 0-471-93620-0
This calcining process is conducted anaerobically to prevent formation of Mn2O3.
MnO occurs in nature as the rare mineral manganosite.

==Applications==

Together with manganese sulfate, MnO is a component of fertilizer and food additives.  Many thousands of tons are consumed annually for this purpose.
Other uses include: a catalyst in the manufacture of allyl alcohol, ceramics, paints, colored glass, bleaching tallow and textile printing.
