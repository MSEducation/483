[[Spaceship (cellular automaton)]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular automaton patterns

In a cellular automaton, a finite pattern is called a spaceship if it reappears after a certain number of generations in the same orientation but in a different position. The smallest such number of generations is called the period of the spaceship.
This notation can be readily generalised to cellular automata with dimensionality other than two.
A tagalong is a pattern that is not a spaceship in itself but that can be attached to the back of a spaceship to form a larger spaceship. Similarly, a pushalong is placed at the front.
A pattern that, when a spaceship is input, outputs a copy of the spaceship travelling in a different direction is called a reflector.
Spaceships are important because they can sometimes be modified to produce puffers. Spaceships can also be used to transmit information. For example, in Conway's Game of Life, the ability of the glider (Life's simplest spaceship) to transmit information is part of a proof that Life is Turing-complete.
