CATEGORIES: Dragons, National symbols of Bhutan

The Druk ([tpl]lang-dz|འབྲུག་[/tpl]) is the "Thunder Dragon" of Bhutanese mythology and a Bhutanese national symbol. A druk appears on the Bhutanese flag, holding jewels to represent wealth. In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is called Druk Yul, or Land of Druk, and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, Dragon Kings. During the Bhutanese mock election in 2007, all four mock parties were called the Druk colour Party.Every party had a separate colour representing its values. The national anthem of Bhutan, Druk tsendhen, translates into English as "The Kingdom of Druk".
The druk (also known as a "duk" or "dug") was adopted as an emblem by the Dugpa sect, which originated in Tibet and spread to Bhutan.  According to traditional accounts, when the sect's founder, the Lama Chodje Tsangpa Gyarespa, began to build the Ralung monastery, there was a violent storm.  Thunder, or the "Cloud-Voice," is seen as the roar of the dragon.[tpl]cite book|last=Waddell|first=Laurence|title=The Buddhism of Tibet Or Lamaism|year=1895|pages=199|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7PYwcfE_bLUC&pg=PA199&dq=Bhutan+thunder+dug&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A2zEUpeyKcrEoASe5YCwBw&ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Bhutan%20thunder%20dug&f=false[/tpl]  Deciding that this was an omen, he named the monastery Dug-Ralung, adding the word "thunder dragon" to the name.
