[[The Lost Album (Skyhooks album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 albums, Skyhooks albums

"The Lost Album" is the result of 1990â€“1994 recording sessions, involving their classic lineup of the early-to-mid 1970's, of Australian glam rock band Skyhooks, released in 1999. Only three tracks had been released earlier, "Jukebox in Siberia" in 1990, "Tall Timber" in 1990 and "Happy Hippy Hut" in 1994. All were released as singles, with the former two also a part of the Latest and Greatest compilation in 1990.
Skyhooks made these latter recordings with a new album in mind, what might have been their first studio album in 14 years, but, for their own reasons, they chose not to go ahead with the album and a "possible" tour. So, Skyhooks' "The Lost Album" remained in Mushroom's vaults, until 1999, when Skyhooks released "The Collection", a two disc set in which the first disc comprised 19 "Best of" tracks from their five 1970's albums, and the second disc was "The Lost Album".
