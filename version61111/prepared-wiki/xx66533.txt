Pasteurellosis is an infection with a species of the bacteria genus Pasteurella,[tpl]cite book | author = Kuhnert P; Christensen H (editors). | title = Pasteurellaceae: Biology, Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/past | id = ISBN 978-1-904455-34-9 [/tpl] which is found in humans and animals.

Mannheimia spp. were classified as Pasteurella spp., and infections by organisms now called Mannheimia spp., as well as by organisms now called Pasteurella spp., were designated as pasteurellosis.  The term "pasteurellosis" is often still applied to mannheimiosis, although such usage has declined.)  
Pasteurella multocida (P. septica) is carried in mouth and respiratory tract of several animals, notably cats. It is a small Gram negative bacillus with bipolar staining by Wayson stain. In animals it can originate fulminant septicaemia (chicken cholera), but is also a common commensal.
Pasteurellosis in humans is associated with a close animal contact, and may be transmitted by cat or dog bite.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

==Types==

There are several forms of the infection:
Other locations are possible, such as septic arthritis, meningitis and acute endocarditis, but are very rare.

==Pasteurellosis in animals==

P. multocida causes numerous pathological conditions in domestic animals. It often acts together with other infectious agents, like Chlamydiae, Mycoplasmae and viruses. Environmental conditions (transportation, housing deficiency, and bad weather) also play a role.
The following diseases are considered caused by P. multocida, alone or associated to other pathogens:

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made with isolation of Pasteurella multocida in a normally sterile site ( blood, pus or CSF).

==Treatment==

As the infection is usually transmitted into humans through animal bites, antibiotics usually treat the infection, but medical attention should be sought if the wound is severely swelling. Pasteurellosis is usually treated with high dose penicillin if severe. Either tetracycline or chloramphenicol provides an alternative in beta-lactam intolerant patients. Most importantly, treat the wound.
