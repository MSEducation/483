==History==

Kath was born to Italian parents in Toronto, Ontario. Prior to Crystal Castles, Kath played different instruments in many bands. As a teenager he played drums in Jakarta, an anarchist-punk band. Later he played bass in a garage-metal band called Kill Cheerleader. He was also in a 2-piece folk band which ended in tragedy with the death of his friend and band mate, Pino Placentile. All 3 Crystal Castles albums are dedicated to Pino Placentile. 
Crystal Castles are known for the elusiveness of their off-stage lives and identities. Kath is routinely photographed wearing hoodies which obscure some or all of his face and has gone by a number of different aliases, creating confusion over his real name. His name is adapted from a nickname Alice Glass gave him, "Ethan Catheter". He had asked Glass to name him after "the most uncomfortable thing ever."
