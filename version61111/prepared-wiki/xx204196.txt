==Plot==

Simbhu is elected college chairman after he beats Charmi, the daughter of Ravishankar(Radharavi), a minister. Predictably, the two soon fall for each other though they never directly reveal it. But when Ravishankar comes to know of the love affair, he is staunchly against it, and is willing to go any distance to make sure that it never succeeds. At home, Simbu's father(Prakashraj) mentally tortures his wife(Seetha) since he suspects her of having an affair with her ex-lover. Outside home, Simbhu is helped by Vakil Dada (T.Rajendar), a lawyer who makes sure justice is served, whatever the means.
The movie deals with the oldest of stories - the poor boy-rich girl love story - and makes no attempts to treat it in a different way or in an interesting manner. It follows the typical sequence of events in such stories. We have the initial enmity between Simbhu and Charmi, the gradual thawing of the icy relationship between the two, the idiot suitor who Charmi's parents want her to marry, her family's horror on finding out about her romance, their attempts to kill it and of course, the lovers' strong refusal to give up their love against all the opposition. There is no deviation from this at any point and as a result, we can predict with great accuracy, what would happen next in the story. In the end Charmi is married to simbhu.
