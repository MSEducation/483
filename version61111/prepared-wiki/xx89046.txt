General elections were held in Venezuela on 30 July 2000, the first under the country's newly adopted 1999 constitution.
Incumbent President Hugo Ch치vez ran for election for a full 6 year term under the new Constitution. He was challenged by a former ally of his, Zulia Governor Francisco Arias C치rdenas. Ch치vez easily won the election with almost 60% of the popular vote, increasing his vote share over the previous elections, and managing to carry a larger number of states. Arias C치rdenas only managed to narrowly carry his home state of Zulia.
On 8 June 2004 it was announced that the results of the presidential elections would be put to a recall referendum on 15 August.
