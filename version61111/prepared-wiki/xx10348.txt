Raëlism (also Raelianism or the Raëlian Movement) is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Raël. It is numerically the world's largest UFO religion.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] An adherent of Raëlism is a Raëlian.
The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods. Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and othersNickerson, Colin, CANADIAN CULT SAYS FIRST HUMAN CLONE IS NEAR BIRTH, Boston Globe. 20 December 2002.

(highlight) The founder of Raëlism, members claim, received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.
The Raëlian Church has a quasi-clerical structure of seven levels. Joining the movement requires an official apostasy from other religions.
Raelian ethics include striving for world peace, sharing, democracy and nonviolence.Susan J. Palmer (2004). Aliens adored: Raël's UFO religion, Page 62 Sexuality is also an important part of the Raëlian doctrine. The Raëlian Church has attracted some of its priests and bishops from other religions despite having liberal views of sexuality.
Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, but then handed it over to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000.Clonaid Homepage: History Retrieved 26 March 2008. In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman underwent a standard cloning procedure that led to the birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.
The Raëlians frequently use the swastika as a symbol of peace, which halted Raëlian requests for territory in Israel, and later Lebanon, for establishing an embassy for extraterrestrials.  The religion also uses the swastika embedded on the Star of David.http://altreligion.about.com/od/symbols/ig/Raelian-Symbols/Official-Raelian-Symbol.htm  Starting around 1991, this symbol was often replaced by a variant star and swirl symbol as a public relations move, particularly toward Israel.

==History==

The beginnings of Raëlism are rooted in the claims of a French former automobile journalist and race car driver Claude Vorilhon. In his books The Book Which Tells the Truth (1974) and Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet (1975), Vorilhon alleges that he had alien encounters with beings who gave him knowledge of the origins of all major religions.
The movement traces its beginnings to a conference in Paris, France of two thousand people in 1974.Rael: Messenger of the Elohim, The International Raelian Movement. Retrieved 1 December 2006. From there, the MADECH organization was born. The name MADECH is a double acronym in the French language. The first stands for "Movement for the welcoming of the Elohim, creators of humanity" ('Mouvement pour l‘accueil des Elohim, créateurs de l'humanité)'' while the second stands for "Moses preceded Elijah and the Christ" ''(Moise a devancé Élie et le Ch'rist).[tpl]rp|p. 104[/tpl] By 1976, Raël transformed MADECH into the International Raelian Movement.Raelians and Cloning: Are They for Real?, CESNUR.com. 16 January 2003. Retrieved 15 September 2007.
From 1980 to 1992 Raël and his movement became increasingly global. In 1980 Claude Raël's fifth Raëlian book Sensual Meditation was published and formal publication of the Raëlian Messages in the Japanese language beganHarmony Revolution, Japanese Raëlian Movement. Retrieved 2 November 2006. as part of the Raëlian mission to Japan.[tpl]rp|p. 64[/tpl] Two years later, Africa became another target area in the mission to spread the Raëlian messages.[tpl]rp|p. 64[/tpl]
On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a biotechnology company called Clonaid announced the birth of baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested that this is one of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They claim that through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life.THE CLONING DEBATE, MacNeil/Lehrer Productions. 27 December 2002.

The structure of the Raëlian Church is hierarchical, with seven levels ascending from level 0 to level 6. The top four levels consist of "Guides". The level 6 guide, known as the "Guide of Guides", has the final say on who becomes a level 5 "Bishop Guide" or a level 4 "Priest Guide". Bishops and priests promote lower-level members one level at a time during annual seminars. Each bishop or priest can propose a new guide as long as the candidate is from a level below his or her own. Guides can assist "Regional Guides"—level 3 and aboveWong, Jan, Clone artist, The Globe and Mail. 7 April 2001. Retrieved 12 July 2007.—in their assigning of non-guide members to levels 3 ("Assistant Priests"), 2 ("Organizers") and 1 ("Assistant Organizers").

===Women-only groups===

Women make up only a third of the membership in the Raëlian Church,[tpl]rp|p. 117[/tpl] though two anecdotes in the Raëlian Contact newsletter report female majorities joining the movement's Asian Mongolian chapter.Mongolia, Raelian Contact 288. 25 October 2005.

Women such as Brigitte Boisselier, the Chief Executive Officer of Clonaid, play a powerful role in the Raëlian Church. There are two major groups of women in the Raëlian Church.
The Order of Angels, founded in the 1990s, consists of over a hundred Raëlian women who call for femininity and refinement for all of humanity.Dellagloria, Rebecca, Otherworldly View of Femininity, The Miami Herald. 7 March 2005. Retrieved 17 July 2007.RaelRadio #7: Femininity Day, RaelRadio.net. Retrieved 18 April 2007.

Retrieved 13 March 2007.McCann, Brigitte, REALM OF THE RAELIANS: RAELIAN NATION – Part 1, Calgary Sun. 7 October 2003. Retrieved 10 January 2007. The Order of Angels has its own hierarchy of "rose angels" and "white angels" which, as of 2003, are six and 160 women, respectively.  After the Clonaid human cloning claim made the headlines, the Daily Telegraph wrote that members of the order not only provided sexual pleasure for Raël, but also helped donate eggs for efforts towards human cloning.Broughton, Philip D. Promise of as much sex as you want and everlasting life, The Daily Telegraph. 27 December 2002. Retrieved 13 March 2007.  A few days later, Time magazine wrote that French chemist Brigitte Boisselier was an Order of Angels member.Gibbs, Nancy, Abducting The Cloning Debate, Time Magazine in partnership with CNN. 5 January 2003. Retrieved 12 May 2007.  Around this time, cult specialist Mike Kropveld called the Order of Angels "one of the most transparent movements" he had witnessed, though he was alarmed by the women's promise to defend Raël's life with their own bodies.
Raël has instructed some women members to play a pro-sex feminist role in the Raëlian Church. "Rael's Girls" is another group of women in the movement which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women.  Rael's Girls solely consists of women who work in the sex industry.  In contrast to the teachings of the world's major religions, the women of Rael's Girls say there is no reason to repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute.I-Team: Alien Nation, Raelians Moving Headquarters to Las Vegas, WorldNow and KLAS. 8 May 2007.

==Rites and practices==

===Initiation===

====Ceremony====

The major initiation rite in the Raëlian Church is the "baptism" or "transmission of the cellular plan" and is performed by upper-level members in the Raëlian clergy known as guides.[tpl]rp|pp. 58–9[/tpl] In 1979, Raël introduced the "Act of Apostasy" as an obligation for those preparing for their Raëlian baptism.[tpl]rp|p. 60[/tpl]Paredes, Noelle, The Raelians: Roots, beliefs and future plans, CTV Television Network. 27 December 2002. Retrieved 3 May 2007.
The Raëlian baptism is known as transmission of the cellular plan where "cellular" refers to the organic cells of the body and the "plan" refers to the genetic makeup of the individual.  This Raëlian baptism involves a guide member laying water onto the forehead of the new member.[tpl]rp|p. 334[/tpl]  The practice began on "the first Sunday in April"[tpl]rp|p. 58[/tpl] of 1976 when Raël baptised 40 Raëlians.[tpl]rp|p. 58[/tpl]  Raëlians believe that their genetic information is recorded by a remote computer and would become recognized during their final hour when they will be judged by the extraterrestrial Elohim.[tpl]rp|p. 175[/tpl]

====Ceremonial dates====

Baptisms can only be performed on four special days in the year. The dates mark anniversaries in the Raëlian calendar.[tpl]rp|p. 64[/tpl]
The dates are the 6 August, which marks the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945,[tpl]rp|p. 151[/tpl][tpl]rp|p. 151[/tpl] 13 December, marking the day that Raël in 1973 says he had his first personal encounter with one of the extraterrestrial Elohim,[tpl]rp|pp. 4, 121–2, 136, 143, 223[/tpl] 7 October in which the Elohim, Raël says, took him up in a spacecraft in 1975 and the following day had meals with Jesus, Buddha, and other past religious figures[tpl]rp|pp. 145–178[/tpl]  and the first Sunday in April, which Raëlians believe is the date when dark-skinned extraterrestrials created Adam and Eve.[tpl]rp|p. 64[/tpl]RaelAfrica.org, RaelAfrica.org. Retrieved 9 August 2006.

===Sensual Meditation===

Sensual Meditation is the set of exercises made public by Claude Vorilhon in his book La méditation sensuelle.Raël, Sensual Meditation[tpl]ref|RaëlSM|Find reference[/tpl]  It is practiced by members of International Raelian Movement (IRM). The first of these exercises is usually taught in Raëlian Seminars.

==Other activities, outreach and advocacy==

Throughout the history of Raëlism, members of the Raëlian Church have toured public settings advocating masturbation, condoms and birth control.Broughton, Philip D. Promise of as much sex as you want and everlasting life, The Daily Telegraph. 31 December 2002. Retrieved 13 March 2007.

Raëlians have founded Clonaid, a company that envisions that someday human beings can be scientifically recreated though a process of human cloning, and Clitoraid, an organization whose mission is to oppose female genital mutilation."On s'en est fait passer une p'tite vite!", Cyberpresse.ca. 5 December 2006.

===Seminars===

Raëlian structure members who run the seminars have organized group exercises involving meditation with the senses. James R. Lewis, an authority on fringe religious movements, spoke of Raëlians who practiced a Raëlian exercise called Sensual Meditation and discovered "playing fields" where "radical self-reconstruction," "new forms of authority," and "new modes of self-relating" were encouraged.Lewis, The Gods have landed: new religions from other worlds[tpl]ref|LewisTGHL|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|p. 133[/tpl]
Music has been a feature of large gatherings, where at night, Raëlians have had multiethnic cabaret performances.[tpl]rp|p. 62[/tpl] Seminarists have used colored bracelets to indicate whether they wanted to be alone, be in a couple, or simply meet people.Brown, DeNeen L., The Leader of UFO Land, Washington Post. 17 January 2003.

On a yearly basis, Raëlian members organize seminars that are often attractive to the sexually adventurous.The Sexual Messiah, National Post. 7 August 1999. Retrieved 3 June 2007. News KNBC called the annual Raëlian seminars "a cross between a nudist camp and new-age retreat." A Spanish television agency reported Raëlian men and women in cross-dressing plays. Activities such as observations of one's own private parts and masturbation with them disturbed Brigitte McCann, a Calgary Sun reporter who entered one of the Raëlian seminars.[tpl]cite news |last= McCann |first= Brigittee |url= http://www.calgarysun.com/perl-bin/niveau2.cgi?s=Lifestyles&p=78811.html&a=1 |title= Get undressed |newspaper=  Calgary Sun |accessdate= 8 September 2007[/tpl] Susan J. Palmer said a French journalist went to a Raëlian Seminar in 1991 and taped couples having sexual intercourse in tents.  These tapes gained widespread negative publicity—with news stories that described these practices as perverted and a form of brainwashing.Susan J. Palmer, The Rael Deal, Religion in the News, Summer 2001, Vol. 4, No. 2. The tents were actually put up for the privacy of attendees whom were sharing dormitories and the person was ejected by the Raelians for misrepresentation for the sake of sensationalism of their so-called research, so called infiltration is encouraged by the Raelians to clear up myths perpetrated by the media and rogue researches.

===Activism===

Raëlians routinely advocate sex-positive feminism and genetically modified food. They also have protested against wars and the Catholic Church.

Anti-Catholic: In 1992 Catholic schools in Montreal, Canada objected to a proposed condom vending machine as contrary to their mission.

The Commissioner of Catholic schools for Montreal said they could do nothing to stop them.Religious Movements Homepage: Raelians (paragraph on Operation Condom), University of Virginia. Retrieved 4 March 2007.
In July 2001, Raëlians on the streets attracted Italians and Swiss people as they gave leaflets protesting the existence of over a hundred child molesters among Roman Catholic clergy in France.  They recommended that parents should not send their children to Catholic confession.  The Episcopal vicar of Geneva sued the Raëlian Church for libel but did not win.[tpl]rp|p. 91[/tpl]"The bishops react to the attacks anti-catholics of the Raëlian movement" (translated), Infosekten. 22 May 2001.

They were invited to burn the crosses in a park not far from Montreal's Mount Royal and to sign letters of apostasy from the Roman Catholic Church.  The Quebec Association of Bishops called this "incitement to hatred", and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Raëlians.[tpl]rp|p. 92[/tpl]

===Converts from other religions===

Raëlians do not believe in a god (or other deity), but in extraterrestrials. Former clergy of mainstream religions have joined the Raëlian Church, especially in Quebec.Palmer, Susan J. Susan J.

===Intentional controversy===

Susan J. Palmer, a sociologist from Canada, has studied the movement since 1987Review of Aliens Adored: Rael's UFO Religion by Publishers Weekly, Publishers Weekly. Retrieved 4 June 2007. and says the movement intentionally stirs a moderate level of controversy to maintain membership.

==Beliefs==

Theologian of new religious movements, George D. Chryssides, described the Raëlian Church as being in an "early developmental stage" and that their beliefs distance it from a "dominant intellectual climate".Partridge, UFO Religions[tpl]ref|Partridge|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|p. 46[/tpl] Raëlism claims that all life on Earth, humans included, was created scientifically by Elohim, members of an extraterrestrial race who appeared similar to small humans and so were often depicted as angels,Raël, Intelligent Design[tpl]ref|RaëlID|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|pp. 308–14[/tpl] cherubs,[tpl]rp|pp. 49–50[/tpl] or gods.[tpl]rp|pp. 153–6[/tpl] Raëlians, who are not monotheists, believe the correct historical meaning of the word Elohim is the plural sense, "those who came from the sky". Belief in extraterrestrial Elohim play a central part in Clonaid's claim of offering cloning services for homosexual and infertile couples who want a child cloned from a partner's DNA.Edwards, A Brief Guide to Beliefs: Ideas, Theologies, Mysteries, and Movements[tpl]ref|Edwards|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|470[/tpl]
Chryssides states that Raëlism is discernible from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism.[tpl]rp|p. 21[/tpl] Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar who had long contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalismPalmer, Aliens Adored[tpl]ref|PalmerAD|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|p. 23[/tpl] with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body.[tpl]rp|p. 167[/tpl] Raëlians publicly deny the existence of the ethereal soul and a supernatural god,Who are the Raëlians?, Time Magazine. 4 January 2003. Retrieved 15 September 2007. but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.[tpl]rp|p. 171[/tpl]
Raëlians believe that throughout the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, all of whom were created as a result of a sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.
Raëlians believe that sex is a normal, natural and healthy part of life and encourages people to be true to their natural sexuality.Exhibit on homosexual behavior in animal kingdom, Raelianews.org. 8 December 2006. Retrieved 11 April 2008. They promote healing from damaging messages from strict puritanical belief systems and social stigmas that stifle one's natural sexuality. Acceptance of masturbation, homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, naturism and any legal, safe and consensual adult activity is promoted as part of a healthy and long life, and this is used to attract young converts to the religion.To stop Pedophilia, It is urgent to give right to sex to Catholic Priests, Raelianews.org. 9 December 2006.

===Voluntarism===

Raëlians are encouraged to do as they feel right, whether that matches the rules of the culture in which they live or not. According to Susan J. Palmer, a majority of loosely affiliated Raëlian Movement members have often strayed from following rules concerning "diet, drugs, and sexual activity" as described in the Raëlian books. Sometimes, they will not attend monthly meetings or pay a tithe in proportion to their income. Only the more committed members who do follow such rules can remain in the movement's structure.[tpl]rp|p. 58[/tpl]
According to Michel Beluet, the former director of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe.[tpl]rp|p. 209[/tpl] Palmer cited Raël, who claimed that more than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe.[tpl]rp|p. 64[/tpl] Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.[tpl]rp|p. 209[/tpl]

===Human cloning===

As opposed to the scientific definition of reproductive cloning which is simply the creation of a genetically identical living thing, Raëlians seek to both genetically clone individuals, rapidly accelerate growth of the clone to adulthood through a process like guided self-assembly of rapidly expanded cells or even nanotechnology[tpl]rp|pp. 35–37[/tpl]Sect leader: Cloning is just the beginning, Cable News Network. 31 December 2002.

In the final stages of development, hitherto unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead[tpl]rp|p. 167[/tpl] including their memories and personality.Rael, Geniocracy[tpl]ref|RaëlG|Find reference[/tpl][tpl]rp|pp. 47,78[/tpl] This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.[tpl]rp|p. 109[/tpl]
Claude Vorilhon told lawmakers that banning the development of human cloning was comparable to outlawing medical advances such "antibiotics, blood transfusions, and vaccines."

====Clonaid====

Raël founded Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation in 1997, to research human cloning. The company name was later changed to Clonaid and handed over to Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, as chief executive of Clonaid, claimed that a human baby was conceived through cloning technology.  Around this time, Clonaid's subsidiary BioFusion Tech claimed to have in possession a cell fusion device that assisted the cloning of human embryos.Human cloning firm sets up affiliate in Korea, Korea Herald. 13 July 2002.

Raëlians of South Korea were instructed by Raël to protest near the Ministry of Health and Welfare that ordered him to leave. Officials detained Raël for nine hours at Incheon International Airport before he and his wife Sophie de Niverville left for Tokyo from where they would take another plane on their way back to Canada.  Raël responded by saying that Korean officials treated him like a "North Korean" and that he would wait for an apology before coming back to Korea.Goodenough, Patrick, Cloning Cult Miffed About Treatment of Leader, Cybercast News Service. 6 August 2003.

Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with a fear that Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.

====Views on pedophilia====

Sexual predators and guides who force missionary ideas against members are excommunicated by the Raëlian Church for a minimum of seven years—the amount of time Raëlians believe it takes for all of a person's biological cells to be regenerated.[tpl]rp|p. 63[/tpl]  In 2006 Raëlians in Los Angeles, California condemned acts of pedophilia which Raelians consider a disease, particularly those associated with celibate Catholic priests, saying that minors and adults should not be mixed in the act of sex.DIFFUSION IN THE WORLD: THE US TEAMS DENOUNCE CATHOLIC PRIESTS PEDOPHILIA, Raelian Contact 324. 11 December 2006.

===Structure of the Universe===

Raëlian cosmology as proposed in 1973 by Raël states that the observable universe has no creator and is infinite in time and finite in size and surrounded by infinite space.[tpl]rp|pp. 211[/tpl]
In Raëlian cosmology, our observable universe is an "atom" of a much larger level of matter (and possibly organism) and subatomic particles in our bodies also possess universes like our own, but on a much smaller scale.  This pattern, atom within universe within atom, is believed to be infinitely repetitive, from the infinitely small, to the infinitely large.[tpl]rp|pp. 211[/tpl]  The Raëlian Messages by Raël state that humanoid extraterrestrials, who were originally called under the name Elohim (singular: Eloha), verified this cosmology scientifically.[tpl]rp|pp. 153–155[/tpl]
Because of the difference of mass, the activity of life inside in a living thing's atoms would undergo many millennia before enough time passes for that living thing to take a single step.  Raëlians believe the universe is infinite in time and space and lacks a center. Because of this, one could not imagine where an ethereal soul would go.[tpl]rp|pp. 153–155[/tpl]
The Raëlian cosmology is meditated upon during the fourth activity in the rite of Sensual Meditation.

===Intelligent Design===

====Creation of life on Earth by extraterrestrials====

In his book The Message Given to me by Extraterrestrials (now republished as Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers 2006 ISBN 2-940252-20-3), Claude Vorilhon claims that on 13 December 1973, he found a spacecraft shaped like a flattened bell that landed inside Puy de Lassolas, a volcano near the capital city of Auvergne. A 25,000-year-old human-like extraterrestrial inside the spacecraft named Yahweh said that Elohim was the name that primitive people of Earth called members of his extraterrestrial race—who were seen as "those who came from the sky". Yahweh explained that Earth was originally void of life, with thick clouds and shallow seas, but the Elohim came, broke apart the clouds, exposed the seas to sunlight, built a continent, and synthesized a global ecosystem. Solar astronomy, terraformation, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering allowed Elohim to adapt life to Earth's thermal and chemical makeup.[tpl]rp|pp. 11–15[/tpl]
Yahweh gave materialistic explanations of the following:
According to Vorilhon, Elohim contacted about forty people to act as their prophets on Earth,[tpl]rp|p. 165[/tpl] including Moses,[tpl]rp|pp. 114,312,324[/tpl]  Elijah,[tpl]rp|p. 114[/tpl] Ezekiel,[tpl]rp|pp. 45–53[/tpl] Buddha,[tpl]rp|pp. 89,312,324[/tpl]

From the Raëlian point of view, religious texts indicate that the Elohim would return at the age of Apocalypse or Revelation (unveiling of the truth). Humans from another world would appear to drop down from the sky and meet in the embassy they have asked Raël to build for them and share their advanced scientific knowledge with humanity.  Thus, one of their stated main goals of the Raëlian movement is to inform as many people as possible about this extraterrestrial race."An Embassy for Extraterrestrials", International Raëlian Movement. Retrieved 20 July 2007.

====Humanity's chance of creating life on other planets====

Raëlians believe that humanity would be able to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars[tpl]rp|p. 159[/tpl] and create life on another planet.[tpl]rp|p. 70[/tpl] Progress in terraforming, molecular biology,[tpl]rp|p. 293[/tpl] and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch.[tpl]rp|p. 50[/tpl] Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would have a better chance of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators.[tpl]rp|p. 153[/tpl]  Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed.[tpl]rp|p. 280[/tpl] The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.[tpl]rp|p. 91[/tpl]

===A coming judgement===

===Embassy for Extraterrestrials===

Raëlians believe that life on Earth—as well as many religions of the world—was the work of extraterrestrial influence.  They believe these were scientists and that ancient people saw them as "gods" and gave the name "Elohim".[tpl]rp|p. 370[/tpl]Sethi, Atul, Was God an astronaut?, Times of India.

The Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is the vision of the International Raëlian Movement to establish an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a landing pad that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships.  The funding of the embassy has been reported over time by the media.  Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would be surrounded by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.

====Proposed architecture and location====

The International Raëlian Movement envisions having an entrance with an aseptic chamber leading to a conference room for twenty-one people as well as a dining room of the same capacity.  In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy.  The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be in the center of a large park and protected from trespassing by a wall−a maximum of two stories-to surround the entire complex's circumference.  Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area.  The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance.  The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" on its terrace.  The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only.  The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door.  Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy.  Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision.ELOHIM'S INSTRUCTIONS, International Raëlian Movement.

===A form of meritocracy===

In his book Geniocracy, Raël outlined his plan for a peaceful worldwide political union that, while democratic, would require members of the electorate to meet a minimum standard of intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above average for a candidate and 10% above average for a voter.[tpl]rp|pp. 17–20[/tpl] The world government would also have a global currency, a common language, and a transformation of militaries of the world into civil police.[tpl]rp|p. 100[/tpl]
Raelians deride the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of Globalisation, such as Environmentalism, Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism.
Raël recommends a world government with 12 regions.  Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of.  After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied.  While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.

====Status====

The current difficulty in the ideas of Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.
The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of Geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies.  Because of the controversies surrounding Geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.
In Raël's book, Extraterrestrials took me to their planet, Raël claims that an extraterrestrial gave him the idea of Economic Humanitarianism. Under the establishment of Economic Humanitarianism, people would not have ownership of businesses or exploitable goods created by others. Instead, people would rent each of them for a period of 49 years. The founders would be able to receive the rents for up to 49 years or when they die, which ever is later. Any rents not inherited by relatives after 49 years would go to the State.[tpl]rp|p. 98[/tpl]  By balancing inheritances, children would be born with enough financial means to forsake menial tasks for endeavors that may benefit the whole of humanity.  Family houses could be inherited from generation to generation, free of rent.[tpl]rp|p. 97[/tpl]
In his much later book, Maitreya, Raël says the road to a world without money is capitalism and globalisation, as opposed to communism.  Capitalism would allow those who contribute much to society to also contribute to its scientific and technological development. Under capitalism, society would produce as much money as it can.  The money would become important in the short run as nanotechnology quickly lowers the cost of goods while putting many people out of work.[tpl]rp|pp. 217–8[/tpl]

In 1991, a Montreal anti-cult organization called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with an article on Le Devoir, branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the swastika as part of their logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, a Jewish anti-cult organization.USE OF SWASTIKA LOGO PROMPTS BEACH PROTEST, The Miami Herald. 3 January 1992.

In February 1991, the Raëlian Church modified their symbol.

In 2005, the Israeli Raëlian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the Raëlian movement to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Raëlians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Raëlians involved declined this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as is.Thomas, Amelia, Raelians want to establish ET embassy in Jerusalem, Middle East Times. 18 November 2005. Retrieved 13 March 2007.  From 1991 to 2007, the official Raëlian symbol in Europe and America did not have the original swastika, but Raël, founder and leader of the Raëlian Movement decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the Raelian Movement worldwide.The Official Raelian Symbol gets its swastika back, Raelianews.org. 17 January 2007.
