South Texas Junior College was a junior college located in Houston, Texas (USA).
In 1923 the college opened as a part of the South Texas School of Law and Commerce. Young Men's Christian Association and Harris County operated the two-year coeducational liberal arts school; no tax money supported the school.
At first classes occurred in the Downtown YMCA building. In 1949, the school had 144 students. The classes moved to the Merchants and Manufacturers Building at One Main Street in 1967.  The college had 2,737 students and 120 faculty members by 1973. The YMCA and YWCA buildings provided dormitories for students.
On August 6, 1974, the University of Houston acquired the assets of South Texas Junior College and then opened the University of Houston–Downtown College (later renamed University of Houston–Downtown) as a four-year institution.[tpl]Handbook of Texas|id=kbs28|name=South Texas Junior College[/tpl]
