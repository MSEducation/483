==History==

Don Muang airfield was the second established in Thailand, after Sa Pathum airfield, which is now Sa Pathum horse racing course, known as the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. The first flights to Don Muang were made on 8 March 1914 and involved the transfer of aircraft of the Royal Thai Air Force.  Three years earlier, Thailand had sent three army officers to France to train as pilots.  On completion of their training in 1911, the pilots were authorized to purchase eight aircraft, four Breguets and four Nieuports, which formed the basis of the Royal Thai Air Force. Sa Pathum airfield was established in February, 1911 by an arrival of Orville Wright,  7 years after the invention of the first airplane, by Wright brothers On December 17, 1903.http://www.airportthai.co.th/ewtadmin85_aot/ewt/aot_web/ewt_news.php?nid=1&filename=map___EN
