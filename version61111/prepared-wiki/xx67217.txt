In 1996, she was given the role of Hitomi Kanzaki in the TV anime series The Vision of Escaflowne in 1996. In this anime she also made her debut as a singer under the production of Yoko Kanno, who was in charge of the soundtrack of the same anime. Under Kanno's production she made her debut as a singer with "Yakusoku wa Iranai", her first single released on April 24, 1996 that was also used as Escaflowne's opening theme. Since then, she would start singing music for several anime series she would be working on as a voice actress, with its production being exclusively in charge of Yoko Kanno and her music crew, which includes a selected number of lyricists and composers, as Yūho Iwasato, Gabriela Robin, Shanti Snyder, Tim Jensen and a few others. For her singing career she would be working almost exclusively with Yoko Kanno for almost a decade. In October 1996 she began her first radio program on Nack 5, becoming a radio personality.

On October 12 of this same year, Sakamoto's fourth album Shōnen Alice was released, which became her first Top 10 album, and also her last one to be produced exclusively by Yoko Kanno, for after this she would start to become more involved in the music making process and the production of her records. Thus, Yūnagi Loop, her fifth album  released on October 26, 2005, was co-produced by herself and musician Mistuyoshi Tamura, whom she would continue working in her subsequent records. The album's lead single "Loop" peaked at number seven in the Japanese charts, becoming her highest chart peaking single at that time.
