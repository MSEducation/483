===Arab villages===

A number of these villages, those in the Jezreel Valley, were inhabited by tenants of land which was sold by a variety of absentee landlord families, such as the Karkabi, Tueini, Farah and Khuri families and Sursock family of Lebanon. The sale of land to Jewish organizations often resulted in the eviction of Arabs.Kenneth W. Stein, The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939, UNC Press Books, 1987 p.60. The Sursocks sold Jinujar, Tall al-Adas, Jabata, Khuneifis, Jeida, Harbaj, Harithiya, Affula, Shuna, Jidru, Majdal.Barbara Jean Smith, The roots of separatism in Palestine: British economic policy, 1920-1929, Syracuse University Press, 1993 pp.96-7;Mark A. Tessler, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Indiana University Press, 1994 p.177, writes 'The Sursock deal is known to have involved the eviction of about 8000 tenants "compensated" at three pounds ten shillings $17 a head.'Sahar Huneidi, A broken trust: Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians 1920-1925, I.B.Tauris, 2001 p.223.[ref]Palestine Commission on the Disturbances of August 1929,H.M.S.O., 1930, vol.1 p.437:'The Sursock titles should have been looked into as was acknowledged by the government officials themselves.The transfer became an irregular one, if not an illegal one, because the peasants' claims were not satisfied.'

Three Arab villages, Bayt Nuba, Imwas and Yalo,  located in the Latrun Corridor were destroyed on the orders of Yitzhak Rabin due to the corridor's strategic location and route to Jerusalem and because of the residents' alleged aiding of Egyptian commandos in their attack on the city of Lod. The residents of the three villages were offered compensation but were not allowed to return.Oren, 2002, pp. 307.
