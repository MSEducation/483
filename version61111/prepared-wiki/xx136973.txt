KHNS is a FM-broadcasting public radio station with principal studios and offices in Haines, Alaska, secondary studios in Skagway, and a broadcast throughout the Haines Borough, Klukwan, and the Skagway area (in other words, upper Lynn Canal).

==Programming==

KHNS is region's only local radio station and offers a wide variety of programming. News for the station includes local news the station's sole reporter. While the reporter is usually based in Haines an effort is made to cover news from the other distinct population center in its listener area: Skagway. 
KHNS receives statewide news from the Alaska Public Radio Network, national news from National Public Radio, and international news from the BBC. KHNS also subscribes to a variety of American Public Media (such as A Prairie Home Companion) and Public Radio International shows. The station also produces a cadre of shows primarily based out of its Haines studios, but also a number from its Skagway studios as well.
Notably, KHNS is the only Southeast Alaskan public radio station that is not a member of CoastAlaska.
