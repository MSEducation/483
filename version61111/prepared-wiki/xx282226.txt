==WildChords==

Ovelin's first release was WildChords, a guitar learning game that drew inspiration from Guitar Hero, but takes the sound of the user playing a real guitar as the input. Unlike the similar Rocksmith, WildChords uses the iPad's microphone, allowing users to play acoustic guitars as well as electric.[tpl]cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=Cutting The Cord: WildChords Brings Guitar Hero To Real Guitars On The iPad|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/16/cutting-the-cord-wildchords-brings-guitar-hero-to-real-guitars-on-the-ipad/|work=Techcrunch.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]  The game features separate modes for learning to play chords and single notes, and is designed for players only beginning to learn the guitar.[tpl]cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Kirk|title=Learn The Guitar While Taming Wild Beasts On Your iPad|url=http://kotaku.com/5867874/learn-the-guitar-while-taming-wild-beasts-on-your-ipad|work=Kotaku.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] WildChords was released in November 2011 for the iPad and was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first month on sale,[tpl]cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=Finnish Startup Ovelin Snags $1.4M From True Ventures To Reinvent Early Music Ed With Games|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/ovelin-funding/|work=Techcrunch.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] and became the number 1 music app in 34 countries.[tpl]cite web|title=Ovelin paints Finnish PM’s fingernails|url=http://2012.slush.fi/en-gb/2012/11/ovelin-paints-finnish-pms-fingernails/|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]

==GuitarBots==

While promoting WildChords Ovelin discussed their intention to launch a browser version of the app. This eventually appeared in the form of GuitarBots, which adapted the basic design of WildChords to web browsers, but with a different aesthetic and higher difficulty options, along with tutorials, a tuner, and other features.[tpl]cite web|last=Ridden|first=Paul|title=GuitarBots online learning game is played with any real guitar|url=http://www.gizmag.com/guitarbots-online-guitar-tuition-game/25199/|work=Gizmag.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] GuitarBots is free-to-play but offers paid premium accounts.[tpl]cite web|title=Apprendre à jouer de la guitare depuis votre navigateur|url=http://www.gizmodo.fr/2013/02/13/guitarbots.html|work=Gizmodo.fr|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] The game is only compatible with PCs and Macs, as the Unity Web Player plugin is required to play.[tpl]cite web|last=Bryant|first=Martin|title=Guitarbots: Like Guitar Hero for real guitars, in your browser|url=http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/02/11/guitarbots-from-ovelin-is-like-guitar-hero-for-real-guitars-in-your-browser/|work=Thenextweb.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]   

==GuitarTuna==

GuitarTuna is a free guitar tuner app available for iOS, Android, and web browsers. GuitarTuna has been praised for its accuracy,[tpl]cite web|first=John|title=Music app review – GuitarTuna by Ovelin|url=http://www.musicappblog.com/music-app-review-guitartun/|work=Musicappblog.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] especially compared to other free tuning apps, but reviewers noted that it only supports six-string guitars with standard tuning.[tpl]cite web|title=GuitarTuna 1.1|url=http://iphone-apps.toptenreviews.com/music/guitartuna-review.html|work=Toptenreviews.com|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] Alternative tuning sets have since been released as paid add-ons.[tpl]cite web|title=Guitartuna - Guitar Tuner for standard and alternative tuning (drop d, open, custom)|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guitartuna/id527588389?ls=1&mt=8|work=Apple App Store|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl]
