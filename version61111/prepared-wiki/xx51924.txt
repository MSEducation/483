The Athabasca River (French: rivière Athabasca) originates from the Columbia Glacier of the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. The impressive and scenic Athabasca Falls is located upstream about [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Jasper townsite. 
In Woods Cree, the word aðapaskāw means "where there are plants one after another",Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 52 likely a reference to the spotty vegetation along the river.  

==History==

Sekani, Shuswap, Kootenay, Salish, Stoney and Cree tribes hunted and fished along the river prior to the European colonization. From about 1778, the Athabasca River, the Clearwater River, which enters the Athabasca River from the east at Fort McMurray, and the Methye Portage were part of the main fur trade route from the Mackenzie River to the Great Lakes. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early).
David Thompson and Thomas the Iroquois travelled through Athabasca Pass in 1811.  In 1862, the Athabasca Springs area was crossed during the Cariboo Goldrush by the Overlander Party.

===Heritage===

This river was designated a Canadian Heritage River for its importance to the fur trade and the construction of railways and roads opening up the Canadian West, as well as for its natural heritage.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Athabasca/Athabasca_e.htm|author=Canadian Heritage River System|authorlink=Canadian Heritage Rivers System|title=Athabasca River|accessdate=2006-11-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061008040226/http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Athabasca/Athabasca_e.htm| archivedate= 8 October 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] 
 

==Course==

The Athabasca River originates in Jasper National Park, in an unnamed lake at the toe of the Athabasca Glacier within the Columbia Icefield, between Mount Columbia, Snow Dome, and the Winston Churchill Range, at an altitude of approximately [tpl]convert|1600|m|ft[/tpl].
The river flows along icefields and through gorges, offering wildlife habitat on its shores and adjacent marshes. Throughout its course, it flows through or adjacent to numerous national and provincial parks, including Jasper National Park, Fort Assiniboine Sandhills Wildland Provincial Park, Hubert Lake Wildland Provincial Park, La Biche River Wildland Provincial Park, Grand Rapids Wildland Provincial Park, Richardson River Dunes Wildland Provincial Park, and Wood Buffalo National Park. Its course is marked by rapids, impeding navigation southwest of Fort McMurray.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010050|title=Athabasca River|year=2006|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2006-09-12|authorlink=Encyclopædia Britannica| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060831221714/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010050| archivedate= 31 August 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Athabasca River travels [tpl]convert|1231|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] before draining into the Peace-Athabasca Delta near Lake Athabasca south of Fort Chipewyan. From there, its waters flow north as Rivière des Rochers, then joining the Peace River to form the Slave River that empties into Great Slave Lake and discharges through the Mackenzie River system into the Arctic Ocean. The cumulative drainage area is [tpl]convert|95300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/basins/BasinForm.cfm|author=Environment Alberta|title=River Basins in Alberta|accessdate=2007-01-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070116201051/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/basins/BasinForm.cfm?| archivedate= 16 January 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Numerous communities are located on the banks of the Athabasca River, including Jasper, Brule, Entrance, Hinton, Whitecourt, Fort Assiniboine, Smith, Athabasca, Fort McMurray, and Fort MacKay.

==Effect of oil sands==

An independent study has concluded that the Athabasca River contains elevated levels of pollution downstream of the Athabasca oil sands. Testing has shown this portion of the river contains mercury, lead and 11 other toxic elements.

===Oil spills===

Owing to its proximity to the Athabasca Oil Sands, the river has seen significant amounts of energy infrastructure constructed along its course. On June 6, 1970, a pipeline operated by Great Canadian Oil Sands, the precursor to Suncor and the earliest commercial extraction operation, ruptured near the banks of the river. The total spill volume was estimated by Great Canadian Oil Sands at approximately 19,000 barrels of oil.

==Legacy==

The Canadian Heraldic Authority named the position of Athabaska Herald after the river.
