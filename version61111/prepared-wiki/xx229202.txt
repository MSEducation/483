[[Molly (fastener)]]

CATEGORIES: Fasteners, Home improvement

A molly or molly bolt, often misspelled moly, is a formerly trademarkedUnited States Patent and Trademark Office name for a specialized screw fastener used with drywall, as a hollow-wall anchor. Larger sizes permit reasonably heavy objects, such as shelving, flatscreen-TV mounts or central-heating radiators to be attached to drywall in locations where there is no stud behind the drywall. For heavy objects, then multiple molly bolts may be required.

==Attaching==

The fastener is an anchor, an expandable sleeve that slides into a hole drilled into the wall. A lip wider than the hole prevents it from falling behind the wall. A machine screw is then screwed into the sleeve, causing the anchor to bend, expand, spread and grip against the inside of the drywall.[tpl]Citation | last = Koenigsberg | first = David  | title = Handyman's Handbook: The Complete Guide to Starting and Running a Successful Business | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2003 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=dO8slEg6LJYC | isbn = 0-07-141670-6[/tpl], p. 111.
Mollies come in various diameters and "grip lengths" for different drywall thicknesses and to support different loads.
