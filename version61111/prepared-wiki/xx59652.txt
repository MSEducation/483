The American Association of Lutheran Churches (TAALC, also known as The AALC) is an American Lutheran church body. It was formed on November 7, 1987 as a continuation of The American Lutheran Church (ALC) denomination, the majority of which body merged with two other Lutheran church bodies, Lutheran Church in America (LCA) and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC), which formed the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The AALC offices were located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The national office moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana in 2007. It has 67 congregations, with about 16,000 members, in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/denoms/D_1414.asp|title=American AssAmerican Association of Lutheran Churches American Association of Lutheran Churches|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl] Its current President is the Rev.

==Historical Background==

The AALC began with 12 congregations and has, as of 2008, grown to 70 congregations spread across 23 states. The AALC sees itself as a confessional Lutheran Church body in the United States. At its beginning, TAALC defined itself by what it saw as maintaining a commitment to the authority of Holy Scripture and the teaching of the Lutheran confessions by way of retaining the Confession of Faith of the American Lutheran Church.
A handful of congregations split off from the AALC in 1995 to form the Lutheran Ministerium and Synod - USA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana in response to what it perceived as a rising influence of the "charismatic renewal" movement. 
The AALC operates its own seminary, The American Lutheran Theological Seminary (ALTS), originally located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In the fall of 2005, ALTS relocated to Fort Wayne, Indiana and is hosted by Concordia Theological Seminary of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS).

==Fellowship with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod==

Since 1989 representatives of The AALC and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) have met in a series of official and unofficial talks. After six official meetings, at which various doctrinal papers were submitted, representatives of both The AALC and the LCMS have recommended to their respective church bodies that they enter into altar and pulpit fellowship with one another. The proposal will meet the theology/doctrine commissions of each church body, and if passed, will be presented at their respective national conventions.  During the June 20–23, 2007 TAALC National Convention, the AALC declared fellowship with the LCMS; and voted to join the International Lutheran Council (ILC).  On July 16, 2007, the LCMS declared fellowship with the AALC during the LCMS 63rd Regular Convention.
