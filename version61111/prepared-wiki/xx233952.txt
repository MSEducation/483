==History==

The debut of SR 347 took place in 1935.  At the time, the highway was a short connector routed along its present alignment between its junction with SR 4 in the hamlet of Pharisburg and its eastern terminus at SR 37 near Magnetic Springs.[tpl]cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Highway System |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1934a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1934 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl][tpl]cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1935a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1935 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl]
In 1937, SR 347 was extended west along its current alignment to its present western terminus near East Liberty at what would later become US 33, but at the time was known as SR 32.  This extension followed a previously un-numbered road.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1936a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1936 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl][tpl]cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1937a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1937 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl]
