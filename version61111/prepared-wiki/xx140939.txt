Brian Jacks later achieved national fame for his outstanding performances on the BBC programme Superstars[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/superstars/3091096.stm|title=Superstars: A brief history|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 October 2006 | date=5 November 2004[/tpl] in which he was one of the most successful competitors.  Jacks dominated the British and European version of the contest from 1979 to 1980, winning four titles.
Jacks was most famous for his amazing efforts in the gymnasium, where he repeatedly set records in the "gym tests", including 100 parallel bar dips in 60 seconds in the 1981 Challenge of the Champions, and 118 squat thrusts in the 1980 World Final. [tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl] He was also very dominant in the weightlifting, canoeing and cycling events, rarely placing lower than second.  Jacks was never able to win the World Superstars title, being forced to miss the 1979 event due to illness and finishing third in 1980.  In 1981 he was beaten for the first time in Europe (by Keith Fielding) and would never again compete in Superstars.
His victories in the British and European Superstars led to the creation of the branded computer games: Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge and Brian Jacks Uchi Mata.
