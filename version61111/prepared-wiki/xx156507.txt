WOLS was home to the "Holiday Show" Hosted by Doug Williams. The program was on the air for 28 years before moving to television for another eight years.
WOLS was an adult standards station using the Stardust format. Most of its programming was also heard on WHYM. Both stations aired some Christian programming. 
In 2003, WOLS was bought by the Colonial Radio Group and was known as "The Sports Animal."[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]It featured Sporting News Radio programming and had a weekly sports talk radio show hosted by on-air personalities Jeff Andrulonis and Bradley Turner.
