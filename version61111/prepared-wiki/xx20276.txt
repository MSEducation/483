Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, is a species in the onion genus, Allium.
Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive, and rakkyo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allallergy.net/fapaidfind.cfm?cdeoc=684 |title=AllergyNet — Allergy Advisor Find |publisher=Allallergy.net |accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] With a history of human use of over 7,000 years, garlic is native to central Asia,Ensminger, AH (1994).

==Description==

Allium sativum is a bulbous plant. It grows up to 1.2 m (4 ft) in height. Its hardiness is USDA Zone 8. It produces hermaphrodite flowers. Pollination occurs by bees and other insects.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Origin and major types==

According to Zohary and Hopf,Zohary, D., Hopf, M. (2000) Domestication of plants in the Old World, 3rd edition, Oxford: University Press, ISBN 0198503571, p. 197 "A difficulty in the identification of its wild progenitor is the sterility of the cultivars", though it is thought to be descended from the species Allium longicuspis, which grows wild in central and southwestern Asia.[tpl]cite book|author=Salunkhe, D.K.; Kadam, S.S.|title=Handbook of Vegetable Science and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker|year=1998|isbn=0-8247-0105-4|page=397[/tpl] Allium sativum grows in the wild in areas where it has become naturalized. The "wild garlic", "crow garlic", and "field garlic" of Britain are members of the species Allium ursinum, Allium vineale, and Allium oleraceum, respectively. In North America, Allium vineale (known as "wild garlic" or "crow garlic") and Allium canadense, known as "meadow garlic" or "wild garlic" and "wild onion", are common weeds in fields.McGee p. 112 One of the best-known "garlics", the so-called elephant garlic, is actually a wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum), and not a true garlic. Single clove garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the Yunnan province of China.

===European garlic===

There are a number of garlics with Protected Geographical Status in Europe; these include:

==Subspecies and varieties==

There are two subspecies of A. sativum,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?2368|title=USDA GRIN Taxonomy, Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon[/tpl] ten major groups of varieties, and hundreds of varieties or cultivars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gourmetgarlicgardens.com/overview.htm | title=The Garlic Family Tree and Where Garlic Came from[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Garlic is easy to grow and can be grown year-round in mild climates. While sexual propagation of garlic is indeed possible, nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated asexually, by planting individual cloves in the ground. In cold climates, cloves are planted in the autumn, about six weeks before the soil freezes, and harvested in late spring. The cloves must be planted at sufficient depth to prevent freeze/thaw which causes mold or white rot Garlic plants are usually very hardy, and are not attacked by many pests or diseases. Garlic plants are said to repel rabbits and moles. Two of the major pathogens that attack garlic are nematodes and white rot disease, which remain in the soil indefinitely after the ground has become infected. Garlic also can suffer from pink root, a typically nonfatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r584100711.html |title=UC IPM: UC Management Guidelines for Pink Root on Onion and Garlic |publisher=Ipm.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl]
Garlic plants can be grown closely together, leaving enough space for the bulbs to mature, and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth. Garlic does well in loose, dry, well drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout USDA climate zones 4–9. When selecting garlic for planting, it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves. Large cloves, along with proper spacing in the planting bed, will also improve bulb size. Garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high organic material content, but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and pH levels.
There are different types or subspecies of garlic, most notably hardneck garlic and softneck garlic. The latitude where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates; softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/warrenreporter/index.ssf/2008/12/farmers_forum_it_probably_came.html |title=Farmers Forum — It probably came from Gilroy | Warren Reporter |publisher=NJ.com |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090626090932/http://www.natural-holistic-health.com/alternative-therapies/herbs-for-health/medicinal-garlic/ |title=The Medicinal Uses of Garlic |publisher=Natural-holistic-health.com |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]

===Production trends===

Garlic is grown globally, but China is by far the largest producer of garlic, with approximately 10.5 million tonnes (23 billion pounds) grown annually, accounting for over 77% of world output. India (4.1%) and South Korea (2%) follow, with Egypt and Russia (1.6%) tied in fourth place and the United States (where garlic is grown in every state except for Alaska) in sixth place (1.4%).Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. Vegetables and Melons Outlook, October 19, 2006, p. 25. (The excerpt "Commodity Highlight: Garlic" (pp. 25–29) is available from Lewis & Clark College.) This leaves 16% of global garlic production in countries that each produce less than 2% of global output. Much of the garlic production in the United States is centered in Gilroy, California, which calls itself the "garlic capital of the world".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofgilroy.org/cityofgilroy/community/community_profile/default.aspx |title=City of Gilroy: Community Profile |publisher=cityofgilroy.org |accessdate=2011-06-14[/tpl]

==Uses==

===Culinary uses===

Garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment.
The garlic plant's bulb is the most commonly used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic pungent, spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking.[tpl]cite web|url = http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Alli_sat.html|title = Garlic (Allium sativum L.)|accessdate = 2012-12-02|author = Katzer, G| date = 2009-08-08[/tpl]
Other parts of the garlic plant are also edible. The leaves and flowers (bulbils) on the head (spathe) are sometimes eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs, and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as "green garlic".Thompson, S. (1995) The Kitchen Garden. Bantam Books. ISBN 0553374761. p. 144. When green garlic is allowed to grow past the "scallion" stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic "round", a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb.Thompson, S. (1995) The Kitchen Garden. Bantam Books. ISBN 0553374761. p. 145. Additionally, the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070313210109/http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/pubs/SFNews/archive/95071.htm|title=Small Farm News Archive |publisher=Sfc.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl]
Inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the "skin" and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of "skin" over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in Korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact.[tpl]cite web|author=Amanda |url=http://www.food-links.com/countries/korea/food-terms-korea.php |title=Glossary of Foods and Food Terms in Korea |publisher=Food-links.com |accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] The root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form.
Garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, southern Europe, and parts of South and Central America. The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with onion, tomato, or ginger. The parchment-like skin is much like the skin of an onion, and is typically removed before using in raw or cooked form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are fermented at high temperature; the resulting product, called black garlic, is sweet and syrupy, and is now being sold in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.
Garlic may be applied to different kinds of bread to create a variety of classic dishes, such as garlic bread, garlic toast, bruschetta, crostini and canapé.
Oils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of vegetables, meats, breads and pasta.
In some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. Laba garlic, prepared by soaking garlic in vinegar, is a type of pickled garlic served with dumplings in northern China to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
Lightly smoked garlic is becoming increasingly popular in British and European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews. In both these cases it is important to utilize the undiscarded skin, as much of the smoke flavor is situated there, rather than in the cloves themselves.
Immature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as "garlic spears", "stems", or "tops". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus. Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.
Mixing garlic with egg yolks and olive oil produces aioli. Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce skordalia. Blending garlic, almond, oil, and soaked bread produces ajoblanco. Yogurt mixed with garlic and salt is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.
Garlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic. If used as a substitute for fresh garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder is equivalent to one clove of garlic.

===Storage===

Domestically, garlic is stored warm 18 °C (64 °F) and dry to keep it dormant (lest it sprout). It is traditionally hung; softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or grappes. Peeled cloves may be stored in wine or vinegar in the refrigerator.[tpl]cite web|author=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428182827/http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/garlic.htm |title=GARLIC: Safe Methods to Store, Preserve and Enjoy |publisher=Cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] Commercially, garlic is stored at 0 °C (32 °F), in a dry, low-humidity environment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hair-health.uk70.com/superfoods/garlic.htm |title=Garlic Facts[/tpl] Garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached.
Garlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling. Untreated garlic kept in oil can support the growth of Clostridium botulinum which causes the deadly botulism illness; refrigeration will not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil. To reduce this risk, the oil should be refrigerated and used within one week. According to wikihow, the garlic immersed in oil should be stored in the freezer and not the fridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Store-Fresh-Garlic |title=How to Store Fresh Garlic: 12 Steps |publisher=wikiHow |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] Commercially prepared oils are widely available. Manufacturers add acids and/or other chemicals to eliminate the risk of botulism in their products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080510164154/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/iyh-vsv/food-aliment/garlic-ail_e.html |title=It's Your Health — Garlic-In-Oil |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl] Two outbreaks of botulism related to garlic stored in oil have been reported.CSU SafeFood Newsletter, Summer 2005 – Vol 9 No. 4 – Botulinum Toxin: Friend or FoeGarlic-in-Oil.

Garlic bulbs should be clean and white with a dried neck and outer skin and quite firm under pressure. They should be discarded if they are soft or spongy or show signs of mould.
In 1961, Chester Lilley from Kent in England was the first person to transform garlic into a pill form for storage.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Although not widely accepted at the time for culinary uses, a capsulate solution for both the storage and simple dosing of garlic has become commonplace.

===Historical use===

Garlic has been used as both food and medicine in many cultures for thousands of years, dating at least as far back as when the Giza pyramids were built. Garlic is still grown in Egypt, but the Syrian variety is the kind most esteemed now (see Rawlinson's Herodotus, 2.125).
Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny the Elder, and Dioscorides all mention the use of garlic for many conditions, including parasites, respiratory problems, poor digestion, and low energy. Its use in China dates back to 2000 BCE.
It was consumed by ancient Greek and Roman soldiers, sailors, and rural classes (Virgil, Ecologues ii. 11), and, according to Pliny the Elder (Natural History xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Galen eulogizes it as the "rustic's theriac" (cure-all) (see F. Adams' Paulus Aegineta, p. 99), and Alexander Neckam, a writer of the 12th century (see Wright's edition of his works, p. 473, 1863), recommends it as a palliative for the heat of the sun in field labor.
In the account of Korea's establishment as a nation, a tiger and a bear prayed to Hwanung that they may become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear remained and was transformed into a woman.
In his Natural History, Pliny gives an exceedingly long list of scenarios in which it was considered beneficial (N.H. xx. 23). Dr. T. Sydenham valued it as an application in confluent smallpox, and, says Cullen (Mat. Med. ii. p. 174, 1789), found some dropsies cured by it alone. Early in the 20th century, it was sometimes used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis or phthisis.
Garlic was rare in traditional English cuisine (though it is said to have been grown in England before 1548) and has been a much more common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for Hecate (Theophrastus, Characters, The Superstitious Man). A similar practice of hanging garlic, lemon and red chili at the door or in a shop to ward off potential evil, is still very common in India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/superstitions-garlic-does-besides-813591.html | author = Eichstaedt, K.C. | year = 2008 | title = Superstitions About Garlic: What Does it Do Besides Ward Off Vampires?|work=voices.yahoo.com[/tpl] According to Pliny, garlic and onions were invoked as deities by the Egyptians at the taking of oaths. (Pliny also stated garlic demagnetizes lodestones, which is not factual.) The inhabitants of Pelusium, in lower Egypt (who worshiped the onion), are said to have had an aversion to both onions and garlic as food.
To prevent the plant from running to leaf, Pliny (N.H. xix. 34) advised bending the stalk downward and covering with earth; seeding, he observes, may be prevented by twisting the stalk (by "seeding", he most likely meant the development of small, less potent bulbs).

===Adverse effects and toxicology===

Garlic is known for causing bad breath (halitosis), as well as causing sweat to have a pungent "garlicky" smell, which is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and from there to the mouth, causing bad breath; see garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11138979 | title = Drinking a glass of milk can stop garlic breath | work = BBC News | date = August 31, 2010 | accessdate = August 31, 2010[/tpl] Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. Plain water, mushrooms and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective.
The green, dry "folds" in the center of the garlic clove are especially pungent. The sulfur compound allicin, produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic, produces other sulfur compounds: ajoene, allyl polysulfides, and vinyldithiins. Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine.
In a rat study allicin was found to be an activator of TRPA1. The neurons released neurotransmitters in the spinal cord to generate pain signals and released neuropeptides at the site of sensory nerve activation, resulting in vasodilation, as well as inflammation.[tpl]cite pmid|11238811[/tpl] Allicin is released only by crushing or chewing raw garlic and cannot be formed from cooked garlic.
Some people suffer from allergies to garlic and other plants in the allium genus. Symptoms can include irritable bowel, diarrhea, mouth and throat ulcerations, nausea, breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Garlic-sensitive patients show positive tests to diallyl disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan and allicin, all of which are present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many plants, including onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden lilies, ginger, and bananas.

===Spiritual and religious uses===

Garlic has been regarded as a force for both good and evil. According to Cassell's Dictionary of Superstitions, there is an Islamic myth that considers that after Satan left the Garden of Eden, garlic arose in his left footprint and onion in the right. In Europe, many cultures have used garlic for protection or white magic, perhaps owing to its reputation as a potent preventative medicine. Central European folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against demons, werewolves, and vampires. To ward off vampires, garlic could be worn, hung in windows, or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes.[tpl]cite book|author=McNally, R.T.|title=In Search of Dracula|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1994|isbn=0-395-65783-0|pages=120–122[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Pickering, D.|title=Cassell's Dictionary of Superstitions|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=2003|isbn=0-304-36561-0|page=211[/tpl]
In both Hinduism and Jainism, garlic is considered to stimulate and warm the body and to increase one's desires. Some devout Hindus generally avoid using garlic and the related onion in the preparation of foods for religious festivities and events. Followers of the Jain religion avoid eating garlic and onion on a daily basis.
A belief among some Hindus is that when Devas and Asuras fought for nectar during churning of the ocean of milk (Samudramathan) in the other world, two Asuras were able to get access to nectar and had some quantity in their mouths in stealthy ways. Knowing the Asuras' foul play, God cuffed the heads of those Asuras before they could swallow it and as a result nectar fell down on the earth from their mouths in drops which later grew as garlic; that is why the vegetable has such wonderful medicinal properties.
In some Buddhist traditions, garlic – along with the other five "pungent spices" – is understood to stimulate sexual and aggressive drives to the detriment of meditation practice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/Buddhist%20Diet.htm |title=The Buddhist Diet |publisher=SFSU[/tpl]

The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks.McGee, pp. 310–311 Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.[tpl]cite journal|author=Macpherson LJ, Geierstanger BH, Viswanath V, Bandell M, Eid SR, Hwang SW, Patapoutian A|title=The pungency of garlic: Activation of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in response to allicin|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=10| year=2005|pages=929–34|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.018|pmid=15916949[/tpl]
A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the "hot" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermotransient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness. Allicin, along with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, while other allicin-derived compounds, such as vinyldithiins and ajoene show beneficial in vitro biological activity. Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the "stinking rose". When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and garlic breath the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. Allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the blood. It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.[tpl]cite book|author=Block, E.|title=Garlic and Other Alliums: The Lore and the Science|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6AB89RHV9ucC&printsec=frontcover|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2010|isbn=0-85404-190-7[/tpl]
The well-known phenomenon of "garlic breath" is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh parsley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120524001130/http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry?id=2677 |title=garlic|work=Food Dictionary, Epicurious.com |accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] The herb is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as pistou, persillade, and the garlic butter spread used in garlic bread. However, since the odor results mainly from digestive processes placing compounds such as AMS in the blood, and AMS is then released through the lungs over the course of many hours, eating parsley provides only a temporary masking. One way of accelerating the release of AMS from the body is the use of a sauna.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Because of the AMS in the bloodstream, it is believed by some to act as a mosquito repellent, but no clinically reported evidence suggests it is actually effective.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130116105611/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in419 |title=Mosquito Repellents |publisher=Edis.ifas.ufl.edu |author=Rutledge, C.

Abundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during pickling and cooking. Under these conditions (i.e. acidity, heat) the sulfur-containing compound alliinase react with common amino acids to make pyrroles, clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shinsuke Imai, Kaori Akita, Muneaki Tomotake, and Hiroshi Sawada|title=Model Studies on Precursor System Generating Blue Pigment in Onion and Garlic|journal=J.
