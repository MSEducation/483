Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park is located in the Central Highlands area of Tasmania (Australia), 165 km northwest of Hobart. The park contains many walking trails, and is where hikes along the well-known Overland Track usually begins. Major features are Cradle Mountain and Barn Bluff in the northern end, Mount Pelion East, Mount Pelion West, Mount Oakleigh and Mount Ossa in the middle and Lake St Clair in the southern end of the park. The park is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.

==Access==

Access from the south (Lake St. Clair) is usually from Derwent Bridge on the Lyell Highway. Northern access (Cradle Valley) is usually via Sheffield, Wilmot or Mole Creek. A less frequently used entrance is via the Arm River Track, from the east.

===Usage fee===

In 2005, the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service introduced a booking system and fee for use of the Overland Track over peak periods. Initially the fee was $100, but this was raised to $150 in 2007, and as at August 2011 is $180.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=7831 | title=Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania |author=National Parks website|accessdate=9 August 2011[/tpl] The money that is collected is used to finance the park ranger organisation, track maintenance, building of new facilities and rental of helicopter transport to remove waste from the toilets at the huts in the park.

===Development===

The Tasmanian Government has moved to allow development in national parks and conservations areas. An 'In principle' permit has been granted for the establishment of an 'eco-friendly' resort at Pumphouse Point at Lake St Clair.

==Flora and fauna==

The Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park is a significant location of Tasmania's endemic species—40–55% of the park's documented alpine flora is endemic.  Furthermore, 68% of the higher rainforest species recorded in alpine areas in Tasmania are present in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.  The park's alpine vegetation is very diverse and, has largely escaped forest fires that have caused neighboring regions to suffer.
Animals present in the park include: pademelons, Bennett's wallabies, quolls, Tasmanian Devils, echidnas, wombats, possums, ravens and currawongs.

===Birds===

The park has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it provides habitat for 11 of Tasmania's endemic bird species, as well as for the Flame and Pink Robins and the Striated Fieldwren. The IBA is important as a representative protected area in north-central Tasmania for those species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Cradle Mountain |accessdate=2011-06-16 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
