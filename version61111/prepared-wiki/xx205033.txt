Conrad Lanoue (October 18, 1908 â€“ October 15, 1972) was an American jazz pianist.
Lanoue began on piano at age ten and studied at the Troy Conservatory. He played locally in his birthplace of Cohoes, New York in the 1920s, then played with regional territory bands throughout the decade. In the 1930s he joined Louis Prima's band, then joined Wingy Manone from 1936 to 1940. Alongside his work with Manone, he collaborated with Joe Haymes as an arranger. He spent much of his later career in dance bands, including those of Lester Lanin, Hal Landsberry, and Charles Peterson. He retired in 1968 due to illness and died in 1972.
