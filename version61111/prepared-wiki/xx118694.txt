Football Weekly is a podcast about football, hosted by The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom. Originally provided weekly (as its name suggests), its popularity led to a mid-weekly spinoff, Football Weekly Extra. Football Weekly airs on Mondays during the European football season, after the weekend's fixtures, while Football Weekly Extra airs on Thursdays.[tpl] cite news | title = James Richardson and his pod-mates return to preview the new Premier League season | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/08/10/football_weekly_39.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=10 August 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] During the Euro 2008, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012 tournaments, the podcast was provided daily.
It is presented by James Richardson, who is joined by various Guardian journalists and correspondents, most regularly Barry Glendenning, who is often mistakenly referred to as a co-host. Despite being an English production, the show takes a notably Eurocentric view of world football matters. Particular emphasis is placed on the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga.
The show is noted for its irreverent, often iconoclastic, style and mood. Although it adheres to a traditional sports chat show format, the presenters are encouraged to digress on matters unrelated to football and to divulge marginal information from the industry normally withheld from print. As such, its level of discussion is often anecdotal, fragmentary and partial. This is in stark contrast to the normal procedures of professional sports journalism, and is a rarity among sports chat shows in general. Listener-generated jingles introducing presenters and knowingly bad sound effects were previously used but have been phased out.
