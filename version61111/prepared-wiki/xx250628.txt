[[List of convention centres in the Netherlands]]

CATEGORIES: Convention centres in the Netherlands, Lists of buildings and structures in the Netherlands

There are several convention centres in the Netherlands. Traditionally there is a distinction in the Netherlands between convention centres for meetings and those for exhibitions/trade shows. Over the past decades this distinction has become blurred, as exhibition facilities have added meeting rooms and meeting centred venues have opened exhibition halls. Also, most of the bigger hotels have built meeting rooms, some of them for large scale (international) gatherings.
