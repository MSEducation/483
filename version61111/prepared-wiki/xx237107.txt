Wapack National Wildlife Refuge was New Hampshire's first refuge and was established through a donation in 1972. The [tpl]convert|1672|acre|adj=on[/tpl] refuge is located about [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] west of Nashua, New Hampshire and encompasses the [tpl]convert|2278|ft|adj=on[/tpl] North Pack Monadnock Mountain. The refuge is a popular hawk migration area and provides nesting habitat for numerous migratory songbirds such as the American tree sparrow, Swainson's thrush, magnolia warbler, crossbills, pine grosbeaks and white-throated sparrow. The refuge also supports a wide variety of upland wildlife including deer, bear, coyote, fisher, fox, mink and weasel.
A [tpl]convert|3|mi|adj=on|0[/tpl] segment of the [tpl]convert|21|mi|adj=on[/tpl] Wapack Trail passes through the refuge and rewards hikers with a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains.
The refuge lies in the towns of Greenfield, Lyndeborough, and Temple, and is administered by the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge in Newburyport, Massachusetts.
