The Red-throated Loon or Red-throated Diver (Gavia stellata) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere. It breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. It is the most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family. Ranging from [tpl]convert|55|-|67|cm|in[/tpl] in length, the Red-throated Loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A monogamous species, the Red-throated Loon forms long-term pair bonds. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch) and feed the hatched young.
The Red-throated Loon has a large global population and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various gull species, and both Red and Arctic Foxes, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by a number of international treaties.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

First described by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the Red-throated Loon is a monotypic species, with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now-defunct genus Colymbus, which contained grebes as well as loons. By 1788, however, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the Red-throated Loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v014n03/p0312-p0313.pdf |journal=The Auk |date=July 1897 |title=The Proper Generic Name of the Loons |first=J. A. |last=Allen |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=312–313 |doi=10.2307/4068646|jstor=4068646 [/tpl] Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all belong to the same genus, it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology, and may be the basal lineage of the genus.[tpl]cite journal |last=Boertmann |first=D. |year=1990 |title=Phylogeny of the divers, family Gaviidae (Aves) |journal=Steenstrupia |volume=16 |pages=21–36[/tpl] It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic.
The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for "sea mew", as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder.[tpl]cite book |title=Diving Birds of North America |first=Paul A. |last=Johnsgard |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=bioscidivingbirds |publisher=University of Nevada–Lincoln |year=1987 |isbn = 0-8032-2566-0 [/tpl] The specific epithet stellata is Latin for "set with stars" or "starry",[tpl]cite book |last = Simpson |first=Donald Penistan| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0[/tpl] and refers to the bird's speckled back in its non-breeding plumage. "Diver" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey, while "red-throated" is a straightforward reference to the bird's most distinctive breeding plumage feature. The word "loon" is thought to have derived from the Swedish lom, the Old Norse or Icelandic lómr, or the Old Dutch loen, all of which mean "lame" or "clumsy", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land.Carboneras 1992, p. 169.

==Description==

The Red-throated Loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loon species, ranging from [tpl]convert|53|to|69|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length[tpl]#tag:ref|By convention, length is measured from the tip of the bill to the tip of the tail on a dead bird (or skin) laid on its back.Cramp 1997, p. 3|group="nb"[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-throated_Loon/lifehistory |title=All About Birds: Red-throated Loon Life History |accessdate=20 October 2011 |publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology[/tpl] with a [tpl]convert|91|-|120|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] wingspan,[tpl]cite book |last1=Svensson |first1=Lars |first2=Peter |last2=Grant |title=Collins Bird Guide |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1999 |pages=12–13 |isbn=0-00-219728-6[/tpl] and weighing [tpl]convert|1|-|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Like all loons, it is long-bodied and short-necked, with its legs set far back on its body.Cramp 1977, p. 42. The sexes are similar in appearance, although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females.Carboneras 1992, p. 162 In breeding plumage, the adult has a dark grey head and neck (with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck), a triangular red throat patch, white underparts and a dark grey-brown mantle.Cramp 1977, p. 43. It is the only loon with an all-dark back in breeding plumage.Carboneras 1992, p. 163. The non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin, foreneck and much of the face white, the top of the head and back of the neck grey, and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle.
Its bill is thin, straight and sharp, and the bird often holds it at an uptilted angle. Though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter, the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird's overall plumage change. The nostrils are narrow slits located near the base of the bill, and the iris is reddish.  One of the bird's North American folk names is pegging-awl loon, a reference to its sharply pointed bill, which resembles a sailmaker's awl (a tool also known as a "pegging awl" in New England).[tpl]cite book |title=Dictionary of American Regional English: Volume IV, P–Sk |first1=Frederic Gomes |last1=Cassidy |first2=Joan Houston |last2=Hall |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=84 |isbn=0-674-00884-7[/tpl]
Like the other members of its genus, the Red-throated Loon is well-adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their set-back position—provide excellent propulsion and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.[tpl]cite book |title=The Sibley Guide to Bird Life & Behaviour |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Sibley |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Elphick |editor3-first=John B. |editor3-last=Dunning, Jr. |year=2001 |publisher=Christopher Helm |location=London |pages=124–25 |isbn=0-7136-6250-6[/tpl]
When it first emerges from its egg, the young Red-throated Loon is covered with fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers.Cramp 1977, p. 49. The juvenile's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.
In flight, the Red-throated Loon has a distinctive profile; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.[tpl]cite book |last=Sibley |first=David |title=The Sibley Guide to Birds |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2000 |page=23 |isbn=0-679-45122-6[/tpl]

===Voice===

The adult Red-throated Loon has a number of vocalisations, which are used in different circumstances. In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles, at roughly five calls per second. Its warning call, if disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call, which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water.Cramp 1977, p. 48. Known as the "long call", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons;Carboneras 1992, p. 164. the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's.
Young have a shrill closed-bill call, which they use in begging and to contact their parents. They also have a long call used in response to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.

===Similar species===

At medium to close range, an adult Red-throated Loon in either breeding or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, at certain times in its moulting cycle or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the Black-throated Loon, but also occasionally the Great Crested Grebe. It shows more white on the head and neck than does the Black-throated Loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the Black-throated Loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the Black-throated.[tpl]cite journal |journal=British Birds |volume=79 |issue=8 | pages=365–91 |first1=R.

==Habitat and distribution==

The Red-throated Loon breeds primarily in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the German Bight, for example.[tpl]cite book |title=Progress in Marine Conservation in Europe: Natura 2000 Sites in German Offshore Waters |first1=Henning |last1=von Nordheim |first2=Dieter |last2=Boedeker |first3=Jochen |last3=Krause |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-33291-6 |location=Berlin |page=85[/tpl] Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites.
In North America, it winters regularly along both coasts, ranging as far south as the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California in northwestern Mexico; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior Mexican state of Hidalgo.[tpl]cite book |title=A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America |first=Steve N. G. |last=Howell |coauthors=Sophie Webb |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=92 |isbn=0-19-854012-4[/tpl] Some of its folk names in northeastern North America—including cape race, cape brace, cape drake and cape racer, as well as corruptions such as scapegrace—originated from its abundance around Cape Race, Newfoundland.[tpl]cite book |title=Dictionary of American Regional English: Volume1, A–C |first1=Frederic Gomes |last1=Cassidy |first2=Joan Houston |last2=Hall |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-674-20511-1 |page=539[/tpl]  In Europe, it breeds in Iceland, northern Scotland, northwestern Ireland (a few pairs only), Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters along the coast as far south as parts of Spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways, including the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas, as well as large rivers, lakes and reservoirs.Cramp 1977, p. 45. It has occurred as a vagrant as far south as Morocco, Tunisia and the Gambia. In Asia, it breeds in the northern stretches of Siberia, and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as China, Japan and Taiwan. It has occurred as a vagrant in Mongolia.

==Behaviour==

Because its feet are located so far back on its body, the Red-throated Loon is quite clumsy walking on land; however, it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea.[tpl]cite journal |journal=British Birds |title=On the Method of Progression on Land of a Young Red-throated Diver |volume=8 |issue=10 | date = March 1915 |pages=241–43 |last=Haviland |first=Maud D.[/tpl] It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land.[tpl]cite journal |journal=British Birds |last=Mead-Waldo |first=E.

The Red-throated Loon is a diurnal migrant, which travels singly or in loose groups, often high above the water. In eastern North America (and possibly elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore;[tpl]cite journal |title=Loon migrations off the coast of the northeastern United States |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v095n01/p0125-p0132.pdf |journal=Wilson Bulletin |volume=95 | year =1983 |issue=1 |pages=125–32 |first=Kevin D. |last=Powers |coauthors=Cherry, Jeffrey[/tpl] Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds.Carboneras 1992, p. 168.

However, unlike other loons—which undergo this moult in late winter—the Red-throated Loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v079n04/p0416-p0420.pdf |journal=The Wilson Bulletin |volume=79 | year = 1967 |issue=4 |pages=416–20 |first=Glen E. |last=Wolfenden |title=Selection for a Delayed Simultaneous Wing Molt in Loons (Gaviidae)[/tpl]

===Food and feeding===

Like all members of its family, the Red-throated Loon is primarily a fish-eater, though it sometimes feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic invertebrates, insects, fish spawn or even plant material.Carboneras 1992, p. 171. It seizes rather than spears its prey, which is generally captured underwater.[tpl]cite book |author=Ehrlich, Paul R. |coauthors=Dobkin, David S.; Wheye, Darryl; Pimm, Stuart L. |title=The Birdwatcher's Handbook |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK |year=1994 |page=2 |isbn=0-19-858407-5[/tpl] Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion, it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Use of the Wings and Feet by Diving Birds |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v026n03/p0234-p0248.pdf |journal=The Auk |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=234–48 |first=Charles W. |last=Townsend |date=July 1909 |format=PDF |doi=10.2307/4070795|jstor=4070795 [/tpl] Pursuit dives range from [tpl]convert|2|-|9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in depth, with an average underwater time of about a minute. Its fish diet increases the Red-throated Loon's vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, both of which bioaccumulate, thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) at or near the top of the food chain.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Arctic |title=Status of Marine Birds of the Southeastern Beaufort Sea |year=2002 |first1=D.

For the first few days after hatching, young Red-throated Loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents. After 3–4 days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do.Cramp 1977, p. 46 Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometers from any breeding areas.[tpl]cite journal |journal=British Birds |volume=91 |page=231 |title=Red-throated Diver feeding young in October |last=Hart |first=Alan S. |coauthors=Jardine, David C. and Colin Hewitt |date=June 1998 |issue=6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |journal=British Birds |volume=95 |page=313 |author=Barber, S.

===Breeding and survival===

The Red-throated Loon is a monogamous species which forms long-term pair bonds. Both sexes build the nest, which is a shallow scrape (or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers, and placed within a half-metre (18 in) of the edge of a small pond. The female lays two eggs (though clutches of 1–3 have been recorded); they are incubated for 24–29 days, primarily by the female. The eggs, which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black, measure [tpl]convert|75|x|46|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and have a mass of [tpl]convert|83|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl], of which 8% is shell. Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid, so they hatch asynchronously. If a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding, for example) before the young hatch, the Red-throated Loon usually lays a second clutch, generally in a new nest.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Journal of Field Ornithology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=282–283 |title=Replacement clutches in the Red-throated Loon |first1=Douglas |last1=Schamel |first2=Diane M. |last2=Tracy |date=Summer 1985 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v056n03/p0282-p0283.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] The young birds are precocial upon hatching: downy and mobile with open eyes. Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially, then small fish for 38–48 days. Parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young. Ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do and others the opposite.
In the wild, the oldest known Red-throated Loon lived for more than two decades; it was found, oiled and dead, on a beach in Sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been ringed (banded).[tpl]cite web |author=Staav, Roland; Fransson, Thor |year=2008 |publisher=EURING: The European Union for Bird Ringing |url=http://www.euring.org/data_and_codes/longevity-voous.htm |title=European Longevity Records |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]

==Conservation status and threats==

Although the Red-throated Loon is not a globally threatened species, as it has a large population and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Groves |first1=Deborah J. |last2=Conant |first2=Bruce |last3=King |first3=Rodney J. |last4=Hodges |first4=John I. |last5=King |first5=James G. |title=Status and trends of loon populations summering in Alaska, 1971–1993 |journal=The Condor |volume=98 |pages=189–95 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v098n02/p0189-p0195.pdf |doi=10.2307/1369136 |year=1996 |issue=2[/tpl] and counts have dropped in continental Europe as well. In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6980265.stm |title=Rise in divers mystifies experts |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 September 2007 | date=7 September 2007[/tpl] In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000 individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.

As recently as the 1800s, the behaviour of the Red-throated Loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob20.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |title=Red-throated Diver |accessdate=27 June 2008[/tpl] In the Orkney and Shetland islands of Scotland, the species is still known as the "rain goose" in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities. The people of Faroe Islands believed that if the Red-throated Loon miaowed like a cat, then rain was imminent, while a call of gaa-gaa-gaa or turkatrae-turkatrae predicted fine weather.[tpl]cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Edward A.|title=The Folklore of Birds|location=New York, NY |publisher=Dover Publications|year=1970|isbn=0-486-22145-8|origyear=1958|pages=62–63[/tpl]
