The company began as "Stettinius associates-Liberia, Inc.", a company founded in 1948 by Edward Stettinius, Jr. to operate flag of convenience registry in Liberia. After a series of mergers Stettinius associates became IRI. IRI then moved from Liberia to the Marshall Islands after Liberia's president Charles Taylor demanded too much money from the company.Rodney Carlisle, "The 'American Century' implemented: Stettinius and the Liberian flag of convenience", The Business History Review, 54, no.2 (1980).Khadija Sharife, "Oil makes its own laws", Le Monde Diplomatique English Edition, July 2010, p.1.
