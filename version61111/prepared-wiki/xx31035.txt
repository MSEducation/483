Due to recent development running north from Guildford, and linking to the Woking area, Guildford now officially forms the southwestern tip of the Greater London Built-up Area, as defined by the Office for National Statistics.

==History==

===Etymology===

The root of the first part may be gold rather than Guild, a society or meeting of tradesmen: the only known 10th century (Saxon) record uses Guldeford and in the 11th century Geldeford[tpl]#tag:ref|Geldefort, Geldesfort, Gildeforda, Gildeforde (12th century); Geldeford, Guldeford (13th and 14th centuries); Gylford and Guldeford (15th and 16th centuries); Guildeford, Gildford, Gilford, and Gillford (16th and 18th centuries).|group= n[/tpl]; both meaning gold and ford. Local historians on toponyms cite the lack of gold in the regions's sedimentary rocks and have suggested that this gold may refer to golden flowers by the ford,[tpl]cite web|title=The Good Move Guide : Guildford History|url=http://www.thegoodmoveguide.com/Locations/Surrey/Boroughs/Guildford/leisure/guildfordhistory.htm|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl] or the golden sand;[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief History of Guildford|url=http://www.localhistories.org/guildford.html|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl] several older sources such as Lewis's topological dictionary of 1848 prefer and give an unreferenced assertion there was a guild.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50993 |title=Groton – Gunnerton |author=Samuel Lewis (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1848 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |accessdate=29 October 2012 [/tpl]  There is an old coaching Inn on the Epsom Road previously called the 'Sanford Arms' may derives from 'Sand Ford', adding weight to the suggestion that the first part of Guildford and its many historic predecessors may refer to the very distinctive golden sand showing on the banks of the River Wey where it cuts through the sandy outcrop just south of the town.[tpl]cite web|title=Travel and Tourism Gossip : Guildford|url=http://www.travelandtourism-gossip.com/2011/10/guildford-hotels/|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl]

===Early settlement===

In Sir Thomas Malory's early 1485 fictional series Le Morte d'Arthur, Guildford is identified with Astolat of Arthurian renown.Guildford- A Residential Centre.

===The Dark and Middle Ages===

It is proven by archaeology and contemporary accounts that Guildford was established as a small town by Saxon settlers shortly after Roman authority had been removed from Britain[tpl]#tag:ref|This era was c.410AD|group= n[/tpl]. The settlement was likely expanded because of the Harrow Way (an ancient trackway including the ancient cities of Winchester and Canterbury crosses the River Wey at this point, via a ford).
Alfred the Great, the first Anglo-Saxon king of unified England named the town in his will and from 978 until a change of location part-way through the reign of William the Conqueror, Guildford was the location of the Royal Mint.
Guildford Castle is of Norman design, although there are no documents about its earliest years.[tpl]cite web|title=Guildford Borough Council : History of Guildford Castle|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/article/7576/History-of-Guildford-Castle|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl] Its situation overlooks the pass through the hills taken by the Pilgrims' Way, and also, presumably, once overlooked the ancient ford across the Wey, thus giving a key point of military control of this hardy long distance way across the country.  [tpl]#tag:ref|Other regional tall fortress castles include Windsor Castle surveying forces that might take the Bath Road, Farnham Castle one of the same axes, Arundel Castle surveying the Arun and the Tower of London surveying ships moving up the Thames|group= n[/tpl].
Guildford appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Geldeford and Gildeford, a holding of William the Conqueror. The King officially held the 75 hagæ (houses enclosed in fences or closes) wherein lived 175 homagers (heads of household) and the town rendered £32.Domesday Book entry of 1086. Stoke, a suburb within today's Guildford, appears in the Book as Stoch and was also held by William. Its domesday assets were: 1 church, 2 mills worth 5s, 16 ploughlands with two Lord's plough teams and 20 mens plough teams, [tpl]convert|16|acre|m2[/tpl] of meadow, and woodland worth 40 hogs. Stoke was listed as being in the King's park, with a rendering of £15.Domesday Book entry of 1086.Surrey Domesday Book
William the Conqueror used the Harrow Way when he sacked the countryside, including Guildford, after his victory at the Battle of Hastings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  He then had the castle built in the classic Norman style, the keep of which still stands. A major purpose of Norman castle building was to overawe the conquered population and it had the considerable improvements sum of £26 spent on it in 1173 under the regency of the young Henry II.Pipe R. 20 Hen. II  As the threat of invasion and insurrection declined the castle's status was demoted to that of a royal hunting lodge as Guildford was, at that time, at the edge of Windsor Great Park. It was visited on several occasions by King John, Eleanor of Aquitaine and King Henry III. In 1611 the castle was granted to Francis CarterPat. Roll 9 James I pt. iii, manuscript 5 whose grandson's initials EC and the year 1699 were above the entrance way.  The surviving parts of the castle were restored in Victorian times and then in 2004; the rest of the grounds became a pleasant public garden.[ref]

In the 14th century the Guildhall was constructed and still stands today as a noticeable landmark of Guildford. The north end was extended in 1589 and the Council Chamber was added in 1683. It was in 1683 when a projecting clock was made for the front of the building and can be seen throughout the High Street.

===Post Renaissance/Dissolution of the Monasteries===

In 1598, a court case referred to a sport called kreckett being played at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford which was built in 1509 and became Royal gaining the patronage of Edward VI in 1552. The Oxford English Dictionary gives this as the first recorded instance of cricket in the English language.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Cricket|url=http://www.infobritain.co.uk/History_Of_Cricket.htm|accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Birley|first=Derek|title=A Social History of English Cricket|year=1999|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=1-85410-941-3|page=5[/tpl]
In 1619 George Abbot founded the Hospital of the Holy Trinity, now commonly known as Abbot's Hospital,A Guide to the Hospital of the Blessed Trinity Guildford. J.W.Penycate 1976 one of the finest sets of almshouses in the country.  It is sited at the top end of the High Street, opposite Holy Trinity church. The brick-built, three-storey entrance tower faces the church; a grand stone archway leads into the courtyard. On each corner of the tower there is an octagonal turret rising an extra floor, with lead ogee domes.
One of the greatest boosts to Guildford’s prosperity came in 1653 with the completion, after many wrangles, of the Wey Navigation. This made it possible for Guildford businesses to access the Thames at Weybridge by boat and predated the major canal building program in Britain by more than a century. In 1764 the navigation was extended as far as Godalming and in 1816 to the sea at Arundel via the Wey and Arun Junction Canal and the Arun Navigation. The Basingstoke Canal also was built to connect with the Wey navigation, putting Guildford in the centre of a network of waterways.

===Post Industrial Revolution===

The Chilworth Gunpowder works operated right through the Industrial Revolution, transported much of their wares through Guildford and its toll paid canal network.Chilworth Gunpowder Works Surrey (Archaeological investigation report series), Wayne D Cocroft, 2003, English Heritage, London.
A branch of the London and South-Western railway was opened in May 1845, to Guildford; its initial spur from Woking of six miles. In 1846, Acts were passed for making two railways from Guildford one leading to Godalming, and the other to Farnham and Alton; and in the same year, an Act was obtained for a railway from Reading, by Guildford, to Dorking and Reigate.  All of these followed in the nineteenth century and remain.National Rail route search  The Guildford Union Workhouse Casuals Ward provided accommodation for many of the casual workers on the railways.
In the years from 1820 to 1865 Guildford was the scene of severe outbursts of semi-organised lawlessness commonly known as the “Guy Riots”. The Guys would mass on the edge of the town from daybreak on Guy Fawkes Night, wearing masks or bizarre disguises and armed with clubs and lighted torches. With the onset of nightfall they would enter the town and avenge themselves on those who had crossed them in the preceding year by committing assaults and damaging property, often looting the belongings of victims from their houses and burning them on bonfires in the middle of the street. In later years attempts to suppress the Guys led to the deaths of two police officers. In 1866 and 1868 the Guys were dispersed by cavalry and this seems to have brought an end to the riots. Similar disorder surrounding the St Catherine’s Hill Fair, held just outside the town on the Pilgrims' Way, was suppressed around the same time.[tpl]Cite book| title=The Guildford Guy Riots| author=Gavin Morgan|year=1992|publisher= Northside Books |isbn=978-0-9520205-0-9[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/bonfire-night/features/the-guildford-guy-riots | title= icons.org.uk The Guildford Guy Riots[/tpl]  In 1906 the Guildford Union Workhouse Casuals Ward The Spike was built in Union Lane (Now Warren Road) on the grounds of the Workhouse, not far from the castle and this is today a tourist attraction.Surrey Council Council's tourist pages – The Spike
After the 1882 death of their father, brothers Charles Arthur and Leonard Gates took over the running of his shop, which held the local distribution franchise for Gilbey's wines and spirits, and also sold beer. However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the temperance movement, and hence poured their entire stock into the gutters of the High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy. Using a milk separator, they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for pig feed. In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, which after development of its dried milk baby formula in 1906 became Cow & Gate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wincantonplc.com/wincanton/history.jsp?tn=1&sn=1|title=History & Business|publisher=Wincanton Plc|accessdate=26 April 2008[/tpl]

On 5 October 1974, bombs planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army went off in two Guildford pubs, killing four off-duty soldiers and a civilian. The pubs were targeted because soldiers from barracks near Guildford were known to frequent them.Study by the University of Ulster The subsequently arrested suspects, who became known as the Guildford Four, were convicted and sentenced to long prison sentences in October 1975. They claimed to have been tortured by the police and denied involvement in the bombing. In 1989 after a long legal battle, their convictions were overturned and they were released.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/19/newsid_2490000/2490039.stm | title=BBC News: 19 October 1989 | accessdate=12 February 2007 | date=19 October 1989[/tpl]

==Education==

===State schools===

As for the rest of Surrey, Guildford's state schools operate a two/three age groups system. Primary schools in the town include Holy Trinity (which merged with Pewley Down in 1995), Burpham, St Thomas of Canterbury (Catholic) and Goldford Grove. Amongst the Junior schools are Bushy Hill, Northmead Junior and Queen Eleanor's C of E. Secondary schools include George Abbot, Guildford County School, St Peter's, King's College and Christ's College.

===Independent schools===

The best-known school in Guildford itself is the Royal Grammar School. The 'old school' building which was constructed over the turn of the Tudor and Elizabethan periods and houses a chained library, lies towards the top of High Street. The school was established in 1509. Nearby is the prep school Lanesborough School which is the choir school for Guildford Cathedral and has had a long association with the Royal Grammar School. Other private schools include Guildford High School, Tormead School and Rydes Hill Preparatory School.

===Higher education===

The campus of the University of Surrey is in Guildford. Battersea College of Technology (previously the Battersea Polytechnic Institute) moved to the town in 1966, gaining a Royal Charter in order to award its own degrees and changing its name to its current title.
The town is home to the inaugural campus of The University of Law[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.college-of-law.co.uk/about_us/about-1334.html|title=A Brief History 1960's|publisher=The College of Law|accessdate=20 March 2008[/tpl] and to the Guildford School of Acting. Other institutions in Guildford include Guildford College of Further and Higher Education (which also occupies the site of the former Guildford School of Art), Academy of Contemporary Music and the Italia Conti Arts Centre.

==Administration==

The town of Guildford forms part of the larger area administered by the borough of Guildford, which in turn forms part of the county of Surrey. Whilst the rest of the borough's area is split into civil parishes, the urban area of Guildford in unparished. Thus, within the town of Guildford, the Borough Council takes the role of both first and second tier local authority, whilst the County Council forms the third tier of local authority.
Though often referred to as a city Guildford is a town, but has applied for city status several times. Guildford's 2002 application to be granted the status of a city was unsuccessful, losing out to Preston, the only English town that was formally recognised as a city as part of the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Traditionally, the establishment of a diocesan cathedral in a town conferred city status. Guildford is a significant economic hub in Surrey, a county with no city.
Even though Guildford is the county town for Surrey, the council itself has its administrative base in Kingston upon Thames[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/County+Hall?opendocument | title= Surrey County Council Website: County Hall | accessdate=12 February 2007[/tpl] which, although formerly in Surrey, is now in Greater London. Public sector organisations of note that have headquarters in Guildford include Surrey Police, the South East England Development Agency and the Government Office for the South East.
Politically, the constituency of Guildford is thought of as a traditional Conservative seat. However, for the first time in over ninety years, the 2001 general election returned a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, Sue Doughty. The 2003 Borough Elections returned a majority council for the Conservative party, replacing the Liberal Democrat-controlled council. In the 2005 general election Guildford returned a Conservative Party MP, Anne Milton – by a narrow margin (0.7% of the voting electorate, or 347 votes) and despite a 0.5% rise in the Liberal Democrat vote. The Conservatives also held the council majority in the local elections of 2007.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/councils/html/43ud.stm | title= BBC News- Election 2007– Local Council Elections- Guildford Council| accessdate=4 May 2007 |date=4 May 2007[/tpl]

==Business==

Guildford is a thriving commercial town with the 2011 Financial Times annual list of Top 500 Global Companies listing five major businesses with a significant presence in the town[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.ft.com/reports/ft-500-2011 | title=Financial Times top 500 Global Companies|year=2011 | accessdate=24 December 2011| quote=List includes Philips Electronics, Ericsson, Colgate-Palmolive, Allianz and Sanofi[/tpl] – the list includes Philips Electronics, Ericsson, Colgate-Palmolive, Allianz and Sanofi.

==Localities==

===Bellfields===

Bellfields is a suburb in the north of Guildford lying adjacent to Slyfield Industrial Estate and Stoughton. The area includes private estates as well as current and former social housing estates.  Christ's College, Guildford's senior school and Pond Meadow special needs school are in Bellfields.  The neighbourhood includes St Peter's Shared Church. Guildford Children's Centre is here and has many pupils.Ofsted report of Guildford Children's Centre Bellfields has its own local newsletter.

===Burpham===

This now very large village attached to Guildford has its own article, see Burpham

===Charlotteville===

Charlotteville is the area south-east of the town. It is loosely bound between Shalford Road and Sydenham Road, and encompasses the beauty spot of Pewley Down. A number of public footpaths lead from the town through Charlotteville to the downs and towards St Martha's Hill and Albury. It houses great many cottages and a few large, mostly privately owned properties and has the town's main cycling club founded in 1903. Guildford's mayor was its first president. The estate was funded by a wealthy doctor, Thomas Sells, laid out by the Guildford architect Henry Peak in 1862, and named after Sells's wife, Charlotte.

====Workhouse====

Uniquely the Union Workhouse Casual Ward has been converted into a remarkable community centre and is a hub of activity day and night, home to the Montessori School, the centre for all manner of activities; physical, artistic, musical and creative. The adjacent St Luke’s surgery and Boots the Chemist provides Medical care, thus all generations seemingly catered for.  
The Heritage Centre historically known as the Spike has been restored in part to retell the fate of the vagrant and indeed, the casuals, many of whom had a large part to play in the building of this Town.   
A strong sense of belonging exists in Charlotteville and just 150 years after the village was founded it continues to flourish as a community.

====Conservation Area====

The official designation of the heart of Charlotteville as a Conservation Area means that most of Peak’s work will survive.
Socially, the development was a resounding success with institutions like the Cork Club and a cycling club Charlotteville Cycling Club which achieved national reputation and the charity Charlotteville Jubilee Trust formed at the time of the Golden Jubilee and still working hard in the community.
Two modern schools have been established in the village and though they obviously draw on a much wider catchment area it means that local children can walk to school. The very last of the shops closed in 2006, victim of car parking and the supermarket.

====Workhouse and Hospital====

1930 hailed the end of the Poor Laws and Guildford Union Workhouse, next to Cooper Road Samuel Cooper (surgeon) was renamed Warren Road Hospital playing a vital role in the war effort it received victims of the London Bombings and specifically Dunkirk and D-Day victims.  The Spike, a vagrants and casuals ward, continued as an overnight shelter for the homeless until 1963.

====St Luke's Hospital====

With the arrival of the Welfare State the hospital changed its name again, this time to St Luke's Hospital and was soon a leading Cancer and Nurses Teaching Hospital.  Coyle Community Hall was built and shared with the Charlotteville community much to the relief of the community who had lost their Tabernacle.  
The 1990s saw St Luke’s Hospital moving to the newly built Royal Surrey County Hospital leaving the site to Crest Homes and within days Charlotteville once again found itself without a community centre, financial enterprise had struck at the soul of the community.

====The Spike====

Due to be demolished in 2003 and replaced by a new Community Centre the Spike Casual Ward was surprisingly, bestowed with Grade II listing and has been converted into a community and Heritage Centre open to the public. http://www.charlotteville.co.uk.  The Spike retains the only stone breaking cells that can be viewed by the public in the country.

===Guildford Park and Dennisville===

These small residential neighbourhoods are immediately south of and generally below Cathedral Hill also known as Stag Hill.  Both neighbourhoods are close to Guildford Train station to the southeast and become without division Onslow Village to the south.  As the University occupies the top and north of Stag Hill, many residents here study at the University of Surrey.

===Jacobs Well===

===Merrow===

This now very large village attached to Guildford has its own article, see Merrow

===Onslow Village===

Onslow Village is the sloped suburb on the western outskirts of Guildford. It with one outlying road continuation, forms a wedge between the A3 road and A31 roads south of the junction of the A3 and Egerton Road, Guildford's Cathedral Turn and directly below Henley Fort, an 1880s built London Defence Position and a Scheduled Monument.Henley Fort [tpl]NHLE|num=1019286[/tpl]  The area consists of a number of residential streets many of which are characterised by beech hedges. Parts of Onslow Village have been designated as conservation areas,Onslow Village Conservation area appraisal enforcing a number of planning restrictions that are intended to protect the character and identity of the locality. It has the  5th Guildford Scout Group a community news website, a Tennis Club and Onslow Arboretum.
It has a small village centre, with a parade of shops and a village hall. There is a recreational ground, tennis courts, and an arboretum. Onslow has one infant school, Onslow Infant School,  as well as Queen Eleanor's School, a primary school. Onslow also has its own church, All Saints.
Onslow Village also has its own football team called Onslow FC established in 1986.
The Village also has a Residents' association, the Onslow Village Residents' Association (OVRA) which was set up in 1956 and whose object is to "safeguard the amenities of Onslow village and to promote the welfare, interests and well-being of the residents".OVRA website Onslow Village Society formed with the aim to tackle the acute shortage of decent working class housing following the First World War.history section of Onslow Village website
Onslow Village Ltd acquired 646 acres (just over one square mile) of land from Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow in 1920 for approximately one quarter of its market value at the time. The aim was to create a "Garden City" to be modelled on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard's Garden City Movement. It was their intention to build a self-contained community with smallholdings, public buildings, open spaces, recreation grounds, woodland and a railway station, as well as developing sites for churches, hotels and factories.  On Saturday 1 May 1920, ten weeks after the formation of the Society, the foundations of the first two houses were laid and by March 1922 ninety-one houses had been built. Unfortunately due to a lack of funding the scheme never reached full completion, with about 600 houses actually being built. Original drawings however showed that there were further plans to develop the farmland at Manor Farm, north of the A3. By the mid-1970s, one third of the properties were still owned by Onslow Village Ltd. Then, in 1984, the company was wound up and many shareholders and tenants had the chance to buy their homes at extremely affordable prices.
Onslow Village never got its railway station, however it did eventually get its woodland: the Onslow arboretum, developed by Guildford Borough Council as a specialist collection of eighty tree species from around the world. The Onslow arboretum is positioned right next to the play area with its own park, a large field, several tennis courts, toilets and a scout hut.

===Park Barn===

Park Barn consists of former and present social housing estate in Guildford. It is bordered to the south by the railway line, the east by the A3 and Woodbridge Hill, the north by the Aldershot Road and Rydes Hill, sometimes mapped as part of it but in Worplesdon civil parish, and the west by Broadstreet Common. 
The Surrey Advertiser newspaper described Park Barn as "one of the most deprived areas of Surrey" in the 11 September 1998 publication and in October that year reported Park Barn as coming 28th in the county's league table of 30 deprived areas. Gillard D., (1999) King's Manor School: an experiment in privatisation?
Park Barn Estate is home to King's College, a school for 11- to 18-year-olds, whose exams results have improved dramatically. There are also a number of primary schools in the area of Park Barn, including Guildford Grove School, which has a specialist sign-supported rescue base on the site that supports pupils with profound hearing impairments.[tpl]citation |  publisher = OFSTED | url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/785755/urn/132758.pdf |title=Inspection Report Guildford Grove Primary School |author=Raymond Jardine |year=2003[/tpl]
Football team Park Barn FC recently started up, playing in League 4 of the Guildford and Woking Alliance League.

===Stoughton===

Stoughton is a mainly residential suburb north of Guildford town centre in Surrey.
It is the location of the former Stoughton Army Barracks (redeveloped for housing in the 1990s and renamed Cardwells Keep). Today only the impressive three-storey Keep, outer walls, entrance gateway and several two-storey barrack blocks survive but the site has an interesting history and was also used as the main location for the film Carry on Sergeant, released in 1958 and which was the first of 26 'Carry On' films.
Also in Stoughton is The Wooden Bridge pub where both the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton performed concerts at the early stages of their respective careers.  Another pub of historic note was The Royal Hotel in Worplesdon Road, which hosted an early U2 concert and was owned by the former wrestler Mick McManus. This closed its doors in 2009 however, and the building is now host to a Chinese restaurant.
Stoughton has one junior school, Northmead Junior School.

===Slyfield===

Is the small mixed land use area north of Guildford that is largely indeterminate from Bellfields, however to its east is Guildford's largest industrial and commercial park, Slyfield Industrial Estate.  There was a cattle market held in the south of the industrial area until 2000 which moved to Maidstone, Kent.The Reading Chronicle story on cattle market.
Slyfield has a community hall and a school.  To the north of Slyfield is the gentle Stoke Hill, on top of which is a park, Stringer's Common, across which is the Jacobs Well neighbourhood which is part of Worplesdon civil parish.

===Stoke===

The central northern area of the town contains Stoke Park summarised in Culture, and the historic manor of Stoke at its centre, now the site of Guildford College.  Within Stoke is the Guildford Spectrum leisure and sports centre see above.  To the south of this mostly residential neighbourhood is London Road railway station, Guildford's secondary railway station.
On Stoke Road here there is a listed hotel, The Stoke,The Stoke Hotel [tpl]NHLE|num=1029231[/tpl] which is  just up a gentle slope from the Dapdune Wharf area of Guildford with its visitor centre, water tours mentioned above, many narrowboats and a large public playing field.

===Westborough===

Located adjacent to the Park Barn Estate, the Westborough Estate was built in the 1920s due to the growing population at the start of the 20th Century.
Westborough is home to the United Reformed Church and to a Community Primary School located on Southway.
Some of the main streets located in Westborough include Southway, Foxburrows Avenue and Woodside Road.

==Transport==

===Rail===

Two railway stations are in the town. The main station, Guildford, has its own footbridge by the Friary Shopping Centre though on the west side of the River Wey and serves the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour, the town's main station. There are also direct lines to Aldershot, Reading, Gatwick Airport via Dorking and Redhill  and alternative London routes which pass through Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon and Epsom.
There is also one daily long-distance service to Newcastle upon Tyne, via Reading, Oxford, Birmingham, Derby, Sheffield, Doncaster and York.
Guildford's other station, London Road, is to the north east of the town centre lying on the New Guildford Line. It is served by stopping services only between Guildford and Waterloo. This station sees four trains an hour both ways, two via Cobham, and two Waterloo services via Epsom. These services are operated by South West Trains.
A low level of peak hour services are operated by Southern terminating at London Bridge via Sutton from both stations.

===Road===

Guildford lies at the beginning of the A31 and is bypassed by the A3, which links London and Portsmouth. The M25 is to the north-east of the town.

===Bus===

Bus services in Guildford are primarily operated by Arriva with some additional services provided by Countryliner, Safeguard and Stagecoach. Most routes are centred on the bus station which is attached to the Friary shopping centre. Many internal bus services within Guildford are loop shaped circulars (starting and ending at the bus station) with different numbers for the clockwise and anticlockwise services. There are also services to many surrounding towns and villages including Woking and Aldershot.
Due to the location of the main railway station on the other side of the river from the bus station, only a small proportion of bus services stop at the railway station leading to poor integration between bus and rail services. To address this issue, the Guildford Shuttle was introduced in 2000. It was a town centre circular service linking up various areas of the town centre. It was free until the borough council withdrew funding for it in August 2008, at which point the route was withdrawn.Surrey Advertiser: Wheels fall off alternatives to shuttle bus The operator of the service reintroduced it in January 2009 on a commercial basis, however withdrew it again in May 2010.
There is also a park and ride service, with three main sites at Artington, Merrow and the Spectrum.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Guildford+town+park+and+ride?opendocument | title=Surrey Country Council – Guildford town park and ride | accessdate=29 September 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803022832/http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Guildford+town+park+and+ride?opendocument| archivedate = 3 August 2008[/tpl] A fourth park and ride site, close to the Surrey Sports Park, was opened in late 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/fourth-park-and-ride-site-up-running-6366202 | title=Fourth park and ride service for Guildford | accessdate=3 December 2013[/tpl]
