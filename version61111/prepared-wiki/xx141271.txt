==Programming==

Being in the coverage of major stations in Tokyo, its major expected role is to provide prefecture specific programming to Saitama prefecture's residents. Local government information, local business and racing programs are in the genre. Sports by the local amateur and professional clubs earn high viewership for the station. J. League football (soccer) and Saitama Seibu Lions baseball game programs are sold to other JAITS and some "dependent" stations. 
Compared with the major network stations, it is one of the JAITS stations which have the lower average ratings (meaning the cheaper sponsorship fee) in the large reachable population. The later beginning and the earlier ending hours of live and / or scheduled programs allow flexible programming. A few single episodes or short series of Japanese animation (anime) are also broadcast and are called "UHF anime". It also broadcasts brokered programming such as religion shows and infomercials. Teletama also runs its own shopping program.
