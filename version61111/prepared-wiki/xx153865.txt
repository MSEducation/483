St. Mary's mascot is the tiger, and its school colors are blue and white. The sports teams have been successful as of late, including three straight district championships in basketball (including a trip to the second round of the class 1A state playoffs in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 and a trip to the quarterfinals in 2011-2012), and district championships in football in both 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 (including trips to the second round of the playoffs in both years).
