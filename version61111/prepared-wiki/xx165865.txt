[[Speedway World Pairs Championship]]

CATEGORIES: Speedway World Pairs Championship, World Speedway Championships

The Speedway World Pairs Championship was an annual speedway (motorcycling) event held each year in different countries. The first competition was held in 1968 and the final competition was held in 1993. From 1994 it was merged with the World Team Cup to create the current Speedway World Cup.

==Rules==

The final was competed between seven national teams, and each national team was represented by two riders. Each pairing rode against each other once. The pair with the highest combined score were declared the Champions. From 1991, a third rider could act as reserve.
The 1968 and 1969 events, were not considered to be official championship meetings, even though medals were given out in the 1969 event.
