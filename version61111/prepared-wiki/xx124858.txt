==Music video==

The music video features David Beaudoin, the same boy from the "Love Generation" and "World, Hold On" videos. In this video, the boy "performs" the song (with two young girls) as Sean Paul, The Beatles, Bob Marley and Anthony Kiedis, along with other stylised performances as John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, Outkast and AC/DC. The video also includes parodies of other music videos, such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (Nirvana), "Cry Me a River" (Justin Timberlake) and "Thriller" (Michael Jackson). Bob Sinclar appears in the middle of the music video as a neighbor next door who comes to the house's door step to complain about the loud music being played by the boy in the house.
