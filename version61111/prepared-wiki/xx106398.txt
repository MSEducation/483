==Plot==

Radhe Mohan (Salman Khan), a rowdy ex-college boy who, after a ragging (hazing) session, loses his heart to first year student Nirjara (Bhumika Chawla), a traditional Brahmin girl. Just when Nirjara reciprocates his love, Radhey is attacked by a gang of thugs, loses his mind and is admitted to an ashram where, it is hoped, the more traditional means of treatment could have a therapeutic effect on him.
Eventually he returns to normal, and rushes back to Nirjara's house, only to find that she has committed suicide, because her family were forcing her to marry Rameshwara (Ravi Kishan). After accepting this fact he returns to the ashram.

==Reception==

Tere Naam garnered overwhelmingly buoyant reviews. Subhash K Jha of Times of India waxed lyrical about Salman claiming that the  actor had outshone even Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. " Obsessive unrequited love has been done by many actors in the past from Dilip Kumar in Mehboob Khan's Andaz to Amitabh Bacchan in Parwana to Shah Rukh Khan in Anjaam. But none has done it with such stunning physical and emotional aggression. Salman takes over the show with gut-wrenching and finally devastating impact."[tpl]cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bollywood/Tere-Naam/movie-review/133663.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Tere Naam - The Times of India[/tpl]
