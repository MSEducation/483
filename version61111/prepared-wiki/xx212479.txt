The discography of Biffy Clyro, a Scottish rock band, consists of six studio albums, one compilation, twenty-eight singles, one extended play and two DVDs. 
After the release of the single "Iname" and EP thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow, Biffy Clyro released their debut album Blackened Sky in 2002, which included the singles "27", "Justboy", "57" and "Joy.Discovery.Invention", which were released during 2001 and 2002. In 2003, they released their second studio album The Vertigo of Bliss, which peaked at #48 in the UK albums chart and it produced their first UK top 40 single "Questions and Answers", which peaked at #26. In 2005, Biffy Clyro's third album Infinity Land debuted at #47 on the UK albums chart. It spawned three top 40 singles in the UK; with those being "Glitter and Trauma", My Recovery Injection" and "Only One Word Comes To Mind". It would not be until 2007 however, when their fourth studio album Puzzle broke the band into the mainstream. It peaked at #2 on the UK albums chart, was certified gold and gave the band three top 20 singles, with "Saturday Superhouse" being the most successful of these by peaking at #13.
As of November 2009, Biffy have released their fifth studio album Only Revolutions. So far the album has given the band their first three top 10 singles, with "Mountains" being the most successful peaking at #5; the album charted at #3.
In January 2013, Opposites  became the bands first UK number one album after debuting at number one in its first week. That same year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) retroactively updated their certifications database, using sales data from 1994 onwards, to automatically update unapplied certifications, as in the past the record label had to apply and keep data on sales. This update enabled their first three studio albums to be certified silver, Only Revolutions double platinum and their singles "Mountains" alongside "Many of Horror" both silver for 200,000 sales each.
