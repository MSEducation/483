===Crime Syndicate of America===

As detailed in Justice League of America #29 (August 1964),[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 112 |quote = Writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky crafted a tale in which the Crime Syndicate...ambushed the JLA on Earth-1. [/tpl] the Crime Syndicate of America originally lived on Earth-Three, a world where history was "reversed" from the real world (e.g., Christopher Columbus discovered Europe, British colonists declared their independence from America, and President John Wilkes Booth was assassinated by Abraham Lincoln). It initially had no superheroes, only the supervillains of the Crime Syndicate, though this changed with the later introduction of the heroic Lex Luthor who used his vast intelligence for good.
In their first appearance, the Crime Syndicate, bored with the ease with which they were able to commit crimes on their Earth (and with no one to truly challenge them), discovered the existence of Earth-One and Earth-Two after Ultraman got "Ultra-Vision" from exposure to a large chunk of kryptonite and found he could peer between Worlds. Intrigued by the existence of super-heroes, they crossed the dimensional void and attacked the JLA and JSA. The villains were at first defeated but when they said the word "Volthoom", they sent themselves into Earth-Three thanks to a fail safe created by Power Ring. The CSA was then able to capture the JSA by transporting them to Earth-Three and imprisoning them, intending to fight the JLA on Earth-2 to prove their superiority (The JLA had a natural advantage on Earth-1 and the CSA had a similar advantage on Earth-3, Earth-2 being chosen as a neutral environment where neither would have an edge). However, the JLA defeated the Syndicate by tricking the members into unleashing more power than they could control, such as Ultraman acquiring so many powers he couldn't use any of them, Power Ring's ring generating constructs that were too large for him to control after Green Lantern gave it a boost, and Wonder Woman allowing Superwoman to 'steal' her Lasso of Truth knowing that her opponent wouldn't be able to use both of them. Following this defeat, the JLA freed the captured Justice Society heroes and imprisoned the CSA in an unbreakable bubble generated by Green Lantern's power ring that was placed in a "limbo" dimension between the Earths where time has no meaning.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Fox, Gardner| penciller= Sekowsky| inker= Sachs, Bernard| story= The Most Dangerous Earth of All| title= Justice League of America| issue= 30| date= September 1964[/tpl]
Over the ensuing years, the Syndicate or one of its members would occasionally escape and attempt to wreak havoc on Earth-One and/or Earth-Two. Power Ring, Johnny Quick, and Super Woman battled Captain Comet after being released by the Secret Society of Super Villains.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry | penciller= Vosburg, Mike| inker= Smith, Bob | story= One Earth Too Many| title= Secret Society of Super Villains | issue= 13| date= March 1978[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry | penciller= Vosburg, Mike| inker= Smith, Bob | story= Crisis on Earth-3 (Reprise)!| title= Secret Society of Super Villains | issue= 14| date= April–May 1978[/tpl] Ultraman once escaped but was returned by the Supermen from Earth-One and Earth-Two.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv | penciller= Buckler | inker= Hunt, Dave| story= Crisis on Three Earths!| title= DC Comics Presents Annual| issue= 1| date= 1982[/tpl]
On one occasion the entire CSA were released by the time travelling villain Per Degaton when he was caught up in a time storm and stumbled upon their limbo prison. He freed them and they reluctantly agreed to help him take over his home world of Earth-Two in his present time of 1942 by stealing nuclear missiles from the 1962 Cuban missile crisis of Earth-Prime. When they inevitably tried to double-cross him, a safety protocol he had created hurled the traitors uncontrollably into the time stream where they landed coincidentally on the satellite headquarters of the Justice League in the then present day of 1982 (the year the story was published). An intricate tale then followed involving the CSA escaping and the JLA traveling back in time to Earth-Two in 1942 and Earth-Prime in 1962 to prevent The Crime Syndicate from helping Degaton. It was during the Earth-Two visit to the past that the JLA teamed up with America's super-hero team of that era, the All-Star Squadron. The heroes succeeded in stopping Per Degaton and the CSA before their evil plan could be set in motion, effectively wiping these events from existence and everyone's memory.Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 198: "The Justice League of America teamed up with the Justice Society of America on a large-scale with 'Crisis on Earth-Prime', a five-part saga that crossed from the pages of Justice League of America into All-Star Squadron."[tpl]cite book |title= The All-Star Companion |last= Thomas|first= Roy |authorlink= Roy Thomas |chapter= The Justice League-Justice Society Team-Ups |year= 2000|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-05-5 |pages= 191–192|url= |accessdate=[/tpl] Justice League of America #207-209 (Oct.-Dec. 1982) and All-Star Squadron #14-15 (Oct.-Nov. 1982)
Earth-Three and the original Crime Syndicate were destroyed along with the rest of DC's parallel worlds in the 1985 twelve-issue maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths. As shown in issue #1, Earth-Three and all of its inhabitants were obliterated by an anti-matter wave that was the catalyst for the story. The original Earth-Three Syndicate made a few post-Crisis appearances, when Ultraman and Power Ring appeared in the Animal Man series[tpl]cite comic| title= Animal man| issue= 24 &25| date= January 1992[/tpl] and then again in Infinite Crisis when Earth-Three was temporarily recreated and models of the Earth-Three Ultraman, Superwoman, and Alexander Luthor, Sr. were briefly merged with the Superman and Wonder Woman of Earth-1 and the Superman of Earth-Two and Wonder Woman of Earth-2.[tpl]cite comic| title= Infinite Crisis| issue= 06| date= September 2005[/tpl]

===Crime Syndicate===

A post-Crisis version of the team, simply known as the "Crime Syndicate" (not 'of America'), was eventually introduced. This post-Crisis version (revealed in 1992's Justice League Quarterly #8) was composed of Qwardians (residents of the antimatter counterpart of Oa) as well as being "more powerful than their counterparts", they are shown to be different from the Earth-Three incarnation by their enlarged eyes, resembling the Weaponers of Qward. They acted as Claire Montgomery's (Maxwell Lord's ex-wife) second Conglomerate team.
Following a further "soft" reboot of DC continuity in 1994's Zero Hour (1994) crossover, the Crime Syndicate was introduced once again, in 2000, in the JLA: Earth 2 graphic novel by Grant Morrison,Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 295: "Writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely brought the Crime Syndicate of America back to DC continuity in JLA: Earth 2." which combined the pre-Crisis parallel Earth idea with the pre-Zero Hour anti-matter universe concept. The Crime Syndicate's post-Zero Hour anti-matter Earth possesses a "reversed" history similar to Earth-Three's, but with a much darker tone to both the team and its world. JLA Secret Files 2004 provided additional history of this team, showing that they did once partially resemble the Earth-Three Syndicate though still easily identifiable from their Pre-Crisis Earth-Three incarnation. Unlike the Crime Syndicate of Earth-Three, this Crime Syndicate of Amerika are able to rule their world (a change from their pre-Crisis counterparts, who were unsuccessful in conquering their world) though allow governments to continue operating and honest people are able to continue operating in pockets such as Gotham City Police Commissioner Thomas Wayne Sr. (father to Owlman and counterpart of the murdered father of Batman). The antimatter Crime Syndicate's motto is "Cui Bono?" ("Who profits?"). The only universally respected principle on their world is that of the "favor bank" (if someone does you a favor, you owe them a favor in return that must be repaid whenever the favor is called in). A unique trait here is that should any person from either Earth cross over to the other universe, he must return to his own universe within 24 hours or else his counterpart will be sent back in his place.
Superman later encounters Ultraman, Superwoman and Owlman after a scared and out of control super-powered baby appears out of nowhere. Ultraman and Owlman come to believe the child is the offspring of Ultraman and Superwoman. Owlman wants to kill it out of jealousy, Ultraman wants to raise it as his demented protege, and Superman tried to save it from both of them. When Superwoman arrives on the scene adamant that she has never given birth, it is revealed that the super-powered infant is actually a reborn Brainiac from the Anti-matter universe, last defeated by Ultraman in the Earth-2 story. Brainiac's sentience is eventually disbursed and the villains return home to sort out their differences.Adventures of Superman #603 - 605 (June - July 2002)
The Crime Syndicate later reappeared where they lay waste to the planet Qward out of boredom.JLA #604 - 605 (July - August 2002) During their decimation of the planet, the entire Anti-Matter universe undergoes a reboot which causes some immediate changes, the most obvious of which is the sudden replacement of the Caucasian Power Ring with an African-Amerikan counterpart to John Stewart, the then current Green Lantern in the JLA. In the story, it is explained that the reboot the Syndicate experiences is direct fallout from the events of 2003's JLA/Avengers crossover. Not knowing of these events, the Crime Syndicate journey to the matter universe to attack Earth, blaming the JLA in the misplaced belief that the heroes are responsible for the changes they have endured. It is during this time that they discover that the reboot of the Anti-matter universe wiped out the previous 24-hour rule so the plan is changed to secretly take over the planet instead. Meanwhile, the defeated Qwardians rally behind a dimension-destroying weapon called The Void Hound and pursue the Syndicate to the Matter universe, laying waste to hundreds of planets along the way. Reluctantly the CSA team up with the JLA but the Void Hound proved too powerful. The heroes finally defeat the Void Hound by using a former League foe, The Construct, to remove the artificial intelligence of the massive weapon and render it powerless. With the Void Hound defeated and the CSA owing the JLA a favor for saving them, the villains are sent back to the anti-matter universe where they discover to their horror that the Qwardians have also invaded their Earth, dismantling their entire criminal organization and freeing many imprisoned super-heroes and rival super-villains.
Superman/Batman Annual #1 (2006) details Superman and Batman's first encounter with Ultraman and Owlman. Set years before Superman and Batman knew each other's secret identities, a vacationing Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Lois Lane meet Ultraman, Owlman, and Superwoman when the villains appear on a cruise ship. This story also features the first appearance of Deathstroke's unnamed antimatter doppelganger. The Ultraman, Owlman, and Superwoman presented in the story have the same costumes as the anti-matter universe version of the Syndicate. However, it should be noted that this tale is being told by Mister Mxyzptlk and as such, may not actually be canonical.
After the events of Infinite Crisis, the original pre-Crisis Ultraman appears in the bottle city of Kandor posing as Kal-El (Superman).[tpl]Comic book reference|Title = Supergirl|Volume = 5|Issue = 7 - 9|Date = (June - August 2006)|Publisher = DC Comics[/tpl] It is also revealed that Saturn Queen, last seen in "Absolute Power",Superman/Batman #14 - 18(December 2002 - April 2003) survived the reboot of the universe in Infinite Crisis and through flashback we learn that she has used her telepathic abilities to convince Ultraman that he is Kal-El and that she is his mother. His original personality seems intact however as he is portrayed as being as sadistic and self-centered as ever. Saturn Queen further manipulates events to place him in charge of Kandor and mind controls Kara Zor-El (Supergirl) into marrying him. Kara eventually breaks free and in a blind rage fights beats him to a pulp (at this point in time, Supergirl was portrayed as being slightly more powerful than Superman). Ultraman is saved when Saturn Queen provides information to Supergirl about her lost home of Argo City in exchange for sparing his life. From this point on neither the pre-Crisis Ultraman or Saturn Queen are seen again and their fates were unknown at the time the universe was rebooted again during 2011's Flashpoint.
Meanwhile, the anti-matter CSA made their next appearance in Trinity.Trinity #9(May 2009) Here it is revealed that the Syndicate have gained control of their Earth again and have been abducting people from throughout all of the individual 52 universes in the current positive matter Multiverse to use as slave labor to repair their damaged Earth. After the hyper-powered Trinity heroes of the story defeat and imprison the Syndicate and free the slaves, the anti-matter Earth falls into chaos.Trinity #16 (August 2009)
In Justice League of America (vol. 2) #43, Doctor Impossible and his cohorts use extra-dimensional superhero Blue Jay to open up a gateway to the Multiverse. Owlman, Ultraman, and Superwoman are briefly seen standing atop a building, with shadows obscuring most of their identifying marks, thus making it unclear which versions they were. The full Crime Syndicate members later appear with the original pre-Crisis iterations of Power Ring and Johnny Quick replacing their contemporary counterparts as a mirror to the events of Green Lantern: Rebirth and Flash: Rebirth.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #50-53 After arriving on New Earth following the destruction of their world at the hands of Alexander Luthor (who had built a weapon of mass destruction that detonated following his demise), the Syndicate attacks the Hall of Justice, where Luthor's corpse was interred after his murder at the hands of the Joker during the finale of Infinite Crisis. It is revealed that the Syndicate members were working with Doctor Impossible in order to create a machine that could resurrect the dead, hoping that they could revive Luthor and force him to undo the damage he had dealt to the Crime Syndicate's world. However, just as the machine is to be activated, Doctor Impossible double-crosses the Syndicate and attempts to resurrect Darkseid rather than Luthor, but the machine malfunctions and instead creates an immensely powerful villain called the Omega Man.DC Universe: The Source » Blog Archive » Your BRIGHTEST DAY solicitations for October
In the ensuing storyline, Power Ring is killed, and the members of the Justice League and the Crime Syndicate are forced to work together to stop Omega Man. Realizing that the situation is hopeless, Owlman betrays the League and turns them over to Omega Man, figuring that the Syndicate could take over the League's Earth after Omega Man kills off most of the heroes. At the last second, Batman reveals that he anticipated the Syndicate's betrayal, and had used the Tangent Universe's version of Green Lantern to resurrect Luthor behind the Syndicate's back. Though his resurrection is short-lived, Luthor builds a machine that ultimately sends the Syndicate back to their own ravaged world and seemingly destroys Omega Man.

At the conclusion of "Trinity War", it is revealed that the leader of the Secret Society, previously known as "The Outsider", was actually an Earth-3 version of Alfred Pennyworth. He gains possession Pandora's Box to open a portal to Earth-3 from which the Crime Syndicate emerges. The Crime Syndicate then proceeds to attack the fallen Justice League members and claims Prime Earth now belongs to them.[tpl]cite comic|writer=Johns, Geoff|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Oclair Albert, Eber Ferreira|colorist=Reis, Rod|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Trinity War Chapter Six: Conclusion|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=23|date=October 2013|publisher=DC Comics[/tpl]

===Founding members===

The following five members founded the original Crime Syndicate of America, and have appeared in all additional iterations of the team:

===Qwardian / Post-Crisis line-up===

The CSA's post-Crisis world is primarily governed by the "favor bank"; the only rule that is not consistently broken. If any person should grant a favor for someone else, that person is entitled to compensation whenever they see fit, no matter what the cost or hardship to the latter. Failure to pay back a favor results in inordinately harsh consequences; as seen in the beginning of "Syndicate Rules". A mobster, Jackson "Rat-Eyes" Drake, who failed to follow up on a favor owed was put on "trial" by Owlman, who then had him incinerated by Ultraman as a favor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
A team of Qwardians based on the then-current Justice League International roster appeared on the post-Crisis, pre-Zero Hour Earth, although they did not call themselves the Crime Syndicate.[tpl]Comic book reference|Title = Justice League Quarterly|Issue = 8|Date = (Summer 1992)|Publisher = DC Comics[/tpl] Its members were:
It is not clear if any of these characters exist in post-Zero Hour or post-Infinite Crisis continuity.
