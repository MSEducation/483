==History==

Lord Bramha and Lord Vishnu had a cross fire  between them  regarding  who is most powerful among them.  At that time Lord Shiva appears as fire of mountain.  Suddenly an oracle is heard "Who is doing quick darshan of Patham (foot) or Sirasu (head ) will be the powerful.  Immediately God Vishnu takes Varaha (Pig)  Avathar and started piercing the earth to see the foot of Lord Shiva. Lord Brahma takes Anna (Swan) avatar and started to fly in the sky to view the head of Lord Shiva. Both could not succeed.  Meanwhile Brahma meets Talampu flower (Screw Pine Flower)which is on the way down  from the head of Lord Shiva .  Brahma insists Talampu to say a lie, that he (Lord Bramha) has seen the head of Lord Shiva.   After much effort, Lord Vishnu realizes and accepts his failure to see Lord Shiva's foot and surrenders to Lord Shiva.  But Lord Bramha says that he has seen Lord Shiva's head  and brings  Talampu (Screw Pine Flower) as witness.  Lord Shiva gets  angry and curses Bramha and Talampu. So, there is no idol worshiping of Bramha in temples. And Talampu is not used for Shiva poojas.

==Salvation (Saba Vimosanam)==

Lord Bramha asked Lord Shiva for Salvation - Lord Shiva asks Lord Bramha to go to Pulokam (Earth) and worship him and also says that Talampu (Screw pine flower) should not be used in Shiva Pooja. Lord Bramha goes to Mount Kailas, meets Lord Shiva and Parvathy, brings Linga from Mount Kailas to Pulokam (Earth) and worships. The place of worship of Linga by Brahma is called as PIRAMANOOR (Bramhan+Oor).

==Temple's Speciality==

Poojas are done twice daily and special poojas on Pradhosam days.  During Karthikai month on Thirukarthikai day, Tala tree is planted in the middle and burned - Chokkappanai. (Burning the Screw Pine Tree)
