Perth Arena is an entertainment and sporting arena in the city centre of Perth, Western Australia. It is located on Wellington Street near the site of the former Perth Entertainment Centre, and was officially opened on 10 November 2012. The Perth Arena is the first stage of the Perth City Link, a 13.5 hectare major urban renewal and redevelopment project which involves the sinking of the Fremantle railway line to link the Perth central business district directly with Northbridge.[tpl]cite web|title=Perth City Link: Reconnecting the City|url=http://www.mra.wa.gov.au/Projects/Perth-City-Link/About-the-Project/|accessdate=2012-05-03|publisher=Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority[/tpl]
The Perth Arena was jointly designed by architectural firms Ashton Raggatt McDougall and Cameron Chisholm Nicol.

The inaugural General Manager of Perth Arena was David Humphreys, former General Manager of the Perth Entertainment Centre and Allphones Arena in Sydney.[tpl]cite web|title=Big player to head Perth Arena|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7863208/big-player-to-head-perth-arena/|accessdate=2012-05-03|publisher=The West Australian[/tpl] Humphreys died two months before the venue's opening.

==Construction==

The tender for the project was won by Western Australian construction consortium BGC, and work commenced on the site in June 2007.
The construction was marred by controversy in relation to the cost and time blowouts from the original $150 million estimate to $550 million. Auditor General Colin Murphy reported in 2010 that "The initial estimates of the cost and opening date for the Arena were unrealistic and made before the project was well understood or defined."[tpl]cite web|title=Perth Arena costs have 'blown out', says WA auditor general|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/top-stories/perth-arena-costs-have-blown-out-says-wa-auditor-general/story-e6frg12l-1225839241008|accessdate=2010-03-10|publisher=PerthNow[/tpl] An example of the modifications to the original Arena design is the change of the carpark location from being built above the nearby railway line as a separate project to underneath the Arena itself.

==Music==

Besides sporting events, Perth Arena can be configured to hold many other events, particularly major concerts. On 10 November 2012, Elton John performed at the official opening of the Arena as part of his 40th Anniversary of the Rocket Man tour.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/perth-confidential/sparkling-sir-elton-john-opens-perth-arena/story-e6frg30l-1226514598260 | title=Sparkling Sir Elton John opens Perth Arena | work=Perth Now | date=11 November 2012 | accessdate=12 November 2012 | author=Symonds, Kristy[/tpl] Originally, George Michael was to be the opening act but cancelled due to health concerns.[tpl]cite web|title=George Michael cancels Perth Arena opener|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/14998593/george-michael-cancels-perth-arena-opener/|accessdate=2012-09-30|publisher=The West Australian[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=George Michael opening act at Perth Arena|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/news/13588834/george-michael-opening-act-at-perth-arena/|accessdate=2012-05-03|publisher=The West Australian[/tpl] Before the first music event, the arena hosted a free test concert called "Plug into Perth" on 2 November featuring WA artists Drapht, Sugar Army and Split Seconds.[tpl]cite news |title = Perth Arena opens doors for local acts |first = Kristy |last = Symonds |url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/perth-arena-opens-doors-for-local-acts/story-e6frf7jo-1226509764337 |newspaper = Herald Sun |date = 3 November 2012 |accessdate = 3 November 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6BtbrPihV |archivedate = 3 November 2012 |deadurl = no [/tpl] Matchbox Twenty and Nickelback also performed at the arena in its opening week.
