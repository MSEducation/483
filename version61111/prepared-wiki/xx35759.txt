Miscegenation ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˌ|s|ɛ|dʒ|ɨ|ˈ|n|eɪ|ʃ|ən[/tpl]; from the Latin miscere "to mix" + genus "kind") is the mixing of different racial groups through marriage, cohabitation, sexual relations, or procreation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/miscegenation |title=Miscegenation: Definition of Miscegenation at Dictionary.com |accessdate=31 January 2010[/tpl]
The term miscegenation has been used since the 19th century to refer to interracial marriage and interracial sexual relations, and more generally to the process of racial admixture, which has taken place since ancient history. Historically, the term has been used in the context of laws banning interracial marriage and sex, known as anti-miscegenation laws.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Downing |first1=Karen |last2=Nichols |first2=Darlene |last3=Webster |first3=Kelly |title=Multiracial America: A Resource Guide on the History and Literature of Interracial Issues |url=http://books.google.com/?id=g-fm97haJQEC&pg=PA9 |year=2005 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=0-8108-5199-7 |page=9[/tpl] The term entered historical records during European colonialism and the Age of Discovery, but societies such as China and Japan also had restrictions on marrying with peoples whom they considered to be of a different race.

==Usage==

In the present day, the word miscegenation is avoided by many scholars, because the term suggests a concrete biological phenomenon, rather than a categorization imposed on certain relationships. The term's historical use in contexts that typically implied disapproval is also a reason why more unambiguously neutral terms such as interracial, interethnic or cross-cultural are more common in contemporary usage.[tpl]Cite book|last=Newman |first=Richard |editor=Kwame Appiah and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |edition=1st |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=0-465-00071-1 |page=1320 |chapter=Miscegenation |quote=Miscegenation, a term for sexual relations across racial lines; no longer in use because of its racist implications[/tpl] The term remains in use among scholars when referring to past practices concerning multiraciality, such as anti-miscegenation laws that banned interracial marriages.[tpl]Cite doi|10.2307/2945474[/tpl]
In Spanish, Portuguese and French, the words used to describe the mixing of races are mestizaje, mestiçagem and métissage. These words, much older than the term miscegenation, are derived from the Late Latin mixticius for "mixed", which is also the root of the Spanish word mestizo. Portuguese also uses miscigenação, derived from the same Latin root as the English word. These non-English terms for "race-mixing" are not considered as offensive as "miscegenation", although they have historically been tied to the caste system (Casta) that was established during the colonial era in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Some groups in South America, however, consider the use of the word mestizo offensive because it was used during the times of the colony to refer specifically to the mixing between the conquistadores and the indigenous people.
Today, the mixes among races and ethnicities are diverse, so it is considered preferable to use the term "mixed-race" or simply "mixed" (mezcla). In Portuguese-speaking Latin America (i.e., Brazil), a milder form of caste system existed, although it also provided for legal and social discrimination among individuals belonging to different races, since slavery for blacks existed until the late 19th century. Intermarriage occurred significantly from the very first settlements, with their descendants achieving high rank in government and society.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] To this day, the Brazilian class system is drawn mostly around socio-economic lines, not racial ones (in a manner similar to other former Portuguese colonies).
The concept of miscegenation is tied to concepts of racial difference. As the different connotations and etymologies of miscegenation and mestizaje suggest, definitions of race, "race mixing" and multiraciality have diverged globally as well as historically, depending on changing social circumstances and cultural perceptions. Mestizo are people of mixed white and indigenous, usually Amerindian ancestry, who do not self-identify as indigenous peoples or Native Americans. In Canada, however, the Métis, who also have partly Amerindian and partly white, often French-Canadian, ancestry, have identified as an ethnic group and are a constitutionally recognized aboriginal people. (In Canada these are referred to as Métis. A very famous one was Louis Riel.)
The differences between related terms and words which encompass aspects of racial admixture show the impact of different historical and cultural factors leading to changing social interpretations of race and ethnicity. Thus the Comte de Montlosier, in exile during the French Revolution, equated class difference in 18th-century France with racial difference. Borrowing Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", he showed his contempt for the lowest social class, the Third Estate, calling it "this new people born of slaves ... mixture of all races and of all times"[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl].

==Etymological history==

Miscegenation comes from the Latin miscere, "to mix" and genus, "kind". The word was coined in the U.S. in 1863, and the etymology of the word is tied up with political conflicts during the American Civil War over the abolition of slavery and over the racial segregation of African-Americans. The reference to genus was made to emphasize the supposedly distinct biological differences between whites and non-whites, though all humans belong to the same genus, Homo, and the same species, Homo sapiens.
The word was coined in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet published in New York City in December 1863, during the American Civil War. The pamphlet was entitled Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro.
It purported to advocate the intermarriage of whites and blacks until they were indistinguishably mixed, as a desirable goal, and further asserted that this was the goal of the Republican Party. The pamphlet was a hoax, concocted by Democrats, to discredit the Republicans by imputing to them what were then radical views that offended against the attitudes of the vast majority of whites, including those who opposed slavery. There was already much opposition to the war effort.
The pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in both the north and south by Democrats and Confederates. Only in November 1864 was the pamphlet exposed as a hoax. The hoax pamphlet was written by David Goodman Croly, managing editor of the New York World, a Democratic Party paper, and George Wakeman, a World reporter.
By then, the word miscegenation had entered the common language of the day as a popular buzzword in political and social discourse. The issue of miscegenation, raised by the opponents of Abraham Lincoln, featured prominently in the election campaign of 1864.
In the United States, miscegenation has referred primarily to the intermarriage between whites and non-whites, especially blacks.
Before the publication of Miscegenation, the word amalgamation, borrowed from metallurgy, had been in use as a general term for ethnic and racial intermixing. A contemporary usage of this metaphor was that of Ralph Waldo Emerson's private vision in 1845 of America as an ethnic and racial smelting-pot, a variation on the concept of the melting pot. Opinions in the U.S on the desirability of such intermixing, including that between white Protestants and Irish Catholic immigrants, were divided. The term miscegenation was coined to refer specifically to the intermarriage of blacks and whites, with the intent of galvanising opposition to the war.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1086/529971[/tpl]

==The concept of miscegenation==

Franz Boas (considered to be the father of American cultural anthropology) as well as many of his students, such as Ashley Montagu, considered race to be an invalid concept.[tpl]cite web|title=Franz Boas|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/franz_boas.html|work=C250 Columbians ahead of their time|publisher=Columbia University[/tpl]  From this point of view, if the concept of race is invalid, then miscegenation as the crossing of races is equally invalid. These ideas are pursued in greater depth in Ashley Montagu's books on the subject.[tpl]cite book|author=Ashley Montagu|title=Man's most dangerous myth: the fallacy of race|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA87|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8039-4648-4[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Ashley Montagu|title=Race and IQ|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NWFWm3GW90kC&pg=PA82|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510221-5|pages=82–[/tpl]

==Laws banning miscegenation==

Laws banning "race-mixing" were enforced in certain U.S. states from 1691 until 1967, in Nazi Germany (the Nuremberg Laws) from 1935 until 1945, and in South Africa during the early part of the Apartheid era (1949–1985). All these laws primarily banned marriage between persons of different racially or ethnically defined groups, which was termed "amalgamation" or "miscegenation" in the U.S. The laws in Nazi Germany and many of the U.S. states, as well as South Africa, also banned sexual relations between such individuals.
In the United States, the various state laws prohibited the marriage of whites and blacks, and in many states also the intermarriage of whites with Native Americans or Asians.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Karthikeyan|first=Hrishi |coauthors=Chin, Gabriel|year=2002|title=Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910–1950|journal=Asian Law Journal|volume=9|issue=1|ssrn=283998[/tpl] In the U.S., such laws were known as anti-miscegenation laws. From 1913 until 1948, 30 out of the then 48 states enforced such laws.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lovingday.org/map.htm|title=Where were Interracial Couples Illegal?|work=LovingDay|accessdate=13 July 2008[/tpl] Although an "Anti-Miscegenation Amendment" to the United States Constitution was proposed in 1871, in 1912–1913, and in 1928,"Courtroom History" Lovingday.org Retrieved 28 June 2007[tpl]Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Edward|year=2004|title=Past and present proposed amendments to the United States constitution regarding marriage|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|volume=82|issue=3|ssrn=576181[/tpl] no nation-wide law against racially mixed marriages was ever enacted. In 1967, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Loving v. Virginia that anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional. With this ruling, these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states that still had them.
The Nazi ban on interracial sexual relations and marriages was enacted in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws, the Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre (The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour). The Nuremberg Laws classified Jews as a race, and forbade extramarital sexual relations and marriage between persons classified as "Aryan" and "non-Aryan". Violation of this was condemned as Rassenschande (lit. "race-disgrace") and could be punished by imprisonment (usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp) and even by death.
The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act in South Africa, enacted in 1949, banned intermarriage between different racial groups, including between whites and non-whites. The Immorality Act, enacted in 1950, also made it a criminal offense for a white person to have any sexual relations with a person of a different race. Both laws were repealed in 1985.

==History of ethnoracial admixture and attitudes towards miscegenation==

===Africa===

Africa has a long history of interracial mixing with Arabs and later European men having sexual relations with black African women as well as taking them as wives. Arabs played a big role in the African slave trade and unlike the trans-atlantic slave trade most of the black African slaves in the Arab slave trade were women. Most of them were used as sexual slaves by the Arab men and some were even taken as wives.[tpl]Cite book|title=Slavery and abolition in the Ottoman Middle East|author=Ehud R. Toledano|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1998|isbn=0-295-97642-X|pages=13–4[/tpl]
Sir Richard Francis Burton writes during his expedition to Africa about relationships between black women and white men. He writes, "The women are well disposed toward strangers of fair complexion, apparently with the permission of their husbands." There are several mulatto populations throughout Africa mostly the results of interracial relationships between Arab and European men and black women. In South Africa there are big mulatto communities like the Coloureds and Griqua formed by White colonists taking native African wives. In Namibia there is a community called the Rehoboth Basters formed by the interracial marriage of Dutch/German men and black African women.
In the former Portuguese Africa (now known as Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde) racial mixing between white Portuguese and black Africans was fairly common, especially in Cape Verde where the majority of the population is of mixed descent.
There have been some recorded cases of Chinese merchants and labourers taking African wives throughout Africa as many Chinese workers were employed to build railways and other infrastructural projects in Africa. These labour groups were made up completely of men with very few Chinese women coming to Africa.
In West Africa, especially Nigeria there are many cases of Lebanese men taking African women. Many of their offsprings have gained prominent positions in Africa. Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings, who has a Scottish father and a black Ghanaian mother became the President and Head of State of Ghana. Jean Ping, the son of a Chinese trader and a black Gabonese mother, became the Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Foreign minister of Gabon and was the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union from 2009 to 2012. Current President of Botswana, Ian Khama, is the son of Botswana's first president, Seretse Khama and a white (British) woman, Ruth Williams.
Indian men, who have long been traders in East Africa, at times married among local African women. The British Empire brought many Indian workers into East Africa to build the Uganda Railway. Indians eventually populated South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Zaire in small numbers. These interracial unions were mostly unilateral marriages between Indian men and East African women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=Africa&x=Indians|title=Jotawa: Afro-Asians in East Africa|publisher=Color Q World|accessdate=15 July 2008[/tpl]

====Réunion====

The majority of the population of Réunion is defined as mixed race. In the last 350 years, various ethnic groups (Africans, Chinese, English, French, Gujarati Indians, Tamil Indians) have arrived and settled on the island. There have been mixed race people on the island since its first permanent inhabitation in 1665.

====Madagascar====

There was frequent intermixing between the Austronesian and Bantu-speaking populations of Madagascar. A large number of the Malagasy today are the result of admixture between Austronesians and Africans. This is most evident in the Mikea, who are also the last known Malagasy population to still practice a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  In the study of "The Dual Origin of the Malagasy in Island Southeast Asia and East Africa: Evidence from Maternal and Paternal Lineages" shows the Bantu Maternal origin to be 38% and Paternal 51% while the Asian Paternal to be 34% and Maternal 62%. In the study of Malagasy Autosomal DNA shows the highlanders ethnic group like Merina are almost an even mixture of Asian and Bantu origin, while the Coastal ethnic group have much higher Bantu mixture in their autosomal DNA suggesting they are mixture of new Bantu migrants and the already established highlander ethnic group. Maximum-likelihood estimates favour a scenario in which Madagascar was settled approximately 1200 years ago by a very small group of women of approximately 30.
Intermarriage between Chinese men and native Malagasy women was not uncommon.[tpl]harvnb|Pan|1994|p=157[/tpl] Several thousand Cantonese men intermarried and cohabited with Malagasy women. 98% of the Chinese traced their origin from Guangdong — more specifically, the Cantonese district of Shunde. For example, the 1954 census found 1,111 "irregular" Chinese-Malagasy unions and 125 legitimate, i.e., legally married. Registered by their mothers under a Malagasy name.[tpl]clarify|date=February 2014[/tpl] Intermarriage between French men and Native Malagasy women was not uncommon either.

===Americas===

====Canada====

The 2006 Census counted 289,400 mixed unions (marriages and common-law unions) involving a visible minority person with a non-visible minority person or a person from a different visible minority group. This was a 33.1% increase from 2001. Among all mixed unions in 2006, 247,600 couples were in unions involving a visible minority person and someone who was not a visible minority. The groups most likely to be involved in a mixed union were Japanese (74.4%), Latin Americans (47%) and blacks (40.6%).[tpl]cite web| title = Canada's 'mixed unions' grow with rising vis-min population| author= Fitzpatrick, Meagan|work=National Post |location=Canada | date=2 April 2008| url = http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=417163|accessdate =6 February 2010[/tpl]

====United States====

Historically, "race mixing" between black and white people was taboo in the United States. So-called anti-miscegenation laws, barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in colonial America as early as 1691. The 1691 Virginia law was amended in 1705 to remove Indian-white from the prohibition. Thomas Jefferson's policy proposal for dealing with Native Americans was "to let our settlements and theirs meet and blend together, to intermix, and become one people."David Nugent, Joan Vincent (2004). A companion to the anthropology of politics. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 407. ISBN 0-631-22972-8 He regretted in 1813 that white-Indian war had prevented this: “They would have mixed their blood with ours, and been amalgamated and identified with us within no distant period of time.“Michael Lind (1996). The next American nation: the new nationalism and the fourth American revolution. Simon and Schuster. ISBN 0-684-82503-1
Although race mixing between whites and blacks was strongly opposed, there did exist a period of time during colonial America when Englishmen would breed their black male slaves with Irish female servants (some as young as 12) in order to produce new slaves of a distinct complexion. These new "mulatto" slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. Irish people were not considered "white" at the time, but rather their own distinct race. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with black African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed "forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale". In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-irish-slave-trade-the-forgotten-white-slaves/31076 |title=The Irish Slave Trade – The Forgotten "White" Slaves |publisher=Global Research |author=John Martin |date=January 27, 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl]
The taboo among American whites surrounding white-black can be seen as a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of African-Americans.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Yancey|first=George|date=22 March 2007|title=Experiencing Racism: Differences in the Experiences of Whites Married to Blacks and Non-Black Racial Minorities|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|publisher=University of Calgary: Social Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pages=197–213[/tpl][tpl]Cite doi|10.1111/j.0020-8701.2005.00534.x[/tpl] In many U.S. states interracial marriage was already illegal when the term miscegenation was invented in 1863. The first laws banning interracial marriage were introduced in the late 17th century in the slave-holding colonies of Virginia (1691) and Maryland (1692). Later these laws also spread to colonies and states where slavery did not exist.
It has also been argued that the first laws banning interracial marriage were a response by the planter elite to the problems they were facing due to the socio-economic dynamics of the plantation system in the Southern colonies. The bans in Virginia and Maryland were established at a time when slavery was not yet fully institutionalized. At the time, most forced laborers on the plantations were indentured servants, and they were mostly white. Some historians have suggested that the at-the-time unprecedented laws banning interracial marriage were originally invented by planters as a divide and rule tactic after the uprising of servants in Bacon's Rebellion. According to this theory, the ban on interracial marriage was issued to split up the racially mixed, increasingly mixed-race labour force into whites, who were given their freedom, and blacks, who were later treated as slaves rather than as indentured servants. By forbidding interracial marriage, it became possible to keep these two new groups separated and prevent a new rebellion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=22|title=Why Did Virginia's Rulers Invent a Color Line?|last=Sweet|first=Frank.
