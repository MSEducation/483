At the time, the CCF was engaged in a three-year plan to create a new party from the union between itself and organized labour forces as represented by the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). Both the CCF and CLC executives approved going down this route starting in April 1958. Argue, like many grassroot CCFers, were not convinced that this merger was necessarily the best route to revitalizing the party. As an organizing tool during this period, the organization was called the New Party.  New Party clubs sprung up around the country during 1958-1961. On October 31, 1960, Walter Pitman won a stunning by-election victory in Peterborough running as a New Party candidate.[ref]
