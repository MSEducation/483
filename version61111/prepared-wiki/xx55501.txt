Paige was a Detroit, United States based automobile company, selling luxury cars between 1908 and 1927.

==History==

The first car in 1908 was called a Paige-Detroit and was a two-seat model powered by a 2.2-liter three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. In 1910 four-stroke, four-cylinder models took over, and in 1911 the name was changed to Paige. A six-cylinder model was added to the range in 1914. Four-cylinder models were dropped in 1916, leaving a choice of 3.7- or 4.9-liter sixes. A straight-eight engine was added to the sixes in 1927.
Probably the most famous Paige was the 1922 to 1926 Daytona, a sporting 3-seat roadster with a 6-liter engine. The third seat pulled out from the side of the car over the near side running board. Paige advertised it as being "The most beautiful car in America".
Paige also made a cheaper range of cars between 1923 and 1926 and sold as Jewetts named after H M Jewett the company president. For 1927, this car was sold as a junior Paige.

The Graham Brothers bought the company on June 10, 1927. Joseph Graham became the new president, his brothers Robert and Ray serving as vice-president and secretary-treasurer, respectively. The three, together with their father, also became directors of the company. The corporate name soon changed to Graham-Paige Motors Corporation. The market agreed, and automobile production rose from 21,881 in 1927 to 73,195 for the following year, when the cars became known as Graham-Paiges.
When the second series of 1930 cars was released (bringing out two series for a model year was widely practised at the time), the name for the product (but not for the corporate name) changed to just Graham.“The Graham Brothers and Their Car” by Jeffery I.
