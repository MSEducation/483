[[Navy bean]]

CATEGORIES: Phaseolus

Navy bean or haricot bean is a variety of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). It is particularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States (where it may also be called pea bean[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=pea+bean|title=Pea bean|publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]).  It features in such dishes as baked beans and even pies, as well as in various soups such as Senate bean soup.Senate Bean Soup. Consumption of baked beans has been shown to lower total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Susan M. Shutler, Gemma M. Bircher, Jacki A. Tredger, Linda M. Morgan, Ann F. Walker and A. G. LOW (1989). The effect of daily baked bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) consumption on the plasma lipid levels of young, normo-cholesterolaemic men. British Journal of Nutrition, 61, pp 257-265 [tpl]doi|10.1079/BJN19890114[/tpl].Donna M. Winham, Andrea M. Hutchins. Baked bean consumption reduces serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic adults. Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.) 1 July 2007 (volume 27 issue 7 Pages 380-386 [tpl]doi|10.1016/j.nutres.2007.04.017[/tpl]). This might be at least partly explained by high saponin content of navy bean. Saponins also exhibit antibacterial and anti-fungal activity, and have been found to inhibit cancer cell growth.John Shi, Sophia Jun Xue, Ying Mab, Dong Li, Yukio Kakuda, Yubin Lan. Kinetic study of saponins B stability in navy beans under different processing conditions. Journal of Food Engineering 93 (2009) 59–65. Furthermore, navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid among the common bean varieties.Devanand L. Luthria, Marcial A. Pastor-Corrales. Phenolic acids content of fifteen dry edible bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 19 (2006) 205–211.  It is commonly known as the "Navy Bean" due to its use as a staple of United States Navy rations in the 19th century.
Navy bean varieties include:
Other white beans include cannellini, a variety popular in central and southern Italy, which is related to the kidney bean and, like the kidney bean, has higher levels of the toxic lectin phytohaemagglutinin. White beans are the most abundant plant-based source of phosphatidylserine (PS) yet known.Souci SW, Fachmann E, Kraut H (2008). Food Composition and Nutrition Tables. Medpharm Scientific Publishers Stuttgart.
(The large white beans known in Greece as gígantes (Greek: γίγαντες, giants) and eléfantes (ελέφαντες, elephants) are from the runner bean, Phaseolus coccineus.)
