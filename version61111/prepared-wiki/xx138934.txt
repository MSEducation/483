Originally known as the Sunbury Rovers, the team was formed so Sunbury had a team in both divisions of RDFL.  The Rovers always struggled because the better players would join the other club, Fortunes improved when Sunbury FC left for the Ballarat Football League. The club changed to the Kangaroos after incentives from the North Melbourne Football Club to do so.
