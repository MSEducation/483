[[Administrative Court (England and Wales)]]

CATEGORIES: Administrative courts, High Court of Justice, English civil law, English administrative law

The Administrative Court is a specialist court within the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. It deals mainly with administrative law matters and exercises the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction over inferior courts and tribunals and other public bodies (exercised mainly through the procedure known as "judicial review").
The Administrative Court may sit with a single judge or as a Divisional Court (i.e. with two or more judges). A Divisional Court of the Administrative Court usually consists of a Lord Justice of Appeal sitting with a judge of the High Court. Although the Administrative Court is within the Queen's Bench Division (reflecting the historical role of the Court of Queen's Bench in exercising judicial review), judges from the Chancery Division and the Family Division of the High Court are also assigned to sit.
