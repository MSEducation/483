Brighton and Hove [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən|_|ən|_|ˈ|h|oʊ|v[/tpl] is a city and unitary authority in the ceremonial county of East Sussex in South East England. It is England's most populous seaside resort with a population of 273,400 (2011 census).
Following the unification of borough councils, the towns of Brighton and Hove formed a unitary authority in 1997.

"Brighton" is often referred to synonymously with the official "Brighton and Hove" name although many locals still consider the two to be separate towns.

===DVLA database ban===

In 2012 it was revealed that the Brighton and Hove unitary authority has been permanently banned from accessing information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This information is normally made available to local authorities for purposes such as enforcing parking fines, but access can be withdrawn if they are found to be misusing the service. The Big Brother Watch organisation, which obtained the information about the ban under a Freedom of Information request, claimed that "the public are right to be worried that their privacy is at risk across a range of government services."[tpl]citation|title=DVLA bans councils from database over abuses|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642429|publisher=BBC News|date=8 December 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl]
