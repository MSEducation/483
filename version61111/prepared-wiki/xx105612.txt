Xi Jinping ([tpl]zh|p=Xí Jìnpíng[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA-cmn|ɕǐ tɕînpʰǐŋ|[/tpl], born 15 June 1953) is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, the President of the People's Republic of China, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Party General Secretary, Xi is also an ex officio member of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, China's de facto top decision-making body, making him the paramount leader.
Son of communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi Jinping rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. He served as the Governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002, then as Governor and CPC party chief of the neighboring Zhejiang between 2002 and 2007. Following the dismissal of Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to Shanghai as the party secretary for a brief period in 2007. Xi was promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee and Central Secretariat in October 2007 and was groomed to become Hu Jintao's successor.
Xi is now the leader of the People's Republic's fifth generation of leadership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=/content/ias/archiv/cds/cds_0905.pdf |title=deckblatt-ca-data sup-form.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl] He has called for a renewed campaign against corruption, continued market economic reforms, an open approach to governance, and a comprehensive national renewal under the neologism "Chinese Dream".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9935609/Xi-Jinping-calls-for-a-Chinese-Dream.html|title=Xi Jinping calls for a Chinese dream, Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2013-03-20[/tpl]

==Early life==

Xi Jinping was born on 15 June 1953 in Beijing and is claimed, according to Chinese custom, to be of ancestral descent from Fuping County, Shaanxi. His father, Xi Zhongxun (1913-2002), was a contributor to bringing about the social revolution[tpl]cite book|last=Isogawa |first=Tomoyoshi|title=Understand Xi Jinping in 30 Minutes|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A82TX3K/|year=2012 |publisher=United Books|location=Japan|page=151[/tpl] and a revolutionary leader.[tpl]cite news|title=Profile: Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/china-profile-xi-jinping/24764283.html|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Radio Free Europe|date=7 November 2012[/tpl] His patrilinear ancestral home is from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hn.wenweipo.com/news/zhuanti/2012-11-16/23713.html|title=本报独家探访河南邓州习营村|date=16 November 2012|publisher=Wen Wei Po|accessdate=15 November 2012[/tpl] He is the second son of Xi Zhongxun, one of the founders of the Communist guerrilla movement in Shaanxi and former Vice-Premier. At the time, his father served as the head of the Communist Party's propaganda department and later Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress. His mother was Qi Xin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/book/2009-04/28/content_11270872.htm |title=与丈夫习仲勋相伴58年 齐心：这辈子无比幸福_读书频道_新华网|work=Xinhuanet|date=28 April 2009|accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl]
When Xi was 10, his father was purged and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.Bouée, Charles-Edouard, China's Management Revolution: Spirit, Land, Energy, (Palgrave Macmillan, 15 December 2010), p. 93; via Googlebooks. Retrieved 15 February 2012. Xi was 15 when his father was jailed in 1968 during the Cultural Revolution. Without the protection of his father, Xi went to work in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. He later became the Party branch secretary of the production team. When he left in 1975, he was only 22 years old. When asked about this experience later by state television, Xi recalled it saying, "It was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion."[tpl]cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Watts|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/oct/26/china.uknews4 |title=Most corrupt officials are from poor families but Chinese royals have a spirit that is not dominated by money|accessdate=11 June 2008 |work=The Guardian|location=London|date= 26 October 2007[/tpl]
From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University. From 1998 to 2002, he studied  Marxist philosophy and ideological education in an "on-the-job" post-graduate programme at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, again at Tsinghua University, and obtained an Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree.[tpl]cite news |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/99727/6934773.html|title=Xi Jinping|date=30 March 2010[/tpl] From 1979 to 1982, he served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission.

==Rise to power==

Xi joined the Communist Youth League in 1971 and the Communist Party of China in 1974.[tpl]cite news |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Zy479_jx11YJ:www.aerospaceindia.org/Issue%2520Briefs/2010/25%2520October%25202010%2520-%2520CHINA%25E2%2580%2599S%2520NEXT%2520CHAIRMAN%25E2%2580%2594XI%2520JINPING.pdf+&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjpQjUAtfkdEgw0cxv3UMunFfoLBcy0_po2aPN4xvPoQ-K9lFpIdgtf7PAw5ebYoTd8NwaRSswzfWmws278UPehKckL3Zb0TXlci2R0HsZGceCYRpBiD6EfBrspdjUh8CZzwcMg&sig=AHIEtbRjgFp8BCiHybWUtaP2uVF8BVuVZA |title=China's Next Chairman - Xi Jinping |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |first=Jayadva |last=Ranade |publisher=Centre for Air Power Studies[/tpl] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as Deputy Secretary to the CPC Zhengding County Committee, and was promoted in 1983 to Secretary of the CPC Zhengding County Committee.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/xi-jinping.htm |title=Xi Jinping |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2012[/tpl] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his political career: Shaanxi (during the Cultural Revolution, 1969–1975), Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), and Zhejiang (2002–2007).
Xi held Party positions in the CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1999, he was promoted to the Deputy Governor of Fujian, then became Governor a year later. While there, he made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to boost free market economy. In February 2000, he and provincial Party Secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top four members of the Party Central Politburo Standing Committee – General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji, Vice-President Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.Xiao Yu, Fujian leaders face Beijing top brass, South China Morning Post, 18 February 2000
In 2002, Xi took up senior government and Party positions in Zhejiang, and eventually took over as party chief after several months as acting Governor, becoming the first-in-charge in the province. Xi was then made an alternate member of the 15th CPC Central Committee and holds the membership of the 16th CPC Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi provided the economic environment which secured growth rates averaging 14% per year. His career in Zhejiang was marked by tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials, which earned him a name on the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.
Following the dismissal of Shanghai Party Chief Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007 to become the new Party Chief of Shanghai. Xi's appointment to one of the most important regional posts in China was clearly a sign of confidence from the Central Government. While in Shanghai he was careful not to touch any controversial issues while largely echoing the line of the central leadership. Xi's career is notable in that during his regional tenures, he was never implicated in any serious scandals, nor did he face serious political opposition.

==Politburo Standing Committee member==

Xi's appointment to the Party Secretary post in Shanghai was seen as a stepping stone for him to become an emerging member of the fifth generation of Chinese leadership. This was solidified by his appointment as a member of the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. Xi was ranked above Li Keqiang, which made him the most likely candidate for China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress, Xi was elected as Vice-President of the People's Republic of China on 15 March 2008."Hu Jintao reelected Chinese president", Xinhua (China Daily), 15 March 2008. Some suggest this was because Xi had kept friendly relations with both Hu Jintao and the other power figure in the central leadership, Zeng Qinghong.
Since his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new President of the Central Party School, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Xi made his first foreign visit after his vice presidency to visit North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjdt/wsrc/t462294.htm|title=Vice-President Xi Jinping to Visit DPRK, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=5 June 2008|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of Committee Chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of political sensitive anniversaries in 2009.Michael Wines. 'China's Leaders See a Calendar Full of Anniversaries, and Trouble'. The New York Times, 9 March 2009.
Xi is considered to be one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese revolutionaries. Senior leaders consider Xi to be an emerging figure that is open to serious dialogue about deep-seated market economic reforms and even political reform, although Xi's personal political views are relatively murky.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2010[/tpl] He is generally popular with foreign dignitaries, who are intrigued by his openness and pragmatism. Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was "a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations."[tpl]cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Ansfield|date=22 December 2007|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/81558 |title=Xi Jinping: China’s New Boss And The ‘L’ Word|work=Newsweek|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl] Lee also commented: "I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons.
