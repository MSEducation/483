Nyman's February 2005 statement about the album printed within the booklet is very brief:
 All my music starts out as piano music so the opportunity to get back to that essence appealed to me.  Hence my desire to make this album a personal signature as a composer/performer.  I have deliberately focused on my more song-like music: the album title suggested itself.
