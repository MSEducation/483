The A-list is part of a larger guide called The Hot List that has become an industry-standard guide in Hollywood. James Ulmer has also developed a Hot List of directors.[tpl]cite news |url=http://ulmerscale.com/aboutUS.html |title=About The Ulmer Scale |publisher = The Ulmer Scale[/tpl]

==Popular usage==

In popular usage outside the film industry, an "A-list celebrity" simply refers to any person with an admired or desirable social status.American Heritage Dictionary In recent times, the term has given rise to any person, regardless of profession, in the limelight. Even socialites with popular press coverage have been termed as "A-list" celebrities. Similarly, less popular persons and current teen idols are referred to as "B-list" – and the ones with lesser fame "C-list".Encarta, Webster's New Millennium Dictionary. Archived October 31, 2009. Entertainment Weekly interpreted C-list celebrity as "that guy (or sometimes that girl), the easy-to-remember but hard-to-name character actor".[tpl]cite news |first=Erin |last= Podolsky |title= C-list celebrities – Three sites with information on 'that one guy' you see in movies from time to time |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,278510,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=November 10, 2000 |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090425112407/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,278510,00.html| archivedate= April 25, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
"D-list" is the lowest rating on the Ulmer Scale,Ulmer Scale Hot List and it is often used to describe persons whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as so-called celebrities on panel game shows and reality television. Kathy Griffin, a comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs, uses the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her TV series Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List. Alternatively successive letters of the alphabet beyond D, such as "E-list" or "Z-list" are used for exaggeration or comic effect, but effectively have the same meaning as D-list.
Some celebrities who begin their careers in this way eventually rise in fame to upper levels of the B-list or, depending on the definition, even the A-list; examples include the members of the Kardashian family and Paris Hilton.
