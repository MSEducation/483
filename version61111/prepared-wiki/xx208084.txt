==History==

The Colegio de San Bartolome de Novaliches (commonly abbreviated as CSBN) was set up following a development plan of the San Bartolome de Novaliches Parish Pastoral Council. A 1-hectare property was bought, and 4,000 square meters of it were allotted for the school. The Pre-school Department opened in June 1995 with 12 enrollees at the old site. Former parish priest Anselmo P. Pamintuan set up the Elementary Department in June 1996, with 250 students. Because of its notable increase in mid-1996, upon the instructions of the archbishop of ManilaJaime L. Cardinal Sin, the school was housed in the basement of the new church. As the CSBN grew, in the summer of 1997 a single-floor building with 5 classrooms was built to house the High School Department. By school year 1999-2000 the first students graduated at secondary level.
In May 2003 Father Albert N. Delvo was appointed by the bishop emeritus of Novaliches, Teodoro C. Bacani, Jr. as superintendent, to succeed Rev. Msgr. Pamintuan as the school director. In July 2004 he was succeeded by Fr. Victor Emmanuel I. Clemen, who led the school for 3 years.
On May 2007 bishop of Novaliches Antonio R. Tobias, DD assigned Rev. Fr. Delvo to be the director and superintendent of all the member schools of the Parochial Schools Association in Novaliches (PSA - Nova).[tpl]cite book | title=Colegio de San Bartolome de Novaliches Manual for Students |year=2005[/tpl]
