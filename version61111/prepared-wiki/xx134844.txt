While Sky Londa is the spelling approved by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names, a frequently used state government variant spelling is Skylonda. The variant spelling is used on a Caltrans sign for southbound SR35 north of SR84 and on the name of a CDF Fire station in the community. This variant name is also shown as a variant in the National Geographic Names Database. The 1994 USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California shows it spelled Sky Londa.http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/usgsmaps/usgsmaps.html#7.5-minute Maps recorded as early as 1909 show it as Sky L'onda apparently derived from the crossroad names Skyline Boulevard and Woodside-La Honda Road.
The 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California, (1994), shows Woodside VOR north of the settlement. The aircraft navigation facility is shown as being outfitted with distance measuring equipment. It lies one mile (1.6 km) at 285 degrees off true north from the intersection of SR35 and SR84. Its identifier is "OSI" and publicly available FAA documents show the VOR signal is on 113.9 MHz.
Many of the area's characteristic redwood-log homes were first built in the early 1930s by a developer who subdivided a few tracts and established a water supply and reservoirs dedicated to the new community. The redwood "logs" came from unused railroad-tie stock sawn by a mill located at the intersection until the Depression. The local water is still pumped from wells and La Honda Creek, and delivered to 154 homes by the Sky L'onda Mutual Water Company.
There are a few commercial establishments at the intersection of SR35 and SR84, including two service stations, a convenience store, a real estate office, a small events center, and one restaurant. The restaurant is called Alice's Restaurant, but it is not the one mentioned in Arlo Guthrie's famous song.
The area is a popular destination for motorcycle and bicycle riders, especially during spring and summer weekends.
