==Career==

===Carshalton Athletic===

A winger, Annon began his career at Isthmian League Premier Division side Carshalton Athletic and made his debut in October 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.margatefchistory.com/darrenannon.shtml |title=Darren Annon |publisher=Margatefchistory.com |date=1972-02-17 |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] He made a handful of appearances during the 1992/93 season and established himself during the 1993/94 season, scoring ten goals and attracting interest from Football League clubs. Annon departed the club in March 1994.

===Brentford===

Annon's form for Carshalton earned him a £20000 move to Division Two side Brentford in March 1994. He made nine appearances and scored one goal in what remained of the 1993/94 season. Awarded the number 10 shirt for the 1994/95 season, Annon made his first appearance of the campaign as a substitute for Lee Harvey in a 1-0 home defeat to Peterborough United on 20 August 1994.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |year=1995 |title=Griffin Gazette versus AFC Bournemouth 29/04/95 |url= |location= |publisher=Quay Design of Poole |isbn= |accessdate= [/tpl] After featuring as an unused substitute in a 2-0 win over Rotherham United three games later, Annon found himself out of the first team squad until November. He made his first start of the season in a Football League Trophy first round match against Gillingham on November 8, crowning his return to the team with the opening goal in a 3-1 victory. He started in the following game, an FA Cup first round match away to Cambridge United and scored the opening goal in a 2-2 draw. Annon made his first league start of the season in a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on November 26, which kicked off a run of ten consecutive appearances. He scored his third goal of the season in a 7-0 mauling of Plymouth Argyle at Griffin Park on 17 December. Annon's final appearance of the season came in a 2-1 victory over Hull City on January 21 1995. He only received one more call into the first team during the season, featuring as an unused substitute in the return league game with Rotherham United on March 18. Annon made 13 appearances during the 1994/95 season and scored three goals. Annon was out of favour during the 1995/96 season and made just one appearance, coming on as a substitute for Denny Mundee in a 2-0 defeat to league leaders Swindon Town on September 2 1995.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |year=1996 |title=Griffin Gazette versus AFC Bournemouth 04/05/96 |url= |location= |publisher=Quay Design of Poole |isbn= |accessdate= [/tpl] Annon departed in February 1996, after making 23 appearances and scoring four goals during his two years with the club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=202 |title=Darren Annon | Football Stats | Margate | Age 42 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl]

Annon featured in Enfield's run to the first round proper of the FA Cup during the 1998/99 season, taking Division Two side York City to a replay before being knocked out 2-1 at Bootham Crescent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=202&season_id=128 |title=Darren Annon | Football Stats | Margate | Season 1998/1999 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] The Es went one better in the 1999/00 season, defeating Division Two side Chesterfield 2-1 at Saltergate in the first round and taking Preston North End to a replay after a 0-0 draw at Deepdale in the second round.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=202&season_id=129 |title=Darren Annon | Football Stats | Margate | Season 1999/2000 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] Featuring mostly as a defender, Annon made over a hundred appearances for Enfield before departing in the summer of 2000.

===Farnborough Town===

Annon joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Farnborough Town in the summer of 2000. He was a virtual ever-present and scored his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Harrow Borough on 24 March 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.farney.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=143&ffc_mid=2728 |title=Match Details |publisher=Farney.co.uk |date=2001-03-24 |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] He had a successful first season, making 48 appearances[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.farney.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=143&ffc_pid=1002 |title=Player Details |publisher=Farney.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] and won the first silverware of his career, with Boro being crowned 2000/01 Isthmian League Premier Division champions and securing promotion to the Conference. Annon scored his first goal of the 2001/02 season in a 7-1 demolition of Portsmouth Royal Navy in the Hampshire Senior Cup on 7 November 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.farney.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=143&ffc_mid=2805 |title=Match Details |publisher=Farney.co.uk |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-20[/tpl] He was again a virtual ever-present, making 42 appearances and helping Boro to a 7th place finish. Annon made 39 appearances during the 2002/03 season and the highlight came when Farnborough were drawn away to Premiership side Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup, though Boro suffered a 5-1 defeat at Highbury. Annon departed the club at the end of the 2002/03 season. He made 129 appearances and scored two goals during his three seasons with Boro.

===Margate===

Annon signed for Conference side Margate in June 2003. He had a successful first season, making 49 appearances, scoring two goals and winning the Kent Senior Cup. Margate suffered demotion to the newly formed Conference South for the 2004/05 season and Annon was named as captain. He filled in at centre back and wing back throughout the early part of the season and his campaign was ended prematurely after he was stretchered off with a ruptured achilles tendon after five minutes of a 1-0 defeat to Hayes on 11 December 2004. He had made 26 appearances during the 2004/05 season, but despite the Gate suffering relegation to the Isthmian League Premier Division, they went on to win the Kent Senior Cup for the third season in succession. The length of Annon's recovery from the injury meant that he missed the start of the 2005/06 season, but he departed the club in October 2005 after returning to fitness. Annon made 75 appearances during his time with Margate and scored two goals.

===Havant & Waterlooville===
