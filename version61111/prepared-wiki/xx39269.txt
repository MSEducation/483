[[Dir (command)]]

CATEGORIES: Internal DOS commands, Windows administration, Microcomputer software

In computing, dir (directory) is a command used for file and directory listing, specifically in the command line interface (CLI) of these operating systems: RT-11, CP/M, VMS, DOS, OS/2, Singularity, and Microsoft Windows. It is analogous to the Unix ls command.
Because it is the primary means of displaying the files and directories on disk or other storage medium within a command window, the dir command is one of the most basic commands employed by users of the command line interface to MS-DOS and subsequent versions of Microsoft Windows.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tnd.com/camosun/elex130/dostutor1.html |title=Learning MS-DOS Basics - A Tutorial |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Baril |first=Suzanne |date=2000-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070709072247/http://tnd.com/camosun/elex130/dostutor1.html  |archivedate = 2007-07-09[/tpl]
The dir command has existed as a DOS command since the initial release of MS-DOS. It is built into the DOS command shell, and is not provided as a separate standalone program.
In DOS and Microsoft Windows, dir checks for switches in the %dircmd% environment variable.
In Windows PowerShell, dir is a predefined command alias for the Get-ChildItem Cmdlet which basically serves the same purpose.
