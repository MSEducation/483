A decimal calendar is a calendar which includes units of time based on the decimal system. 

==History==

===Calendar of Romulus===

The original Roman calendar consisted of ten months (however, the calendar year only lasted 304 days, with 61 days during winter not assigned to any month).[tpl]cite web|title=The Roman calendar|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/roman-calendar.html|publisher=Time and Date AS|accessdate=10 June 2012|author=Time and Date AS[/tpl] The months of Ianuarius and Februarius were added to the calendar by Numa Pompilius in 700 BC.

===Egyptian calendar===

The ancient Egyptian calendar consisted of twelve months, each divided into three weeks of ten days, with five intercalary days.[tpl]cite web|title=Ancient Egyptian Calendar and Chronology|url=http://math.camden.rutgers.edu/extension01.pdf|publisher=Rutgers University|accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl]

===French Republican Calendar===

The French Republican Calendar was introduced (along with decimal time) in 1793, and was similar to the ancient Egyptian calendar.[tpl]cite web|title=French Republican Calendar: Time, History and the Revolutionary Event|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.2011.00408.x/pdf|publisher=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|author=Sanja Perovic|accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl] It consisted of twelve months, each divided into three d√©cades of ten days, with five or six intercalary days called sansculottides. The calendar was abolished by Napoleon on January 1, 1806.

==Proposals==

The modern Gregorian calendar does not use decimal units of time, however several proposed calendar systems do. None of these have achieved widespread use.
