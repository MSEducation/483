Rushbrooke is an urban area on the western side of Cobh on Great Island in Cork Harbour, Ireland. It is in the townland of Ringacoltig ([tpl]Irish place name|Rinn an Chabaltaigh|headland of the navy[/tpl]).Placenames Database of Ireland
The area is named after Frederica Harriet Rushbrooke and her son and daughter who were granted lands under the 'Midleton Act' (1850). This followed the suicide of the 5th Viscount Midleton, George Alan Broderick (1806-1848), who died by inhaling charcoal on 1 November 1848. Succession to the titles and estate was court challenged and ultimately settled by Private Act of the House of Lords.
Land in Surrey and Ireland were settled on the Rushbrookes from the estates of Earl Broderick/Viscount Midleton, who became known as 'The most wretched man in the world' by his aristocratic peers in England.http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey+Heritage+talks+and+tours?opendocument Much disapproved of was his association with Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, the renowned Catholic architect and father of E W Pugin who later designed Cobh Cathedral. Even more disapproved of was his unorthodox relationships.
Rushbrooke contains some of the most beautiful examples of Victorian houses in Ireland, and is rapidly becoming one of the most sought after housing locations in the Cork region. There is much regeneration underway of the heritage houses of Rushbrooke, many of which are now listed buildings.
Rushbrooke has the oldest tennis club in Ireland, namely the Rushbrooke Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. 
Rushbrooke has a long tradition of ship and boat-building. The docks at Rushbrooke were founded by Joseph Wheeler and became the home of the former Dutch-owned Verolme Cork Dockyard which once employed over 1,100 people in shipbuilding. Many large ships were built and launched from Verolme as well as a number of naval vessels for the Irish Naval Service which has its headquarters nearby. Unfortunately the yard closed in the mid 1980s with major job losses but in recent years the dockyard has been redeveloped into a commercial and small industries park, while Cork Dockyard Holdings Ltd. continues with ship and boat repair.
An array of housing estates are being built on the outskirts of the Rushbrooke area at present.
