X-Ray Spex were an English punk band from London that formed in 1976.
During their first incarnation (1976–79), X-Ray Spex were “deliberate underachievers”[tpl]cite book |title= All Time Top 1000 Albums|last= Larkin|first= Colin|year= 1994|publisher= Guinness Publishing|location= Enfield|isbn= 0-85112-786-X|page= 236[/tpl] and only managed to release five singles and one album.[tpl]cite book |title= The Great Indie Discography|last= Strong|first= M.C.|year= 2003|publisher= Canongate|location= Edinburgh|isbn= 1-84195-335-0|page= 184[/tpl] Nevertheless, their first single, "Oh Bondage Up Yours!", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock singleMojo (October 2001) – 100 Punk Scorchers, Issue 95, London;[tpl]cite book |title= Up Yours!

==Career==

Initially, the band featured singer Poly Styrene (born Marianne Joan Elliott-Said) on vocals, Jak Airport (Jack Stafford) on guitars, Paul Dean on bass, Paul 'B. P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This latter instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl], and became one of the group's most distinctive features.  Lora played on only one of the band's records.  As she was only fifteen, playing saxophone was a hobby and she left the band to complete her education.x-ray spex official site/x-ray spex history
X-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as "effervescently discordant"allmusic review of The Anthology and "powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal".Poly Styrene from comnet.ca/~rina As Mari Elliot, Poly had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, "Silly Billy", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and remains one of the most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement.Are you ready to fly? – article from The Guardian Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on her teeth and once stated that "I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, The Anthology, that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a "strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out."Cinderella's Big Score:  Women of the Punk and Indie Underground by Maria Raha Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, recently said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, "Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy—it was just not relating to anything around it—superb."The Punk Years documentary
Styrene was inspired to form a band by seeing the Sex Pistols in Hastings and, through their live performances, she and X-Ray Spex became one of the most talked about acts on the infant punk scene.[tpl]cite book |title= Alternative Rock|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|isbn= 0-87930-607-6|page= 730[/tpl] The band played twice at the punk club The Roxy during its first 100 days. In March, the band played with The Drones and Chelsea. In April, they shared the bill with the Buzzcocks, Wire, and Johnny Moped.[tpl]cite book |title= Punk|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Collector's Guide Publication|location= Ontario|pages= 61–62[/tpl] Their first Roxy gig was only their second live appearance. It was recorded and their anthem "Oh Bondage Up Yours!" was included on the influential Live at the Roxy WC2 album.[tpl]cite book |title= Punk|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Collector's Guide Publication|location= Ontario|page= 102[/tpl] The publicity from this gig led to a "near residency", particularly on Sunday nights, at 'The Man on the Moon' pub, Kings Road, Chelsea, and record label interest.[tpl]cite book |title= Alternative Rock|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|page= 730[/tpl] 
In late September 1977, a studio recording of "Oh Bondage Up Yours!" was released as a single. Today, the 45 is regarded as their most enduring artefact, both as a piece of music and as a sort of proto-grrrl catchphrase.Michelle Lee, "Oh bondage up yours! The early punk movement—and the women who made it rock, Off Our Backs, Nov/Dec 2002[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/04/08/bofh_oh_bondage_up_yours/ |title=BOFH: Oh Bondage, Up Yours! (article demonstrating the use of the song title as a catchphrase) |work=The Register |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] Opening with the spoken/screamed line, "Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard but I think, oh bondage, up yours!", the song could be interpreted as a premonition of the riot grrrl movement a good 15 years later, although Styrene herself insists it was more intended as an anti-consumerist/anti-capitalist jingle, and was not exclusively feminist in nature.
In late 1977, Lora Logic was replaced on saxophone, first temporarily by Glyn John, and then permanently by Rudi Thompson (also known as Steve Rudi).[tpl]cite AV media notes|title=Germ Free Adolescents Expanded |titlelink=Germ Free Adolescents |last=Tyler |first=Kieron |type=CD liner |year=2005[/tpl]
In November 1978, the band released their debut album. With the exception of "Identity", which was partially based on Styrene seeing a girl slash her wrists in a club toilet, the rest of Germ Free Adolescents dealt with the anti consumerist theme. Indeed, The Guardian newspaper described the album as containing "unrivalled anti-consumerism anthems".[tpl]cite book |title= 1,000 Albums To Hear Before You Die|last= The Guardian|year= November 2007|location= London[/tpl]
X-Ray Spex played at 'Front Row Festival', a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor, Islington in late November and early December 1977. This resulted in the band's inclusion, alongside the likes of Wilko Johnson, 999, The Only Ones, the Saints, The Stranglers, and XTC, on a double album of recordings from the festival. Then, in February 1978, before the release of their second single, X-Ray Spex recorded the first of two sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1.X-Ray Spex’s John Peel Sessions on BBC Radio 1; Their profile was further enhanced by playing a fortnight's residency at New York's CBGB's, even though the album Germ Free Adolescents was not released in America until 1992.
On 30 April, the band appeared at the Rock Against Racism gig at Victoria Park, Bow, Tower Hamlets. Also on the bill were Steel Pulse, The Clash, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X and Tom Robinson Band. Later in the year, to promote the album, X-Ray Spex embarked on their first, and only, full UK tour. Exhausted by touring, Poly Styrene left the band in mid 1979, though she is seen performing with the band in the 1980 film, D.O.A.. She released a solo album, Translucence, before joining the Hare Krishna movement (as did Logic, who left the band aged 16 in 1977 to form a new group called Essential Logic).
Without Styrene, the group lost its momentum and split up. Hurding and Airport went on to form Classix Nouveaux, while Paul Dean and Rudi Thompson went on to form Agent Orange with Anthony "Tex" Doughty, who later become a founding member of Transvision Vamp.
The first incarnation of X-Ray Spex existed from mid-1976 to 1979, during which time they released five singles—"Oh Bondage, Up Yours", "Identity", "The Day the World Turned Day-Glo", "Germ Free Adolescents", and "Highly Inflammable"—and one album, Germ Free Adolescents.PUNKNET 77 – X-Ray Spex One retrospective review described the singles as “not only riveting examples of high-energy punk, but contained provocative, thoughtful lyrics berating the urban synthetic fashions of the 70s and urging individual expression”.[tpl]cite book |title= Virgin Encyclopedia of 70s Music|last= Larkin|first= Colin|year= 2002|publisher= Virgin Books|location= London|isbn= 1-85227-947-8|page= 503[/tpl]
The same reviewer in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music sums up the band's 1970s contribution as “one of the most inventive, original and genuinely exciting groups to emerge during the punk era”.

==Reformation==

In 1988, Poly Styrene, Jak Airport, Mick Sweeney and Lora Logic reformed the band with no drummer. As a replacement bought in Paul Merron who had a sequencer, small studio set up provided drum loops played keyboards and co-produced demos with Jak. They rehearsed in Oxted at Poly's home and then went into Nomis studios in Olympia London prior to a planned trip to India to shoot video and recording session in Florence. Unfortunately Jak broke his arm in a cycling accident and after a period of 6 months with the band Paul was asked to not only be in the band and make video promos but also to manage them too. This seemed unrealistic so he left and went to live in Crete pursuing his other passions of photography and scuba diving. 
In 1991 X-Ray Spex reformed for a surprise sell-out gig at the Brixton Academy where Poly appeared in a blue foam dress with an army helmet (to her regret).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-poly-styrene-singer-51-811129.html|title=My secret life: Poly Styrene|work=The Independent|date=19 April 2008[/tpl] The group reformed again in 1995 with a line-up of Styrene, Dean and Logic to release a new album Conscious Consumer. Although heralded as the first in a trilogy, the album was not a commercial success. Styrene later explainedPoly Styrene’s Biography By Celeste Bell[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] from x-ray spex official site that touring and promotional work suffered an abrupt end when she was run over by a fire engine in central London, suffering a fractured pelvis. The group disbanded, but subsequent releases include a compilation of the group's early records, a live album, and an anthology of all the aforementioned.
Jak Airport later worked for the BBC's Corporate and Public Relations department under his real name, Jack Stafford; he died on 13 August 2004 of cancer.
