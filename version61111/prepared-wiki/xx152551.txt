==Summary==

In writer and director Anne Wheeler's Bye Bye Blues, a blue-collar family finds all sorts of unorthodox means to confront the tribulations of World War II. In Angel Square, Wheeler deals with a more contemporary subject: random street crime. Ned Beatty stars as a standard-issue husband and father in a "safe" neighbourhood. Beatty's sense of security is violated when he is brutally beaten by a youth gang. The familial spirit of Bye Bye Blues is carried over into the climax of Angel Square, with Beatty's neighbours uniting to track down his assailants.http://www.allmovie.com/work/angel-square-2361
