Later, she won the Best Actress Award in Star Awards 1999 with her breakthrough performance in Stepping Out, in which she played a long-suffering woman fighting against her fate.[tpl]cite news | author = | title = Stepping Out sweeps 5 awards | publisher = The Straits Times | date = 20 December 1999| page=4[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author = Tee Hun Ching| title = I was in shock | publisher = The Straits Times | date = 23 December 1999| page=L3[/tpl] This role earned her a nomination in the same category at the Asian Television Awards.
Koh was also part of the cast in three of MediaCorp TV Channel 8's long-running dramas. The 3 long-running dramas include: Holland V (Year 2003, 125 episodes), Portrait of Home (Year 2005, 100 episodes), Kinship (Year 2007, 86 episodes). Koh's role as Fu Baozhu (傅宝珠), a greedy and bossy woman in Portrait of Home granted her another Best Actress nomination in the Star Awards 2005. Unfortunately, she lost the award to veteran Huang Bi Ren.
While filming Mediacorp Channel U's blockbuster drama Show Hand in December 2011, it was reported that Koh delayed an ovarian cyst operation to finish filming the series.[tpl]citenews|title=Cynthia Koh delays ovarian cyst op to complete filming|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20120227-330482.html|publisher=AsiaOne|date=27 February 2011[/tpl]
In 2012, after not receiving an award for 15 years at the annual Star Awards, Koh made her comeback, winning her second Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste Award.
