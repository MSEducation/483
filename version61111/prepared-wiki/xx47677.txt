Halva (halawa, alva, haleweh, halava, helava, helva, halwa, halua, aluva, chalva) refers to many types of dense, sweet confections, served across the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Balkans, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Malta and the Jewish world.
The term halva ([tpl]lang-ar|حلاوة[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥalāwah[/tpl] / [tpl]lang|ar|حلوى[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥalwah[/tpl]), meaning "desserts" or "sweet", is used to describe two types of desserts:
Halva may also be based on numerous other ingredients, including sunflower seeds, various nuts, beans, lentils, and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, yams and squashes.[tpl]cite book  | last = Davidson  | first = Alan  | authorlink = Alan Davidson (food writer)  | coauthors =  | title = The Oxford Companion to Food  | publisher = Oxford University press  | year = 1999  | location = Oxford  | pages = xx + 892  | url =  | doi =  | isbn =  0-19-211579[/tpl]
Halva can be kept at room temperature with little risk of spoilage. However, during hot summer months, it is better kept refrigerated, as it can turn runny after several days.

==Etymology==

The word halva entered the English language between 1840 and 1850 from the Yiddish halva. The latter term came from the  Persian  language - Iran (halva - [tpl]lang|fa|حلوا[/tpl])  a word which itself ultimately derived from the [tpl]lang-ar|حلوى[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥalwā[/tpl], meaning sweet confection.Halvah, Random House Dictionary, 2009 The Arabic root [tpl]lang|ar|حلو[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥelw[/tpl] means "sweet".

==Types==

Most types of halva are relatively dense confections sweetened with sugar or honey. Their textures, however, vary. For example, semolina-based halva is gelatinous and translucent, while sesame-based halva is drier and more crumbly.

===Flour-based===

This type of halva is made by frying flour (such as semolina) in oil, mixing it into a roux, and then cooking it with a sugary syrup. This variety is popular in Greece, Iran, Turkey, Somalia, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. 

====Semolina (suji)====

This variety of halva, produced and served in India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and surrounding countries (different versions of it are also found in Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Montenegro, Macedonia and Turkey), is usually made with wheat semolina, sugar or honey, and butter or vegetable oil. Raisins, dates, other dried fruits, or nuts such as almonds or walnuts, are often added to semolina halva. The halva is very sweet, with a gelatinous texture similar to polenta; the added butter gives it a rich mouthfeel. The standard proportions of semolina halva are one part fat (a vegetable oil or butter), two parts semolina, two parts sweetening agent (e.g. sugar or honey) and four parts water. The semolina is sautéed in the fat while a syrup is being made of the sweetener and water. Then the two are mixed carefully while hot, and any extra ingredients are added. At this point, the halva is off-white to light beige, and rather soft. Depending on recipe and taste, it can be cooked a bit further, which makes it darker and firmer, or left to settle as is.
In India, halwa is prepared in different forms. The recipes use flour, melted butter, sugar and goondh (Dinka or Goond or Katira Goond or Gond or Kamarka). It comes in various colors like orange, brown, green and cream with a translucent appearance studded with cashew nuts, pistachios etc. Technically the term halva is used in native recipes throughout India, and though semolina halva is considered to be essentially a "Northern" confection, it is also quite popular in South India. A prominent South Indian version of halva (or alvaa in Tamil) is from Tirunelveli, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu. Another semolina preparation widely enjoyed throughout South India called kesari or kesari-bath originates from the state of Karnataka.
In Pakistan and India, vegetable based recipes include beetroots, potato, yam, and most commonly carrots (for gajar halwa), mung beans (for moong dal halwa) or bottle gourds (for doodi halwa) are also used instead of semolina. Prepared with condensed milk and ghee, without semolina to bind it together, the end result has a moist, yet flaky, texture when freshly prepared. Other examples include the famous Agra Petha easily available at Taj Mahal, Agra.

====Cornstarch====

Cornstarch halva is popular in Greece, and has many variations. The farsala recipe is the most well known. It is quite sweet, with caramel-like syrup.

====Rice flour====

This rice flour and coconut milk halva is common fare on the streets of Zanzibar.

===Nut butter–based===

This type of halva is made by grinding oily seeds, such as sesame, to a paste, and then mixing with hot sugar syrup cooked to hard-crack stage. This type is popular in the eastern Mediterranean and Balkan regions, in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Russia, Greece and Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Macedonia, Albania, Syria, Central Asia, southern India, the Caucasus region and Turkey. It is also popular in Algeria and on the central Mediterranean islands of Malta.

====Sesame====

Sesame halva is popular in the Balkans, Poland, Middle East, and other areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The primary ingredients in this confection are sesame butter or paste (tahini), and sugar, glucose or honey.Sesame Halva recipe SoapwortSeasoning Savvy: How to Cook With Herbs, Spices, and Other Flavorings By Alice Arndt, p.215Halva Ethnological Museum of Thrace (called ‘erq al halaweh in Arabic; çöven in Turkish), egg white, or marshmallow root are added in some recipes to stabilize the oils in the mixture or create a distinctive texture for the resulting confection.
Other ingredients and flavourings, such as pistachio nuts, cocoa powder, orange juice, vanilla or chocolate, are often added to the basic tahini and sugar base.

====Sunflower====

Sunflower halva is popular in countries in Eastern Europe, including Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. It is made of sunflower seeds instead of sesame.

===Other===

====Floss halva====

Pişmaniye (Turkish) or floss halva is a traditional sweet, prepared in Kocaeli, Turkey, made by flossing thin strands of halva into a light confection. Made primarily of wheat flour and sugar, the strands are continuously wrapped into a ball shape and then compressed. The result is a halva with a light consistency, similar to cotton candy. Floss halva can be found in regular and pistachio flavors, and there are brands with halal or kosher certifications.
A similar pistachio-based version of floss halva is popular in North India. It tends to be slightly denser and is often referred to as patisa or sohan papdi. In Chinese cuisine, a floss-like candy similar to pismaniye or pashmak halva, known as dragon beard candy, is eaten as a snack or dessert.
A raw version of halva also has become popular amongst proponents of raw food diets. In this version, a mixture of raw sesame tahini, raw almonds, raw agave nectar and salt are blended together and frozen to firm.Matt Amsden, RAWvolution: Gourmet Living Cuisine, HarperCollins, 2006
