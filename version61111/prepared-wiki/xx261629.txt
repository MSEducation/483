The Guffert is a [tpl]Convert|2195|m|ft[/tpl] high, isolated, prominent limestone alpenstock in the Brandenberg Alps (Rofan) that, together with the Guffertstein, forms a twin peak. It lies north of Steinberg am Rofan. Because it projects above the Mangfall Mountains to the north by about 300 metres, the striking double peak is easily recognised from the Alpine Foreland, the Tegernsee and the Bavarian Prealps.
