==History==

Work on the line started under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company, but were taken over by the government in 1856 after work faltered. Builders Kerr, Hodgson & Billings commenced work on the timber Williamstown station building in 1858, with the station opened to traffic on 17 January 1859. Arched bluestone road bridges were built over the cutting at Thompson and Cole Streets. Until 1987 the line continued around the bend to the now closed Williamstown Pier station. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 18 June 1996.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1997|title=Upgrading Eltham to a Premium Station|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|page=page 310[/tpl]
The building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is the second oldest railway station in Victoria, after St Kilda. It is also the oldest timber railway station building to survive in the state, and one of the earliest surviving timber public buildings in Victoria.[tpl]Cite AHPI|VICH1599|Williamstown railway station|accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl]
The central section of the station building remains today, but was originally flanked by two pavilions: one the stationmasters residence and on the other refreshment rooms. A now removed timber and iron veranda lined the street side of the station, while on the rail side the original platform canopy extended along the platform much further.
The Ann Street footbridge was installed c1883, and on electrification in 1916 the Thompson Street road bridge arch was removed and replaced with girder spans to provide increased clearance. Railway sidings, a signal box and weighbridge were once located opposite the station, but have been since removed.
