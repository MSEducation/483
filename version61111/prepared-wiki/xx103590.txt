==Blue House Raid==

On January 21, 1968, a group of 31 North Korean military soldiers was sent to South Korea by Kim Il-sung to kill President Park Chung-hee. A firefight began when the commandos were just 800 yards from the Blue House (the South Korean Presidential Palace). In all, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, including about two dozen civilians. Three or four Americans also died and three were wounded.

==Unit 684==

In response to the attempted assassination of Park Chung-hee, South Korea began training Unit 684, to infiltrate North Korea and kill Kim Il-sung.
The assassination mission was subsequently cancelled. On 23 August 1971, for reasons which remain unclear, the members of Unit 684 revolted, killing most of their guards and making their way to the mainland where they hijacked a bus to Seoul. The bus was stopped by the Army in Daebang-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul and 20 members of the Unit onboard were shot or committed suicide with hand grenades. The 4 survivors were sentenced to death by a military tribunal and executed on 10 March 1972.
