[[Centrophoridae]]

CATEGORIES: Centrophoridae

Centrophoridae are a family of squaliform sharks. The family contains just two genera and approximately 15 species. They are sometimes called gulper sharks but this is also the name of a specific species in the family, Centrophorus granulosus.
These are generally deepwater fish.  While some, such as the gulper shark Centrophorus granulosus, are found worldwide and fished commercially, others are uncommon and little-known.  Their usual prey is other fish; some are known to feed on squid, octopus, and shrimp.  Some species live on the bottom (benthic), while others are pelagic. They are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the egg-cases in her body until they hatch.[tpl]FishBase_family|family=Centrophoridae|year=2009|month=January[/tpl]
