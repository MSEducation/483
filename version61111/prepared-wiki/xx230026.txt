[[Vasomotor center]]

CATEGORIES: Brainstem

The vasomotor center (VMC) is a portion of the medulla oblongata[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~uzwiak/AnatPhys/Blood_Vessels.html |title=Blood Vessels |work= |accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl] that regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes. Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors, it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels. This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation, especially in the brain.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=2238 |title=Bionic blood pressure device being developed at Vanderbilt |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl] Cranial nerves IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure.
