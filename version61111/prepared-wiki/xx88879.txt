Mark Anthony Patrick Owen (born 27 January 1972), is an English singer-songwriter. He is a member of pop band Take That. As a solo artist, Owen had sold over 500,000 records worldwide and 45 million with Take That.

==Early life==

Owen was born in Oldham, Lancashire, England. He lived in a small council house with his mother Mary, his father Keith, brother Daniel and sister Tracy in Oldham, Lancashire. His father was a decorator, later getting a job at a police station. His mother was a supervisor in a bakery in Oldham. Owen was educated at the Holy Rosary Primary and St Augustine’s Catholic School in Oldham. Owen’s first ambition was to be a professional footballer; he starred in school plays but showed no interest in music at school, preferring football. He played for Chadderton F.C. for a brief period. He also had trials for Manchester United, Huddersfield Town and Rochdale, but damaged his groin and was unable to pursue a career in the sport. During the Take That “quiet” years, Owen spent some time back in Lancashire and was often spotted at musical events put on and performed by local boarding school, “Casterton School”. He used the school gymnasium on Tuesday evenings for football practice with mates.

===1989–1996: Early Success===

After selecting Gary Barlow as the group's lead singer in 1989, Nigel Martin-Smith introduced Owen, Howard Donald, Jason Orange and finally Robbie Williams to the fold. The group were signed to RCA records, and after a number of top 40 hits, eventually secured their first number one with Barlow's "Pray". Previous hits included "A Million Love Songs", "It Only Takes a Minute" and "Could It Be Magic".
The band's debut album Take That & Party was released on 17 August 1992. It reached number two on the UK Album Chart. The following year saw the release of their second album, Everything Changes. It went straight in at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles, as well as "Why Can't I Wake Up with You" and "Love Ain't Here Anymore" hitting number two and three respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=Search both songs Every Hit |publisher=Everyhit.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl] Owen sang lead vocals on "Babe", which was released in December 1993.

This was to be the first single released by Take That as a four piece (without Williams) and it was their last single until they reformed in 2005.
Although Owen's vocal contributions were limited in Take That's original run, he was arguably the most popular member of the group, on account of his boyish good looks and sweet demeanour,[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] regularly earning awards such as Smash Hit's "Most Fanciable Male in the World" and "Best Haircut".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-artist-formerly-known-as-the-pretty-one-1312521.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=The artist formerly known as the pretty one | first=Ben | last=Thompson | date=1 December 1996[/tpl]

==Solo career==

===1996-1997: Green Man===

After Take That split, Owen became the first of the band's ex-members to release a solo record. He reached number three in the UK Singles Chart with his debut single, "Child". His second single, "Clementine", also went to number three. In 1997 his album Green Man was released, charting at a number 33. After another single, "I Am What I Am", charted at number 29, Owen was dropped by BMG Records in late 1997.

===2002-2003: Celebrity Big Brother & In Your Own Time===

Owen won the second series of Celebrity Big Brother in November 2002 with 77% of the public vote against television presenter Les Dennis. Owen broke down in tears, overwhelmed by the fans' support. After being invited to perform on stage with Robbie Williams at Knebworth, he returned to the spotlight and signed a deal with Island/Universal Records. In August 2003, Owen returned to the charts with the Top 5 hit, "Four Minute Warning", which remained in the Top 40 for eight weeks. His second album, In Your Own Time, was released in November 2003, entering the charts at number 59. After a second single, "Alone Without You", charted at number 26, Owen was dropped by Island/Universal Records.

===2004-2006: How the Mighty Fall===

In April 2004 he established his own record company, Sedna Records. One report around 2004 even alleged that Owen was looking for a day job, but he simply said "Doing it properly isn't cheap. These are my indulgences. I don't have a Ferrari, I have two albums."
Mark released his first single "Makin' Out" which charted at #30 in the UK charts, making it his highest charted single released in an independent label. He released his third solo album, How the Mighty Fall in 18 April 2005, which was recorded at Sunset Studios, Los Angeles in 2004. It charted at #56 in the German charts. According to Mark, he said that this is more "his" album than the last couple because he has had full control over every aspect of the record and it is a true representation of where he is at in his life right now. On the strength of this release, he was picked up by Caroline Elleray (Coldplay, Keane), resulting in him signing his publishing deal to BMG Music Publishing. Mark released his second single "Believe in the Boogie", charting at #57 in the UK charts, making it his lowest charting single of his whole solo career. Although it didn't chart well, his second single has been added to the European soundtrack of the American film Mr. and Mrs. Smith starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. In February 2006 he released "Hail Mary" as a single from the album.

===2012-present: The Art of Doing Nothing===
