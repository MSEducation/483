Ballyhaunis ([tpl]Irish place name|Béal Átha hAmhnais[/tpl])Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) is a town in County Mayo, Ireland. It is situated at the crossroads of the N60 and N83 National secondary roads and on the railway line connecting Dublin to Westport and Ballina. 
It is thought that the town grew up around St Mary's Augustinian Friary (popularly referred to as "the Abbey"), which was founded in 1348, according to local tradition. The town and the surrounding hinterland is steeped in history and contains an extraordinary concentration of megalithic monuments.A Very Short History of Ballyhaunis and District Annagh Magazine, 2008. Local writer Paul Waldron explains that the full meaning of the name Béal Átha hAmhnais remains elusive: "The origins of that name has been the subject of much study and debate over the centuries. Beal Átha means the ford mouth, but what the last element means is still the subject of debate. Suggestions range from derivatives of 'Abhann', meaning river, or of 'amhnas', said to mean 'strife' or 'plunder'."
The town is a mixed community where farming, private business and industry are the main sources of employment. Employment, infrastructure and continued development of the town are key issues addressed by the Ballyhaunis Local Area Plan 2010-2016, adopted by Mayo County Council on 8 February 2010.Ballyhaunis Local Area Plan 2010–2016 Mayo County Council, 2010-02-08.
It has become a cosmopolitan area in recent decades. Even prior to Ireland's period of economic growth between 1995 and 2007, there were children of at least seven nationalities attending schools in the town. These included Pakistani, Syrian, Russian, English, Polish and Lithuanian. More recently, other nationalities have been attracted to Ballyhaunis, with immigrants from several countries in Africa and Eastern Europe now settled in the area. There are two Catholic churches in the town and it is also home to Ireland's only purpose-built mosque outside Dublin, which is the second most westerly mosque in Europe, after the Lisbon Mosque.[tpl]cite web | title=Lisbon Mosque | work=Wikipedia - Lisbon Mosque | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Mosque | accessdate=2007-09-06[/tpl] The results of the 2006 census showed that some 36 per cent of Ballyhaunis residents are non-Irish. The town's population in the 2011 Census was 3,008.Actual and percentage change in population 2006 to 2011 by Province County City Urban area Rural area and Electoral division by District, Year and Statistic Central Statistics Office.

==War of Independence==

Due to the active East Mayo Brigade of the Irish Volunteers during the Irish War of Independence, Ballyhaunis witnessed a number of incidents. On August 2, 1920, the Volunteers ambushed a British Army lorry on the Claremorris road from Ballyhaunis. This resulted in the capture of arms and ammunition for the Volunteers. A high cross marks the spot of the ambush. On April 1, 1921, Sean Corcoran, O/C of the East Mayo Brigade, was shot dead by British soldiers after a short gunfight at Crossard crossroads (6 km north of Ballyhaunis). A high cross marks the spot where Corcoran died.  Later that same day, a member of the Black and Tans was killed by a sniper. In retaliation, the Black and Tans executed Michael Coen, a man that was later proven not to have taken part in fighting of any kind. A monument to Coen was placed on the Cloonfad/ Galway road from Ballyhaunis.
