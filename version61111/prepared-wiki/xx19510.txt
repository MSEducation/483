The marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26 miles and 385 yards),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bcathletics.org/main/rr_iaaf.htm|title=IAAF Competition Rules for Road Races|year=2009|publisher=International Association of Athletics Federations|accessdate=1 November 2010|work=International Association of Athletics Federations[/tpl] that is usually run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens.
The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become standardized until 1921. More than 500 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes. Smaller marathons, such as the Stanley Marathon, can have just dozens of participants,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.penguin-news.com/index.php/news/sport/item/301-falkland-islands-sport-the-windiest-marathon-on-earth|title=The Windiest Marathon on Earth|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl] while larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.the Marathon race directory.

==History==

===Origin===

The name Marathon[tpl]refn|group=n|In modern Greek the sports event is called Marathonios Dromos ([tpl]lang|el|Μαραθώνιος Δρόμος[/tpl]) or simply Marathonios.[/tpl] comes from the legend of Pheidippides, a Greek messenger. The legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon (in which he had just fought),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeffgalloway.com/retreats/athens.html |title=Retreats — Athens |publisher=Jeffgalloway.com |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl] which took place in August or September, 490 BC.The Moon and the Marathon, Sky & Telescope. Skytonight.com (19 July 2004). Retrieved on 18 April 2013.  It is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly, exclaiming νενικήκαμεν (nenikekamen, "we have wοn"), before collapsing and dying.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/faq10.html |title=Ancient Olympics FAQ 10 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl] The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appears in Plutarch's On the Glory of Athens in the 1st century AD which quotes from Heraclides Ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.Moralia 347C Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) also gives the story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).A slip of the tongue in Salutation, Chapter 3
There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marathonguide.com/history/olympicmarathons/prologue.cfm |title=Prologue: The Legend |publisher=Marathonguide.com |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl]Holland, Tom (2007) Persian Fire, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, ISBN 0307386988. The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentions Pheidippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over [tpl]convert|240|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl] each way.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.co.nz/articles/2002a007.html#appendix |title=The Great Marathon Myth |publisher=Coolrunning.co.nz |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl] In some Herodotus manuscripts the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides. Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.
In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem Pheidippides. Browning's poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
Mount Penteli stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that, if Pheidippides actually made his famous run after the battle, he had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south. The latter and more obvious route matches almost exactly the modern Marathon-Athens highway, which follows the lie of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper. This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl] long, and this was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races. However there have been suggestions that Pheidippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens. This route is considerably shorter, some [tpl]convert|35|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl], but includes a very steep initial climb of more than [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl].

===Modern Olympics marathon===

When the modern Olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece. The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks. The Greeks staged a selection race for the Olympic marathon on 10 March 1896 that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory Olympic Games marathon coming in fifth). The winner of the first Olympic Marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon "Spyros" Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds.
The women's marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, USA) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/olympic-champion-joan-ben.shtml |title=Olympic Champion Joan Benoit Samuelson To Be Guest of Honor at Manchester Marathon — Registration Closed |publisher=Cool Running |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl]
Since the modern games were founded, it has become a tradition for the men's Olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, with a finish inside the Olympic stadium, often within hours of, or even incorporated into, the closing ceremonies. The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics revived the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics.

===Marathon mania===

Johnny Hayes' victory at the 1908 Summer Olympics contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the United States.[tpl]cite book |title=The World 1910 Almanac and Encyclopedia |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cGA3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PP7 |year=1909 |publisher=Press Publishing Company |location=New York|pages=384–385|chapter=Track and Field Athletics |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=cGA3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA384[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Whorton |first1=James C. |editor1-first=Jack W. |editor1-last=Berryman |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Park |title=Sport and Exercise Science: Essays in the History of Sports Medicine |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TVklQ4FX76wC&printsec=frontcover|year=1992 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-06242-6 |page=127 |chapter="Athlete's Heart": The Medical Debate over Athleticism, 1870–1920 |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=TVklQ4FX76wC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA109[/tpl] Later that year, races around the holiday season including the Empire City Marathon held on New Year's Day 1909 in Yonkers, New York, marked the early running craze referred to as "marathon mania".[tpl]cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Roger |date=January–February 2009 |title=Footsteps: 'Tis the (Racing) Season; 100 Years of Holiday Running |journal=Running Times Magazine|accessdate=10 February 2011 |url=http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=15263[/tpl] Following the 1908 Olympics, the first five amateur marathons in New York City were held on days that held special meanings to ethnic communities: Thanksgiving Day, the day after Christmas, New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, and Lincoln's Birthday.[tpl]cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Pamela |title=The American Marathon |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cSPF71aP0qsC&printsec=frontcover |year=1999 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=0-8156-0573-0 |pages=27–48 | chapter=New York City Marathon Culture |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=cSPF71aP0qsC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl]
Frank Shorter's victory in the marathon at the 1972 Summer Olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intense than that which followed Hayes' win 64 years earlier.  By 2009, an estimated 467,000 runners completed a marathon within the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.runningusa.org/node/57770#57771|title=Running USA's Annual Marathon Report|publisher=RunningUSA.org|accessdate=12 November 2010|work=RunningUSA[/tpl] This can be compared to 143,000 in 1980.

===Inclusion of women===

For a long time after the Olympic marathon started, there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women. Although a few women had run the marathon distance, they were not included in any official results.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marathonguide.com/history/olympicmarathons/chapter25.cfm|title=Olympic Marathon (excerpt)|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc.|accessdate=1 November 2010|work=Charlie Lovett[/tpl] Marie-Louise Ledru has been credited as the first woman to race a marathon.[tpl]cite web |title=World Best Progressions- Road |url=http://www.arrs.net/RecProg/RP_wwR.htm |work=Association of Road Racing Statisticians |accessdate=1 November 2010 [/tpl]Krise, Raymond and Squires, Bill (1982).

Violet Piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon. For challenging the long-held tradition of all-male marathon running in the Boston Marathon, in 1967, Kathrine Switzer is regarded as the first woman to run a marathon as a numbered entry, but did so unofficially, due to a fluke in the entry process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katherineswitzer.com/|title=Marathon Woman|accessdate=1 November 2010|work=Kathrine Switzer[/tpl] Bobbi Gibb had completed the Boston race unofficially the previous year,Boston Marathon History. baa.org and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women’s winner for that year, as well as 1967 and 1968.Boston Marathon History: Past Women's Open Champions. baa.org

==Distance==

The length of an Olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first, but the marathon races in the first few Olympic Games were about [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|sp=uk[/tpl],Bryant, J. (2007) 100 Years and Still Running, Marathon News roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens by the longer, flatter route. The exact length depended on the route established for each venue.

===1908 Olympics===

The International Olympic Committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 London Olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometres. The organisers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at Windsor Castle to the royal entrance to the White City Stadium, followed by a lap (586 yards, 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the Royal Box.[tpl]cite journal|author=Wilcock, Bob |title=The 1908 Olympic Marathon|journal= Journal of Olympic History|volume= 16 |issue =1|date=March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.athensmarathon.com/marathon/history.html|title=History of the Athens Marathon|accessdate=23 July 2012[/tpl] The course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium, followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish.
The modern 42.195 km standard distance for the marathon was set by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) in May 1921"Marathon: How it works", IAAF website[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080924220856/http://www.european-athletics.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6235&Itemid=2|title=The Marathon journey to reach 42.195km |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=european-athletics.org|accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Martin|first=David E.|coauthors=Roger W.

Course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one metre per kilometre to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance.
For events governed by IAAF rules, it is mandatory that the route be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometres. The rules make no mention of the use of miles. The IAAF will only recognise world records that are established at events that are run under IAAF rules. For major events, it is customary to publish competitors' timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognised by the IAAF (such as 20 km, 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon, and completes the marathon course.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=IAAF Competition Rules 2010–2011 |pages=230–235 |format=PDF |publisher=IAAF|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl]

===World records and world's best===

World records were not officially recognized by the IAAF until 1 January 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the 'world best'. Courses must conform to IAAF standards for a record to be recognized. However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

Most participants do not run a marathon to win. More important for most runners is their personal finish time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run–walk strategy.  In 2005, the average marathon time in the U.S. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women.
A goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours.{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutrunning.net/sri-chinmoy-racesblog/running-sub-3-hour-marathon |title=Running a sub 3 hour marathon | allaboutrunning.net |publisher=allaboutrunning.netTypically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). Many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. Anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. In many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal.
With the growth in popularity of marathoning, many marathons across the United States and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. When the Boston Marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours.Online, sprinters win race: Marathon fills its field in a record 8 hours.

===Training===

The long run is an important element in marathon training.McMillan, Greg The Marathon Long Run. mcmillanrunning.com Recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about [tpl]convert|32|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in their longest weekly run and a total of about [tpl]convert|64|km|abbr=on[/tpl] a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury. Most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over [tpl]convert|160|km|abbr=on|-1[/tpl].[tpl]Cite book| author=Daniels, J. PhD | title=Daniels' Running Formula, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Human Kinetics Publishing | year=2005 | isbn=0-7360-5492-8[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of tapering in the weeks preceding the race. For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended.Whitsett et al. (1998) The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer. Master's Press.Finishing A Marathon. Calendarofmarathons.com. Retrieved on 18 April 2013.  Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%. It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program, to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses.[ref]
[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl][/ref] The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training, with a periodization of the general plan.[ref]

The last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also "carbo-load" (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen.

===Glycogen and "the wall"===

Carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km/18–20 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.half-marathon-running.com/HittingTheWall |title=Hitting the wall for marathon runners |publisher=Half-marathon-running.com |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl] When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to "hit the wall". The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches,Lesser-known Dangers Associated with Running a Marathon Retrieved 9/7/2009 is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the "wall" is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Carbohydrate-based "energy gels" are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of "hitting the wall", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely.
Alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race. It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the COX-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brater|first=D.

The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time. Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.
After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended. In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery.[tpl]Cite book|title= Marathon Training for Dummies |last=Stouffer Drenth |first= Tere |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc. |location=United States |isbn=0-7645-2510-7[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Health risks==

Marathon running has various health risks.Keener, Candace. (27 February 2008) HowStuffWorks "The Health Risks of the Marathon". Entertainment.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved on 19 April 2011. Training and the races themselves put runners under stress. While rare, even death is a possibility during a race.
Common health risks include injury such as tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, extreme dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), and other conditions. Many are categorised as overuse injuries.

===Cardiac health===

A study published in 1996Risk for sudden cardiac death associated with marathon running. Retrieved 13 December 2008. found that the risk of a fatal heart attack during or up to 24 hours after a marathon was approximately 1 in 50,000 over an athlete's racing career[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980600ap/oconnor.html |title=American Family Physician: Sudden death in young athletes: screening for the needle in a haystack |publisher=Aafp.org |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl]—which the authors characterised as an "extremely small" risk. The paper went on to say that since the risk was so small, cardiac screening programs for marathons were not warranted. However, this study was not an attempt to assess the overall benefit or risk to cardiac health of marathon running.
In 2006, a study of 60 non-elite marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins (see Troponin) which indicate heart damage or dysfunction after they had completed the marathon, and gave them ultrasound scans before and after the race. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had done less than [tpl]convert|56|km|abbr=on[/tpl] per week of training before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than [tpl]convert|72|km|abbr=on[/tpl] per week of training beforehand showed few or no heart problems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bankingmiles.blogspot.com/2006/11/marathons-dangerous-for-your-heart.html |title=Banking Miles: marathons dangerous for your heart? |publisher=Bankingmiles.blogspot.com |accessdate=22 August 2009[/tpl]
According to a study presented in 2010, running a marathon can result in decreased function of more than half the segments in the heart's main pumping chamber, but other parts of the heart will take over.

===Water consumption dangers===

Overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death.Merck Manual: Hyponatremia.

Lucero's cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy, a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH).

Fluid intake should be adjusted individually as factors such as body weight, gender, climate, pace, fitness (VO2 max), and sweat rate are just a few variables that change fluid requirements between people and races.

A patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood. Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water.

==Charity involvement==

Particularly for marathons, it is common to find charities associated with various races. Marathon organizers allotted their limited spacing and entry slots for charity organizations. Runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when open marathon entries are no longer available.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]
In some cases, marathons are organized as a fund-raiser for charity organizations (funding raised via entry fees or through sponsorships).
