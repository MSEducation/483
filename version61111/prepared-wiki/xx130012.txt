A hurricane party is a social event held by people in the coastal United States who live in hurricane alley between Maine and Texas and is common in the Southeast.[tpl]cite web|title=How to Throw a Hurricane Party for Irene|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/how-throw-hurricane-party-irene-305338|date=August 26, 2011|publisher=International Business Times[/tpl] The event is held during a hurricane just as any other party would. However the guests are typically allowed to stay with the host for 3â€“5 days (weather permitting) and guests, in return, bring hurricane supplies such as radios, first aid supplies, food, etc.[tpl]cite web|title=How to Host a Hurricane Party|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/how-host-hurricane-party-494180.html|author=Kathy Browning|date=Aug 20, 2007|accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl]

==Background==

Hurricane parties were formed by people living in the southern hurricane areas of the United States, especially in  Florida. Events are held by people who, for differing reasons, cannot or choose not to evacuate during a hurricane warning. Hosts may also lack hurricane supplies, therefore they invite others to stay with them so as to share supplies and company. However, these events are usually more centered around the people and the socialness of the event, yet they are not necessarily done with diversion as an objective.
Another rationale for hosting hurricane parties is the expectation that power service may be lost for days or even weeks. As a result most perishable items, particularly frozen meats, will surely be wasted after the storm. In order to make good use of these items, grilling is an important aspect of many hurricane parties, as a way of "cleaning out the freezer."

==Party supplies and customs==

Although the guests are expected to bring drinks and food, the host is primarily responsible for supplying a minimal amount of each for all guests involved. The host will also be required to have enough space in his/her house for the people invited, as well as having prepared the house for the coming hurricane (i.e. window boarding, standby generator).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/hurricane-party-61103.html|title=What Is A Hurricane Party?|accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl]
Also, in an adult environment, alcohol will most likely be present,[tpl]cite book|title=Vintage Cocktails: Retro Recipes for the Home Mixologist|author=Amanda Hallay|year=2011|isbn=1616083948|page=106[/tpl] as is customary in some locations to drink according to the intensity of the hurricane.
