Green cestrum is highly attractive to birds, and seedlings are often found growing under perching trees, along fence lines and on creek banks. It is also dispersed by water.
Spread by birds, it invades gardens, rural lands and bushland. It has a deep and persistent taproot. This weed is considered a major problem because of its toxicity to livestock (especially cattle) and poultry which eat green cestrum when there is a shortage of other feed.Farming Small Areas, p. 17, "Vigorous toxic threat", Rural Press, North Richmond, April 2009 All parts of the plant material, stems, leaves, berries and even partly burnt roots pose a serious threat to livestock."Country Leader", Northern Daily Leader, Tamworth, 5 May 2008, Death is usually rapid and painful. The plant is also known to be toxic to other livestock and humans. 
This species is defined as a noxious plant in New South Wales under the Noxious Weeds Act, 1993 and all plants must be destroyed.
In cultivation in the United Kingdom, this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2303
