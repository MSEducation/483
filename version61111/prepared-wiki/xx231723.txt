Hawthorne is a rail station located in Hawthorne, New Jersey in Passaic County. Volunteer Railroaders Association (aka VRA), a non-profit railroad preservation group leases the station from the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. The station is single floor wooden structure at grade with the local area. Formerly brown and cream colored, the station has currently been repainted blue-green and red as part of an ongoing restoration.  The station once served as the commuter ticket office until June 30, 1966 and was also used as a freight depot building.
The original station at this location was built in 1872. In 1894 a fire destroyed the station and the station was rebuilt in a larger form. Since 1872, the present station has been located on the corner of Royal Avenue and County Route 654 (Diamond Bridge Avenue).

The move of just 75 feet within the same plot away from the corner was to alleviate the nearly monthly truck strikes to the southeast roof corner. As a part of this move a concrete brick and poured floor foundation was constructed. The move contractor hired made the move of the station onto the new foundation on September 20, 2010. After the move the areas of deteriorated siding were replaced and adding a new coat of paint was begun. Also added was a deck with safety railing, a fence between the station & the railroad and a garden area in the location of the old station footing.
It is proposed that New Jersey Transit will build a new station for the northern terminus of the Passaic-Bergen Rail Line adjacent to the NJ Transit Main Line's Hawthorne station several blocks away from this station.http://nyswpassengerrail.blogspot.com/  The neighbourhood of the original Erie mainline station would benefit from state funding to improve signage, lighting and parking.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/105413858_HAWTHORNE_PURSUES_TRANSIT_VILLAGE_STATUS.html|title=Hawthorne aims to spruce up rail neighborhood, end parking woes with 'transit village' concept|last=Shrestha|first=Kamana|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Record|publisher=North Jersey Media Group LLC|pages=1â€“2|accessdate=23 October 2010|location=Bergen County, New Jersey[/tpl]
