Terrick Terrick National Park is a [tpl]convert|3880|ha|acres|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] national park in Victoria, Australia, [tpl]convert|225|km|miles|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of Melbourne, [tpl]convert|4|km|miles|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the town of Mitiamo and [tpl]convert|65|km|miles|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the City of Bendigo. It is an important remnant of Box-Ironbark forests and northern grass plains and is close to Kow Swamp, the site of a major palaeontological find providing insight into the origins of Indigenous Australians.  There are many walking tracks and one basic campground. Drinking water is not available in the park and must be carried.
Terrick Terrick National park was one of the last remaining strongholds for the Plains-wanderer, an endangered Australian endemic bird species. Sadly, land management techniques employed by Parks Victoria has seen the species almost wiped-out, in addition to the creation of dangerous fuel loads, and the prevalence of many noxious weeds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2012/11/14/549199_latest-news.html |title=Blunder threatens Plains Wanderer[/tpl] The park is part of the Patho Plains Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International principally because of its importance for the conservation of Plains-wanderers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Patho Plains |accessdate=2011-09-14 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
