The Master Singers were a British vocal group in the 1960s.  Comprising four schoolmasters, they specialised in comedic recordings of mundane documents and announcements such as the radio weather forecast and Highway Code, performed a cappella as Anglican chant.  Two of their records, "Highway Code" and "Weather Forecast", both produced by George Martin, reached the UK singles chart in 1966.

==History==

The original setting of the Highway Code as a psalm chant was devised by John Horrex, a teacher at Abingdon School, in the late 1950s.  He performed it with various friends at local church and school social events for several years.  In 1963, to celebrate the school's tercentenary, Horrex with three other teachers – George Pratt, Geoff Keating and Barry Montague – made a private recording of the Highway Code in several different styles.  A copy of the recording reached broadcaster and humourist Fritz Spiegl, who in turn passed it to the BBC where it was played on a radio show hosted by Winston Churchill, the grandson of the former Prime Minister.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.batesline.com/archives/2007/05/the-definitive.html|title=The definitive story of the Mastersingers, the Weather Forecast, and the Highway Code|last1=Bates|first1=Michael|last2=Keating|first2=Helen|publisher=BatesLine|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]  
The group were then contracted to record for Parlophone Records.  They first appeared on record in late 1965 with Peter Sellers on his version of the Beatles' "Help!", which was released as the B-side of his version of "A Hard Day's Night", produced by George Martin."Help!" at 45cat.com.

The Master Singers' version of "Highway Code", arranged by Horrex and Keating and produced by George Martin, was released in April 1966, and rose to no.25 on the UK pop chart.[tpl]cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=499[/tpl]  They followed it up with "Telephone Directory", and then "Weather Forecast", which reached no.50.

The group also made several television appearances.  Montague left the group to move to Australia, and was replaced by Mike Warrington from Cheadle Hulme School.  As the original members each left Abingdon School, and their teaching careers took them to different parts of the country – Horrex to Glasgow, Pratt to Keele, and Keating to Cheadle Hulme – the group split up.
