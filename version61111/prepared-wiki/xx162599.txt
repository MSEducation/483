[[Grass skirt]]

CATEGORIES: Polynesian clothing, Skirts

A grass skirt, also known as hula skirt, is a skirt that hangs from the waist and covers all or part of the legs.  Grass skirts were made of many different natural fibers, such as hibiscus, palm, or Phormium tenax in New Zealand, and are traditional clothes in many different cultures from Polynesia to Africa. They are still worn today by hula girls in Hawaii where the skirt is known as pāʻū, and in New Zealand by kapa haka performers.
