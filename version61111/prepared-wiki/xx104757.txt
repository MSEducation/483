==History==

Elk was originally called "Greenwood" after early homesteaders, the Greenwood brothers, sons of mountain man Caleb Greenwood, one of the rescuers of the Donner Party.  When the post office was opened, in 1887, there was already another Greenwood in California so it was called Elk Post Office.  Eventually the name came to refer to the town.  It is an outgrowth of an earlier town called Cuffy's Cove and the cemetery is located at that townsite [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of Elk.  When pioneer lumberman Lorenzo White was unable to reach a satisfactory deal with the owners of the lumber chutes at Cuffy's Cove to ship out his redwood product, he constructed a wharf out along a string of rocks in the center of what is now Elk.  When he built a large steam sawmill and 3-foot (90-cm) gauge railroad, the new employment drained the town of Cuffy's Cove which was eventually abandoned.  The sawmill was producing [tpl]convert|80000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1[/tpl] of lumber per day by 1890.  The mill was sold to Goodyear Redwood Company in 1916.  Elk River Company took over the sawmill when Goodyear went bankrupt in 1932.  The local redwood lumber industry economy collapsed when the uninsured sawmill burned in 1936.[tpl]cite book| title=Redwood Lumber Industry |author=Carranco, Lynwood |publisher=Golden West Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-87095-084-3 |pages=206â€“207[/tpl]
Another sawmill was built in about 1953 and one more in 1963.  These operated until the late 1960s when the redwood and Douglas fir was mostly logged out.  After some quiet times, the town has had a rebirth as a recreation destination.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]  Many of the larger old houses are now Bed & Breakfast inns and the State has acquired the Greenwood Creek beach and the original mill site as a state park.
The ZIP Code is 95432. The community is inside area code 707.
