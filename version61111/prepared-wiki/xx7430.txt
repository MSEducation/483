Malmö ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˈmalːˈmøː|-|sv-Malmö.ogg[/tpl]) is Sweden's third largest city by population, after Stockholm and Gothenburg. It is the capital of Skåne County. Together with Copenhagen, it constitutes the transnational Öresund Region.
Malmö was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns of Scandinavia, but it struggled with the adaptation to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the Öresund bridge, Malmö has undergone a major transformation with architectural developments, attracting new biotech and IT companies, and particularly students through Malmö University, founded in 1998. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial centre for the western part of Scania. Malmö was ranked #4 in Grist Magazine's "15 Green Cities" list in 2007.[tpl]cite web|author=by Grist |url=http://www.grist.org/article/cities3/ |title=15 Green Cities |publisher=Grist |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2011-09-15[/tpl].

The administrative entity for most of the city is Malmö Municipality which, as of 31 March 2013, has 309,105 inhabitants in eight different localities. Malmö is also a bimunicipal locality, as part of it is formally situated in Burlöv Municipality.Statistiska Centralbyrån Befolkningsstatistik 31 mars 2013.

==History==

Malmö is thought to have been founded in 1275, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] to the north-east. It was for centuries Denmark's second biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning "Gravel pile" or "Ore Hill".
In the 15th century, Malmö became one of Denmark's largest and most frequented cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the Öresund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, notable for its flourishing herring fishing. During that time, the city arms were granted in 1437 by King Eric of Pomerania. It was based on Eric's own arms from Pomerania: argent with a griffin gules. It gave the griffin's head to Malmö, eventually this extended to the entire province of Scania.
In 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malmöhus, did not get its current appearance until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malmö Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malmöhus remains.
Lutheran teachings became popular during the 16th century, and Malmö was one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527–29).
In the 17th century, Malmö and the Scanian region (Skåneland) came into Swedish possession. This happened following the Treaty of Roskilde, signed in 1658. Fighting was not yet over, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malmö for a month, but were unable to conquer the Swedish troops holding it.
By the dawn of the 18th century, Malmö had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, due to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden and bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbour was constructed by the late 18th century. The city started to expand, and in 1800 had 38,054 inhabitants.Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911), article Malmö
In 1840, the Kockums shipyard was founded and it eventually became one of the largest shipyards in the world. Between 1856 and 1864 the Southern Main Line was built and enabled Malmö to become a center of manufacture, with big textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malmö overtook Norrköping to become Sweden's third most populous city and by 1900 Malmö had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malmö continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952. By 1971, Malmö reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl]
By the mid-1970s, Sweden experienced a recession that struck especially hard on the industrial sector; shipyards and manufacturing industries were hard hit, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malmö as its greatest employer and when the shipbuilding ceased in 1986 the reassurance for the future of Malmö plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper middle class. By 1985, Malmö had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.
The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malmö's decline as an industrial city; between 1990–95, Malmö lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 and under the leadership of the former mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malmö started to re-conceptualize itself as a center of culture and knowledge. Malmö reached bottom in 1995 and the same year marked the commencement of the massive Öresund Bridge project. A new university Malmö University, was opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside and further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001 and its buildings and villas forms the core of a new city district, aimed at the urban middle-class and with attractive waterfront vistas.
Since 1974 the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malmö and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005 Malmö got a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malmö, it has largely benefited the already somewhat well-off. While the inner city are being gentrified and the upper-middle class have inhabited the Western Harbor, little has changed for the inhabitants of in the districts of the Million Programme; Malmö remains a city of sharp social divide and high unemployment.

==Geography==

Malmö is located at 13°00' east and 55°35' north. It is located near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the Scania province.
Malmö is part of the transnational Öresund Region and since 2000 the Öresund Bridge crosses the Öresund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge was inaugurated 1 July 2000, and measures [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching [tpl]convert|204.5|m|1|abbr=off[/tpl] vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsingør ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.

===Climate===

Malmö, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is surprisingly mild compared to other locations in similar latitudes, or even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the Gulf Stream. Because of its northern latitude, daylight extends 17 hours in midsummer, to only around 7 hours in midwinter.
Summers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of [tpl]convert|20|to|21|C|F[/tpl] and lows of around [tpl]convert|11|to|13|C|F[/tpl], but temperatures do sometimes exceed [tpl]convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] and occasional heat waves are common during the summer. Winters are fairly cold, with temperatures steady between [tpl]convert|-3|to|4|C|F[/tpl], but it rarely drops below [tpl]convert|-10|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl].
Rainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] and some winters are virtually free of snow.

==Transport==

Öresund Railway cross Öresund Bridge every 20 minutes (every 10 minutes during rush hour) connecting Malmö to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 20 minutes. Also some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, digging began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on December 4, 2010. The tunnel runs from under Malmö Central Station to Triangeln continuing to Hyllievång (Hyllie Meadow), where it emerges to connect with the Öresund Bridge, effectively changing Malmö Central from being a terminus to being a transit station.
Besides the Copenhagen Airport, Malmö has an airport of its own, Malmö Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.
The motorway system has been incorporated with the Öresund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malmö–Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to Jönköping–Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in direction of Växjö–Kalmar, Kristianstad–Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.
Malmö has [tpl]convert|410|km|mi[/tpl] of bike paths and approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.
Malmö has two industrial harbours; one is still in active use and is the biggest Nordic port for car importation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmport.com/ |title=CMP |publisher=Cmport.com |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] Also, there are two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina ([tpl]Coord|55|35|N|12|55|E[/tpl]) and the private Lagunen ([tpl]Coord|55|35|N|12|56|E[/tpl]), both offering a limited number of guest docks.Free marine charts are available.

==Municipality==

Malmö Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of MalmöIn all official contexts, the town Malmö calls itself "Malmö stad" (or City of Malmö), as does a small number of other Swedish municipalities, and especially the other two metropolitans of Sweden: Stockholm and Gothenburg. However, the term city has administratively been discontinued in Sweden. and its immediate surroundings.
The Malmö urban area, Malmö tätort consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arlöv in the municipality of Burlöv. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and Åkarp. Malmö tätort is to be distinguished from Malmö stad (the city of Malmö), which is a semi-official name of Malmö Municipality.
The politicians in the City of Malmö created a commission for a socially sustainable Malmö in November 2010. The commission´s was tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malmö, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.The commission for a socially sustainable Malmoe, http://www.malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Kommission-for-ett-socialt-hallbart-Malmo/Commission-for-a-Socially-Sustainable-Malmoe-in-English.html[tpl]primary source-inline|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Economy==

The economy of Malmö was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about [tpl]convert|16|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] to the north-east. As a result, Malmö had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990-1995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona. In 1995, Malmö had Sweden's highest unemployment rate [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
However, during the last few years there has been a revival. The main contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the Öresund Bridge. Almost 10% of the population[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] in Malmö works in Copenhagen.  Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed.

==Education==

Malmö has the country's eighth largest school of higher education, Malmö University, established in 1998. It has 1,500 employees and 24,000 students (2011).
In addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malmö:
The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malmö. The World Maritime University (WMU)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmu.se |title=World Maritime University |publisher=Wmu.se |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08[/tpl] operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.

==Culture==

A striking depiction of Malmö was made by Bo Widerberg in his engaging debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malmö. With humour and tenderness it depicts the tensions between classes and generations. The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

===Theatre===

In 1944, one of the city's most enduring cultural hubs was inaugurated, Malmö Stadsteater (Malmö Municipal Theatre) with a repertory embracing both stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and theatrical experiments. In 1993 it was split into three separate units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malmö Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Skånes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. When the ownership of the last two where transferred to Region Skåne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern retained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malmö Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin were brought to stardom through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and Göran Stangertz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malmostadsteater.se/om_malmo_stadsteater/om_oss |title=Malmö Stadsteater |accessdate=2 February 2010 |language=Swedish[/tpl] Malmö Musikteater were renamed Malmö Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's largest opera scenes with 1,511 seats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malmoopera.se/d/1/inenglish |title=Malmö Opera och Musikteater |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] Skånes dansteater is also active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malmö harbour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skanesdansteater.se/en-GB/Page/content/74/About-us.aspx |title=About us [tpl]![/tpl] Skånes Dansteater |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl]
Since the 1970s the city has also been home to a rich, if fluctuating, array of independent theatre groups and some show/musical companies. It also hosts a rich rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.
The Cardigans made their start in Malmö and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called "MyCity_MyLife" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malmö that she enjoys.
The Rooseum Centre for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centres for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the national Museum of Modern Design inaugurated in its place.

===Museums===

On 26 December 2009, Moderna Museet ("the modern museum") opened its first outpost in the old Rooseum building in Malmö. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dalí, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse och Robert Rauschenberg[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malmo.se/Medborgare/Kultur--noje/Konst--design/Moderna-Museet-Malmo.html |title=Malmö stad — Moderna Museet Malmö |language=Swedish |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/Samlingen/ |title=Samlingen — Moderna Museet |language=Swedish |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl]

===Architecture===

Malmö's oldest building is Sankt Petri Church. It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in Lübeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=88936&ptid=0 |title=Svenska kyrkan — Malmö S:t Petri församling — S:t Petri kyrka — Malmös katedral |language=Swedish |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl]
Another old building is Tunneln, [tpl]convert|300|m|sigfig=1[/tpl] to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.
The oldest parts of Malmö were built between 1300-1600 during its first major period of expansion. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] The central city's layout as well as some of its oldest buildings are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those is the Malmö synagogue. Malmö was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.
Around 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city centre. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
Recent years[tpl]when|date=May 2013[/tpl] have seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. Västra Hamnen (The Western Harbour), like most of the harbour to the north of the city centre, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malmo.se/English/Sustainable-City-Development/Bo01---Western-Harbour.html|title=Western Harbour/Bo01|author=City of Malmö website[/tpl]  The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new buildings towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, [tpl]convert|190|m[/tpl] tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malmö's new landmark.Arkitekterna som formade Malmö, Tyke Tykesson (1996), ISBN 91-7203-113-1Web site Malmö Arkitekturhistoria Arkitekturhistoria, a brief compilation made by Malmö Public Library website.

She further stated that "Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. “I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore.”
