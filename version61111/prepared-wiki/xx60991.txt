[[LBCAST]]

CATEGORIES: Optoelectronics

LBCAST (Lateral Buried Charge Accumulator and Sensing Transistor array) is a type of photo sensor which the manufacturer claims is simpler and thus smaller and faster than CMOS sensors. It was developed over ten years by Nikon, in parallel with other manufacturer's development of CMOS, and resulted in shipping product in 2003.
Both CMOS and LBCAST technologies branched from researchers discussions of "amplifying sensors" as a way to develop an imaging sensor with lower power requirements than the already-existing CCD sensor technology, for use in portable devices such as DSLR cameras.[tpl]cite web| url=http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/scene/07/index.htm| title=LBCAST| publisher=Nikon Corporation| accessdate=December 15, 2009[/tpl]

==Comparison between LBCAST and CMOS photo sensors==

The main differences between LBCAST and CMOS-based sensors appear to be those given below:

==Uses of LBCAST sensors==

As at end 2006, the Nikon D2H and the D2Hs were the only publicly available cameras known to carry the sensor. Nikon has opted to use CCDs sourced from Sony in most of their low and mid range cameras and used a CMOS sensor in the flagship D2Xs/D2x. The LBCAST sensor in the D2Hs has remained at 4.1MP.
With the advent of the D3, D700 and D300 cameras in 2007 and 2008, all featuring CMOS sensor technology, it is unknown whether LBCAST plays a part in the design of the CMOS sensor of either, since Nikon's implementation of LBCAST is an adaptation of CMOS, and it is therefore technically correct to refer to the known instances of LBCAST as CMOS, Nikon has not been forthcoming to requests for specific information on the D3 sensor[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bythom.com/D3QA.htm| title=Answers to Nikon D3 Questions| first=Thom| last=Hogan| date=April 9, 2007| accessdate=December 15, 2009[/tpl] and Nikon have claimed in the past that LBCAST would be further developed.

==Criticisms of LBCAST sensors==

The following weaknesses have been cited as affecting the Nikon D2H, although whether these issues have origins specific to LBCAST, and whether LBCAST necessitates these problems, is not known.
