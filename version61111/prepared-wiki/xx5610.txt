[[File:CO2emissions1.jpg|thumb|Anthropogenic emissions of CO2-equivalents per year by the 10 largest emitters (the European Union is lumped as a single area, because of their integrated carbon trading scheme). Data sorted based on 2010 contributions.
[tpl]legend|#A6A6A6|Other countries[/tpl]]]
Total aggregate GHG emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF, i.e., carbon storage in forests and soils) for all Annex I Parties (see list below) including the United States taken together decreased from 19.0 to 17.8 thousand teragrams (Tg, which is equal to 109 kg) [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] equivalent, a decline of 6.0% during the 1990-2008 period.[tpl]Rp|3|date=November 2012[/tpl]  Several factors have contributed to this decline.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl]  The first is due to the economic restructuring in the Annex I Economies in Transition[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl]  (the EITs – see Intergovernmental Emissions Trading for the list of EITs). Over the period 1990-1999, emissions fell by 40% in the EITs following the collapse of central planning in the former Soviet Union and east European countries.[ref]

 PBL publication number 500253004. JRC Technical Note number JRC65918.[/ref][tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl]  This led to a massive contraction of their heavy industry-based economies, with associated reductions in their fossil fuel consumption and emissions.[tpl]Rp|24|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Emissions growth in Annex I Parties have also been limited due to policies and measures (PaMs).[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] In particular, PaMs were strengthened after 2000, helping to enhance energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] Energy use also decreased during the economic crisis in 2007-2008.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl]

====Projections====

UNFCCC (2011)[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] made projections of changes in emissions of the Annex I Parties and the effectiveness of their PaMs. It was noted that their projections should be interpreted with caution.[tpl]Rp|7|date=November 2012[/tpl]  For the 39 Annex I Parties, UNFCCC (2011) projected that existing PaMs would lead to annual emissions in 2010 of 17.5 thousand Tg [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] eq, excluding LULUCF, which is a decrease of 6.7% from the 1990 level.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] Annual emissions in 2020 excluding LULUCF were projected to reach 18.9 thousand Tg [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] eq, which is an increase of 0.6% on the 1990 level.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl]
UNFCCC (2011)[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] made an estimate of the total effect of implemented and adopted PaMs. Projected savings were estimated relative to a reference (baseline) scenario where PaMs are not implemented.  PaMs were projected to deliver emissions savings relative to baseline of about 1.5 thousand Tg [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] eq by 2010, and 2.8 thousand Tg [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl] eq by 2020.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl]  In percentage terms, and using annual emissions in the year 1990 as a reference point, PaMs were projected to deliver at least a 5.0% reduction relative to baseline by 2010, and a 10.0% reduction relative to baseline in 2020.[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] Scenarios reviewed by UNFCCC (2011)[tpl]Rp|14|date=November 2012[/tpl] still suggested that total Annex I annual emissions would increase out to 2020 (see the preceding paragraph).

====Annex I Parties with targets====

Data given in the table above may not be fully reflective of a country's progress towards meeting its first-round Kyoto target. The summary below contains more up-to-date information on how close countries are to meeting their first-round targets.
Collectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the USA, have a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008-2012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.[tpl]Rp|24|date=November 2012[/tpl]  According to Olivier et al. (2011),[tpl]Rp|24|date=November 2012[/tpl] the Kyoto Parties will comfortably exceed their collective target, with a projected average reduction of 16% for 2008-2012. This projection excludes both LULUCF and credits generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).[tpl]Rp|24|date=November 2012[/tpl]
As noted in the preceding section, between 1990–1999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the USA.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Almost all European countries are on track to achieve their first-round Kyoto targets. Spain plans to meet its target by purchasing a large quantity of Kyoto units through the flexibility mechanisms. Australia,[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] Canada[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] (Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in 2012), and Italy are not on course to meet their first-round Kyoto targets. In order to meet their targets, these countries would need to purchase emissions credits from other Kyoto countries.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl] As noted in the section on Intergovernmental Emissions Trading, purchasing surplus credits from the EIT countries would not actually result in total emissions being reduced. An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits or the use of the voluntary Green Investment Scheme.
In December 2011, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, formally announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (see the section on the withdrawal of Canada).

====Annex I Parties without Kyoto targets====

Belarus, Malta, and Turkey are Annex I Parties but do not have first-round Kyoto targets. The US has a Kyoto target of a 6% reduction relative to the 1990 level, but has not ratified the treaty.[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl]  Emissions in the US have increased 11% since 1990, and according to Olivier et al. (2011),[tpl]Rp|25|date=November 2012[/tpl]  it will be unable to meet its original Kyoto target.
If the US had ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the average percentage reduction in total GHG emissions for the Annex I group would have been a 5.2% reduction relative to the base year.[tpl]Rp|26|date=November 2012[/tpl] Including the US in their calculation, Olivier et al. (2011)[tpl]Rp|26|date=November 2012[/tpl]  projected that the Annex I countries would collectively achieve a 7% reduction relative to the base year, which is lower than the original target of a 5.2% reduction. This projection excludes expected purchases of emissions credits.[tpl]Rp|26|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Non-Annex I===

UNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income.[tpl]Rp|4|date=November 2012[/tpl] Most Parties included information on policies relating to sustainable development. Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care.[tpl]Rp|6|date=November 2012[/tpl] Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their environmental legislation to include global concerns such as climate change.[tpl]Rp|7|date=November 2012[/tpl]
A few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions by Annex I Parties could adversely affect their economies.[tpl]Rp|7|date=November 2012[/tpl] The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of fossil fuels.
Emissions
GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7 billion tonnes (billion = 1,000,000,000) of CO2-eq. CO2 was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by methane (26%) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (11%).
The energy sector was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO2-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8 tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9 billion tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7 billion tonnes.
Trends
In several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009).[ref]
[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl][/ref]  For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990–2005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.

==Cost estimates==

Barker et al. (2007, p. 79) assessed the literature on cost estimates for the Kyoto Protocol. Due to non-US participation in the Kyoto treaty, costs estimates were found to be much lower than those estimated in the previous IPCC Third Assessment Report. Without US participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1–1.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without US participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2–2%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.

==Views on the Protocol==

Gupta et al. (2007) assessed the literature on climate change policy. They found that no authoritative assessments of the UNFCCC or its Protocol asserted that these agreements had, or will, succeed in solving the climate problem. In these assessments, it was assumed that the UNFCCC or its Protocol would not be changed. The Framework Convention and its Protocol include provisions for future policy actions to be taken.
Gupta et al. (2007)[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3|2007[/tpl]
[/ref]  described the Kyoto first-round commitments as "modest," stating that they acted as a constraint on the treaty's effectiveness. It was suggested that subsequent Kyoto commitments could be made more effective with measures aimed at achieving deeper cuts in emissions, as well as having policies applied to a larger share of global emissions. In 2008, countries with a Kyoto cap made up less than one-third of annual global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion.
World Bank (2010)[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|World Bank|2010|p=233[/tpl]
[/ref] commented on how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global emissions growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%.[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|World Bank|2010|p=248[/tpl]
[/ref] World Bank (2010) also stated that the treaty had provided only limited financial support to developing countries to assist them in reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change.
Some of the criticism of the Protocol has been based on the idea of climate justice (Liverman, 2008, p. 14).
This has particularly centred on the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability of the developing world to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world.
Some environmentalists have supported the Kyoto Protocol because it is "the only game in town," and possibly because they expect that future emission reduction commitments may demand more stringent emission reductions (Aldy et al.., 2003, p. 9). In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a "small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases."[ref]
The joint-statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Canada, the Caribbean Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina, the Indian National Science Academy, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Irish Academy, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Italy), the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society (UK). 
. Statement website at the UK Royal Society. Also published as: 

[/ref] Some environmentalists and scientists have criticized the existing commitments for being too weak (Grubb, 2000, p. 5).
The United States (under former President George W. Bush) and Australia (initially, under former Prime Minister John Howard) did not ratify the Kyoto treaty.[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|Stern|2006|p=478[/tpl]
[/ref] According to Stern (2006), their decision was based on the lack of quantitative emission commitments for emerging economies (see also the 2000 onwards section). Australia, under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, has since ratified the treaty, which took effect in March 2008.

===Views on the flexibility mechanisms===

Another area which has been commented on is the role of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms – emissions trading, Joint Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).[ref]
Toth et al. summarize the arguments for and against flexibility: 
, in [tpl]harvnb|IPCC TAR WG3|2001[/tpl]
[/ref][ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|IPCC TAR WG3|2001[/tpl]
[/ref] The flexibility mechanisms have attracted both positive and negative comments.[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|Carbon Trust|2009|pp=53–79[/tpl]
[/ref]
As mentioned earlier, a number of Annex I Parties have implemented emissions trading schemes (ETSs) as part of efforts to meet their Kyoto commitments. General commentaries on emissions trading are contained in emissions trading and carbon emission trading. Individual articles on the ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes (see Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading for a list of ETSs).
One of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments. Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources, and adverse impacts of CDM projects on local communities in developing countries.

==Conference of the Parties==

The official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the Conference of the Parties. It is held every year as part of the United Nations Climate Change conference, which also serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. The first Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (MOP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with the eleventh Conferences of parties to UNFCCC. Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin, while the 2013 conference was held in Warsaw. Future COPs will be held in Lima, Peru in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2015.

==Amendment and possible successors==

In the non-binding 'Washington Declaration' agreed on 16 February 2007, heads of governments from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and developing countries, and initially hoped that it would be in place by 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6364663.stm|title=Politicians sign new climate pact|publisher=BBC |date=16 February 2007|accessdate=28 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,2014683,00.html|title=Global leaders reach climate change agreement|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=16 February 2007|accessdate=28 May 2007[/tpl]
The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.
The 2010 Cancún agreements include voluntary pledges made by 76 developed and developing countries to control their emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2010, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.
By May 2012, the USA, Japan, Russia, and Canada had indicated they would not sign up to a second Kyoto commitment period. In November 2012, Australia confirmed it would participate in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and New Zealand confirmed that it would not.
New Zealand's climate minister Tim Groser said the 15-year-old Kyoto Protocol was outdated, and that New Zealand was "ahead of the curve" in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Groser-NZ-ahead-of-the-curve-in-quitting-Kyoto-Protocol/tabid/1160/articleID/278937/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Groser defends quitting Kyoto Protocol| date=3 December 2012[/tpl] Non-profit environmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund criticised New Zealand's decision to pull out.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/NZs-environmental-reputation-nosedive/tabid/1160/articleID/279779/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= NZ's climate reputation 'nosedive'| date=10 December 2012[/tpl]
On 8 December 2012, at the end of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, an agreement was reached to extend the Protocol to 2020 and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020 (see lede for more information). The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the overall package. The Kyoto second commitment period applies to about 15% of annual global emissions of greenhouse gases. Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries.[ref]
