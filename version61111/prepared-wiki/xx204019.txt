Elections to Three Rivers District Council were held on 1 May 2008.  One-third of the council was up for election.  The Liberal Democrats won the most seats, despite the Conservatives winning more votes.  The Conservatives also gained a seat, strengthening their position against the Liberal Democrats, who remained stayed in overall control of Three Rivers.
The election was marked by the collapse of Labour support in South Oxhey: the part of the district that Labour are at their strongest.  Most notably, they lost one seat, Ashridge, to the far-right British National Party (BNP).[tpl]cite news |first=Hayley |last=Korn |title=Labour loses to BNP in South Oxhey |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/display.var.2243841.0.labour_loses_to_bnp_in_south_oxhey.php |publisher=Watford Observer |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-25 [/tpl]  Another seat, Northwick, was lost to the Conservatives.
