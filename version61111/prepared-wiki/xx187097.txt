The race is named in honor of Elizabeth Arden's Beaugay, the American Champion Two-Year-old of 1945, regardless of gender.The Bloodhorse.com Champion's history charts
Due to bad weather in 1998 that severely affected the turf course, the race was run on the dirt track at a distance of one mile. Prior to 1983 the race took place on the main track at Aqueduct Racetrack.  
In 1979, the Beaugay Handicap was raced in two divisions.
