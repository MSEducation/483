===Qualification process===

A total of 16 teams will qualify for each teams event as follows:
Each team will consist of 3 players and they don't have to participate in singles events (there are 22 additional athletes quota places for such players). Teams will be selected after all singles qualification events, and according a special May 2008 team ranking list. Qualification will be awarded first to the highest ranked teams with three players qualified for the singles event.  If the quota hasn't been filled, selection will proceed to teams with two players qualified for the singles event, then to teams with only one singles qualifier.
If the field of 16 teams is filled without using all of the 22 athletes quota places, any unused places will be added to the Final World Qualification Tournament to select additional singles players. In order to select the Teams only the 64 qualified players will be taken into
consideration to establish the Special Olympic Computer Team Ranking (SOCTR). The SOCTR will be calculated in the same way as we calculate the current ITTF Computer Team Ranking now. The difference is that: Only the 64 players qualified will be considered to establish the SOCTR for the purpose of selecting the Teams.
