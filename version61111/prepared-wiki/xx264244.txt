==History==

===Beginnings===

Clockwork Radio started in north Wales as a side-project of singer and guitarist Rich Williams. This early incarnation of the band released the single "Lost" in November 2007, which was quickly picked up and played by BBC Radio One, BBC Radio Wales and other national radio stations. Two years later Williams teamed up with lead-guitarist Iwan Jones and they relocated to Manchester, England, to concentrate on music and putting a live band together.
The current line-up came together in 2010 when Dan Wiebe, Sam Quinn and Nadim Mirshak joined the band (in 2012 Mirshak left the band, with Quinn taking up on bass). The band began writing new material and started to tour the UK and Europe where they were booked for Taubertal Festival in Germany in August 2010 as a "secret tip".
