Melon was a group formed by former The Plastics members Toshio Nakanishi and Chica Sato.  When The Plastics broke up in 1982, Toshio went to New York and formed Melon with  friends Percy Jones of Brand X, Dougie Bowne of The Lounge Lizards, and Bernie Worrell of Funkadelic and Chica Sato, former vocalist of The Plastics, trying to merge funk with Japanese and became known as a quirky, exotic, pop band.  Chica’s appearances in Toshi’s projects since Melon have dwindled, but Toshio continues collaborating music acts, changing sounds and names: Tycoon Tosh, Group of Gods, Love T.K.O., Major Force and Skylab being some of the most often used.
