==Early life and career==

Born in Equatorial Guinea, he moved to Spain, with his parents and brothers, when he was six years old. He had no intention of becoming an actor until one day, in 1995, when casting director Paco Pino discovered him as they both waited in a subway station in Madrid. Pino needed a black actor to play Ombasi, one of the main characters of Imanol Uribe's Bwana (1996). Before that, Emilio was studying to become a construction engineer, as well as working as a fireman. He accepted Pino's offer traveling to Almería two weeks later for the filming of the movie. Buale made his debut, along with two well-known Spanish actors Andrés Pajares and María Barranco.
Buale continued getting work in films, TV series and, especially, in theatre. He was a member of the National Classical Theater Company of Spain for a couple of years appearing in many of stage productions such as "La entretenida", "Amar después de la muerte", "Los chicos de la banda" and "Yonquis y Yanquis".
