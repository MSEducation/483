CATEGORIES: Asthma, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, Respiratory therapy

Asthma (from the Greek ἅσθμα, ásthma, "panting")  is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction and bronchospasm.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=11–12[/tpl] Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[tpl]harvnb|British Guideline|2009|p=4[/tpl]
Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martinez FD |title=Genes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=179–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17197483 |doi=10.1183/09031936.00087906[/tpl] Its diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time and spirometry.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lemanske RF, Busse WW |title=Asthma: clinical expression and molecular mechanisms|journal=J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. |volume=125 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S95–102 |date=February 2010|pmid=20176271 |pmc=2853245 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.047 [/tpl] It is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic) where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing type 1 hypersensitivity reactions.[tpl]cite book | title=Stedman's Medical Dictionary | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | edition=28 | year=2005 | isbn=0-7817-3390-1 [/tpl]
Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol) and oral corticosteroids.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=214[/tpl] In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=373–375[/tpl] Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=169–172[/tpl] and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=71[/tpl] Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or leukotriene antagonists may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=33[/tpl] The occurrence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. In 2011, 235–300 million people globally have been diagnosed with asthma, and it caused 250,000 deaths.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=3[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|pp=2–5[/tpl] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[tpl]cite book|last=Jindal|first=editor-in-chief SK|title=Textbook of pulmonary and critical care medicine|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers|location=New Delhi|year=2011|isbn=978-93-5025-073-0|page=242|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=EvGTw3wn-zEC&pg=PA242[/tpl] During recovery from an attack it may appear pus like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[tpl]cite book|last=George|first=Ronald B.|title=Chest medicine : essentials of pulmonary and critical care medicine|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-7817-5273-2|page=62|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZzlX2zJMbdgC&pg=PA62|edition=5th[/tpl] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[tpl]harvnb|British Guideline|2009|p=14[/tpl] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|pp=8–9[/tpl]

A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in those with asthma, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boulet LP |title=Influence of comorbid conditions on asthma |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=897–906 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19336592 |doi=10.1183/09031936.00121308 [/tpl] Psychological disorders are also more common,[tpl]cite journal|last=Boulet|first=LP|coauthors=Boulay, MÈ|title=Asthma-related comorbidities|journal=Expert review of respiratory medicine|date=June 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=377–93|pmid=21702660|doi=10.1586/ers.11.34|ref=harv[/tpl] with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16–52% and mood disorders in 14–41%.[tpl]cite book|last=editors|first=Andrew Harver, Harry Kotses,|title=Asthma, health and society a public health perspective|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-78285-0|page=315|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=nkP8_h_ewLMC&pg=PA315[/tpl] However, it is not known if asthma causes psychological problems or if psychological problems lead to asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thomas|first=M|coauthors=Bruton, A; Moffat, M; Cleland, J|title=Asthma and psychological dysfunction|journal=Primary care respiratory journal : journal of the General Practice Airways Group|date=September 2011|volume=20|issue=3|pages=250–6|pmid=21674122|doi=10.4104/pcrj.2011.00058|ref=harv[/tpl]

==Causes==

Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.[tpl]cite journal | last=Miller | first=RL |author2=Ho SM|title=Environmental epigenetics and asthma: current concepts and call for studies | journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume=177 | issue=6 | pages=567–573 |date=March 2008 | pmid=18187692| doi=10.1164/rccm.200710-1511PP | pmc=2267336 [/tpl] These factors influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Choudhry S, Seibold MA, Borrell LN "et al." |title=Dissecting complex diseases in complex populations: asthma in latino americans |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=226–33 |year=2007 |pmid=17607004 |doi=10.1513/pats.200701-029AW |pmc=2647623[/tpl] It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dietert|first=RR|title=Maternal and childhood asthma: risk factors, interactions, and ramifications|journal=Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)|date=September 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=198–204|pmid=21575714|doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.04.007|ref=harv[/tpl]

===Environmental===

Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation including allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kelly|first=FJ|coauthors=Fussell, JC|title=Air pollution and airway disease|journal=Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2011|volume=41|issue=8|pages=1059–71|pmid=21623970|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03776.x|ref=harv[/tpl] Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=6[/tpl] Low air quality from factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels,[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=61[/tpl] has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gold DR, Wright R |title=Population disparities in asthma |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=26 |pages=89–113|year=2005 |pmid=15760282 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144528 [/tpl] Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; formaldehyde exposure, for example, has a positive association.[tpl]cite journal|last=McGwin|first=G|coauthors=Lienert, J; Kennedy, JI|title=Formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children: a systematic review|journal=Environmental health perspectives|date=March 2010|volume=118|issue=3|pages=313–7|pmid=20064771|doi=10.1289/ehp.0901143|pmc=2854756|ref=harv[/tpl] Also, phthalates in PVC are associated with asthma in children and adults.[tpl]cite journal |author= Jaakkola JJ, Knight TL. |title= The role of exposure to phthalates from polyvinyl chloride products in the development of asthma and allergies: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal= Environ Health Perspect |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=845–53 |date=July 2008 |pmid= 18629304 |pmc= 2453150 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.10846 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Bornehag|first=CG|coauthors=Nanberg, E|title=Phthalate exposure and asthma in children|journal=International journal of andrology|date=April 2010|volume=33|issue=2|pages=333–45|pmid=20059582|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.01023.x|ref=harv[/tpl] There is an association between paracetamol (acetaminophen) use and asthma but it is unclear if it has a role in causing asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Henderson|first=AJ|author2=Shaheen, SO|title=Acetaminophen and asthma.|journal=Paediatric Respiratory Reviews|date=Mar 2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=9–15; quiz 16|pmid=23347656[/tpl]
Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ahluwalia|first=SK|coauthors=Matsui, EC|title=The indoor environment and its effects on childhood asthma|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=April 2011|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–43|pmid=21301330|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283445921|ref=harv[/tpl] Common indoor allergens include: dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander, and mold.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arshad|first=SH|title=Does exposure to indoor allergens contribute to the development of asthma and allergy?|journal=Current allergy and asthma reports|date=January 2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=49–55|pmid=20425514|doi=10.1007/s11882-009-0082-6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Custovic|first=A|author2=Simpson, A|title=The role of inhalant allergens in allergic airways disease|journal=Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology : official organ of the International Association of Asthmology (INTERASMA) and Sociedad Latinoamericana de Alergia e Inmunologia|year=2012|volume=22|issue=6|pages=393–401; qiuz follow 401|pmid=23101182[/tpl] Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective. Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=11[/tpl] Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk.

====Hygiene hypothesis====

The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.[tpl]cite journal| last=Ramsey | first=CD |author2=Celedón JC | title=The hygiene hypothesis and asthma | journal=Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine| volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=14–20 |date=January 2005 | pmid=15591883 | doi=10.1097/01.mcp.0000145791.13714.ae [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last=Bufford | first=JD |author2=Gern JE | title=The hygiene hypothesis revisited | journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=247–262 |date=May 2005 | pmid=15878454 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 [/tpl] It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brooks|first=C|coauthors=Pearce, N; Douwes, J|title=The hygiene hypothesis in allergy and asthma: an update|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=February 2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=70–7|pmid=23103806|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32835ad0d2[/tpl] Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rao|first=D|author2=Phipatanakul, W|title=Impact of environmental controls on childhood asthma.|journal=Current allergy and asthma reports|date=October 2011|volume=11|issue=5|pages=414–20|pmid=21710109|doi=10.1007/s11882-011-0206-7[/tpl] Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.
Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Murk|first=W|author2=Risnes, KR|author3=Bracken, MB|title=Prenatal or early-life exposure to antibiotics and risk of childhood asthma: a systematic review|journal=Pediatrics|date=June 2011|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1125–38|pmid=21606151|doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2092[/tpl] Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk (estimated at 20–80%) of asthma—this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal.[tpl]harvnb|British Guideline|2009|p=72[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Neu|first=J|author2=Rushing, J|title=Cesarean versus vaginal delivery: long-term infant outcomes and the hygiene hypothesis|journal=Clinics in perinatology|date=June 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=321–31|pmid=21645799|doi=10.1016/j.clp.2011.03.008|pmc=3110651[/tpl] There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence.[tpl]cite journal|last=Von Hertzen|first=LC|author2=Haahtela, T|title=Asthma and atopy -the price of affluence?|journal=Allergy|date=February 2004|volume=59|issue=2|pages=124–37|pmid=14763924|doi=10.1046/j.1398-9995.2003.00433.x[/tpl]

===Genetic===

Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.[tpl]cite book|last=Elward|first=Graham Douglas, Kurtis S.|title=Asthma|year=2010|publisher=Manson Pub.|location=London|isbn=978-1-84076-513-7|pages=27–29|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=gS4BsugTBvoC&pg=PA27[/tpl] If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%. By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others. Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.  In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone;[tpl]cite journal |author=Ober C, Hoffjan S |title=Asthma genetics 2006: the long and winding road to gene discovery |journal=Genes Immun |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=95–100 |year=2006 |pmid=16395390 |doi=10.1038/sj.gene.6364284 [/tpl] more continue to be found.[tpl]cite journal|last=Halapi|first=E|author2=Bjornsdottir, US|title=Overview on the current status of asthma genetics|journal=The clinical respiratory journal|date=January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2–7|pmid=20298365|doi=10.1111/j.1752-699X.2008.00119.x[/tpl]
Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures. An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martinez FD |title=CD14, endotoxin, and asthma risk: actions and interactions |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=221–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17607003 |doi=10.1513/pats.200702-035AW |pmc=2647622[/tpl]

===Medical conditions===

A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=4[/tpl] Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, an autoimmune disease and vasculitis. Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.[tpl]cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L.|title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 [/tpl]

===Exacerbation===

Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baxi SN, Phipatanakul W |title=The role of allergen exposure and avoidance in asthma |journal=Adolesc Med State Art Rev |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=57–71, viii–ix |date=April 2010 |pmid=20568555 |pmc=2975603 [/tpl] Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.
Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold. Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease. Psychological stress may worsen symptoms—it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chen E, Miller GE |title=Stress and inflammation in exacerbations of asthma|journal=Brain Behav Immun. |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=993–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17493786|doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2007.03.009|pmc=2077080[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the airways which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change. Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include: T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system including: cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.

==Diagnosis==

While asthma is a well recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition. It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment".
There is currently no precise test with the diagnosis typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time. A diagnosis of asthma should be suspected if there is a history of: recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=42[/tpl] Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=20[/tpl]

===Spirometry===

Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management.[tpl]Cite journal |author1 = American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |author1-link=American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |title=Five things physicians and patients should question |publisher=American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |work=Choosing wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page= |url=http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AAAAI.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Third Expert Panel on the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma |title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma |year=2007 |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (US) |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7232/ [/tpl] It is the single best test for asthma.

It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=58[/tpl]

===Others===

The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.
Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pinnock H, Shah R |title=Asthma |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7598 |pages=847–50 |year=2007 |pmid=17446617 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39140.634896.BE |pmc=1853223[/tpl] Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications.

Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yawn BP |title=Factors accounting for asthma variability: achieving optimal symptom control for individual patients |journal=Primary Care Respiratory Journal |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=138–147 |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.thepcrj.org/journ/vol17/17_3_138_147.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nySCf5x8 |archivedate=2010-03-04 |pmid=18264646 |doi=10.3132/pcrj.2008.00004 [/tpl] Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).[tpl]cite book |editor1-last=Kumar |editor1-first=Vinay |editor2-last=Abbas |editor2-first=Abul K |editor3-last=Fausto |editor3-first=Nelson |editor4-last=Aster |editor4-first=Jon |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Saunders |edition=8th |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5 |page=688 |oclc=643462931 [/tpl] While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.[tpl]cite journal |author=Moore WC, Pascual RM |title=Update in asthma 2009 |journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |volume=181 |issue=11 |pages=1181–7 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20516492 |doi=10.1164/rccm.201003-0321UP |pmc=3269238 [/tpl] Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.
Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.[tpl]cite book |editor=Mary Anne Koda-Kimble, Brian K Alldredge, et al. |author1=Self, Timothy |author2=Chrisman, Cary |author3=Finch, Christopher |title=Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2009 |chapter=22. Asthma |oclc=230848069 [/tpl] Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling.[tpl]cite journal |last=Delacourt |first=C |title=Conséquences bronchiques de l'asthme non traité |trans_title=Bronchial changes in untreated asthma |journal=Archives de Pédiatrie |volume=11 |issue=Suppl. 2 |pages=71s–73s |date=June 2004 |pmid=15301800 |doi=10.1016/S0929-693X(04)90003-6[/tpl] In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_copd/article.htm |title=Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |first=George |last=Schiffman |date=18 December 2009 |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100828011049/http://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_copd/article.htm |archivedate= 28 August 2010 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

====Asthma exacerbation====

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,[tpl]cite book|last=Barnes |first=PJ |chapter=Asthma |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|editor1-last=Fauci|editor1-first=Anthony S |editor2-last=Braunwald |editor2-first=E, |editor3-last=Kasper|editor3-first=DL |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2008 |edition=17th |isbn=978-0-07-146633-2|pages=1596–1607[/tpl] some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.
Signs which occur during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.[tpl]cite journal |author=Maitre B, Similowski T, Derenne JP |title=Physical examination of the adult patient with respiratory diseases: inspection and palpation |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=8 |issue=9|pages=1584–93|date=September 1995 |pmid=8575588 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/8/9/1584.long[/tpl] A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Werner |first=HA |title=Status asthmaticus in children: a review|journal=Chest |volume=119 |issue=6|pages=1596–1607 |date=June 2001|pmid=11399724|doi=10.1378/chest.119.6.1913 [/tpl]
In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min or ≥50% of the predicted best.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shiber JR, Santana J |title=Dyspnea |journal=Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=90|issue=3 |pages=453–79 |date=May 2006|pmid=16473100 |doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2005.11.006 [/tpl] Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min or 25% and 50% of the predicted best while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min or ≤25% of the predicted best.
Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shah|first=R|author2=Saltoun, CA|title=Chapter 14: Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus)|journal=Allergy and asthma proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies|date=May–Jun 2012|volume=33 Suppl 1|issue=3|pages=S47–50|pmid=22794687|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3547[/tpl]
Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks.[tpl]harvnb|British Guideline|2009|p=54[/tpl] Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.

====Exercise-induced====

Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction in both people with and without asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Khan|first=DA|title=Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: burden and prevalence|journal=Allergy and asthma proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies|date=Jan–Feb 2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–6|pmid=22370526|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3507[/tpl] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma. In athletes is diagnosed more commonly in elite athletes, with rates varying from 3% for bobsled racers to 50% for cycling and 60% for cross-country skiing.

====Occupational====

Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures, is a commonly reported occupational disease. Many cases however are not reported or recognized as such.[tpl]cite book|last=Kunnamo|first=ed.-in-chief: Ilkka|title=Evidence-based medicine guidelines|year=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-01184-3|page=214|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=frYEiHYtOv0C&pg=PA214[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kraft|first=editors, Mario Castro, Monica|title=Clinical asthma|year=2008|publisher=Mosby / Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-07081-2|pages=Chapter 42|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=y9WYwLVn7pgC&pg=PT1185[/tpl] It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work–related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baur|first=X|coauthors=Aasen, TB; Burge, PS; Heederik, D; Henneberger, PK; Maestrelli, P; Schlünssen, V; Vandenplas, O; Wilken, D; ERS Task Force on the Management of Work-related, Asthma|title=The management of work-related asthma guidelines: a broader perspective|journal=European Respiratory Review|date=Jun 1, 2012|volume=21|issue=124|pages=125–39|pmid=22654084|doi=10.1183/09059180.00004711[/tpl]

===Differential diagnosis===

Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis should be considered as well as other causes of airway obstruction including: foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis or laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses. In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors should be considered. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=46[/tpl]
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma.  After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD.  In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi.  However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gibson PG, McDonald VM, Marks GB |title=Asthma in older adults |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9743 |pages=803–13 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20816547 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61087-2 [/tpl] It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hargreave|first=FE|author2=Parameswaran, K|title=Asthma, COPD and bronchitis are just components of airway disease|journal=European Respiratory Journal|date=August 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=264–267|doi=10.1183/09031936.06.00056106|pmid=16880365[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Diaz, P.

==Prevention==

The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=184–5[/tpl] Early pet exposure may be useful.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lodge|first=CJ|coauthors=Allen, KJ; Lowe, AJ; Hill, DJ; Hosking, CS; Abramson, MJ; Dharmage, SC|title=Perinatal cat and dog exposure and the risk of asthma and allergy in the urban environment: a systematic review of longitudinal studies|journal=Clinical & developmental immunology|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=176484|pmid=22235226|doi=10.1155/2012/176484|pmc=3251799[/tpl] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[tpl]cite journal|last=Chen|first=CM|coauthors=Tischer, C; Schnappinger, M; Heinrich, J|title=The role of cats and dogs in asthma and allergy—a systematic review|journal=International journal of hygiene and environmental health|date=January 2010|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1–31|pmid=20053584|doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2009.12.003[/tpl] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.[tpl]cite journal|last=Prescott|first=SL|coauthors=Tang, ML; Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and, Allergy|title=The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy position statement: Summary of allergy prevention in children|journal=The Medical journal of Australia|date=May 2, 2005|volume=182|issue=9|pages=464–7|pmid=15865590[/tpl] Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.

==Management==

While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[tpl]cite book|last=Ripoll|first=Brian C. Leutholtz, Ignacio|title=Exercise and disease management|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4398-2759-8|page=100|url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=eAn9-bm_pi8C&pg=PA100|edition=2nd|year=2011[/tpl] A specific, customized plan for proactively monitoring and managing symptoms should be created. This plan should include the reduction of exposure to allergens, testing to assess the severity of symptoms, and the usage of medications. The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms.[tpl]harvnb|GINA|2011|p=56[/tpl]
The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=213[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf |title=British Guideline on the Management of Asthma|format=PDF|publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080819203455/http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf| archivedate= 19 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, an oral leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, oral corticosteroids are added to these treatments.

===Lifestyle modification===

Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (tobacco and other), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=69[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Thomson NC, Spears M |title=The influence of smoking on the treatment response in patients with asthma |journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 |year=2005 |pmid=15643345 |doi=10.1097/00130832-200502000-00011[/tpl] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[tpl]cite journal| author=Stapleton M, Howard-Thompson A, George C, Hoover RM, Self TH| title=Smoking and asthma | journal=J Am Board Fam Med | year= 2011 | volume= 24 | issue= 3 | pages= 313–22 | pmid=21551404 | doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.03.100180[/tpl] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Been|first=Jasper|title=Effect of smoke-free legislation on perinatal and child health: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Lancet|date=Mar 28, 2014|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60082-9[/tpl] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[tpl]cite journal |author=PC Gøtzsche, HK Johansen |title=House dust mite control measures for asthma|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD001187 |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001187.pub3 |pmid=18425868 |editor1-last=Gøtzsche |editor1-first=Peter C[/tpl] Overall exercise, however is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chandratilleke|first=MG|coauthors=Carson, KV; Picot, J; Brinn, MP; Esterman, AJ; Smith, BJ|editor1-last=Carson|editor1-first=Kristin V|title=Physical training for asthma|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=May 16, 2012|volume=5|pages=CD001116|pmid=22592674|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001116.pub3[/tpl]

===Medications===

Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=560[/tpl]
Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[tpl]harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=250[/tpl]
Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rachelefsky|first=G|title=Inhaled corticosteroids and asthma control in children: assessing impairment and risk|journal=Pediatrics|date=January 2009|volume=123|issue=1|pages=353–66|pmid=19117903|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3273[/tpl] Risks include the development of cataracts and a mild regression in stature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dahl R |title=Systemic side effects of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma |journal=Respir Med |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=1307–17 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16412623|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2005.11.020[/tpl]

===Others===

When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. For emergency management other options include:
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[tpl]cite journal|last=Castro|first=M|author2=Musani, AI|author3=Mayse, ML|author4=Shargill, NS|title=Bronchial thermoplasty: a novel technique in the treatment of severe asthma|journal=Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease|date=April 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=101–16|pmid=20435668|doi=10.1177/1753465810367505[/tpl] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[tpl]cite journal|last=Boulet|first=LP|author2=Laviolette, M|title=Is there a role for bronchial thermoplasty in the treatment of asthma?|journal=Canadian respiratory journal : journal of the Canadian Thoracic Society|date=May–Jun 2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=191–2|pmid=22679610|pmc=3418092[/tpl] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate.
