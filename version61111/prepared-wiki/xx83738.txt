George Perle (May 6, 1915 â€“ January 23, 2009) was a composer and music theorist.

==Biography==

Perle was born in Bayonne, New Jersey.  He graduated from DePaul University, where he studied with Wesley LaViolette and received private lessons from Ernst Krenek.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.georgeperle.net/bio.html |title=Biography |last1=Perle |first1=George |year=2007 |work=George Perle |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl]
Perle composed with a technique of his own devising called "twelve-tone tonality". This technique was different from, but related to, the twelve-tone technique of the Second Viennese School,Perle (1992).[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] of which he was an "early admirer" and whose techniques he used aspects of but never fully adopted. Perle's former student Paul Lansky described Perle's twelve-tone tonality thus:
In 1968, Perle cofounded the Alban Berg Society with Igor Stravinsky and Hans F. Redlich, who had the idea (according to Perle in his letter to Glen Flax of 4/1/89[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]). Perle's important work on Berg includes documenting that the third act of Lulu, rather than being an unfinished sketch, was actually three-fifths complete and that the Lyric Suite contains a secret program dedicated to Berg's love-affair.
After retiring from Queens College in 1985, he became a professor emeritus at the Aaron Copland School of Music. In 1986, Perle was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Fourth Wind Quintet and also a MacArthur Fellowship. In about 1989 Perle became composer-in-residence for the San Francisco Symphony, a three-year appointment. It was also around this time that he had published his fourth book entitled The Listening Composer.
He died aged 93 in his home in New York City in January 2009.Kozinn, Allan (January 24, 2009). "George Perle, a Composer and Theorist, Dies at 93", New York Times.

Swift differentiates between Perle's 'free' or 'intuitive', tone-centered, and twelve-tone modal music.Swift, Richard. "A Tonal Analog: The Tone-Centered Music of George Perle", p.258-259 & 283. Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 21, No. 1/2, (Autumn, 1982 - Summer, 1983), pp. 257-284. He lists Perle's tone-centered compositions:
