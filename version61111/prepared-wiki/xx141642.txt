[[Saint Catherine of Alexandria (Raphael)]]

CATEGORIES: 1500s paintings, Paintings by Raphael

Saint Catherine of Alexandria is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. In the painting, Catherine of Alexandria is looking upward in ecstasy and leaning on a wheel - an allusion to the breaking wheel (or Catherine wheel) of her martyrdom.Capgrave, John, and Karen A.

It was painted circa 1507, shortly after Raphael's arrival in Florence and shows the young artist in a transitional phase. The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of Pietro Perugino. But the graceful contrapposto of Catherine's pose is typical of the influence of Leonardo da Vinci on Raphael, and is believed to be an echo of Leonardo's lost painting Leda and the Swan.
This picture was partially used on the cover of The Smashing Pumpkins album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
