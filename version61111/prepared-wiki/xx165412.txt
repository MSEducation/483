West Craven is an area in the east of Lancashire, England in the far northern part of the borough of Pendle. Historically the area has lain within the ancient county boundaries of Yorkshire and was administered as part of the Skipton Rural District of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974.
After 1974 and becoming part of the Pendle borough of Lancashire, the area that was formerly in the larger Craven area of the West Riding of Yorkshire has been known as West Craven owing to its cultural links with Yorkshire.
