Andrea Mia Ghez (born June 16, 1965) is an American astronomer and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCLA.[tpl]citeweb|title=20 Young Scientists to Watch|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/oct/featwatch|publisher=Discover Magazine|accessdate=2008-03-06[/tpl]  In 2004, Discover magazine listed Ghez as one of the top 20 scientists in the United States who have shown a high degree of understanding in their respective fields.

==Early life==

Growing up in Chicago, Ghez first wanted to be a ballerina. The moon landings inspired her to want to become the first female astronaut and her mother supported her goal. Her only female role model was her high school chemistry teacher.[tpl]citeweb|title=Science Hero:Andrea Mia Ghez|url=http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=A_M_Ghez_06|author=Jennifer Lauren Lee|publisher=The My Hero Project|accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl]  She started out in college by majoring in mathematics but changed to physics.[tpl]citeweb|title=Zeroing in on Black Holes|url=http://cosmicmatters.keckobservatory.org/2007/dec/07dec_1.htm|author=Linda Copman|publisher=W.

==Career==

Her current research involves using high spatial resolution imaging techniques, such as the adaptive optics system at the Keck telescopes,[tpl]citeweb|title=Supermassive Black Holes|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/massivebholes_transcript.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-03-20[/tpl] to study star-forming regions and the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy known as Sagittarius A*. She uses the kinematics of stars near the center of the galaxy as a probe to investigate this region.[tpl]citeweb|title=CELT Science Working Group Meeting|url=http://celt.ucolick.org/minutes/SWG_27mar00_minutes.doc|publisher=celt.ucolick.org|accessdate=2008-03-20[/tpl] The high resolution of the Keck telescopesUCLA Galactic Center Group gave a significant improvement over the first major study of galactic center kinematics by Reinhard Genzel's group.[tpl]citeweb|title=Observations of stellar proper motions near the Galactic Centre|author=Eckart, A.; Genzel, R.|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1996Natur.383..415E|doi=10.1038/383415a0[/tpl]
In 2004, Ghez was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[tpl]citeweb|title=Andrea Ghez Elected to National Academy of Sciences|url=http://nai.nasa.gov/newsletter/04302004/index.html#6|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2004-03-20[/tpl] She's appeared in a long list of notable media presentations. The documentaries have been produced by organizations such as  BBC, Discovery Channel, and The History Channel; in 2006 there was a presentation on Nova.[tpl]citeweb|title=Andrea M.

===Black Hole at the Galactic Center (Sgr A *)===

By imaging the Galactic Center at infrared wavelengths, Ghez and her colleagues have been able to peer through heavy dust that blocks visible light, and to produce images of the center of our galaxy.  Thanks to the 10m aperture of the W.M. Keck Telescope and the use of adaptive optics to correct for the turbulence of the atmosphere, these images of the Galactic Center are at very high spatial resolution and have made it possible to follow the orbits of stars around the black hole, which is also known as Sagittarius A * or Sgr A*. The partial orbits of many stars orbiting the black hole at the Galactic Center have been observed.  Since 1995, object SO-2 has made almost a complete elliptical orbit.  Several decades more will be required to completely document the orbits of some of these stars; these measurements may provide a test of the theory of general relativity. In October 2012, a second star was identified by her team at UCLA, S0-102, orbiting the Galactic Center.http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-astronomers-discover-star-239172.aspx  Using Kepler's law, Ghez's team has used the orbital motion to show that the mass of Sgr A* is 4.1Â±0.6 million solar masses.http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2870  Because Sgr A* is one hundred times closer than the next nearest known supermassive black hole M31* (located at the center of M31) it is now one of the best demonstrated cases for a supermassive black hole.

==Personal life==

Ghez is married to Tom LaTourrette who is a geologist and research scientist at the RAND corporation.  They have two sons, Evan born in 2001 and Miles born in 2005.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ghez-64006.aspx|title=UCLA astronomer Andrea Ghez named MacArthur Fellow|date=September 23, 2008|author=Stuart Wolpert|accessdate=2011-04-16||publisher=UCLA[/tpl]  Ghez is a passionate swimmer in the Masters Swim Club which she uses to take a break from science.Poster Project Biographies
