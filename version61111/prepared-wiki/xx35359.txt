The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature UICN, in French) is an international organization dedicated to finding "pragmatic solutions to our most pressing environment and development challenges".[tpl]ZooOrg|iucn|main|accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl] The organization publishes the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the conservation status of species.
IUCN supports scientific research, manages field projects globally and brings governments, non-government organizations, United Nations agencies, companies and local communities together to develop and implement policy.
IUCN is the world's oldest and largest global environmental network—a democratic membership union with more than 1,000 government and NGO member organizations, and almost 11,000 volunteer scientists in more than 160 countries.
IUCN's work is supported by more than 1,000 professional staff in 60 offices and hundreds of partners in public, NGO and private sectors around the world. The Union's headquarters are located in Gland, Switzerland, near Geneva.
IUCN's stated vision is "a just world that values and conserves nature". Its mission is to "influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable".

==History==

IUCN began when the first Director General of UNESCO, Sir Julian Huxley, sponsored a congress to establish a new environmental institution to help serve this purpose.Christoffersen, Leif E. (1994) "IUCN: A Bridge-Builder for Nature Conservation. " Green Globe YearBook Accessed 11 June 2008
At that first congress (held at Fontainebleau, France), on 5 October 1948, 18 governments, 7 international organizations, and 107 national nature conservation organizations all agreed to form the institution and signed a "constitutive act" creating an International Union for the Protection of Nature.
From this beginning, the overriding strategy and policy of the institution has been to explore and promote mutually beneficial conservation arrangements that suit those promoting development as well as assisting people and nations to better preserve their flora and fauna. When approached in 1978 by primatologist Richard Wrangham to contribute funds to the new Digit Fund to prevent further poaching of mountain gorillas near Dian Fossey's Karisoke Research Station in Rwanda, the International Union for Conservation of Nature declined to provide funds to the cause. Instead, IUCN supported opening the Virunga Volcanoes to tourism as a way to encourage the Rwandan government to preserve the gorillas.[tpl]cite book | title = Woman In the Mists|last= Mowat|first= Farley|authorlink= Farley Mowat|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Warner Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-446-51360-1|page= |pages= 172–3|url= [/tpl]
At all times, the institution (in all its forms) has heavily emphasized as a key operating principle the strong need to cater to and address the needs of local nations, communities and peoples, so that those nations, communities and peoples can take ownership of future, long term conservation goals and objectives in their local areas:
IUCN's World Conservation Strategy (1980)World Conservation Strategy: living resource conservation for sustainable development, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), 1980. data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf Accessed 20 February 2011 was founded upon this kind of principle, and clearly announced the IUCN's ambitions to more effectively enter into dialogue with the promoters of human development. The strategy was internationally applauded by many and served to secure IUCN funds from several donors who did not themselves feel they could open up effective dialogue in the world's developing countries, nor that United Nations organizations and international banks would effectively engage in such dialogue.
With the pre-eminence of the concept of sustainable development, IUCN has expanded into many of the nations around the world, making available the services of a large pool of mainly voluntary specialists, providing local level advice and conservation services, and expanding its networks of Committees and regional advisory bodies into increasing numbers of countries.

==Organizational structure==

The Union has three components: its member organizations, its six scientific commissions, and its professional secretariat.

===Members===

The Union unites both States and non-governmental organizations. They set the policies of the Union, define its global programme of work and elect its Council (comparable to a company board) at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. Member organizations organize themselves into National and Regional Committees.

===Commissions===

There are six commissions that "assess the state of the world's natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues":[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/ | title = IUCN - Commissions |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl]
CEC champions the strategic use of communication and education to empower and educate stakeholders for the sustainable use of natural resources.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/union/council/iucn_council_2012_16/commission_chairs/ | title = IUCN - Commission Chairs |date=15 October 2009 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl]
CEESP provides expertise and policy advice on economic and social factors for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
WCEL advances environmental law by developing new legal concepts and instruments, as well as by building the capacity of societies to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development.
CEM provides expert guidance on integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems.
SSC advises the Union on the technical aspects of species conservation and mobilizes action for those species that are threatened with extinction. It produces the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™.
WCPA's mission is to promote the establishment and effective management of a world-wide representative network of terrestrial and marine protected areas.
IUCN is also the governing body responsible for the development of the Management Categories into which each Protected Area is divided depending on its conservation requirements and management aims.

===Secretariat===

The members and commissions work together with a professional secretariat consisting of over 1,000 people in more than 60 different countries. Julia Marton-Lefèvre, a global expert and leader in development and conservation, has been its Director General since 2 January 2007.
She succeeded Achim Steiner, who was appointed Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in June 2006. Poul Engberg-Pedersen serves as Deputy Director General and Managing Director.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/management/?posList=168,1580,304,1005&groupName=Directorate |title=Senior Management |publisher=IUCN |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01[/tpl]
