[[Bargate stone]]

CATEGORIES: Sandstone

Bargate stone is a highly durable form of sandstone. It owes its yellow, butter or honey colouring to the high iron oxide content, thus can also be considered ironstone.  Its closest relation in England is Yorkstone which is usually paler.

==Sources==

This stone was quarried for centuries in the Greensand Ridge, particularly where it is widest in south west Surrey, England.  It occurs near the surface and was quarried in the hillsides of the parish of the town Godalming.  Medieval quarries are visible in Godalming, at the foot of Holloway Hill.
Bargate stone is in relatively rare in current use, it being difficult to find other sources in England of a strong yellow/honey coloured sandstone.  Bath stone, Yorkstone and other similar coloured stone is sometimes instead used, or to complement it.

==Use==

Bargate found in many buildings in Surrey, approximately 250 of which are listed, and in two churches in London.Advanced Search by text 'Bargate' less Bargate Farmhouse and Street/Lane/Bargate meaning road It is endemic to older buildings near the Greensand Ridge where it is found.
