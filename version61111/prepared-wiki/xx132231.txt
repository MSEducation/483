The cats in the key experiments conducted by Edward Thorndike were able to learn through operant conditioning. In Thorndike's experiment, cats were placed in various boxes approximately 20 inches long, 15 inches wide, and 12 inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it. The cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by "trial and error with accidental success." In one test the cat was shown to have done worse in a later trial than in an earlier one, suggesting that no learning from the previous trials was retained in long-term memory. The scientist considered the cat to have the capacity for learning due to the law of effect, which states that responses followed by satisfaction (i.e. a reward) become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future.
An experiment was conducted in 2009 where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen. When presented with one string, cats had no trouble getting the treats. When presented with multiple strings, some of which were not connected to treats, the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings, leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do.B.

Research was made to identify possible observational learning in kittens. Kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a non-related adult cat, and sooner than the ones who, being placed in trial and error conditions, observed no other cat performing the act. Experimental investigation of primates show that the chimpanzee possess some limited insight in regard to observational learning (see Köhler), whereas this capacity is wholly absent in the domesticated cat,[tpl]Clarify|reason=What about the observational learning in kittens that was referred to a few sentences ago?|date=April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first=Michael|last=Wertheimer|title=A Brief History of Psychology|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:B8t8DSqzHP8J:www.psypress.com/common/sample-chapters/9781848728752.pdf+(Kurt+Koffka)+The+whole+is+other+than+the+sum+of+the+parts&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESj6v2mqIRUUrshKO0FSFIEvLtwa-eggIqwSxyTp0lFttiUB653Gzui7jAuqcPdZrUKfcYzlKm56ah_9HaAl-a8_QSEytegYeXJIXbKChl_7XnqAdM1Z9SnhDMBoeJ5UBFMPf3eY&sig=AHIEtbTvvRkNkGeuBd5anY86LwECIZAAnw&pli=1 |publisher=Psychology Press|year=2012|isbn= 978-1-84872-874-5[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=C.

In considering the unlikely likelihood of the cat developing intelligence should the opportunity for longitudinal evolutionary changes occur, e.g. if humanity becomes extinct, the likelihood of an evolution of pantera intelligence within the millions-of-years time-scale identified by the evolution of human intelligence studies is a factor of genetics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

Artificially enhanced cat intelligence would therefore only become a consideration for use in experiment, perhaps at some unknown time in future. The production of more intelligent cats might be theoretically a consideration for military organisations i.e. DARPA, in the hope of gleaning some advancement in warfare. Practically the common cat has proved little use for military personnel (Acoustic Kitty), despite the potential inherent in a creature with far greater prowess and agility than any human.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

There are a number of reasons the cat brain is a goal of computer simulations. Cats are familiar and easily-kept animals, so the physiology of cats has been particularly well studied. The physical structures of human brains and cat brains are very similar. Cats, like humans, have binocular vision that gives them depth perception.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(01)00149-6 |title=Temporal dynamics of binocular disparity processing with corticogeniculate interactions |year=2002 |last1=Grossberg |first1=Stephen |last2=Grunewald |first2=Alexander |journal=Neural Networks |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=181–200 |pmid=12022507[/tpl] Building artificial mammal brains requires ever more powerful computers as the brain gets more complex, from the mouse brain, to the rat brain (in 2007), to the cat brain, and ultimately to the human brain. Building artificial mammal brains advances the research of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, but also leads to questions of the definition of sentient and conscious life forms, and to the ethics of artificial consciousness and the ethics of artificial intelligence.
