The song is in common time throughout and follows the basic ABABCB skeleton, with 'A' being the verse, 'B' being the prechorus and chorus, and 'C' being the bridge.
The song's verses are in the key of C natural minor and feature a i-VI-III-VII progression repeated three times, with a chord change every two beats.  The song then enters a prechorus that slows into a half time.  Background "Ohs" are heard as a slow B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] progression is played.  Using the B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] (V/I), the song then modulates into E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] major for the chorus which features a I-V-IV-V progression with a chord change every measure.  This progression is repeated twice.  The bridge is also in the key of C natural minor, but features a progression of i-VII-VI-VII.  With a chord change every two beats.  This progression is repeated six times.  In the last three repeats, lead guitarist Jeff Stinco plays a short guitar interlude.  The song ends in E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] major on the dominant chord.Save You Chords by Simple Plan
