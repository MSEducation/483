Chennai is also known as Chennapattanam. The town grew around Fort St. George, which was built by English in 1639.[tpl]cite book|last=Wagret|first=Paul|title=Nagel's encyclopedia-guide|publisher=Nagel Publishers|location=Geneva|year=1977|series="India, Nepal"|page=556|isbn=978-2-8263-0023-6|oclc=4202160[/tpl]
Two different aspects explain the origin of the name Chennapattanam:
Multiple explanations attempt to account for the city's colonial name, Madras:

In 1996 the state government officially changed the name to Chennai. At that time many Indian cities underwent a change of name. However, the name Madras continues in occasional use for the city,[ref]

==History==

The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military, and economic centre for many centuries. During 1st century CE, a poet and weaver named Thiruvalluvar lived in the town of Mylapore (a neighbourhood of present Chennai).[tpl]cite book|title=Awakening Indians to India (Hard Bound)|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nqmg3xeDmOMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Awakening+Indians+to+India+(Hard+Bound)#v=onepage&q=mylapore&f=false|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=215|year=2008|isbn=978-81-7597-433-3|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl] From 1st century CE until 12th CE the region of present Tamil Nadu and parts of South India was ruled by the Cholas.[tpl]cite book|title=India: Food & Cooking: The Ultimate Book on Indian Cuisine|url=http://books.google.com/?id=orHWFRMKf4EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=India:+Food+%26+Cooking:+The+Ultimate+Book+on+Indian+Cuisine#v=onepage&q=Chennai%201st%20century&f=false|publisher=Replika Press Pvt.

Stone age implements have been found near Pallavaram in Chennai. According to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Pallavaram was a megalithic cultural establishment, and pre-historic communities resided in the settlement.[tpl]cite news|title=Road workers stumble upon ancient grinding stone in Pallavaram|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-19/chennai/28256385_1_revenue-officials-stone-alandur|work=The Times of India|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl] The Pallavas of Kanchi built the areas of Mahabalipuram and Pallavaram during the reign of Mahendravarman I.

The Portuguese first arrived in 1522 and built a port called São Tomé after the Christian apostle, St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached in the area between 52 and 70 AD. In 1612, the Dutch established themselves near Pulicat, north of Chennai. On 22 August 1639, which is referred to as Madras Day, the British East India Company under Francis Day bought a small strip of land stretching 3 miles on the Coromandel Coast. They got a license to build a fort and a castle in the contracted region. The ruler Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu, the Nayaka of Vandavasi, granted the British permission to build a factory and warehouse for their trading enterprises. The region was then primarily a fishing village known as "Madraspatnam". A year later, the British built Fort St. George, the first major British settlement in India,[tpl]cite book|title=A short history of the world|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+the+World#v=onepage&q=St%20George&f=false|publisher=Helicon publishing Ltd.|page=277|year=1997|author=Roberts J.

In 1746, Fort St. George and Madras were captured by the French under General La Bourdonnais, the Governor of Mauritius, who plundered the town and its outlying villages. The British regained control in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and strengthened the town's fortress wall to withstand further attacks from the French and Hyder Ali, the Sultan of Mysore.[tpl]cite book|title=A global chronology of conflict|url=http://books.google.com/?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&pg=PA756#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=ABC—CLIO|page=756|year=2010|author= Spencer C.

Gradually, the city grew into a major naval base and became the central administrative centre for the British in South India. With the advent of railways in India in the 19th century, the thriving urban centre was connected to other important cities such as Bombay and Calcutta, promoting increased communication and trade with the hinterland. Sir Arthur Lawley was Governor of Madras from 1906 to 1911 and promoted modern agriculture, industry, railways, education, the arts and more democratic governance. The Governor lived in Government House, Fort St George, and had a country home at Guindy, with access to a golf course, hockey pitches, riding stables and the Guindy Horse Racing Track.Sir Arthur Lawley, Eloquent Knight Errant, Chapter 6.

After India gained its independence in 1947, the city became the capital of Madras State, which was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. The violent agitations of 1965 against the compulsory imposition of Hindi in the state marked a major shift in the political dynamics of the city and eventually it had a big impact on the whole state.[tpl]cite news|title=Chennai says it in Hindi|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/chennai-says-it-in-hindi/830371/0|work=The Indian Express|date=14 August 2011|author=V.

Cooum is one of the most polluted rivers in the whole South of India and serves as potential health hazard to the people living in and around the river. A third river, the Kortalaiyar, flows through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at Ennore. The estuary of this river is heavily polluted with effluents released by the industries in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=department/department/profile&deptid=8&facultyid=28 |title=Welcome to Univesity of Madras - 154 years of Excellence |publisher=Unom.ac.in |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2013[/tpl] Adyar and Cooum rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and waste from domestic and commercial sources.

Some areas of the city have the problem of excess iron content in groundwater.
Chennai's soil is mostly clay, shale and sandstone. Clay underlies most of the city, chiefly Manali, Kolathur, Maduravoyal, K. K. Nagar, Semmencherry, Alapakkam, Vyasarpadi and Anna Nagar. Sandy areas are found along the river banks and coasts, and include areas such as Tiruvottiyur, George Town, Madhavaram, New Washermanpet, Chepauk, Mylapore, Porur, Adyar, Besant Nagar and Uthandi. In these areas, rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. Areas having hard rock surface include Guindy, Nanganallur, Pallikaranai, Alandur, Jaladampet, Velachery, Adambakkam and a part of Saidapet and Perungudi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-29/chennai/28352223_1_groundwater-level-poondi-soil|title=Quality of groundwater better this year|work=The Times of India|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=29 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Lakshmi | first = K. | title = Tardy monsoon: Chennai water table rises only marginally | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | date = 28 August 2012 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/article3828935.ece | accessdate =28 December 2012[/tpl] The ground water table in Chennai is at 4-5m below ground in most of the areas, which was considerably improved and maintained through the mandatory rain water harvesting system.[tpl]cite book |author1=Susheela Raghavan |author2=Indira Narayanan |editor=S.Muthiah |title=Madras, Chennai: A 400-year Record of the First City of Modern India, Volume 1 |publisher=Palaniappa Brothers |year=2008 |page=13 |chapter=Chapter 1: Geography |isbn=978-81-8379-468-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tbR_LLkqdI8C&dq=A+400-year+Record+of+the+First+City+of+Modern+India|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl]
