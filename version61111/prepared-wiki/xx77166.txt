He is known for his satellite-based temperature monitoring work, for which he was awarded the American Meteorological Society's Special Award.

==Education and career==

Spencer received a B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Michigan in 1978 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1980 and 1982. His doctoral thesis was titled, A case study of African wave structure and energetics during Atlantic transit.[tpl]cite journal | author=Spencer, Roy Warren | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/case-study-of-african-wave-structure-and-energetics-during-atlantic-transit/oclc/8338410 | title=A case study of African wave structure and energetics during Atlantic transit | publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison | year=1981 |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl]
After receiving his Ph.D. in 1982, Spencer worked for two years as a research scientist in the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He then joined NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center as a visiting scientist in 1984, where he later became a Senior Scientist for Climate Studies. After leaving NASA in 2001, Spencer has been a Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UHA). As well as his position at UHA, Spencer is currently the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA's Aqua satellite, a position he has held since 1994. 
In 2001, he designed an algorithm to detect tropical cyclones and estimate their maximum sustained wind speed using the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU).[tpl]cite web |url=http://datamining.itsc.uah.edu/case_studies/cyclone.html |title=Detecting Tropical Cyclones Using AMSU |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Spencer, Roy W. and William D.

Spencer has been a member of several science teams: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Space Station Accommodations Analysis Study Team, Science Steering Group for TRMM, TOVS Pathfinder Working Group, NASA Headquarters Earth Science and Applications Advisory Subcommittee, and two National Research Council (NRC) study panels.
He is on the board of directors of the George C. Marshall Institute,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marshall.org/board.php |title=The Marshall Institute - Staff |publisher=George C. Marshall Institute |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] and on the board of advisors of the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cornwallalliance.org/about/cornwall-alliance-advisory-board/ |title=Cornwall Alliance Board of Advisors |publisher=Cornwall Alliance |accessdate=2013-04-03[/tpl]
Spencer's research work is funded by NASA, NOAA, DOE and the DOT.

==Peer-reviewed articles on climate change==

===Negative cloud feedback===

In 2007, Spencer and others published a paper in Geophysical Research Letters regarding negative cloud feedback in the tropics that potentially supports Richard Lindzen's Iris hypothesis, which proposes that as the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease, allowing infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere to outer space.[tpl]cite journal |author=Spencer, Roy W. |coauthors=Braswell, William D.; Christy, John R.; Hnilo, Justin |year=2007 |url=http://www.drroyspencer.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf |title=Cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=15 |doi=10.1029/2007GL029698|bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3415707S [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Milloy, Study |date=November 1, 2007 |url=http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2007/11/01/clouds-mitigate-global-warming-new-evidence-shows |title=Clouds Mitigate Global Warming, New Evidence Shows |publisher=Heartland Institute |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] Spencer stated, "To give an idea of how strong this enhanced cooling mechanism is, if it was operating on global warming, it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent. ... Right now, all climate models predict that clouds will amplify warming. I'm betting that if the climate models' 'clouds' were made to behave the way we see these clouds behave in nature, it would substantially reduce the amount of climate change the models predict for the coming decades."[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.uah.edu/News/newsread.php?newsID=875 |title=Cirrus disappearance: Warming might thin heat-trapping clouds |publisher=University of Alabama in Huntsville |date=August 9, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716042310/http://www.uah.edu/news/newsread.php?newsID=875 |archivedate=July 16, 2011  |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl]

===Cloud formation and temperature change===

In 2008, Spencer and William Braswell published a paper in the Journal of Climate which suggests that natural variations in how clouds form could actually be causing temperature changes, rather than the other way around, and could also lead to overestimates of how sensitive the Earth's climate is to greenhouse gas emissions.[tpl]cite journal |authors=Spencer, Roy W. and William D. Braswell |year=2008 |url=http://www.drroyspencer.com/Spencer-and-Braswell-08.pdf |title=Potential Biases in Feedback Diagnosis from Observational Data: A Simple Model Demonstration |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=21 |issue=21 |pages=5624–5628 |accessdate=2012-08-29|bibcode = 2008JCli...21.5624S |doi = 10.1175/2008JCLI2253.1 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Rice, Doyle |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2008-06-18-clouds-climate_N.htm |title=Global warming forecast: Partly cloudy |work=USA Today |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl] Spencer stated, "Our paper is an important step toward validating a gut instinct that many meteorologists like myself have had over the years, ... that the climate system is dominated by stabilizing processes, rather than destabilizing processes - that is, negative feedback rather than positive feedback."[tpl]cite news |date=June 8, 2008 |url=http://phys.org/news132251958.html |title=Has global warming research misinterpreted cloud behavior? |work=PhysOrg |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl]

===Energy lost to space as compared to climate models===

In 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper in Remote Sensing concluding that more energy is radiated back to space and released earlier than previously thought.[tpl]cite journal |authors=Spencer, Roy and William Braswell |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/8/1603 |title=On the Misdiagnosis of Climate Feedbacks from Variations in Earth's Radiant Energy Balance |journal=Remote Sensing |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=1603–1613 |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-08-27|bibcode = 2011RemS....3.1603S |doi = 10.3390/rs3081603 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Orlowski, Andrew |date=July 29, 2011 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/29/spencer_missing_heat/ |title='Missing heat': Is global warmth vanishing into space? |work=The Register |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl] Spencer stated, "The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show. There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans."[tpl]cite news |date=July 29, 2011 |url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2011/07/29/Data-contradict-climate-model-predictions/UPI-93691311982879/ |title=Data contradict climate model predictions |work=UPI |accessdate=2012-08-30[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Horton, Daniel |date=July 29, 2011 |url=http://phys.org/news/2011-07-climate-energy-wrong-hot-global.html |title=Climate models make too hot forecasts of global warming |work=PhysOrg |accessdate=2012-08-30[/tpl]
The paper was criticized by mainstream climate scientists.[tpl]cite news |author=Borenstein, Seth |date=July 29, 2011 |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20110729/AP10/307299868 |title=Skeptic's small cloud study renews climate rancor |work=Associated Press |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Black, Richard |date=September 2, 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14768574 |title=Journal editor resigns over 'problematic' climate paper |work=BBC News |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl] Kerry Emanuel of MIT, said this work was cautious and limited mostly to pointing out problems with forecasting heat feedback.
The editor-in-chief of Remote Sensing, Wolfgang Wagner, later resigned over publication of Spencer and Braswell (2011),[tpl]cite news |author=Hickman, Leo |date=February 9, 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/sep/02/journal-editor-resigns-climate-sceptic-paper |title=Journal editor resigns over 'flawed' paper co-authored by climate sceptic |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] stating, "From a purely formal point of view, there were no errors with the review process. ... the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view ...but that it essentially ignored the scientific arguments of its opponents. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal."[tpl]cite journal |author=Wagner, Wolfgang |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/9/2002/ |title=Taking Responsibility on Publishing the Controversial Paper "On the Misdiagnosis of Surface Temperature Feedbacks from Variations in Earth's Radiant Energy Balance" by Spencer and Braswell, Remote Sens. 2011, 3(8), 1603-1613 |journal=Remote Sensing |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=2002–2004 |year=2011 |doi=10.3390/rs3092002 |accessdate=2012-08-27|bibcode = 2011RemS....3.2002W [/tpl] Wagner added he, "would also like to personally protest against how the authors and like-minded climate sceptics have much exaggerated the paper's conclusions in public statements".
Spencer responded that Wagner's assertion was wholly inaccurate, "But the paper WAS precisely addressing the scientific arguments made by our opponents, and showing why they are wrong! That was the paper’s starting point! We dealt with specifics, numbers, calculations…while our critics only use generalities and talking points. There is no contest, as far as I can see, in this debate. If you have some physics or radiative transfer background, read the evidence we present, the paper we were responding to, and decide for yourself."[tpl]cite news |author=Clabough, Raven |date=September 6, 2011 |url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/6961-resignation-of-climate-change-editor-incites-inquiries |title=Resignation of Climate Change Editor Incites Inquiries |work=The New American |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl]
Andrew Dessler later published a paper opposing the claims of Spencer and Braswell (2011) in Geophysical Research Letters.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dessler, Andrew E. |url=http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/Dessler2011.pdf |title=Cloud variations and the Earth's energy budget |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=38 |issue=19 |year=2011 |doi=10.1029/2011GL049236 |accessdate=2011-09-07|bibcode = 2011GeoRL..3819701D [/tpl]

===Climate change===

Spencer is a signatory to An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cornwallalliance.org/blog/item/prominent-signers-of-an-evangelical-declaration-on-global-warming/ |title=Prominent Signers of An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming |publisher=Cornwall Alliance |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl]Mark Kelly. "Global warming alarmism 'fails the tests,' scholars say", Baptist Press, December 4, 2009. which states that "Earth and its ecosystems – created by God's intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence – are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting".An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming "We believe Earth and its ecosystems – created by God's intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence – are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting, admirably suited for human flourishing, and displaying His glory." He believes that most climate change is natural in origin, the result of long-term changes in the Earth's albedo and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have caused some warming, but that its warming influence is small compared to natural, internal, chaotic fluctuations in global average cloud cover.[tpl]cite interview |last=Spencer |first=Roy |url=http://www.science20.com/quotscience_help_usquot/interview_global_warming_skeptic_dr_roy_spencer |title=Interview With A Global Warming Skeptic: Dr. Roy Spencer |interviewer=Cameron J. English |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] This view is at odds with the vast majority of the science community, as 97% of scientists are convinced that current global climate change is heavily influenced by human action. For more on this subject, see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change
In 2006 Spencer criticized Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth, saying, "For instance, Mr. Gore claims that the Earth is now warmer than it has been in thousands of years. Yet the latest National Academies of Science (NAS) report on the subject has now admitted that all we really know is that we are warmer now than we were during the last 400 years, which is mostly made up of the 'Little Ice Age'".Star Search by Roy Spencer, TCS Daily, 30 Jun 2006
In a New York Post opinion column on February 26, 2007, Spencer wrote: 

In an interview with conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh on February 28, 2007, Spencer stated that he doesn't believe "catastrophic manmade global warming" is occurring. He also criticized climate models, saying "The people that have built the climate models that predict global warming believe they have sufficient physics in those models to predict the future. I believe they don't. I believe the climate system, the weather as it is today in the real world shows a stability that they do not yet have in those climate models."Global Warming Update: Facts, Science Smash the Global Warming Myth Roy Spencer is also included in a film that argues against the theory of man-made global warming called The Great Global Warming Swindle.
He testified before the Waxman committee's examination of political interference with climate science on March 19, 2007.
Spencer has published two books on climate change: In 2008, Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that Hurt the Poor,Climate Confusion and in 2010, The Great Global Warming Blunder: How Mother Nature Fooled the World’s Top Climate Scientists.The Great Global Warming Blunder
On July 18, 2013 before U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's Environment and Public Works committee, Spencer suggested the hearing title could easily be renamed "Climate Change, It's Happened Before" rather than the actual title, "Climate Change, It's Happening Now". He added “The last 2000 years of proxy reconstructed temperature variations for the Northern Hemisphere shows that the Modern Warm Period (today) is not significantly different from the Medieval Warm Period of ~1000 years ago, or the Roman Warm Period of ~2000 years ago."

In February 2014 Spencer posted on his blog that he was going to start referring to those who referred to those questioning the mainstream view of global warming (such as Spencer himself) as "climate change deniers" as "global warming Nazis", contending that "...these people are supporting policies that will kill far more people than the Nazis ever did."

Shelley Rose, the ADL's Southeast Interim Regional Director, argued that the comparison of global warming advocates to Nazis was "outrageous and deeply offensive," and "This analogy is just the latest example of a troubling epidemic of comparisons to Hitler and the Holocaust."[tpl]cite web | url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2014/02/uah_climate_expert_roy_spencer.html | title=UAH climate expert Roy Spencer calls critics 'global warming Nazis'; Anti-Defamation League objects | work=The Birmingham News | date=26 February 2014 | accessdate=28 February 2014 | author=Gattis, Paul[/tpl]  In reply, Spencer asked whether the ADL  is being hypocritical.  Spencer quoted syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman's famous  statement that "global warming deniers are now on a par with Holocaust deniers," and said  that the ADL should condemn that use of  "denier." UAH climate expert Roy Spencer sharply rebukes criticism from Anti-Defamation League, The Huntsville Times (AL.com), February 28, 2014 Spencer was defended by Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow adjunct policy analyst Alan Caruba, who wrote that "Dr. Spencer’s decision to call a Nazi a Nazi ignited a lot of discussion among the global warming hustlers and those whom they have been calling “deniers” for many years."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sonorannews.com/archives/2014/140312/guested-caruba.html | title=Calling the Global Warming charlatans "Nazis" | work=Sonoran News | date=12 March 2014 | accessdate=13 March 2014 | author=Caruba, Alan[/tpl]

===Intelligent design===

In TCS Daily, Spencer wrote, "Twenty years ago, as a PhD scientist, I intensely studied the evolution versus intelligent design controversy for about two years. And finally, despite my previous acceptance of evolutionary theory as 'fact,' I came to the realization that intelligent design, as a theory of origins, is no more religious, and no less scientific, than evolutionism. In the scientific community, I am not alone. There are many fine books out there on the subject. Curiously, most of the books are written by scientists who lost faith in evolution as adults, after they learned how to apply the analytical tools they were taught in college."[tpl]cite web |author=Spencer, Roy |date=August 8, 2005 |url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=080805I |title=Faith-Based Evolution |work=TCS Daily |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl] In the book The Evolution Crisis, Spencer wrote, "I finally became convinced that the theory of creation actually had a much better scientific basis than the theory of evolution, for the creation model was actually better able to explain the physical and biological complexity in the world. ... Science has startled us with its many discoveries and advances, but it has hit a brick wall in its attempt to rid itself of the need for a creator and designer."[tpl]cite book |author=Penfold, Michael |year=2007 |url=http://theevolutioncrisis.org.uk/testimony2.php |title=The Evolution Crisis |isbn=1900742241 |publisher=Penfold Books |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl] 
Climatologist Patrick Michaels has defended Spencer, arguing that his religious beliefs have nothing to do with his climate change research.[tpl]cite news |author=Michaels, Patrick J. |date=May 9, 2012 |url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/guilt-association |title=Guilt by Association |work=National Review |accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl]
