The text in Charles's book, Winin, is bilingual and at the back of the small book is a guide to pronunciation of Nyulnyul words and word lists translating to and from English.
The story is a traditional story written for children.  It is set "In the dreamtime ...",  when the emu flies higher than all the other birds, and lives in the Milky Way.  The other birds who fly close to the ground are jealous.  The brolga tell the emu that if its wings were made smaller it would be able to fly even higher, and because the emu wants to fly higher it lets the other birds trim its wings.  With small wings, the emu can't fly at all and will always stay that way.
