Aldiss & Harry Harrison, Hell's Cartographers, Orbit Books, 1976, p. 105. His first story, "The Itching Hour," appeared in the Summer 1940 number of Futuria Fantasia, edited and published by Ray Bradbury. "Resilience" followed in the February 1941 number of Stirring Science Stories, edited by Donald Wolheim. An editorial error made the latter story's ending incomprehensible;Pohl, SFWA Grand Masters Volume Three, p. 202. it was reprinted in a 1978 magazine in four pages with a two-page introduction by Knight.

At the time of his first story, he was living in New York, and was a member of the Futurians. One of his short stories describes paranormal disruption of a science fiction fan group, and contains cameo appearances of various Futurians and others under thinly-disguised names: For instance, non-Futurian sf writer H. Beam Piper is identified as "H. Dreyne Fifer".
In a series of reviews for various magazines, he became famous as a science fiction critic, a career which began when he wrote in 1945 that A. E. van Vogt "is not a giant as often maintained. He's only a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter." After nine years, he ceased reviewing when a magazine refused to publish one review exactly as he wrote it. These reviews were later collected in In Search of Wonder.
The SFWA officers and past presidents named Knight its 13th Grand Master in 1994 (presented 1995). After his 2002 death the associated award was renamed in his honor, the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2003.
To the general public, he is best known as the author of "To Serve Man", a 1950 short story that was adapted for The Twilight Zone.Stanyard, Dimensions Behind the Twilight Zone, p. 51. It won a 50-year Retro Hugo in 2001 as the best short story of 1950, which predated the Hugo Awards. His only Hugo Award was the "Best Reviewer" in 1956.
Knight is also known for the term "idiot plot", a story that only functions because almost everyone in it is an idiot; the term was probably invented by James Blish, but became well-known through Knight's frequent use of it in his reviews.Gary K. Wolfe, "Coming to Terms", in Gunn & Candelaria, Speculations on Speculation, p. 18.
His papers are held in the University of Oregon Special Collections and University Archive.http://around.uoregon.edu/story/academics/celebrating-csws-40th-le-guin-feminist-science-fiction-fellowship
