==Design==

This ship was designed by the firm Bernardis and was intended to be a cruiser submarine which carried a seaplane in a waterproof hangar. Several prototype seaplanes were designed but not deployed and the hangar was removed in 1931. The deck gun was initially a 12-cm (4.7-inch) 27-calibre OTO model of 1924, but this was later replaced by a 12-cm 45-calibre OTO model of 1931.[tpl]cite book |last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink = |title =Naval Weapons of World War Two |publisher =Naval Institute Press |volume = |edition = |date =1985 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |pages =335-338 |isbn =0-87021-459-4[/tpl]

The ship was built by Tosi. She was laid down in 1926, launched on 15 April 1929 and completed in 1930. She was deployed on operational patrols in 1940 but was found too large to be effective in the Mediterranean Sea. She suffered a battery explosion late in 1940 and was laid up for the remainder of the war.
