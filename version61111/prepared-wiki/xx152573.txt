Abbott Mysteries was a comedy-mystery radio program adapted from the novels of Frances Crane (1896-1981). Initially a summer replacement for Quick As a Flash, the series was heard on Mutual and NBC between the years 1945 and 1955.
The Mutual series, sponsored by Helbros Watches, debuted June 10, 1945, airing Sundays at 6pm. The scripts by Howard Merrill and Ed Adamson were in the lighthearted tradition of Mr. and Mrs. North. Julie Stevens and Charles Webster starred as Jean and Pat Abbott, a San Francisco married couple who solved murder mysteries. In the supporting cast were Jean Ellyn, Sydney Slon and Luis van Rooten.
Moving to 5:30pm in 1946, Les Tremayne and Alice Reinheart took over the roles until the end of the series on August 31, 1947.
Seven years later, the characters returned October 3, 1954, on NBC in The Adventures of the Abbotts, broadcast on NBC Sunday evenings at 8:30pm. In this series, the Abbotts were portrayed by Claudia Morgan and Les Damon. The NBC series ran until June 12, 1955.
"The series was resurrected by NBC in 1955 under the new title of The Adventures of the Abbotts and this nudged Mutual into producing a copycat show under the title It's A Crime, Mr. Collins.""The Copycat Shows of Old Time Radio", by Jack French, The Old Radio Times, official publication of the Old-Time Radio Researchers, #26, January, 2008, accessed March 18, 2010 "Many programs in the Golden Age of Radio were flattered by their competitors. ... The Abbotts on NBC were copied exactly in Mutual's It's A Crime, Mr. Collins, including paraphrasing (the original author's) words.""Radio's Clumsy Counterfeits", by Jack French, from Radio Recall magazine, February, 2004, a publication of the Metropolitan Washington Old Time Radio Club, accessed March 18, 2010 "Mutual even used ... the habit of putting a color in the title of every story."
