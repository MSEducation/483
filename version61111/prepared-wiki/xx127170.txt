The major landowners were St. Blaisen Abbey and Zurzach Abbey.  The rights to hold courts was held in the 14th and 15th Centuries by the Lords of Liebegg.  Between 1506-1671, the court rights were held by Sion Abbey in Klingnau, and after that those rights were in private hands.
The chapel (now a building from the 18th Century), together with tithes were initially the property of St. Blaisen Abbey, while the village was part of the parish of Wislikofen.  In 1883 the village and chapel became part of the newly founded parish of Baldingen.
