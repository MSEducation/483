[[European Social Survey]]

CATEGORIES: Social statistics data, Data collection

The European Social Survey (ESS) is a social scientific endeavour to map the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of the various populations in Europe.

==History==

The ESS was initiated by the European Science Foundation. One of the reasons to start this new time series of social scientific data was that existing cross-national attitude surveys were regarded as not of sufficient methodological rigour to draw on as reliable sources for knowledge about changes over time in Europe. Starting in 2002 the survey has been held every two years in many European countries, with round 6 (2012) covering 30 nations.

==Modules==

The questionnaires consist of a core module, which is repeated each round. In addition to the core module each round contains rotating modules on specific themes.
The core module covers the following topics:
The various rounds of the ESS contained the following rotating modules:
Round 1 (2002) 
Round 2 (2004)
Round 3 (2006)
Round 4 (2008)
Round 5 (2010)
Round 6 (2012)

==Prize==
