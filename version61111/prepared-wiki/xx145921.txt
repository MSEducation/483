Uptown Avondale is an EP by the band The Afghan Whigs. It bears the Sub Pop catalog number SPCD 53/215 and is representative of the Cincinnati band's soul influences. The EP contains covers of 4 classic Stax/Motown-era tracks:
It also contains a stark, robotic remix of the Whigs song "Milez Is Ded" as a hidden track â€” the original was itself a sinister, funk-tinged hidden track on the 1992 album Congregation. This version takes the song and gives it a bit of a menacing dancefloor tweak, complete with a looped drum track (same bed as The Stone Roses' "Fools Gold", and dozens of other tracks from the same timeframe) and some heavy effects on the vocals and guitars. Cue track #4 to 4:28 for the beginning of "Milez Is Ded"'s remix, which the band playfully referred to as "Rebirth Of The Cool".
