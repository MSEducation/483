The 1st Minnesota Volunteer Heavy Artillery Regiment was a regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Service==

The 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery mustered in at St. Paul, and  Rochester, Minnesota, between November 1864 and February 1865. Many of the officers were recruited from discharged veteran sergeants of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and corporals from the 3rd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 4th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. It was composed of twelve companies, each containing 140 men, with officers.
The regiment was assigned to the garrison of Chattanooga, Tennessee where it was in charge of the heavy guns and forts because it was feared General John Hood might try and retake the city. The regiment, which saw no combat action, remained there until the close of the war. The 1st Minnesota "Heavies" were mustered out of service on September 27, 1865.
Albert Woolson, who was a 14-year-old company drummer in the regiment, became the last surviving veteran of the American Civil War from either side. He died in 1956.
