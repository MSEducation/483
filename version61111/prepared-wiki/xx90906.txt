The Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, also commonly known as St. Andrew's Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Episcopal Church in the United States located in the State of Hawaii.  Originally the seat of the Anglican Church of Hawaii, it is now the home of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii.

==History==

Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, his queen consort, were devout members of the Church of England led by their good friend Queen Victoria. At their request, Thomas Nettleship Staley was appointed bishop in 1862. Inspired to build a place of worship in the Anglican tradition, Kamehameha IV commissioned the construction of what would later become the Cathedral of Saint Andrew.  However, the king died on the feast day of Saint Andrew in 1863 before ground-breaking. Kamehameha V, the king's brother, took over the project and laid the cornerstone in honor of his predecessor on March 5, 1867.  The cathedral was designed by the London architects William Slater and R. H. Carpenter,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.thecathedralofstandrew.org/sacred-spaces/| title = Sacred Spaces: History in the North Pacific Tropics| accessdate = 19 November 2012| publisher = Cathedral of Saint Andrew, Honolulu[/tpl] and the building process was overseen by their chief assistant Benjamin Ingelow.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sussexparishchurches.org/content/view/328/40/|title=Architects and Artists I–J–K|last=Allen|first=John|date=28 March 2013|work=Sussex Parish Churches website|publisher=Sussex Parish Churches (www.sussexparishchurches.org)|accessdate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GfBW8P16|archivedate=16 May 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The Cathedral of Saint Andrew was built in the French Gothic architectural style, shipped in several pre-fabricated pieces from England.  The western facade has a window of hand-blown stained glass that reaches from the floor to the eaves, depicting the European explorers that visited the Hawaiian islands.
There are only three other cathedrals in the Hawaiian Islands — Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Pacific of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.
It is located on Queen Emma Street, between Beretania Street and Queen Emma Square.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on July 2, 1973 as site 73000663.[tpl]cite web |title= nomination form |work= National Register of Historic Places |author= Robert.
