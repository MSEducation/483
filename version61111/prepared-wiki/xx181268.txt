==History==

Established in 1927 as an original US highway, it was assigned to the entirety of SC 21, which was removed the following year.  Traveling closely as it does today, it went from North Augusta to Travelers Rest, connecting the cities and towns of Edgefield, Greenwood, Ware Shoals, and Greenville.
In 1937, US 25 was rerouted in Greenville, moving onto College Avenue from Main Street to Buncombe Street.  By 1961, US 25 was moved onto a new bypass east of North Augusta, leaving US 25 Bus. In 1963, Ware Shoals was bypassed east, leaving another US 25 Bus.  In 1964, US 25 was rerouted onto new primary routing east of Travelers Rest, leaving Main Street to US 276 and Poinsett Highway downgraded to secondary (today now an unsigned US 25 Conn).[tpl]cite map |publisher= South Carolina Department of Transportation |url= http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/scrm/id/304/rec/2 |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map, Greenville County, South Carolina |cartography= SCDOT |year= 1957 |accessdate= April 7, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= South Carolina Department of Transportation |url= http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/scrm/id/192/rec/1 |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map, Greenville County, South Carolina |cartography= SCDOT |year= 1965 |accessdate= April 7, 2014[/tpl]
By 1969, US 25 was rerouted onto a western bypass of Greenville, replacing SC 250; the old alignment was replaced by US 25 Bus.  Also in same year, US 25 was given its current eastern bypass around Greenwood, leaving US 25 Bus along its old alignment along Main and Montague Streets.  In 1973, US 25 was rerouted in northern Greenville County onto new modern ascent along the Saluda Mountains; the old route was downgraded to secondary (Old Highway 25 - S-23-969).[tpl]cite map |publisher= South Carolina Department of Transportation |url= http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/scrm/id/638/rec/5 |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map, Greenville County, South Carolina |cartography= SCDOT |year= 1973 |accessdate= April 7, 2014[/tpl]
