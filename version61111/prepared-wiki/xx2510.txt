His 11th-century biographer, Osbern, himself an artist and scribe, states that Dunstan was skilled in "making a picture and forming letters", as were other clergy of his age who reached senior rank.[tpl]Cite book|last=Alexander |first=Jonathon |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work |year=1992 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |pages=9|isbn=0-300-05689-3 [/tpl]
Dunstan served as an important minister of state to several English kings. He was the most popular saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, not least among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the Devil.[tpl]ws|"St. Dunstan" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl]

==Early life (909–43)==

===Birth===

Dunstan was born in Baltonsborough, Somerset.[tpl]Cite book|last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-461-6 [/tpl] He was the son of Heorstan, a noble of Wessex. Heorstan was the brother of the bishops of Wells and of Winchester.[tpl]Cite book|last=Green |first=John Richard  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=History of the English People, Volume I (of 8) Early England, 449–1071; Foreign Kings, 1071–1204; The Charter, 1204–1216 |year= 1895|publisher=MacMillan |location=London |isbn=1-4346-0693-7[/tpl] It is recorded that his mother, Cynethryth, was a pious woman. Osbern's life of Dunstan relates that a messenger miraculously told her of the saintly child she would give birth to:
The anonymous author of the earliest Life places Dunstan's birth during the reign of Athelstan, while Osbern fixed it at "the first year of the reign of King Æthelstan", 924 or 925. This date, however, cannot be reconciled with other known dates of Dunstan's life and creates many obvious anachronisms. Historians therefore assume that Dunstan was born c. 910 or earlier.Lapidge, Michael, "Dunstan" in Lapidge et al. (eds), The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England. Blackwell, Oxford, 1999.

===School to the king's court===

As a young boy, Dunstan studied under the Irish monks who then occupied the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey.[tpl]Cite web| last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =St Dunstan  | work =Catholic Online  | publisher =Catholic Online   | url = http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=438  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = July 2007 [/tpl] Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of his vision of the abbey being restored.  While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. Even as a child, he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parent's consent he was tonsured, received minor orders and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he is said to have been summoned by his uncle Athelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to enter his service. He was later appointed to the court of King Athelstan.The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church by F. L. Cross (Editor), E. A. Livingstone (Editor) Oxford University Press, USA; 3 edition p.514 (March 13, 1997)
Dunstan soon became a favourite of the king and was the envy of other members of the court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool.[ref]
