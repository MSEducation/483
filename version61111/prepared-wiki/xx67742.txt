Fritzsche, Zinin's colleague, soon recognized that "benzidam" was actually aniline.  See:  Fritzsche (1842) Bulletin Scientifique, 10 :  352.  Reprinted as a postscript to Zinin's article in:  J. Fritzsche (1842) "Bemerkung zu vorstehender Abhandlung des Hrn. Zinin" (Comment on the preceding article by Mr. Zinin), Journal für praktische Chemie, 27 (1) :  153.

On page 48, Hofmann argues that krystallin, kyanol, benzidam, and aniline are identical.

===Synthetic dye industry===

In 1856, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine and went into industry producing the first synthetic dye.  Other aniline dyes followed, such as fuchsine, safranine, and induline.  At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive.  Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine Béchamp,A. Béchamp (1854) "De l'action des protosels de fer sur la nitronaphtaline et la nitrobenzine.  Nouvelle méthode de formation des bases organiques artificielles de Zinin"  (On the action of iron protosalts on nitronaphthaline and nitrobenzene.  New method of forming Zinin's synthetic organic bases.), Annales de Chemie et de Physique, 3rd series, 42 :  186 – 196.  (Note:  In the case of a metal having two or more distinct oxides (e.g., iron), a "protosalt" is an obsolete term for a salt that is obtained from the oxide containing the lowest proportion of oxygen to metal; e.g., in the case of iron, which has two oxides – iron (II) oxide (FeO) and iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) – FeO is the "protoxide" from which protosalts can be made.  See:  Wiktionary:  protosalt.) it was prepared "by the ton".Perkin, William Henry. 1861-06-08. "Proceedings of Chemical Societies: Chemical Society, Thursday, May 16, 1861." The Chemical News and Journal of Industrial Science. Retrieved on 2007-09-24.  The Béchamp reduction enabled the evolution of a massive dye industry in Germany.  Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, now among the largest chemical suppliers, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via aniline dyes and extended via the related azo dyes.  The first azo dye was aniline yellow.Auerbach G, "Azo and naphthol dyes", Textile Colorist, 1880 May;2(17):137-9, p 138.

===Developments in medicine===

In the late 19th century, aniline emerged as an analgesic drug, its cardiac-suppressive side effects countered with caffeine.Wilcox RW, "The treatment of influenza in adults", Medical News, 1900 Dec 15;77():931-2, p 932. During the first decade of the 20th century, while trying to modify synthetic dyes to treat African sleeping sickness, Paul Ehrlich – who had coined the term chemotherapy for his magic bullet approach to medicine – failed and switched to modifying Béchamp's atoxyl, the first organic arsenical drug, and serendipitously obtained a treatment for syphilis – salvarsan – the first successful chemotherapy agent. Salvarsan's targeted microorganism, not yet recognized as a bacterium, was still thought to be a parasite, and medical bacteriologists, believing that bacteria were not susceptible to the chemotherapeutic approach, overlooked Alexander Fleming's report in 1928 on the effects of penicillin.D J Th Wagener, The History of Oncology (Houten: Springer, 2009), pp 150–1.
In 1932, Bayer sought medical applications of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk identified as an antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide – a colorless intermediate for many, highly colorfast azo dyes – already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research.  By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939–45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry.John E Lesch, The First Miracle Drugs: How the Sulfa Drugs Transformed Medicine (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp 202–3.  In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.)  After World War II, Cornelius P. Rhoads introduced the chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment."Medicine: Spoils of war", Time, 15 May 1950.

===Rocket Fuel===

In the 1940s and early 1950s, aniline was used with nitric acid as rocket fuel for small missiles and jet assisted take-off (JATO). The two fuel components are hypergolic, producing a violent reaction on contact."Hypergolic propellant", Wikipedia

==Toxicology and testing==

Aniline is toxic by inhalation of the vapour, ingestion, or percutaneous absorption.Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory, The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London.The Merck Index. 10th ed. (1983), p.96, Rahway: Merck & Co.  The IARC lists it in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) due to the limited and contradictory data available.  The early manufacture of aniline resulted in increased incidents of bladder cancer, but these effects are now attributed to naphthylamines, not anilines.
Many methods exist for detection of aniline.Basic Analytical Toxicology (1995), R. J. Flanagan, S. S. Brown, F. A. de Wolff, R. A. Braithwaite, B. Widdop: World Health Organization  It is metabolized to p-aminophenol and p-acetamidophenol, which are excreted in urine as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. On hydrolysis of urine, p-aminophenol is reformed, and can be detected using the o-cresol test.
