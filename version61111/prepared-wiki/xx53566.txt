Amar Sonar Bangla ([tpl]lang-bn|আমার সোনার বাংলা[/tpl], "My Golden Bengal" pronounced as Amar Shonar Bangla) is a 1905 song written and composed by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, the first ten lines of which were adopted in 1972 as the national anthem of Bangladesh.[tpl]cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/bangladesh-amar-shonar-bangla | title=Bangladesh: Amar Sonar Bangla | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-08-09 [/tpl]
The word [tpl]lang|bn|সোনার[/tpl] sonar literally means 'made of gold', but in the song [tpl]lang|bn|সোনার বাংলা[/tpl] sonar Bangla may be interpreted to either express the preciousness of Bengal or a reference to the colour of paddy fields before harvest.
The song was written in 1905 during the period of [tpl]lang|bn|বঙ্গভঙ্গ[/tpl] Bônggôbhônggô (Partition of Bengal (1905)) - when the ruling British empire had the province of Bengal (of undivided India) split into two parts; the decision on the Partition of Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon. The partition took effect on 16 October 1905. This divide of Bengal was along communal lines — East Bengal had a majority of Muslims, while West Bengal had a majority of Hindus. This partition is claimed to have undermined India's national movement against British imperialism, and is said to have been politically motivated. This song, along with a host of others, was written by Tagore, a pioneer of the cultural and political movement against this partition. These songs were meant to rekindle the unified spirit of Bengal, to raise public consciousness against the communal political divide.
The lyrics first appeared in the September issues of "Bongodorshon" and "Baul" simultaneously, in 1905. The song along with the musical notation (referred to as swaralipi in Bengali), first appeared in the periodical musical journal Shongeet Biggnan Probeshika in the same month and year. Indira Devi, Tagore's niece, Satyendranath Tagore's daughter, jotted down the musical notation hearing it from Tagore himself (this was the common norm, Tagore singing the song, and someone formally jotting down the musical notations). It is said that the music of this song was inspired by the Baul singer Gagan Harkara's song [tpl]lang|bn|কোথায় পাবো তারে[/tpl] "Ami Kothay Pabo Tare".Folk singer, Swapan Basu, demonstrates the similarity in a live recitation (0:43/8:46 to 1:21/8:46)
The first 10 lines of this song constitute the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was adopted in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The instrumental orchestra rendition was composed by Samar Das.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/D_0043.HTM | title=Samar Das | publisher=Banglapedia | accessdate=2013-05-13[/tpl] The English translation was done by Syed Ali Ahsan.
