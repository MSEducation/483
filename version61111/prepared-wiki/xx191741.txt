Procaterol, applied as procaterol hydrochloride (USAN), is an intermediate-acting Î²2-adrenergic receptor agonist used for the treatment of asthma. It has never been filed for FDA evaluation in the United States, where it is not marketed. The drug is readily oxidised in the presence of moisture and air, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use by inhalation. Pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis/Warner-Lambert researched a stabilizer to prevent oxidation, but an effective one was never developed.
