==The glutaminolytic pathway==

Glutaminolysis partially recruits reaction steps from the citric acid cycle and the malate-aspartate shuttle.

===Reaction steps from glutamine to α-ketoglutarate===

The conversion of the amino acid glutamine to α-ketoglutarate takes place in two reaction steps:
1. Hydrolysis of the amino group of glutamine yielding glutamate and ammonium.
Catalyzing enzyme: glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2)
2. Glutamate can be excreted or can be further metabolized to α-ketoglutarate.
For the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate three different reactions are possible:
Catalyzing enzymes: 

===Recruited reaction steps of the citric acid cycle and malate aspartate shuttle===

catalyzing enzyme: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex
catalyzing enzyme: succinyl-CoA-synthetase, EC 6.2.1.4
catalyzing enzyme: succinate dehydrogenase, EC 1.3.5.1
catalyzing enzyme: fumarase, EC 4.2.1.2
catalyzing enzyme: malate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.37 (component of the malate aspartate shuttle)
catalyzing enzyme: citrate synthase, EC 2.3.3.1

===Reaction steps from malate to pyruvate and lactate===

The conversion of malate to pyruvate and lactate is catalyzed by
according to the following equations:

==Intracellular compartmentalization of the glutaminolytic pathway==

The reactions of the glutaminolytic pathway take place partly in the mitochondria and to some extent in the cytosol (compare the metabolic scheme of the glutaminolytic pathway).

==Glutaminolysis: an important energy source in tumor cells==

Glutaminolysis takes place in all proliferating cells, such as lymphocytes, thymocytes, colonocytes, adipocytes and especially in tumor cells.[tpl]cite journal|last = Wolfrom |first = C|coauthors = Kadhom N, Polini G, Poggi J, Moatti N and Gautier M |title = Glutamine dependency of human skin fibroblasts:  modulation of hexoses|journal = Exp.

Besides glycolysis in tumor cells glutaminolysis is another main pillar for energy production. High extracellular glutamine concentrations stimulate tumor growth and are essential for cell transformation.[tpl]cite journal|last = Turowski |first = GA|coauthors =  Rashid Z, Hong F, Madri JA and Basson MD|title = Glutamine modulates phenotype and stimulates proliferation in human colon cancer cell lines|journal = Cancer Res. |year = 1994|volume = 54|pages = 5974–5980|pmid = 7954430|issue = 22[/tpl] On the other hand a reduction of glutamine correlates with phenotypical and functional differentiation of the cells.[tpl]cite journal|last = Spittler |first = A|coauthors = Oehler R, Goetzinger P, Holzer S, Reissner CM, Leutmezer J, Rath V, Wrba F, Fuegger R, Boltz-Nitulescu G and Roth E|title = Low glutamine concentrations induce phenotypical and functional differentiation of U937 myelomonocytic cells|journal = J.

===Energy efficacy of glutaminolysis in tumor cells===

Due to low glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities, in tumor cells the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate mainly takes place via glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase.[tpl]cite journal|last = Matsuno |first = T|title = Pathway of glutamate oxidation and its regulation in HuH13 line of human hepatoma cells|journal = J.
