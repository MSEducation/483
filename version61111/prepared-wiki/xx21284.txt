An aerosol is a colloid of fine solid particles or liquid droplets, in air or another gas.Hinds, 1999, p. 3 Examples of aerosols include haze, dust, particulate air pollutants and smoke. The liquid or solid particles have diameter mostly smaller than 1 μm or so; larger particles with a significant settling speed make the mixture a suspension, but the distinction is not clear-cut. In general conversation, aerosol usually refers to an aerosol spray that delivers a consumer product from a can or similar container. Other technological applications of aerosols include dispersal of pesticides, medical treatment of respiratory illnesses, and combustion technology.Hidy, 1984, p. 254. Aerosol science covers generation and removal of aerosols, technological application of aerosols, effects of aerosols on the environment and people, and a wide variety of other topics.

==Definitions==

An aerosol is defined as a colloidal system of solid or liquid particles in a gas. An aerosol includes both the particles and the suspending gas, which is usually air.  Frederick G. Donnan presumably first used the term aerosol during World War I to describe an aero-solution, clouds of microscopic particles in air. This term developed analagously to the term hydrosol, a colloid system with water as the dispersing medium.Hidy, 1984, p. 5 Primary aerosols contain particles introduced directly into the gas; secondary aerosols form through gas-to-particle conversion.Hinds, 1999, p. 8
There are several measures of aerosol concentration. Environmental science and health often uses the mass concentration (M), defined as the mass of particulate matter per unit volume with units such as μg/m3. Also commonly used is the number concentration (N), the number of particles per unit volume with units such as number/m3 or number/cm3.Hinds, 1999, pp. 10-11.
The size of particles has a major influence on their properties, and the aerosol particle radius or diameter (dp) is a key property used to characterise aerosols.
Aerosols vary in their dispersity.  A monodisperse aerosol, producible in the laboratory, contains particles of uniform size.  Most aerosols, however, as polydisperse colloidal systems, exhibit a range of particle sizes.Hinds, 1999, p. 8. Liquid droplets are almost always nearly spherical, but scientists use an equivalent diameter to characterize the properities of various shapes of solid particles, some very irregular. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a spherical particle with the same value of some physical property as the irregular particle.Hinds, 1999, p. 10. The equivalent volume diameter (de) is defined as the diameter of a sphere of the same volume as that of the irregular particle.Hinds, 1999, p. 51. Also commonly used is the aerodynamic diameter.

==Size distribution==

For a monodisperse aerosol, a single number—the particle diameter—suffices to describe the size of the particles. However, more complicated particle-size distributions describe the sizes of the particles in a polydisperse aerosol. This distribution defines the relative amounts of particles, sorted according to size.[tpl]cite journal| last = Jillavenkatesa | first = A | last2 = Dapkunas | first2 = SJ |last3 = Lin-Sien |first3 = Lum| title = Particle Size Characterization | journal = NIST Special Publication | volume = 960-1 |  year = 2001[/tpl] One approach to defining the particle size distribution uses a list of the sizes of every particle in a sample. However, this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use. Another approach splits the complete size range into intervals and finds the number (or proportion) of particles in each interval. One then can visualize these data in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin, usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents.Hinds, 1999, pp. 75-77. If the width of the bins tends to zero, one gets the frequency function:Hinds, 1999, p. 79
where
Therefore, the area under the frequency curve between two sizes a and b represents the total fraction of the particles in that size range:Hinds, 1999, p. 79. 
It can also be formulated in terms of the total number density N:Hidy, 1984, p. 58
Assuming spherical aerosol particles, the aerosol surface area per unit volume (S) is given by the second moment:
And the third moment gives the total volume concentration (V) of the particles:
One also usefully can approximate the particle size distribution using a mathematical function. The normal distribution usually does not suitably describe particle size distributions in aerosols because of the skewness associated a long tail of larger particles. Also for a quantity that varies over a large range, as many aerosol sizes do, the width of the distribution implies negative particles sizes, clearly not physically realistic. However, the normal distribution can be suitable for some aerosols, such as test aerosols, certain pollen grains and spores.Hinds, 1999, p 90.
A more widely chosen log-normal distribution gives the number frequency as:
where:
The log-normal distribution has no negative values, can cover a wide range of values, and fits many observed size distributions reasonably well.Hinds, 1999, p 91.
Other distributions sometimes used to characterise particle size include: the Rosin-Rammler distribution, applied to coarsely dispersed dusts and sprays; the Nukiyama-Tanasawa distribution, for sprays of extremely broad size ranges; the power function distribution, occasionally applied to atmospheric aerosols; the exponential distribution, applied to powdered materials; and for cloud droplets, the Khrgian-Mazin distribution.Hinds, 1999, p 104-5

==Physics==

===Terminal velocity of a particle in a fluid===

For low values of the Reynolds number (where
This allows us to calculate the terminal velocity of a particle undergoing gravitational settling in still air. Neglecting buoyancy effects, we find:Hinds, 1999, p. 49
where
The terminal velocity can also be derived for other kinds of forces. If Stokes' law holds, then the resistance to motion is directly proportional to speed. The constant of proportionality is the mechanical mobility (B) of a particle:Hinds, 1999, p. 47
A particle traveling at any reasonable initial velocity approaches its terminal velocity exponentially with an e-folding time equal to the relaxation time:Hinds, 1991, p 115.
where:
To account for the effect of the shape of non-spherical particles, a correction factor known as the dynamic shape factor is applied to Stokes' law. It is defined as the ratio of the resistive force of the irregular particle to that of a spherical particle with the same volume and velocity:Hinds, 1991, p. 51
where:

===Aerodynamic diameter===

The aerodynamic diameter of an irregular particle is defined as the diameter of the spherical particle with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and the same settling velocity as the irregular particle.Hinds, 1999, p. 53.
Neglecting the slip correction, the particle settles at the terminal velocity proportional to the square of the aerodynamic diameter, da:
where 
This equation gives the aerodynamic diameter:Hinds, 1999, p. 54.
One can apply the aerodynamic diameter to particulate pollutants or to inhaled drugs to predict where in the respiratory tract such particles deposit. Pharmaceutical companies typically use aerodymanic diameter, not geometric diameter, to characterize particles in inhalable drugs. [tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===Dynamics===

The previous discussion focussed on single aerosol particles. In contrast, aerosol dynamics explains the evolution of complete aerosol populations. The concentrations of particles will change over time as  a result of many processes. External processes that move particles outside a volume of gas under study include diffusion, gravitational settling, and electric charges and other external forces that cause particle migration.  A second set of processes internal to a given volume of gas include particle formation (nucleation), evaporation, chemical reaction, and coagulation.Hidy, 1984, p. 60
A differential equation called the Aerosol General Dynamic Equation (GDE) characterizes the evolution of the number density of particles in an aerosol due to these processes.
Change in time = Convective transport + brownian diffusion + gas-particle interactions + coagulation + migration by external forces
Where:

====Coagulation====

As particles and droplets in an aerosol collide with one another, they may undergo coalescence or aggregation. This process leads to a change in the aerosol particle-size distribution, with the mode increasing in diameter as total number of particles decreases.Hinds, 1999, p. 260  On occasion, particles may shatter apart into numerous smaller particles; however, this process usually occurs primarily in particles too large for consideration as aerosols.

====Dynamics regimes====

The Knudsen number of the particle define three different dynamical regimes that govern the behaviour of an aerosol:
where a is the particle radius, P∞ and PA are the pressures far from the droplet and at the surface of the droplet respectively, kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, CA is mean thermal velocity and α is mass accommodation coefficient.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The derivation of this equation assumes constant pressure and constant  diffusion coefficient.
Particles are in the continuum regime when Kn where a is the radius of the particle A, MA is the molecular mass of the particle A, DAB is the diffusion coefficient between particles A and B, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature (in absolute units like kelvin), and PA∞ and PAS are the pressures at infinite and at the surface respectively.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The transition regime contains all the particles in between the free molecular and continuum regimes or Kn ≈ 1. The forces experienced by a particle are a complex combination of interactions with individual gas molecules and macroscopic interactions. The semi-empirical equation describing mass flux is:
where Icont is the mass flux in the continuum regime.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] This formula is called the Fuchs-Sutugin interpolation formula. These equations do not take into account the heat release effect.

====Partitioning====

Aerosol partitioning theory governs condensation on and evaporation from an aerosol surface, respectively. Condensation of mass causes the mode of the particle-size distributions of the aerosol to increase; conversely, evaporation causes the mode to decrease. Nucleation is the process of forming aerosol mass from the condensation of a gaseous precursor, specifically a vapour. Net condensation of the vapour requires supersaturation, a partial pressure greater than its vapour pressure. This can happen for three reasons:[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
There are two types of nucleation processes. Gases preferentially condense onto surfaces of pre-existing aerosol particles, known as heterogeneous nucleation. This process causes the diameter at the mode of particle-size distribution to increase with constant number concentration.Hinds, 1999, p.288 With sufficiently high supersaturation and no suitable surfaces, particles may condense in the absence of a pre-existing surface, known as homogeneous nucleation. This results in the addition of very small, rapidly growing particles to the particle-size distribution.

====Activation====

Water coats particles in an aerosols, making them activated, usually in the context of forming a cloud droplet.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Following the Kelvin equation (based on the curvature of liquid droplets), smaller particles need a higher ambient relative humidity to maintain equilibrium than larger particles do.  The following formula gives relative humidity at equilibrium:
Kelvin equation for saturation vapor pressure above a curved surface is:
where  rp droplet radius, σ surface tension of droplet, ρ density of liquid, M molar mass, T temperature, and R molar gas constant.

====Solution to the General Dynamic Equation====

There are no general solutions to the general dynamic equation (GDE);Hidy, 1984, p62 common methods used to solve the general dynamic equation include:[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

Some devices for generating aerosols are:

==Detection==

Aerosol can either be measured in-situ or with remote sensing techniques.

===In situ observations===

Some available in situ measurement techniques include:

===Remote sensing approach===

Remote sensing approaches include:

===Size selective sampling===

Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper within the respiratory tract (from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles), or in the alveolar region.Hinds, 1999, p.233 The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the in the respiratory system strongly determines the health effects of exposure to such aerosols.Hinds, 1999, p. 233 This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system.Hinds, 1999, p. 249 Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway.Hinds, 1999, p. 244 The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter.Hinds, 1999, p. 246 The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region.Hinds, 1999, p. 254 The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region.Hinds, 1999, p. 250 To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.Hinds, 1999, p. 252
Two alternative size selective criteria, often used in atmospheric monitoring are PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 is defined by ISO as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cut-off at 10 μm aerodynamic diameter.  PM10 corresponds to the “thoracic convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, Clause 6 and PM2.5 as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cut-off at 2,5 μm aerodynamic diameter.  PM2,5 corresponds to the “high-risk respirable convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, 7.1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://diamondenv.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/particulate-pollution-pm10-and-pm2-5/|title=Particulate pollution – PM10 and PM2.5|work=Recognition, Evaluation, Control. News and views from Diamond Environmental Limited|accessdate=23 September 2012[/tpl] The United States Environmental Protection Agency replaced the older standards for particulate matter based on Total Suspended Particulate with another standard based on PM10 in 1987[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/aqtrnd95/pm10.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM-10)|accessdate=23 September 2012[/tpl] and then introduced standards for PM2.5 (also known as fine particulate matter) in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pmdesignations/basicinfo.htm|title=Basic Information|accessdate=23 September 2012[/tpl]
