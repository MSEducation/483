He reached the temporary rank of Vice Admiral but was allowed to retire in 1987 at the lower rank of Rear Admiral as a result of his role in the Iran–Contra affair.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-03/news/mn-7536_1_navy-regulations|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Poindexter Opts for Demotion, to Stay in Navy|date=March 3, 1987[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Chang |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.nytimes.com/keyword/vice-admiral |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01[/tpl]

==U.S. Executive branch service==

Poindexter went on to serve in the Reagan administration as Military Assistant, from 1981 to 1983, as Deputy National Security Advisor from 1983 to 1985, and as National Security Advisor from 1985 to 1986.

Major events in which he played a significant role for the executive branch included the Strategic Defense Initiative, Operation Urgent Fury, the Achille Lauro incident, Operation El Dorado Canyon (in response to Libyan terrorist attacks), the Reykjavík Summit with the Soviets.

===Iran–Contra affair===

The Iran-Contra affair resulted from the discovery of the United States' involvement in sending money and weapons to Iran for the release of American hostages from Lebanon, and sending aid to the Contras. This involvement was in violation of the Boland Amendment, which prevented the United States from directly or indirectly being involved with the Contras.[tpl]cite book|title=Out of Many|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-949760-9|pages=956, 957[/tpl] Evidence revealed that Poindexter was a leader in the organization of the transfer of the weapons to Iran and oversaw other people involved in the affair, such as Oliver North. 
Poindexter and North communicated through a channel, known as the "Private Blank Check," that Poindexter set up on a National Security Council (NSC) computer. Through this system, Poindexter and North were able to send messages back and forth without being intercepted by other NSC staff members. This system was not successful. Even though both Poindexter and North attempted to delete the messages, the White House Communications Agency was able to recover some of them,  later used in trying Poindexter and North. On November 25, 1986, after the public disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair, Poindexter was forced to resign from his position as National Security Advisor, [tpl]cite web|title=Chapter 3: United States v. John M. Poindexter|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_03.htm|publisher=Federation of American Scientists[/tpl] 
Poindexter was convicted on April 7, 1990, of five counts of lying to Congress and obstructing the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra Affair, which were investigating the Reagan Administration's covert arms sales to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to insurgents fighting the Marxist Government in Nicaragua. The convictions were reversed in 1991 on appeal[tpl]cite web|author=By LINDA GREENHOUSEPublished: December 08, 1992 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/08/us/supreme-court-roundup-iran-contra-appeal-refused-by-court.html |title=Supreme Court Roundup; Iran-Contra Appeal Refused by Court - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1992-12-08 |accessdate=2013-02-01[/tpl] on the grounds that several witnesses against him had been influenced by his testimony before Congress, even though Congress had given him immunity for that testimony.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=David|title=Poindexter Wins Iran-Contra Case in Appeals Court|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-poindexter.html|accessdate=2013-07-26|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1991-11-16[/tpl]

==Defense contractor work==

From 1988 to 1989, Poindexter was senior scientist at Presearch, Inc., which had primarily been involved with defense studies and analysis. Faced with anticipated defense budget reductions, Poindexter joined the firm to develop new commercial enterprises. He designed and developed hardware and software for the prototype of a digital real-time, imaging system to be used for physical security of high value facilities. It was used to obtain a contract for a nuclear power plant security system.
From 1990 to 1996, Poindexter served as co-founder of TP Systems, Inc., a software development firm specializing in commercial software for the IBM PCs and compatibles; Poindexter was the chief designer and programmer. Development included a symbolic debugger for multi-tasking environments, a BBS communications program, and numerous utility programs.
From 1993 to 1996, Poindexter served as a consultant to Elkins Group. Elkins was a business alliance with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which has developed the Elkins Interactive Training Network (EITN), a satellite based training delivery system. Poindexter was the chairman of the Maritime Advisory Committee and a member of Elkins' board of directors. He also provided advice on strategic planning.
From 1996 to 2002 Poindexter served as senior vice president for SYNTEK Technologies. SYNTEK is a small high technology firm with contracts in domestic and international defense and commercial business. Poindexter was responsible for high-level advice on management and direction of information systems projects (for example Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Project Genoa).
Currently he serves on the board of Saffron Technology Inc, which he joined in 2000, and Bright Planet Corporation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightplanet.com/about-us/board-of-directors |title=Board of Directors |publisher=Brightplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01[/tpl] which he joined in 2007. With Saffron, Poindexter played a role in Iraq, building a tool to run entity analysis on insurgent networks in the struggle against IEDs.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|first=Shane|title=The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=London|isbn=1-101-195332-0|page=281[/tpl]
After 2007 Poindexter branched out from National Security and worked to promote Associative Memory Base technology to civilian government agencies such as the IRS for fraud detection.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|first=Shane|title=The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Group|location=London|isbn=1-101-195332-0|page=321[/tpl]

==Recall to public service==

Late in 2001, upon the recommendation of Science Applications International Corporation executive Brian Hicks, then Vice President Dick Cheney recommended Admiral Poindexter to head a separate anti-terrorist office and serve under US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

===Information Awareness Office===

From January 2002 to August 2003, Poindexter served as the Director of the DARPA Information Awareness Office (IAO). The mission of the IAO was to imagine, develop, apply, integrate, demonstrate and transition information technologies, components, and prototype closed-loop information systems. This aimed to counter asymmetric threats (most notably, terrorist threats) by achieving total information awareness and thus aiding preemption; national security warning; and, national security decision making.

===Policy Analysis Market===

Poindexter faced criticism from the media and some politicians about the Policy Analysis Market project, a theoretical prediction market that would have rewarded participants for accurately predicting geopolitical trends in the Middle East and elsewhere. This was portrayed in the media as allowing participants to profit from the assassination of heads of state and acts of terrorism due to such events being mentioned on illustrative sample screens showing the interface.[tpl]cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Pam, Prism, and Poindexter| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/07/pam-prism-and-poindexter.html |work=Spying| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=4 January 2014| date=7 July 2013 |location=Washington[/tpl] The controversy over the proposed futures market led to a Congressional audit of the IAO in general.  Funding for the IAO was subsequently cut and Poindexter retired from DARPA on August 12, 2003.

==Family==

His wife, Linda Poindexter, was an Episcopal priest for 13 years, but retired from the clergy when she converted to Roman Catholicism. They have five children, including the late Alan G. Poindexter, a NASA astronaut, Space Shuttle pilot on the STS-122 mission to the International Space Station, and the commander of STS-131.
