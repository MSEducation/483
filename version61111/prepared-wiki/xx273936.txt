Orlando Phidelio Boss was a Corporal in Company F, 25th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He received Medal of Honor for his bravery at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia on June 3, 1864. Prior to rescuing Lieutenant Daly of his regiment, he had dragged another wounded comrade to safety among the enemy fire. He had then appealed to his brigade commander, General George J. Stannard, for permission to rescue the Lieutenant. General Stannard consented, and Private Boss succeeded in bringing the wounded office despite a torrent of enemy gunfire that erupted at him during his deed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html|title=Civil War|publisher=History.Army[/tpl]
