==History==

The history of Shendish Manor goes back to the 13th century when Ralf de Chenduit was granted land in the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/local/story-of-shendish-1-1192391|title=The Story of Shendish|publisher=Hemel Today|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] Ralf de Chenduit's family built a manor on the site in about 1300; it passed to Richard and Alice Parker in about 1364, to John Cheyne, the local squire, in about 1560 and then to John Beale, a London grocer, in about 1650. It changed hands many times before coming into the ownership of Charles Longman, a publisher, in 1853. It passed down the Longman family and was used as a British Army camp during World War I.[tpl]cite web|url=http://swpp.co.uk/wedding_venues/3630.htm|title=Shendish Manor|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] Henry Longman sold the property in 1936 to John Dickinson Stationery who used it as a sports and social club. In 1994 it became a hotel and conference centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shendish-manor.com/|title=Shendish Manor|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
