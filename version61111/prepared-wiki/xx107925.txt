==Plot==

When Marge catches Bart vandalizing a town sidewalk by writing his name in wet cement, she lectures him on the importance of town pride. Afterwards, Bart realizes how wonderful it is living in Springfield. Consequently, however, Bart also becomes upset with anti-Springfield sentiments coming from the neighboring town of Shelbyville. Grampa explains that this rivalry can be traced back to the establishment of the two towns. This occurred when the founders Jebediah Springfield and Shelbyville Manhattan discovered they had irreconcilable differences regarding their visions for a perfect town, Springfield favoring promotion of chastity and Shelbyville advocating incestuous marriages between cousins.
The next day, Springfield's lemon tree is stolen by a couple of boys from Shelbyville. Taking his town pride to heart and swearing to keep it, Bart leads Milhouse, Nelson, Martin, Todd, and Database into Shelbyville to search for the tree and bring it back to Springfield. The group splits up and has a few misadventures. Bart goes undercover and infiltrates the children of Shelbyville by disguising himself. However, he is unable to obtain any information. Eventually, the Springfield children track down the tree to an impound lot (where one of the boys that stole the tree lives).
Back in Springfield, Homer, using Ned Flanders' RV, leads the fathers to find the boys. When the two groups meet, the boys tell their fathers of the tree being stolen, convincing them to help recover it. At the impound lot, the fathers demand the return of the tree, while the owner of the impound lot refuses and taunts them. Using a plan similar to the Trojan Horse, Bart steers the RV to the outside of the hospital. The RV is taken to the impound lot after it is found parked outside the hospital. When night falls, the Springfieldian boys and their fathers get out of the RV and tie the tree to the top. They are caught in the middle of this act by the owner but manage to escape. The tree, though considerably damaged during the escape, is returned to Springfield. The children of Springfield celebrate with lemonade, while those in Shelbyville drink turnip juice, much to their disgust.

==Production==

Brent Forrester wrote "Lemon of Troy", his second episode of The Simpsons. Jim Reardon directed it. Early on in the production stage, the writers decided that the leader of the Shelbyville children, Shelby, and his father should be modeled after Bart and Homer. Shelby's voice was provided by Tress MacNeille, and Shelby's father was voiced by Hank Azaria, who based his performance on Walter Matthau. Dan Castellaneta originally based his performance of Homer on Matthau.
The writers wanted to have the Springfield children find an area of Springfield that was not decimated, and the animators designed a version of Springfield that was very idyllic. They drew several scenes of the children running through non-polluted streams and woodlands.[tpl]cite video |people=David, Mirkin |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Lemon of Troy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] The animators gave Shelbyville's nature a more dark feeling in comparison to Springfield.[tpl]cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Lemon of Troy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]

==Cultural references==

In the episode, Milhouse recites a slightly paraphrased line from Prince's 1984 song "When Doves Cry".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page24.shtml |title=Lemon of Troy |accessdate=2008-03-28 |author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC[/tpl] Bart identifies the number seven in Roman numerals by referring to a nonexistent sequel of the Rocky series, Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge. The scene with Bart and his team sitting on a hill above the enemy camp and looking down at the captured tree being circled by children on bicycles bears a resemblance to an early scene in Mad Max 2.
thumb|The method of recovery of the lemon tree is a reference to the legend of the Trojan Horse.The overall plot structure of Springfield residents attacking their neighboring rivals after they steal their prize possession is a reference to the legend of the Trojan War, in which the incentive for the Greeks declaring war on their Trojan neighbors is the abduction of their most famous and beautiful female citizen, Helen. The title of the episode is a play on her name. The method of recovery of the tree is an echo of the Trojan Horse (a fact lost on Homer, who gleefully exclaims that "no one in history has ever done anything this clever").[tpl]cite news |title=Linger At A Quiet Spot And You Can Conjure Up A Hero |date=May 2, 2004 |page=|publisher=The Mail on Sunday |author=Gareth Huw Davies[/tpl] Retrieved on September 23, 2008.
While Shelby's father is towing Ned Flanders' RV, he can be heard singing "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong.
