===20th and 21st centuries===

In the early 20th century, purple, green and white were the colors of the Women's Suffrage movement, which sought to win the right to vote for women.  Later, in the 1970s, in a tribute to the Suffragettes, it became the color of the women's liberation movement.Eva Heller,  Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques, image 75–76.
In the 1960s,  it was also associated with hallucinogenic drugs, and with the music of Jimi Hendrix, particularly the 1967 song Purple Haze.   Later, in the 1980s, it was featured in the song and album Purple Rain (1984) by the American musician Prince.
The violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders.   It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie, and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders.

==In science==

===Optics===

Violet is at one end of the spectrum of visible light, between blue and the invisible ultraviolet.  It has the shortest wavelength of all the visible colors.  It is the color the eye sees looking at light with a wavelength of between 380 and 450 nanometers.
In the traditional color wheel used by painters, violet and purple lie between red and blue.  Violet is inclined toward blue, while purple is inclined toward red.
Violet colors composed by mixing blue and red light are within the purple colors[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07238.html |title=Color Wheel |author=M. Roll|date=8 September 2012 |work=Colorado State University[/tpl] (the word "purple" is used in the common sense for any color between blue and red).  In color theory, a purple is a color along the line of purples on the CIE chromaticity diagram and excludes violet. Violet light from the rainbow, which can be referred as spectral violet, has only short wavelengths.
Violet objects are objects that reflect violet light. Objects reflecting spectral violet often appear dark, because human vision is relatively insensitive to those wavelengths. Monochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color shown below as electric violet.

===Chemistry – pigments and dyes===

The earliest violet pigments used by humans, found in prehistoric cave paintings, were made from the minerals manganese and hematite.  Manganese is still used today by the Aranda people, a group of indigenous Australians, as a traditional pigment  for coloring the skin during rituals. It is also used by the Hopi Indians of Arizona to color ritual objects.
The most famous violet-purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple, made from a type of sea snail called the murex, found around the Mediterranean.
In western Polynesia, residents of the islands made a violet dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin.  In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the purpura, found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua.  The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, and the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.Anne Carichon (2000), Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples. p. 133.
During the Middle Ages, most artists made purple or violet on their paintings by combining red and blue pigments;  usually blue azurite or lapis-lazuili with red ochre, cinnabar or minium.   They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using woad or indigo dye for the blue, and dye made from cochineal for the red.
Mixing of two different colors to dye clothing was considered unnatural and diabolic in Medieval times.   Those  who dyed blue fabric and red fabric were members of different guilds, and were forbidden to dye any other colors than those of their own guild.  Most violet fabric was made by the dyers who worked with red, and who used dye from madder or cochineal, so Medieval violet colors were inclined toward red.
Orcein, or purple moss, was another common violet dye.  It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews,  was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer's moss (Roccella tinctoria), combined with an ammoniac,  usually urine.   Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century,  when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.Anne Carichon (2000), Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples. p. 144.
Violet dyes for the clothing of common people from the Middle Ages onward were also made from the blackberry or other red fruit of the genus rubus, or from the mulberry.  All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish, and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight.
A popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the logwood tree (Haematoxylum campechianum), which grew in Spanish Mexico.  Depending on the different minerals added to the dye, it produced a blue, red, black or, with the addition of alum, a violet dye. It made a fine color, but, like earlier dyes, it did not resist sunlight or washing.
In the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes.  Two synthetic  purple dyes were invented at about the same time.  Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk, without the use of mordant.  Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3–4 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.
French purple was developed in France at about the same time.  The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with calcium chloride; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.
Cobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century,  and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue, cerulean blue  and cobalt green.  It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists.
Mauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin's mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously in 1856.  
Its chemical name is
3-amino-2,±9-dimethyl-5-phenyl-7-(p-tolylamino)phenazinium acetate.
In the 1950s, a new family of violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridone came onto the market. It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthetized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to violet in color, and have the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing, and are used in oil paints, water colors, and acrylics, as well as in automobile coatings and other industrial coatings.
