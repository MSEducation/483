The 1992 Big Bear earthquake occurred at 08:05 PDT local time (15:05 UTC) on June 28, 1992 in Big Bear Lake, California, with a Richter magnitude of 6.5,[tpl]cite news |first=Diane |last=LaMacchia |title=Yucca Valley earthquake surprised experts |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/yucca-valley-earthquake.html |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |date=July 17, 1992 |accessdate=November 4, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012013512/http://lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/yucca-valley-earthquake.html| archivedate= October 12, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Destructive) on the Mercalli intensity scale.

This earthquake occurred three hours after the 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake, which was centered [tpl]convert|22|mi|km[/tpl] to the east.  The closely timed occurrence of these earthquakes is an often-cited example of a regional earthquake sequence.[tpl]cite web|title=Static-stress impact of the 1992 Landers earthquake sequence on nucleation and slip at the site of the 1999 M=7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, southern California|author=Tom Parsons|author2=Douglas S.
