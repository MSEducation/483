[[Ose (demon)]]

CATEGORIES: Demons, Goetic demons

In demonology, Ose is a Great President of Hell, ruling three legions of demons (thirty to other authors, and Pseudomonarchia Daemonum gives no number of legions). He makes men wise in all liberal sciences and gives true answers concerning divine and secret things; he also brings insanity to any person the conjurer wishes, making him/her believe that he/she is the creature or thing the magician desired, or makes that person think he is a king and wearing a crown, or a Pope.
Ose is depicted as a leopard that after a while changes into a man.
His name seems to derive from Latin 'os', mouth, language, or 'osor', that who abhors.
Other spellings: Os√©, Oze, Oso, Voso.
