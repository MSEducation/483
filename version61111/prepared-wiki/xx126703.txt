Belfast Harlequins is a multi-sports club located off the Malone Road in south Belfast, Northern Ireland. The club name provides the overall umbrella for rugby union, men's and ladies' hockey and squash. The club is associated on and off the field with Methodist College Belfast (MCB).

==Background of the club==

Belfast Harlequins was formed in 1999 with the merger of Collegians, North of Ireland Cricket Club and North of Ireland Football Club. The former clubs were three of the oldest and most distinguished clubs in Ireland. "North" sold its famous ground at Ormeau - one of the earliest international rugby venues See references to Ireland's matches against Scotland from 1877 to 1889: Ireland v Scotland - Head to Head Statistics - to pay for the redevelopment of the Deramore Park facilities.
The club uses a version of the Maltese cross that MCB uses as its sports logo, with the colours being those of navy, sky blue, red and maroon. The North colours were traditionally red, blue and black, with Collegians using navy, white and maroon.
At two extraordinary general meetings held simultaneously in both North and Collegians, the members of both clubs voted to proceed with the merger to form the new club, Belfast Harlequins. As of 12.00 midnight, 18 November 1999, Belfast Harlequins came into existence. The first annual general meeting of the new club took place in March 2000. The new clubhouse at Deramore was opened in June 2002 by the then club president, Alison Watt, along with Jack Kyle OBE and Gilbert Paton.
On and off the field, all three sections of the Belfast Harlequins set-up have been successful. Pictures and memorabilia of both clubs and grounds is placed around the bar area and throughout the club. There is an active social scene, many parties and events take place throughout the season.

==Grounds==

Deramore is located in the heart of south Belfast, flanked by the River Lagan and Lagan Meadows to the east and south, and overlooked to the north and west by large detached homes.
Deramore Park was the home to Collegians (and of Methodist College from 1919 until the school purchased Pirrie Park from Harland & Wolff in 1932). Deramore Park was bequested in trust for the use of the former pupils of Methody for its life by Mr C W Neill in 1941. A special board of trustees exists today in the name of C W Neill, and its consent was required for the merger in 1999, to allow the continued use of Deramore Park by the new club.
Deramore Park has one squash court, three rugby pitches, one cricket pitch, one synthetic hockey pitch, a two-bedroom apartment and one bowling green which Belfast Bowling Club owns and plays on.
In the summer of 2006, Belfast Harlequins hosted several sports in the Special Olympics Ireland Games. The games were held in Belfast for the first time in their history.
Deramore Park was a venue for the 2007 Under 19 Rugby World Championship, which was hosted in Belfast.

==Cricket==

Collegians Cricket Club had merged with Cooke Cricket Club to form Cooke Collegians in 1998, and so the Belfast Harlequins Cricket Club was effectively a continuation of North. In 2005, however, the cricket section left the Harlequins set-up and now plays at Stormont under the name of Civil Service North of Ireland.

==Hockey==

The Harlequins hockey sections essentially are that of Collegians as North of Ireland did not have a hockey section since prior to World War I.
In September 1967, Collegians Men's Hockey Club played and won its first ever competitive fixture, with a 1-0 win against Gallaher. In the first season promotion to the Intermediate League was secured with an unbeaten record in the league. This success was carried over to the 1968-69 season and the Intermediate League was again won. However, a restructuring of the leagues meant that the 1st XI had to win the League for the second year in succession to receive promotion to Senior League Section 2. The overall playing record in the first season was played 26, won 22, drawn 1, lost 3. They scored 111 goals and conceded 3.Ireland's Saturday Night ?/03/1983
In their first season in Senior hockey, they were pipped for promotion by one point, remaining unbeaten (Played 18, won 8, drew 10). However, the following year promotion to the top section in the Senior League was achieved. The team finished level on points with Annadale, winning a test match by two goals to one to gain their place in Senior League One.
