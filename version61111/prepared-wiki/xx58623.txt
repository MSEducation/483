The Straits of Tiran ([tpl]lang-ar|مضيق تيران[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Maḍyaq Tīrān[/tpl]), are the narrow sea passages, about [tpl]convert|13|km|nmi|0|abbr=in|lk=out[/tpl] wide, between the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas which separate the Gulf of Aqaba from the Red Sea. It is named after Tiran Island located at its inflow, on which the Multinational Force and Observers has an observation post to monitor the compliance of Egypt in maintaining freedom of navigation of the straits as provided under the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty.[tpl]or|date=September 2013[/tpl] 
Sanafir Island lies to the east of Tiran, southeast of the shallow strait between Tiran and Saudi Arabia.
Access to Jordan's only seaport of Aqaba and to Israel's only Red Sea seaport of Eilat is contingent upon passage through the Gulf of Aqaba, giving the Straits of Tiran strategic importance. Egypt's blockade of the Straits to Israeli ships and ships bound for Israel in 1956 and again in 1967 was a catalyst, respectively, to the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War.[tpl]cite book |first=Michael B. |last=Oren |title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-19-515174-7 [/tpl] Despite this, according to Major General Indar Jit Rikhye, military adviser to the United Nations Secretary General, the accusation of a blockade was "questionable," pointing out that an Israeli-flagged ship had not passed through the straits in two years, and that "The U.A.R. Egyptian navy had searched a couple of ships after the establishment of the blockade and thereafter relaxed its implementation."[tpl]cite book |first=Indar Jit |last=Rikhye |title=The Sinai Blunder: Withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force Leading to the Six-Day War of June 1967 |location=London |publisher=Rutledge |year=1980 |isbn= 0-7146-3136-1 [/tpl] However, Israel viewed the Straits of Tiran as a vital interest as it's where Israel received vital imports, mainly oil from Iran, and it threatened Israel's ability to develop the Negev.http://books.google.com/books?id=oUSbvWDgYucC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=israel+exports+straits+of+tiran&source=bl&ots=O7K5VdVC5W&sig=LmTJ_FYlvd92wz2XybPzLRwEyCU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DgmdUaOlMMG4rQH2joDwBQ&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=israel%20exports%20straits%20of%20tiran&f=false
International documents inconsistently refer to both the "Straits of Tiran" and the "Strait of Tiran".  There are several passages formed by the islands between Egypt and Saudi Arabia.  The westernmost strait, between Egypt and the island of Tiran, overlooked by the Egyptian city Sharm el-Sheikh is the "Strait of Tiran". It has two passages deep enough to be navigable by large ships. The Enterprise passage, [tpl]convert|290|m|ft[/tpl] deep, is adjacent to the Egyptian side, while the [tpl]convert|73|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] deep Grafton passage, surrounded by shallows, is to the east, nearer to the island of Tiran.  To the east of Tiran, between it and Saudi Arabia, the other strait has reefs and shallows with a single channel [tpl]convert|16|m|ft[/tpl] deep.[ref]

A project to build a [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|1|adj=on|sing=on[/tpl] bridge across the straits, linking Egypt and Saudi Arabia, is under consideration by the Egyptian government (see Saudi–Egypt Causeway).Najla Moussa.
