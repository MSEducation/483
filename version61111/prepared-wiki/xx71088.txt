CATEGORIES: Farm to Market Roads in Texas, Roads in the United States, Types of roads

In the United States, a farm-to-market road or ranch-to-market road (sometimes farm road or ranch road for short) is a state road or county road that connects rural or agricultural areas to market towns. These are better quality roads, usually a highway, that farmers and ranchers use to transport products to market towns or distribution centers.
Specifically, in the state of Texas, the terms Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road indicate roadways that are part of the state's system of secondary and connecting routes, built and maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Texas established this system in 1949 to provide access to rural areas. The system consists primarily of paved, two-lane roads. Generally, roads west of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|281[/tpl] (or Interstate 35 in some locations) are designated Ranch to Market Roads, while those east of US 281 are designated Farm to Market Roads—though there are exceptions to this naming system, such as [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|RM|2588[/tpl] in Henderson County in East Texas or [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1215[/tpl] in Reeves County West Texas.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Texas Department of Transportation |author=Staff |url=http://www.dot.state.tx.us/tpp/hwy/fmfacts.htm|title=Farm/Ranch to Market Facts |accessdate=February 26, 2008 [/tpl]  Oddly, Erath, Comanche, Brown and several other counties along and west of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|281[/tpl] also appear to be exceptions to this rule, using Farm to Market designations primarily, if not exclusively. Some segments are even expressways, including a segment of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1764[/tpl] (the Emmett F. Lowry Expressway between Interstate 45 and Texas City, Texas). 
These roads are signed with route markers that contain the words FARM ROAD or RANCH ROAD, but the formal name is Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road (hence the abbreviation "FM" and "RM" on signs). The only road that explicitly uses the name Ranch Road is Ranch Road 1, which runs near the former ranch home of former President Lyndon B. Johnson.
As with other state-maintained highways in Texas, all Farm or Ranch to Market roads are paved. Speed limits along these roads vary, but may be as high as 75 mph in rural areas, such as in Andrews and Pecos Counties (for example, along [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1788[/tpl], [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1776[/tpl], and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1053[/tpl]).

==History==

The first farm to market road in Texas was completed in January 1937. It connected Mount Enterprise and the former community of Shiloh in Rusk County. The route was [tpl]convert|5.8|mi|km[/tpl] long and was constructed at a cost of $48,015.12. This route is now part of Texas State Highway 315. The first highway officially designated as [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1[/tpl] was authorized in 1941, connecting [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|96[/tpl] near Pineland to a sawmill belonging to the Temple Lumber Company.[tpl]TxDOT|FM|1|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Burka |first= Paul |date=April 1983|title=Texas Primer: The Farm-to-Market Road|journal=Texas Monthly|volume=11|issue=4 |page=134|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8SwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA122&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
In 1945, the highway commission authorized a three-year pilot program for the construction of [tpl]convert|7205|mi|km[/tpl] of farm-to-market roadway, with cost shared equally by the state and federal governments.[tpl]cite news |title=Texas to improve farm to market roads|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RX1LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JSQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4709,493868 |newspaper=Harper Herald|date=June 15, 1945 |page=3|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] As the program grew, efforts were made by legislators from rural areas, including State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Amarillo, to expand the farm-to-market road network in the late 1940s.[tpl]cite newspaper |last=Followwill-Line|first=Robyn|title=Grady Hazlewood|newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/051900/his_hazlewood.html|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] The funding was to have come from an increase in the gasoline tax, as proposed by State Senator Grover Morris in 1947; however, this measure was stymied by lobbyists, who indicated that such funding should go to arterial routes.[tpl]cite journal |last=Smith |first= Griffin Jr. |date=April 1974 |title=The Highway Establishment and How It Grew |journal=Texas Monthly |volume=2 ||issue=4 |page=86[/tpl] Nonetheless, the popularity of the program and the perceived need to connect the vast, isolated central and western areas of the state prompted the passing of the Colson-Briscoe Act in 1949, sponsored by State Senator E. Neveille Colson and State Representative Dolph Briscoe.[tpl]cite web |author=Texas Transportation Institute |publisher= Texas A&M University System |url=http://tti.tamu.edu/hall_of_honor/inductees/2005.htm |title=Texas Transportation Hall of Honor: Inductees: 2005 |accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] This legislation appropriated funding for the creation of an extensive system of secondary roads to provide access to the rural areas of the state and to allow farmers and ranchers to bring their goods to market, reserving a flat $15 million per year plus 1 cent per gallon of gasoline sold in the state for local highway construction. In 1962, the Texas legislature increased this amount to no less than $23 million annually, through federal fund matching, and expanded the farm-to-market system from [tpl]convert|35000|to|50000|mi|km[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |last=Kite |first=Kirk |title=Highway Development |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/erh02 |accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Texas Department of Transportation|title=TxDOT History: 1970 to 1951|url=http://www.txdot.gov/about_us/1970_1951.htm|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] The system now accounts for over half of the mileage in the Texas Department of Transportation system.

==Identification==

Signs designating a Farm to Market or Ranch to Market road are a black square background containing a white shape of the state of Texas, with the words "FARM ROAD" or "RANCH ROAD" appearing in white text on the background and the route number in black text within the shape of Texas. Guide signs (the large green signs usually found along highways in the United States) designating these roads use a simple white rectangle with the abbreviation "F.M." or "R.M." and the route number appearing below the abbreviation in black text.[tpl]cite book|author=Texas Department of Transportation|title=Freeway Signing Handbook|date=October 2008|pages=4-9–4-10|url=http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/fsh/index.htm|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl]
As a result of population growth and the expansion of urban areas, many Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads that originally served rural areas now serve urban areas, sometimes exclusively. An effort was made to rename such roads "Urban Roads" in 1995, but residents opposed the effort, arguing that removing the "Farm" and "Ranch" from the designations was "un-Texan," and that the cost of changing signage was not justified. Other than a few route markers, such as on [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1315[/tpl] near Victoria, most signs were not changed, and TxDOT abandoned the idea to do so.[tpl]cite news |last=Hughes |first= Sharon |title=Highway officials nix urban road designation|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pSVSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DjYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1946,2751619 |newspaper=Victoria Advocate |agency=Associated Press |date=July 16, 1995 |accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl] However, though the Farm to Market and Ranch to Market designations remain in place on route signage, the state does continue to track these urban roads separately in its highway designation files. For example, the mileage of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|544[/tpl] in the Plano area was transferred from FM 544 to UR 544 in 1995.[tpl]TxDOT|FM|544|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|UR|544|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl] As part of the state highway system, Urban Roads are eligible for state maintenance; however, unlike rural Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads, they do not receive state funding for expansion.[tpl]cite news |last=Babineck |first= Mark |title=Tex-Arcana: What's a farm-to-market road?|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5065822.html |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=August 18, 2007 |accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] 
Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads are numbered as a single set of roads. There is not an FM and an RM with the same route number, unless it crosses US 281. Urban Roads are designated with the same route number as the FM or RM from which the mileage was transferred.[tpl]cite web|author=Texas Department of Transportation|title=Highway Designations Glossary|url=http://www.dot.state.tx.us/business/governments/glossary.htm|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl]

==Business routes==

Texas currently has three signed business routes of Farm to Market Roads: Business [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1187[/tpl] in Tarrant County, Business [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|RM|1431[/tpl] in Burnet County, and Business FM 1960 in Harris County.[tpl]TxDOT|BF|1187|C|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|BF|1431|J|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|BF|1960|A|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl] These routes are former alignments that have been bypassed by newer routings.

==Other states==

Missouri has a similar state-operated system of farm-to-market roads, called Missouri supplemental routes. Missouri uses single (e.g., "A", "B", etc.) and double letters (e.g., "AA", "BB", etc.).
Iowa also has a farm-to-market road system. Those roads are under county jurisdiction,Iowa Code 2003: Section 306.3. Retrieved March 28, 2006 but are eligible for state aid from a dedicated fund.Iowa Code 2001: Section 312.5. Retrieved March 28, 2006.
