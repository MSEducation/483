==Toponymy==

In ancient records Bideford is recorded as; Bedeford, Byddyfrod, Bedyford, Bydeford, Bytheford and Biddeford. The etymology of the name means "by the ford", and records show that before there was a bridge, there was a ford at Bideford where River Torridge is estuarine and at low tide it is possible, but not advisable, to cross the river by wading on foot.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA1 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]

==History==

===Early History===

Hubba the Dane was said to have attacked Devon in the area around Bideford near Northam or near Kenwith Castle and was repelled by either Alfred the Great (849-899) or by the Saxon Earl of Devon. The manor of Bideford was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, which states that Brictric son of Algar was lord of the manor of Bideford in 1066 and that Gotshelm brother of Walter of Claville was lord in 1086. It also records that there were then 30 villagers, 8 smallholders and 14 slaves in Bideford.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SS4526/bideford/ |title=Bideford | Domesday Book |publisher=Domesdaymap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] William the Conqueror (1066-1087) was said to have given the manor of Bideford to Sir Richard de Grenville, who was descended from the Norman nobleman Hamon Dentatus (Latin: "Hamon the Betoothed"), Earl of Carboyl and lord of Thorigny and Granvile in Normandy, himself descended from Rollo of Normandy(c.846–c.931), the Viking founder of the Duchy of Normandy. Prince, John, (1643–1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, p.440 His descendant, another Sir Richard Grenville, fought under his brother Robert FitzHamon (d.1107), in the Norman conquest of Glamorgan, just north across the Bristol Channel from North Devon, as a member of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50569#s2 |title=Parishes - Bickton - Bridford | Magna Britannia: volume 6 (pp. 47-69) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] He was awarded by FitzHamon the lordship of Neath in Glamorgan, where he founded Neath Abbey in 1129. Prince relates that "having finished and settled this foundation he returned to his patrimony at Bideford where he lived in great honour and reputation the rest of his days".Prince, p.440 A charter was granted in 1272 to a descendant of Richard de Grenville, another also called Richard de Grenville by King Henry III, which created the town's first council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/historicbideford |title=Bideford |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] In ancient records Bideford was recorded as a borough but has only returned members to parliament during the reigns of Edward I (1272-1307) and Edward II (1307-1327).

===1500–1700===

The Grenville family were for many centuries lords of the manor of Bideford and played a major role in the town's development. The monument with an effigy of Sir Thomas Grenville (d.1513) exists in St Mary's Church. His great-great-grandson Sir Richard Grenville (1542–1591), the heroic captain of the Revenge, was born in the manor house in Bideford, formerly situated on the site of numbers 1-3 Bridge Street. He built himself a new mansion on the quayside in 1585.David Carter, The Grenville Reports, Nimrod Research The family had another seat at Stow House, Kilkhampton, near Bude in Cornwall. Sir Richard Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in North Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. In 1575 he created the Port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the Town Council he established. Sir Richard Grenville brought with him a Native American back to Bideford after returning from a voyage to America, the native American was called Raleigh, possibly a name given to him by Sir Richard Grenville as Grenvilles cousin Sir Walter Raleigh shares that name.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA57 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] Raleigh was baptised in Bideford and lived at Sir Richard Grenvilles house until his death in 1589.[tpl]cite web|url=http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Bideford/Bideford1850.html |title=GENUKI/Devon: Bideford 1850 |publisher=Genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk |date=1998-10-20 |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] Sir Richard Grenville's great-grandson, Sir John Granville, helped restore Charles II to the throne and in 1601 he made Sir John Granville, Baron Granville of Bideford and Earl of Bath.
In the year 1646, 229 people in the town were killed by the plague. It was suggested that a Spanish vessel laden with wool which docked at the quay may have brought this plague to Bideford, and that children playing with the wool got infected with the plague first in the town. People were buried from June 8, 1646 to January 18 the next year.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA43 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the expulsion of French Protestants from France a considerable number of them immigrated to Bideford and they brought a lot of new trades to the town including silk weaving.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA58 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]
In the 16th century a man called John Strange was born in the town. When he was in his youth he fell from a cliff and did not suffer any injury, then later on in his life someone fired an arrow at his forehead, but it did not penetrate his skull and only and the only lasting damage was a scar. Then a person tried to throw him over the Long Bridge but they were unexpectedly and luckily interrupted by something.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA226 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]

===1800–1939===

In 1816 a mob forced their way into Bideford prison to try and breakout some of the mobs ringleaders and soldiers from the Royal North Devon Yeomanry had to be mustered and they patrolled the town and arrested several members of the mob and they were escorted to Exeter.Mileham, Patrick (1994). The Yeomanry Regiments; 200 Years of Tradition. Edinburgh: Canongate Academic. ISBN 1-898410-36-4. In 1835 the Bideford Poor Law Union was founded bringing marking the existence of the Bideford workhouse, which was built in 1837 in Meddon Street, the workhouse had a 40-bed infirmary. The workhouse would later go on to become Torridge Hospital, then a residential building.http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Bideford/ In 1830 it was reported that 5000 people waved farewell to ships leaving Bideford for New York; St. Andrews, Newfoundland and Montreal. Between the years 1840 and 1900 2,467 people immigrated to Canada and 248 to the USA. by getting ships from Bideford. In 1847 a horse-drawn omnibus bound for Torrington taking people to a fair fell of Bideford Quay and into the River Torridge drowning eight people. In the book "Kingsleys County it put the expansion and growth of Bideford down to; the publication of Kingsley's romance, Westward Ho! In 1855, and the extension of the London and South Western Railway from Barnstaple in 1856. In 1902 the first car arrived in Bideford it was owned by Dr E.J. Toye, the car was a 4 1/2 hp Benz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ehive.com/account/4566/object/159708/Bidefords_first_car_1902 |title=Bideford's first car, 1902; Photographer: Unknown; 1902; 262 - Burton Art Gallery and Museum on eHive |publisher=Ehive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]

===World War II===

In 1942 American GI's arrived in Bideford. At first they were there to work in radar stations across North Devon and work on experimental things. More American troops began to arrive as the war progressed. Experiments nearby, including The Great Panjandrum, were said to be viewed in the area in secret by Dwight D. Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill. In 1943 more Americans arrived as D-day training had begun at beaches across North Devon[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bidefordheritage.co.uk/htdocs/gisinbideford.htm |title=GI's In Bideford |publisher=Bidefordheritage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] During the war Bideford Ordnance Experimental Station Depot O-617 was set up to experiment on waterproofing equipment for the D-day landings. The Americans' GI camp was at Bowden Green in Bideford and had plenty of facilities, including a cinema. There was also a Vehicle Repair Shop off the Kingsley Road and the Pill was taken over by US forces as well. Because of the sheer number of American soldiers in the area by 1943 the American Red Cross opened a club near Chudleigh Fort in East-the-Water. Bideford had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol at Cleave Mine, the men of this patrol were expected to be the resistance if Britain was invaded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bidefordheritage.co.uk/htdocs/Auxunit.htm |title=Churchill's Secret Army | Auxiliary Unit |publisher=Bidefordheritage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] During the war 2700 evacuees were expected in Bideford, a large number of these came and stayed throughout the war in Bideford. During World War Two a bomb was dropped on a house in Bowden Green and caused substantial damage. During the war an RCAF bomber crashed in East the Water. Three men were killed and one badly injured. A memorial has been put on the Tarka Trail to commemorate this.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bidefordbuzz.org.uk/page/2/ |title=Newspages for the Bideford and district community. | Page 2 |publisher=Bideford Buzz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] It is also thought that during the war there was an experimental Royal Navy unit testing a secret petrol pipeline in the river, also it is thought that after being rescued in the Bristol Channel some German airman were brought ashore at Bideford where they were taken to Bideford Hospital. There was also a POW camp at Handy Cross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bidefordbuzz.org.uk/ |title=Newspages for the Bideford and district community |publisher=Bideford Buzz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] It has also emerged that the Nazis had a map of Bideford in readiness for a possible invasion,http://www.germaninvasion.co.uk/archiveimages/tp012-w.jpg  also the Nazis had an aerial picture of the area for intelligence purposes.http://www.clique.co.uk/coloptics/luftwaffe/luftimages/LS-306.jpg

==Long Bridge==

The original Long Bridge spanning the River Torridge and connecting the East and West of the town was said to have been built out of timber in the year 1286. In 1474 the original structure was replaced by the masonry arch bridge seen today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisnorthdevon.co.uk/closer-look-Bideford-s-Long-Bridge/story-12151830-detail/story.html#axzz2X8wMhrKW |title=Bideford Long Bridge, history and facts ¦ |publisher=This is North Devon |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] The bridge was built around the timber so people could still use it while construction was taking place. It has 24 arches all of different sizes. The traditional explanation is that each arch was funded by a different local guild, although there are no records to confirm this. Another theory is that the piers of the arches of the bridge were built on naturally existing and therefore randomly situated large stones in the river.http://This is North Devon site: Retrieved 2 July 2012. During the first decade of the 17th century, the bridge trustees were taken to court by the people of Bideford for feasting and seeing plays with the trust funds. The people won the court case although it is unclear whether the trustees were forced to resign after the scandal or what happened to them. In 1790 the bridge was the largest in Devon.[tpl]cite web|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iW9bAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA140 |title=An Essay Towards a History of Bideford, in the County of Devon - Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] In the 1820s there was talk of converting the bridge so that it could be raised and lowered to allow larger boats and ships to pass under it. A former New Year's Eve tradition was to try to run across the Long Bridge during the time taken for the bells of St. Mary's parish church to chime midnight. In 1886 a Ship called 'Edward Birkbeck' launched from a Bideford shipyard hit the bridge, but only caused small damage by knocking some of the stones out. In 1925 another incident took place on the bridge, during the widening of the bridge a lorry came off the side of the bridge and crashed into the River Torridge, it is believed that both the people in the lorry survived.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ehive.com/account/4566/object/159831/Lorry_crash_on_the_bridge_1925 |title=Lorry crash on the bridge, 1925; 1925; 76 - Burton Art Gallery and Museum on eHive |publisher=Ehive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] During World War Two the 10th arch of the bridge was being repaired, the police asked for ladders and scaffolding to be removed from the bridge to prevent potential invaders climbing up and capturing the bridge, during the war the home guard patrolled the bridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bidefordbuzz.org.uk/page/3/ |title=Newspages for the Bideford and district community. | Page 3 |publisher=Bideford Buzz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] The Bideford Bridge Trust held responsibility for the long bridge right up until the year 1968 when one of the arches of the bridge collapsed. The Department of Transport then took on the bridge. During the rebuilding of that part of the bridge a crane toppled over on the bridge and a man was killed. An inspection by Devon County Council in July 2007 revealed problems with the bridge's concrete and structure, in September 2008, work began on putting in the cathodic protection system which restored the bridge for another 60 years. A sight which many holiday makers and locals enjoy is seeing the Starlings at dusk, as they roost underneath the bridge.

==Port & Shipping==

By the 16th century Bideford had become Britain's third largest port.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bideford-tc.gov.uk/ | title=The Beautiful North Devon Town of Bideford | publisher=Bideford Town Council | year=2010 | accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl] Sir Walter Raleigh landed his first shipment of tobacco here, although, contrary to popular belief, he was not the first to import tobacco to England. Several local roads and a hill have been named after Raleigh. Bideford was heavily involved in the transport of indentured servants to the New World colonies.[tpl]cite web | url=http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/places-involved/britain/south-west-ports/ | title=The south west ports of England | publisher=Bristol City Council | accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl] Bideford also was heavily involved in the Newfoundland cod trade form the 16th century to the mid 18th century 28 Bideford vessels with a tonnage of 3860 were involved in this practise in the year 1700.http://www.lerwill-life.org.uk/history/bideford.htm In the years 1706, 1707, 1726 and 1758 fishermen of Bideford sent petitions demanding the building of a fort in Newfoundland to protect them from Native Americans and the French.http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Bideford/Petition1706.html  Bideford also imported large amounts of Irish wool in the 18th century. Two prominent shipbuilders in Bideford were George Crocker and Richard Chapman, they built a large amount of ships. A number of ships have been built in Bideford including, HMS Acorn an 18-gun sloop launched in 1807, HMS Mutine, HMS Fairy, HMS Carnation and HMS Ontario were all 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloops built in Bideford, HMS Garland and HMS Volage were both 22-gun Royal Navy Laurel-class post ship's built in the town, and HMS Meda a Harbour Defence Motor Launch was built and launched in the town. Around 150 ships were built between 1840 and 1877 at Higher Cleave Houses in Bideford. The largest wooden ship to be built in Bideford was the Sarah Newman a 1,004-ton full rigged ship built in 1855.http://www.bidefordheritage.co.uk/htdocs/shipping4.htm During the 19th century over 815 registered wooden sailing ships were launched on the Torridge and also hundreds of unregistered craft. Shipbuilding in the Bideford area declined during the 1890s as shipyards in Britain's industrial regions constructed steel steamships, the last wooden merchant ship launched in the River Torridge was the schooner PT Harris from the Hubbastone yard of PK Harris & Sons in 1912.http://www.bidefordheritage.co.uk/htdocs/shipping5.htm During WWII a Shoreham-class sloop was named HMS Bideford after the town, also four sixth rate ships of the line have been named after the town.HMS Bideford Nowadays the only ship building in the area is at Appledore Shipbuilders, which has built civilian ships and ships for the Royal Navy and Irish Naval Service.  Currently ball clay is exported from Bideford to Castellón, Spainhttp://www.torridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=9080 and also Naantali, Finland;http://www.torridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=9268&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter also wood has been exported to Wismar, Germany.http://www.torridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=7419 The Kathleen and May, the last remaining British built wooden hull three masted top sail schooner is registered in Bideford and used to be based there.http://kathleenandmay.blogspot.co.uk/ There are also still some fishing boats that operate out of Bideford.

==Witch trial==

The Bideford witch trial in 1682 involved three women, Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles and Susannah Edwards, accused of witchcraft and resulted in one of the last hangings for witchcraft in England.

==Literary references==

This area of North Devon was home to the author Charles Kingsley, and is where he based his novel Westward Ho!. A small seaside town, named after the book, was built after the book's publication. Westward Ho!, which is the only town in the United Kingdom which officially contains an exclamation mark in its name, is approximately three miles (5 km) from Bideford. A statue was erected in honour of Kingsley near the car park of Victoria Park.

==Namesakes in USA & Canada==

The city of Biddeford, Maine, USA, was named after the English town, using the original old English spelling. Also, the town of Bideford in the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada, is named after the English town.

==Bideford Black==

Bideford Black is a unique pigment and was mined for 200 years up until 1969 in Bideford and the surrounding area.http://intim8ecology.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/earth-pigments-in-north-devon-a-teachers-guide-2.pdf The deposits were formed 350 million years ago during the Carboniferous period on Gondwana. Bideford Black contains carbon, silica and alumina, the carbon creates the black colouration in the pigment.http://bidefordblack.blogspot.co.uk/p/geology.html The seams containing Bideford Black Stretch from Hartland, underneath Bideford and onto Umberleigh.  Bideford Black was used in a number of ways, for example is was used as camouflage paint during World War Two, in mascara by Max Factor, by artists and in the boat building industry.http://www.torridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8831 Bideford Black was processed as a paint and a dye up until the mining stopped a number of artists (mainly local artists) used these Bideford Black paints and oils in their works. The Bideford Black Mining Company produced Biddiblack powder at a processing plant in Chapel Park, East-the-Water.http://bidefordblack.blogspot.co.uk/p/art.html Some of the miners houses were situated at Springfield Terrace, East-the-Water. The mining of the pigment became unviable when other blacks went into large cheap commercial production.http://bidefordblack.blogspot.co.uk/p/history.html Bideford black has also been known as "The Mother of Coal",http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2OH28vpzzMsC&pg=PT144&lpg=PT144&dq=Bideford+Anthracite+Mine&source=bl&ots=6RgmIkDjVk&sig=rmhRLkA0fjZaipS3iXGhMwZ1pwU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3tTKUdaiBeeV0AX8yIC4DQ&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBg there are still a number of places where evidence of the mine can be seen, like old mine entrances just off the Barnstaple road. A number of roads are named after the mining in the town including; Mines Road, Pitt Lane, Biddiblack Way and other roads. Recently some Bideford Black was exchanged by locals for some Australian Aboriginal Elder Noel Butler, Noel Butlers nephew has used the Bideford Black to paint his body for Aboriginal ceremonial events in Australia.http://bidefordblack.blogspot.co.uk/p/your-stories.html The Heritage lottery fund has given a grant of £8700 to the Burton Art Gallery to fund research into Bideford Black.http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SxB5RFUIn70/URlVvr5rcaI/AAAAAAAAAJw/Oca8aQImyTY/s1600/bideford+black+pr+ndj+7213.jpeg In October 2013 a display about Bideford Black happened at Bidefords Burton Art Gallery.http://bidefordblack.blogspot.co.uk/p/whats-it-all-about.html

==Transport==

===Roads===

Bideford is served by the A39 Atlantic Highway and A386 roads.

===Ferry===

A ferry operates between Bideford quay and Lundy Island, which lies about [tpl]convert|22|mi|km[/tpl] away in the Bristol Channel. The same ship, the MS Oldenburg, also provides evening cruises from Bideford along the River Torridge but in the downstream direction only as it is too big to pass under the Bideford Long Bridge.

===Coast path===

The South West Coast Path National Trail runs through the town, and gives access to walks along the rugged North Devon coast.

===Bus===

Bus There are several bus services provided by Stagecoach South West, First Devon and Cornwall, and Beacon Bus, including:
Many routes are subsided by Devon County Council.

===Railway===

The nearest railway station is at Barnstaple [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km[/tpl] away. Bideford was previously connected to the national rail network, but the connection was lost in 1982 (by then only a freight branch and that was primarily due to the ball clay traffic from Meeth Quarry) with the closure of the line from Barnstaple to Torrington and Meeth quarry. Passenger services were lost in 1965 following the publication of the Beeching Report. The station still exists East-the-Water and is now managed by a preservation group, the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre. The line followed the contours of the River Torridge for much of its route to Torrington and most of it continues to exist now as part of the Tarka Trail.
In 2009, James May's Toy Stories attempted to run OO scale trains on a temporary track on the right of way. A subsequent attempt in 2011 was successful.

====Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway====

The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway was an unusual and short-lived railway built entirely on this peninsula with no direct connection to the rest of the British railway network. The locomotives were fitted with skirts to protect pedestrians as at one point the line ran along the quay at Bideford. The line had eleven halts which largely served visitors wishing to enjoy the bracing air along the coast or the fine beaches around Westward Ho!. The railway, although authorised in 1896 was opened only as far as Northam by 1901 and finally opened to Appledore in 1908.
The railway fell into financial difficulties until in the First World War the War Department requisitioned all of its equipment for use in France. Bideford's 13th century Long Bridge was temporarily converted into a railway bridge to carry the locomotives and rolling stock onto the main line railway near Bideford Station.Stuckey, Douglas (1962). The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway 1901-1917. Pub. West Country Publications.

==Climate==

Bideford has a wet but mild climate, during the winter Bideford experiences a lot of frosty nights and mornings and also gets some snow. During the summer Bideford is quite wet, but also mild.

==East-the-Water==

The town of Bideford has grown to cover land on both sides of the River Torridge; the area located east of the river is known as East-the-Water. Much of the land that has been built on in recent years is drained marshland.
East-the-Water has its own primary school, local shops, a few factories, approximately 3 bars and pubs, a small health centre and a small industrial area consisting largely of locally owned businesses. The community also has its own community centre and association, both of which are self funding and run by a committee of local residents. A key historical feature is Chudleigh Fort, built by the Parliamentarian Major-General James Chudleigh during the English Civil War.J. Murray. (1879) A Handbook for Travellers in Devonshire (9th edition) The area is surrounded by agricultural land.

Local radio was provided by Heart North Devon, the station, which started in 1992 and originally called Lantern FM was based in Bideford in a building named "the Lighthouse", later moved to an industrial estate in nearby Barnstaple.

On 20 October 2006, British ex-patriate David Riley came to mark the '20-year link' between Manteo on Roanoke Island, North Carolina, and Bideford. The Bideford town clerk, George McLauchlan, told him that locals had never heard of Manteo and the only town Bideford was twinned with was in France. Mr Riley handed over a clock to 'celebrate' the twenty-year link, while the Manteo Town manager Kermit Skinner said the link started in the 1980s during the 400th anniversary of Raleigh’s voyages to America.
It turns out the 'twinning' of Bideford with Manteo had been established 20 years before. But the story goes back much further, 500 years, to the mysterious disappearance of a colony of more than 100 people on Roanoke Island, many of whom were migrants from Bideford. The colony was established by Sir Richard Grenville, who bought back two native Indians, one of them called Manteo which gave the North Carolina town its name.Coles, 2006"Gifts from an undiscovered US twin town", The North Devon Gazette, 2006.
