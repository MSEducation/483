Milo post office was established in 1923; Cora E. Buker was the first postmaster.[tpl]Cite OGN|7th|pages= 323–324, 647, 754[/tpl] It was named for Milo, Maine, the hometown of Amos O. Buker, who was the husband of Cora. Originally the post office at this locale was named "Perdue", named after John Perdue, Sr., who was also its first postmaster. It was originally at the confluence of the South Umpqua River and Elk Creek—which today is the location of Tiller—and the office was first called "Elk Creek". Elk Creek post office was founded in 1877. Perdue took over as postmaster of the Elk Creek post office on June 11, 1884 and on August 22, the name was changed to Perdue. At the same time to office was moved to the current location of Milo. The office was closed in 1920 when no one could be found to replace then-postmaster Amos Buker, who was fired after he had acted against postal regulations by working as a United States Census enumerator. Today Milo has a Days Creek mailing address.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.miloacademy.net/#about/location |title= Milo Adventist Academy: About: Location |accessdate= 2010-01-10[/tpl]Note: ZIP Code 97429.
