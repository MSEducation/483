Heavenly Mountain Resort is a ski resort located on the California-Nevada border in South Lake Tahoe. It has 97 runs and 30 lifts that are spread between California and Nevada and four base facilities.

With an average of [tpl]convert|360|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] of snow annually, and one of America's largest snowmaking systems, their ski season usually runs from mid November to mid April.

==Master development plan==

Under the recently approved 10-year Master Plan Amendment, Heavenly can continue to improve their resort with the replacement of fixed grip lifts with high speed detachables. The first of these, Olympic Express, debuted on December 23, 2007.  Future lift upgrades include the upgrade of the Galaxy double chair to a high speed detachable quad, the upgrade of the North Bowl triple chair to a high speed detachable quad, the replacement of the Patsy's and Groove triple chairs with a single high speed detachable quad, a high speed detachable lift to replace the Aerial Tram that will terminate at the future Powderbowl Lodge, the extension and conversion of the Mott Canyon double chair to a fixed grip quad that will terminate at the top of Dipper Express, the construction of a fixed grip quad between the base of Sky Express and the top of the Gondola, the reinstallation of the Wells Fargo chair, accessing abandoned terrain on the Nevada side, and the upgrading of Sky Express from a high speed detachable quad to a high speed detachable six-pack.
The Powderbowl Lodge, a [tpl]convert|27650|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] LEED certified building that will seat 950 people, the Sand Dunes Lodge on the ridge adjacent to the top of the Tamarack Express lift,  a skier bridge from the top of the Gondola to Tamarack Express, the complete fleet of low-emission buses, and multiple other projects are currently planned.
