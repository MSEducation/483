It is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing up to about 30 or 40 centimeters tall. Most of the leaves occur around the base of the stem. They have rounded blades several centimeters wide and edges divided into dull toothed lobes. The erect inflorescence bears several flowers, sometimes over 50, usually along one side of the stem. The distinctive flower is saucer-shaped with five greenish petals which are divided into narrow, whiskerlike lobes.
