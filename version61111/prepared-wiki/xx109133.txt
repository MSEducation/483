==History==

The island was the site of a monastic settlement in the 7th century,[tpl]cite book |title=Spike Island: Saints, Felons and Famine |last=Martin |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=The History Press |location=Dublin |isbn=184588910X | accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=[/tpl] and was used by smugglers for some time.Passage West and Monkstown website - Cork Harbour: Spike Island
Its location at the entrance to Cork Harbour meant that the island held strategic importance, and it was a significant site in the French intervention following the Glorious Revolution. The island was later purchased by the British government in 1779 and Fort Westmoreland was developed on the site to designs by Charles Vallancey.Irish National Inventory of Architectural Heritage - Westmoreland Fort The fort was proposed by the Royal Engineer Charles Holloway[tpl]cite book|last=Philippart|first=John|title=The Royal Military Calendar, Or Army Service and Commission Book ..., Volume 3|year=1820|page=335|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQt4PleGb8QC&pg=PA335&lpg=PA335&dq=%22sir+Charles+Holloway%22&source=bl&ots=VjNJ1Jy_8T&sig=2uQLjxTDtzyVH5X38glLvXtAtpA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZqKgUafVOIKJhQfV34DIBg&ved=0CHYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22sir%20Charles%20Holloway%22&f=false[/tpl] and named for John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and fortified gun emplacements were constructed facing the mouth of the harbour.
Later a prison and convict depot, the island was used to house "convicts" prior to penal transportation.  It gained a reputation as "Ireland's Alcatraz".  It remained in use as a garrison and prison through the Irish War of Independence, when IRA prisoners were held there. Richard Barrett was among those detained there, but escaped during the truce of 1921.
Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the island remained as one of the so-called Treaty Ports, and was handed over to the Free State in 1938. Upon its handover to the Irish state, the island's installations were renamed Fort Mitchel (after John Mitchel, nationalist activist and political journalist who was held on the island for a time). 
The island remained the site of a prison and military base (for the regular Irish Army, the FCÁ and later the Navy) for some time. Late into the 20th century it was used as a youth correctional facility. On 1 September 1985 inmates rioted and, as a subsequent Dáil committee reported, "civilians, prison officers and the Gardai on the Island were virtual prisoners of the criminals".[tpl]cite web|url=http://193.178.2.84/test/R/1986/REPORT_13081986_1.html|title=Report No. 11 - Disturbance at Fort Mitchel prison, Spike Island on the 1st September 1985|last=Dáil Select Committee on Criminal Lawlessness and Vandalism|year=1986|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl] During the riot, one of the accommodation blocks, Block A, caught fire and is known as the Burnt Block. This prison facility closed in 2004.
The island also had a small civilian population, which was serviced by a small school, church and ferry (launch) service to Cobh. The island is known locally for having excellent earth for growing crops.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] The civilian population has since left the island however, with many previous residents moving to nearby Cobh.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

==Tourism development==

In May 2006 the then Minister for Justice Michael McDowell announced plans to build a new prison on the island. However in January 2007, it was decided to explore an alternative site for the new prison, and a local task group was set up to re-open Spike as a historical tourist site. In 2009 it was announced that ownership of the island would be transferred (free of charge) to Cork County Council to enable its development as a tourist attraction.BreakingNews.ie - Spike Island to become tourist attraction - 28 July 2009 The Council formed a steering group to explore how Spike Island might be developed as a tourist site,Cork County Council - Press Release - "Spike Island, Cork Harbour - Unlocking the Potential" and the Council subsequently licensed operators to give guided tours of the island. 
Tours now depart from Cobh during the summer,Spike Island - Walking Tours taking in the fort, prison cells, and gun emplacements. There is a café in the former prison gym which caters to visitors.[tpl]fact|date=September 2013[/tpl]
