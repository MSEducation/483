Gareth Jon Batty (born 13 October 1977)[tpl]cite book |title=If The Cap Fits |last=Bateman |first=Colin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Tony Williams Publications |location= |isbn=1-869833-21-X |page= 188 |url= |accessdate=30 April 2011[/tpl] is an English cricketer, more specifically a spin-bowler. He is the younger brother of former Yorkshire and Somerset off-spinner Jeremy Batty.

==Education==

Batty was educated at Bingley Grammar School, a Voluntary Aided state school in Bingley, West Yorkshire.

==Life and career==

The off-spinner has been largely backup to Ashley Giles throughout his career, though he did play four Tests in the English tour of the subcontinent in 2003, as conditions favoured the inclusion of a second spinner in a team. He was picked the tour of the West Indies in 2003/04. Batty was the bowler Brian Lara faced when he scored his world record 400th run in the fourth Test Match in Antigua. He was picked as second spinner for the South African tour the next season.
The selectors continued to show faith in him, picking him for the two Tests against Bangladesh in 2005 when Giles suffered a hip injury – in the first, he did not bat, did not bowl, and but for Bangladeshi resilience in the second innings, he might have gone through the entire series without bowling. He has gone down to the spinning pecking order due to the emergence of Monty Panesar and re-emergence of Graeme Swann.

==County career==

Batty began his county career with his native Yorkshire, after playing for England Under 19's, making his County Championship debut in 1997. Due to lack of opportunities he transferred to Surrey in 1998 where he played mainly one-day games. He joined Worcestershire in 2002 where he became the main spinner and came to prominence with the national team.
Batty has been sponsored by Slazenger for the past five years and currently uses the SX model, which features a pronounced bow, suiting his aggressive style. His bats weigh 2.8 lbs (1.2 kg).
Batty was selected for the England Lions squad to tour New Zealand in the winter of 2008.[tpl]citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wiveng2009/content/current/story/384526.html |title=Vaughan misses out on West Indies |author=Cricinfo staff |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2008[/tpl] In March 2009, Batty was called up to the England ODI and Twenty20 squad to tour the West Indies. He replaced spinning all-rounder Samit Patel, who dropped due to fitness concerns, and Swann who returned home after the Test series to undergo an operation on his elbow.[tpl]citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wiveng2009/content/current/story/393407.html |title=England drop Patel for 'unsatisfactory' fitness |author=Cricinfo staff |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2009[/tpl]
In July 2009, he announced his intention to leave Worcestershire at the end of the 2009 cricket season to seek fresh opportunities elsewhere. He rejoined Surrey on a three-year contract.
In August 2013, Batty was suspended from the T20 finals day after a clash with Somerset batsman Peter Trego. The ECB banned him for two games after he apparently physically confronted Trego and hurled foul language after dismissing him in a quarter-final match.Gareth Batty suspended for two T20 matches and will miss finals day The Guardian ,9 August 2013.
