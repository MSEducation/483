Kenneth Mathieson "Kenny" Dalglish MBE (born 4 March 1951) is a Scottish former footballer and manager. In a career spanning 22 years, he played for Celtic and Liverpool, winning numerous honours with both. He is Scotland's most capped player of all time with 102 appearances, and also Scotland's joint-leading goal scorer, with 30 goals. Dalglish won the Ballon d'Or Silver Award in 1983, the PFA Player of the Year in 1983, and the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1979 and 1983. In 2009 FourFourTwo named Dalglish as the greatest striker in post-war British football,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/dalglish-named-the-greatest | title=Dalglish named the greatest|date=24 January 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010| author=Carroll, James| work=liverpoolfc.tv[/tpl]The list was published in the February 2010 edition of Four Four Two magazine and in 2006 he topped a Liverpool fans' poll of "100 Players Who Shook the Kop".[tpl]cite web |title=100 PWSTK – THE DEFINITIVE LIST  |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=8 October 2006 |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/100-pwstk-the-definitive-list |accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] He has been inducted into both the Scottish and English Football Halls of Fame.
Dalglish began his career with Celtic in 1971, going on to win four Scottish First Divisions, four Scottish Cups and one Scottish League Cup with the club. In 1977, Liverpool manager Bob Paisley paid a British transfer record of £440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six Football League First Divisions, two FA Cups, four League Cups, seven FA Charity Shields, three European Cups and one UEFA Super Cup. For these achievements and his style of play he was given the name King Kenny by Liverpool supporters. Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of Joe Fagan, winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning from Liverpool in 1991.
Eight months later Dalglish made a return to football management with Blackburn Rovers, whom he led from the Second Division to win the Premier League in 1995. Soon afterwards he stepped down as Blackburn manager to become Director of Football at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997 Dalglish took over as manager at Newcastle United. Newcastle finished runners-up in both the Premier League and FA Cup during his first season, but they could only finish 13th in 1997–98, which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed Director of Football at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the Scottish League Cup before an acrimonious departure the following year.
Between 2000 and 2010 Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care. In January 2011 Dalglish was appointed Liverpool's caretaker manager after the dismissal of Roy Hodgson, becoming the permanent manager in May 2011. Despite winning the League Cup which earned them a place in the Europa League and reaching the FA Cup Final, Liverpool could only finish 8th in the Premier League, and Dalglish was sacked in May 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/kenny-dalglish-sacked-manager-liverpool-160215966.html |title=Liverpool Legend Dalglish Sacked As Manager |publisher=yahoo |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl] In October 2013, Dalglish returned to Anfield as a non-executive director.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24407211 |title=Kenny Dalglish returns to Liverpool on board of directors |publisher=BBC |date=4 October 2013 | accessdate =4 October 2013[/tpl]

==Early life==

Dalglish, the son of an engineer, was born in Dalmarnock in the East End of Glasgow, and was brought up in Milton in the north of Glasgow. He moved to the docklands of Govan, near Ibrox, home of Rangers football club, when he was 15, and he grew up supporting Rangers.[tpl]harvnb |Dalglish; Winter|2010| p=3[/tpl]Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish through the years: in pictures

He won the Scottish Cup playing for Glasgow Schoolboys and Glasgow Schools, and was then selected for the Scottish schoolboys team that went undefeated in a home nations Victory Shield tournament. In 1966 Dalglish had unsuccessful trials at West Ham and Liverpool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifhof.com/hof/dalglish.asp | title=Hall of Fame Kenny Dalglish|accessdate=11 October 2011| work=International Football Hall of Fame[/tpl]

==Playing career==

===Celtic===

Dalglish signed a provisional contract with Celtic in May 1967. Celtic manager Jock Stein sent Sean Fallon to see Dalglish and his parents at their home; on hearing that Fallon was at the door, Dalglish rushed upstairs to remove the Rangers posters from his bedroom walls.[tpl]harvnb |Kelly|1993| p=34[/tpl] In his first season Dalglish was loaned out to Cumbernauld United, for whom he scored 37 goals.Lomax, Andrew (14 February 2008) Kenny Dalglish backs Scottish youngsters The Daily Telegraph Retrieved on 18 June 2009 During this time he also worked as an apprentice joiner. By the following year Dalglish was a full professional and a regular member of the highly-rated Celtic reserve team that became known as the Quality Street Gang, due to its having a large number of future Scottish internationals, including Danny McGrain, George Connelly, Lou Macari, and David Hay.[tpl]harvnb |Macpherson|2007| p=224[/tpl] Dalglish made his first-team competitive debut for Celtic as a substitute in the 1968 Scottish League Cup quarter-final tie against Hamilton Academical.NOW YOU KNOW: Kenny Dalglish debuted for Celtic against Hamilton Evening Times (18 March 2009) Retrieved on 18 June 2009
Dalglish was in the stands when the Ibrox disaster occurred at an Old Firm match in January 1971, when 66 Rangers fans were killed.
By the 1971–72 season, Dalglish had become established in the Celtic first team. He scored his first competitive goal for the club, a penalty, in a 2–0 Scottish League Cup tie win over Rangers at Ibrox in August 1971, and that season went on to score 23 league and cup goals in 49 appearances. The following season Dalglish was Celtic's leading scorer, with 41 goals in all competitions. He was made Celtic captain in the 1975–76 season, during which Celtic failed to win a trophy for the first time in 12 years, after

On 10 August 1977, after making 320 appearances and scoring 167 goals for Celtic, Dalglish was signed by Liverpool manager Bob Paisley for a British transfer fee record of £440,000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8012611.stm|title=Benitez opens talks with Dalglish |date=24 April 2009|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 May 2009[/tpl] Dalglish's departure was unpopular with the Celtic fans, and when he returned in August 1978 to play in Stein's testimonial, he was booed by a large contingent of Celtic supporters.[tpl]harvnb |Macpherson|2007| p=279[/tpl]

===Liverpool===

Dalglish was signed to replace Kevin Keegan, and Liverpool supporters were initially sceptical that he could perform this task.Lawford, Mark (1 April 2009) Home is where the heart is:  Shearer joins Keegan, Dalglish, Souness, Ardiles, Hoddle, Redknapp and Bremner in the legends' hotseat club – but who was the best of them all? The Daily Mail Retrieved on 18 June 2009 However, Dalglish quickly settled into his new club. He made his debut, wearing Keegan's number seven shirt, on 13 August 1977 in the season opener at Wembley, in the Charity Shield against Manchester United. He scored his first goal for Liverpool in his league debut a week later on 20 August, against Middlesbrough. Dalglish also scored three days later on his Anfield debut in a 2–0 victory over Newcastle United, and he scored Liverpool's sixth goal when they beat Keegan's Hamburg 6–0 in the second leg of the 1977 UEFA Super Cup final. By the end of his first season with Liverpool, Dalglish had played 62 times and scored 31 goals, including the winning goal in the 1978 European Cup Final final at Wembley against Bruges.
In his second season Dalglish recorded a personal best of 21 league goals for the club, and he was also named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year. He did not miss a league game for Liverpool until the 1980–81 season, when he appeared in 34 out of 42 league games and scored only eight goals as Liverpool finished fifth in the league, but still won the European Cup and Football League Cup. He recovered his goal-scoring form the following season, and was an ever-present player in the league once again, scoring 13 goals as Liverpool became league champions for the 13th time, and the third time since Dalglish's arrival. It was also around this time that he began to form a potent strike partnership with Ian Rush; Dalglish began to play just off Rush, "running riot in the extra space afforded to him in the hole". Dalglish was voted PFA Player of the Year for the 1982–83 season, during which he scored 18 league goals as Liverpool retained their title. From 1983 Dalglish became less prolific as a goalscorer, though he remained a regular player.
After becoming player-manager on the retirement of Joe Fagan in the 1985 close season, Dalglish selected himself for just 21 First Division games in 1985–86 as Liverpool won the double, but he started the FA Cup final win over Everton. On the last day of the league season, his goal in a 1–0 away win over Chelsea gave Liverpool their 16th league title. Dalglish had a personally better campaign in the 1986–87 season, scoring six goals in 18 league appearances, but by then he was committed to giving younger players priority for a first team place.
With the sale of Ian Rush to Juventus in 1987, Dalglish formed a new striker partnership of new signings John Aldridge and Peter Beardsley for the 1987–88 season, and he played only twice in a league campaign which saw Liverpool gain their 17th title. Dalglish did not play in Liverpool's 1988–89 campaign, and he made his final league appearance on 5 May 1990 as a substitute against Derby. At 39, he was one of the oldest players ever to play for Liverpool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1740|title=Liverpool 1–0 Derby County|work=LFCHistory.net|accessdate=3 February 2011[/tpl] His final goal had come three years earlier, in a 3–0 home league win over Nottingham Forest on 18 April 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=198687 | title=Liverweb all-time playing records|accessdate=11 October 2011| work=Liverweb[/tpl]

==International career==

Tommy Docherty gave Dalglish his debut for the Scottish national side as a substitute in the 1–0 Euro 1972 qualifier victory over Belgium on 10 November 1971 at Pittodrie. Dalglish scored his first goal for Scotland a year later on 15 November 1972 in the 2–0 World Cup qualifier win over Denmark at Hampden Park. Scotland eventually qualified and he went to the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, where they were eliminated during the group stages despite not losing any of their three games.
In 1976, Dalglish scored the winning goal for Scotland at Hampden Park against England, by nutmegging Ray Clemence. A year later Dalglish scored against the same opponents and goalkeeper at Wembley, in another 2–1 win.
Dalglish went on to play in both the 1978 World Cup in Argentina – scoring against eventual runners-up the Netherlands in a famous 3–2 win – and the 1982 World Cup in Spain, scoring against New Zealand. On both occasions Scotland failed to get past the group stage. Dalglish was also selected for the 22-man squad travelling to Mexico for the 1986 World Cup, but had to withdraw due to injury.http://www.icons.com/kenny_dalglish/Scotland_biography

==Managerial career==

===Liverpool===

After the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 and Joe Fagan's subsequent resignation as manager, Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool.  In his first season in charge in 1985–86, he guided the club to its first "double". Liverpool achieved this by winning the League Championship by two points over Everton (Dalglish himself scored the winner in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to secure the title on the final day of the season), and the FA Cup by beating Everton in the final.Bevan, Chris and Barder, Russell (23 January 2009) When Dalglish did the Double BBC Sport Retrieved on 18 June 2009
The 1986–87 season was trophyless for Liverpool. They lost 2-1 to Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley. Before the 1987–88 season, Dalglish signed a number of new players: Peter Beardsley from Newcastle, John Aldridge from Oxford United (who replaced Ian Rush); winger John Barnes from Watford; and Oxford United midfielder Ray Houghton. The new-look Liverpool side shaped by Dalglish topped the league for almost the entire season, and had a run of 37 matches unbeaten in all competitions (including 29 in the league; 22 wins and 7 draws) from the beginning of the season to 21 February 1988, when they lost to Everton in the league. Liverpool were crowned champions with four games left to play, having suffered just two defeats from 40 games. However, Dalglish's side lost the 1988 FA Cup Final to underdogs Wimbledon.FA Cup Final 1988 FA-Cup Finals, Retrieved on 18 June 2009
Dalglish guided Liverpool to victory over Everton in the second all-Merseyside FA Cup final in 1989, winning the match 3–2 after extra time, but was deprived of a second Double in the final game of the season, when Arsenal secured a last-minute goal to steal the title from Liverpool. In the 1989–90 season Liverpool won their third league title under Dalglish. They missed out on the Double and a third successive FA Cup final appearance when they lost 4-3 in extra-time to Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/5172107/Top-10-classic-FA-Cup-semi-finals.html At the end of the season Dalglish received his third Manager of the Year award. Dalglish resigned as manager of Liverpool (on health groundsLFC History The Kenny Dalglish story – end of an era) on 22 February 1991, two days after a 4–4 draw with rivals Everton in an FA Cup fifth round tie at Goodison Park, in which Liverpool surrendered the lead four times. At the time of his resignation, the club were three points ahead in the league and still in contention for the FA Cup.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/14/kenny-dalglish-liverpool-everton-4-4|title=The game that forced Kenny Dalglish to resign as Liverpool manager|date=14 January 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2011|first=Louise|last=Taylor[/tpl]

====Hillsborough disaster====

Dalglish was the manager of Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989. The disaster claimed 94 lives on the day, with the final death toll reaching 96. Dalglish attended many funerals of the victims – including four in one day – and his presence in the aftermath of the disaster has been described as "colossal and heroic".[tpl]cite web|author=Herbert, Ian |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/king-kenny-loses-grip-on-poisoned-chalice-7758042.html |title=King Kenny loses grip on poisoned chalice |publisher=The Independent |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl] Dalglish broke a twenty-year silence about the disaster in March 2009. He expressed regret that the police and the FA did not consider delaying the kick-off of the match, a move which might have averted the 96 deaths.Dalglish breaks disaster silence BBC Sport (3 March 2009) Retrieved 18 June 2009 During the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 15 April 2011, Liverpool MP Steve Rotherham announced he would submit an Early Day Motion to have Dalglish knighted, "not only for his outstanding playing and managerial career, but also the charity work he has done with his wife, Marina, for breast cancer support and what he did after Hillsborough. It is common knowledge it affected him deeply".

===Blackburn Rovers===

Dalglish returned to management in October 1991, at Second Division Blackburn Rovers. By the turn of 1992 they were top of the Second Division, and then suffered a dip in form before recovering to qualify for the playoffs,[tpl]cite web|last=Singleton |first=Ian |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17640251 |title=BBC Sport – How Kenny Dalglish turned a six-game losing run into glory |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= 9 April 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] during which Dalglish led Blackburn into the new Premier League by beating Leicester City 1–0 in the Second Division Play-off final at Wembley.

The following year, Dalglish failed in an attempt to sign Roy Keane.Kissane, Sinead (19 August 2002) Keane tells of Dalgish fury RTÉ Retrieved on 18 June 2009 Blackburn finished two positions higher the following season, as runners-up to Manchester United. By this time, Dalglish had added England internationals Tim Flowers and David Batty to his squad.
At the start of the 1994–95 season Dalglish paid a record £5 million for Chris Sutton, with whom Shearer formed an effective strike partnership. By the last game of the season, both Blackburn and Manchester United were in contention for the title. Blackburn had to travel to Liverpool, and Manchester United faced West Ham United in London. Blackburn lost 2–1, but still won the title since United failed to get a result in London. The title meant that Dalglish was only the fourth football manager in history to lead two different clubs to top-flight league championships, after Tom Watson, Herbert Chapman and Brian Clough. Dalglish became Director of Football at Blackburn in June 1995. He left the club at the end of the 1995-96 season after a disappointing campaign under his replacement, Ray Harford.

===Newcastle United===

In January 1997 Dalglish was appointed manager of Premier League side Newcastle United on a three-and-a-half-year contract, taking over from Kevin Keegan. Dalglish guided the club from fourth position to a runner-up spot in May and a place in the new format of the following season's UEFA Champions League. He then broke up the team which had finished 2nd two years running, selling popular players like Peter Beardsley, Lee Clark, Les Ferdinand and David Ginola and replaced them with ageing stars like John Barnes (34), Ian Rush (36) and Stuart Pearce (35), as well as virtual unknowns like Des Hamilton and Garry Brady.Asprilla: How Dalglish destroyed The Entertainers He also made some good long-term signings like Gary Speed and Shay Given. The 1997–98 campaign saw Newcastle finish in only 13th place and, despite Dalglish achieving some notable successes during the season (including a 3–2 UEFA Champions League win over Barcelona and an FA Cup final appearance against Arsenal), he was sacked by Freddie Shepherd after two draws in the opening two games of the subsequent 1998–99 season, and replaced by former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/159285.stm|title=Sport: Football Gullit named Newcastle boss |date=27 August 1998|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 May 2009[/tpl] One commentator has since written, "His 20 months at Newcastle United are the only part of Kenny Dalglish's career that came anywhere near failure".

He had recommended previous manager Barnes to the club and offered himself as a replacement manager should the young Barnes not succeed in the role.Forsyth, Roddy (30 June 2000) Dalglish hits out over messy Celtic divorce The Daily Telegraph Retrieved on 18 June 2009 In spite of the termination of his contract, Dalglish vowed to stay on as Director of football.

===Return to Liverpool===

In April 2009 Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez invited Dalglish to take up a role at the club's youth academy. The appointment was confirmed in July 2009,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8012611.stm|title= Dalglish makes Liverpool return|date=4 July 2009|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl] and Dalglish was also made the club's ambassador.
Following Benítez's departure from Liverpool in June 2010, Dalglish was asked to help find a replacement, and in July Fulham's Roy Hodgson was appointed manager.Roy Hodgson leaves Fulham to become Liverpool manager – BBC Sport – Football However, a poor series of results at the start of the 2010–11 season led to Liverpool fans calling for Dalglish's return as manager as early as October 2010,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/oct/04/roy-hodgson-liverpool|title= Spectre of Kenny Dalglish hovers over Roy Hodgson at Liverpool|date=4 October 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=5 October 2010|first=Andy|last=Hunter[/tpl]

After the game, Dalglish admitted that Liverpool faced "a big challenge".
Shortly after his appointment, Dalglish indicated he would like the job on a permanent basis if it was offered to him, and on 19 January the Liverpool chairman Tom Werner stated that the club's owners would favour this option. On 22 January 2011, Dalglish led Liverpool to their first win since his return, against Wolves at Molineux. After signing Andy Carroll from Newcastle for a British record transfer fee of £35 million and Luis Suárez from Ajax for £22.8 million at the end of January (in the wake of Fernando Torres's sale to Chelsea for £50 million), some journalists noted that Dalglish had begun to assert his authority at the club. Following a 1–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in February 2011, described by Alan Smith as "a quite brilliant display in terms of discipline and spirit" and a "defensive masterplan" by David Pleat, Henry Winter wrote, "it can only be a matter of time before he Dalglish is confirmed as long-term manager".
On 12 May 2011, Liverpool announced that Dalglish had been given a three-year contract. Dalglish's second stint in charge at Anfield proved controversial at times. The Scot consistently defended Luis Suárez in the wake of the striker's eight-match ban for allegedly racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra when the teams met in October 2011. After the Uruguayan's apparent refusual to shake Evra's hand in the return fixture in February 2012, an apology from both player and manager came only after the intervention of the owners. Critics have also questioned whether the England trio of Andy Carroll, Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing represented value for money at a combined cost of approximately £70m.
In February 2012, Dalglish led Liverpool to their first trophy in six years, with victory in the 2011–12 Football League Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/9103560/Cardiff-City-2-Liverpool-2-Liverpool-win-on-penalties-match-report.html|title=Cardiff City 2 Liverpool 2; Liverpool win on penalties|date=27 February 2012|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl] In the same season he also led Liverpool to the 2012 FA Cup Final where they lost 2–1 to Chelsea. Despite the success in domestic cups, Liverpool was 17th in the table over the second half of the season to finish the season eighth, their worst showing in the league since 1994, failing to qualify for Europe's Champions League for a third straight season.[tpl]cite web|last=Panja|first=Tariq|title=Liverpool Fires Dalglish After Worst League Finish In 18 Years|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-16/liverpool-manager-dalglish-fired-after-worst-finish-in-18-years.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=17 May 2012[/tpl] Following the end of the season, Liverpool sacked Dalglish on 16 May 2012, citing that "results in the Premier League have been disappointing".
