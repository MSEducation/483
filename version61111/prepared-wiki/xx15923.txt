[[Cigar]]

CATEGORIES: Cigars

A cigar is a tightly-rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco that is ignited so that its smoke may be drawn into the mouth. Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities in Brazil, Cameroon, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canary Islands (Spain), Italy and the Eastern United States. The origins of cigar smoking are still unknown. In Guatemala, a ceramic pot dating back to the tenth century features a Mayan smoking tobacco leaves tied together with a string. Sikar, the term for smoking used by the Maya may have inspired the name cigar.[tpl]cite news|last=Altman|first=Alex|title=A Brief History Of the Cigar|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1869320,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=2009-01-02[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The word cigar originated from the Spanish cigarro, which in turn probably derives from the Mayan sicar ("to smoke rolled tobacco leaves" – from si'c, "tobacco;"). There is also a possible derivation, or at least an influence, from the Spanish cigarra ("cicada"), due to their similar shape. The English word came into general use in 1730.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=cigar&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl]

==History==

Explorer Christopher Columbus is generally credited with the introduction of tobacco to Europe. Three of Columbus's crewmen during his 1492 journey, Rodrigo de Jerez, Hector Fuentes and Luis de Torres, are said to have encountered tobacco for the first time on the island of Hispaniola, in what is present day Dominican Republic, when natives presented them with dry leaves that spread a peculiar fragrance. Tobacco was widely diffused among all of the islands of the Caribbean and therefore they again encountered it in Cuba where Columbus and his men had settled.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Lancker JL |title=Smoking and disease |journal=NIDA Res Monogr |issue=17 |pages=230–88 |year=1977 |pmid=417256 |url=http://nida.nih.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf#page=243 |format=PDF [/tpl] His sailors reported that the Taínos on the island of Cuba smoked a primitive form of cigar, with twisted, dried tobacco leaves rolled in other leaves such as palm or plantain.
In due course, Spanish and other European sailors adopted the hobby of smoking rolls of leaves, as did the Conquistadors, and smoking primitive cigars spread to Spain and Portugal and eventually France, most probably through Jean Nicot, the French ambassador to Portugal, who gave his name to nicotine. Later, the hobby spread to Italy and, after Sir Walter Raleigh's voyages to the Americas, to Britain. Smoking became familiar throughout Europe—in pipes in Britain—by the mid-16th century and, half a century later, tobacco started to be grown commercially in America. Tobacco was originally thought to have medicinal qualities, but there were some who considered it evil. It was denounced by Philip II of Spain and James I of England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigars-review.org/history.htm|title=A bit of History|publisher=Cigars Review|accessdate=8 April 2011[/tpl]
Around 1592, the Spanish galleon San Clemente brought 50 kilograms (110 lb) of tobacco seed to the Philippines over the Acapulco-Manila trade route. The seed was then distributed among the Roman Catholic missionaries, where the clerics found excellent climates and soils for growing high-quality tobacco on Philippine soil.
In the 19th century, cigar smoking was common, while cigarettes were still comparatively rare. In the early 20th century, Rudyard Kipling wrote his famous smoking poem, "The Betrothed." The cigar business was an important industry, and factories employed many people before mechanized manufacturing of cigars became practical.
In 1869, Spanish cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his Principe de Gales (Prince of Wales) operations from the important cigar manufacturing center of Havana, Cuba to Key West, Florida to escape the turmoil of the Ten Years' War. Other manufacturers followed, and Key West became another important cigar manufacturing center. In 1885, Ybor moved again, buying land near the then-small city of Tampa, Florida and building the largest cigar factory in the world at the timeYbor City Museum State Park in the new company town of Ybor City. Friendly rival and Flor de Sánchez y Haya owner Ignacio Haya built his own factory nearby in the same year, and many other cigar manufacturers soon followed, especially after an 1886 fire that gutted much of Key West. Thousands of Cuban and Spanish tabaqueros came to the area from Key West, Cuba and New York to produce hundreds of millions of cigars annually. Local output peaked in 1929, when workers in Ybor City and West Tampa rolled over 500,000,000 "clear Havana" cigars, earning the town the nickname "Cigar Capital of the World".[tpl]cite book | last = Ingalls | first = Robert | title = Tampa Cigar Workers: A Pictorial History | publisher = University Press of Florida | location = Gainesville, Florida | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8130-2602-4 [/tpl][tpl]Cite video  | people = Jamison, Gayla (Producer, Director, Writer)  | title = Living in America: 100 Years of Ybor City  | medium = video documentary  | publisher = Lightfoot Films, Inc.  | location = Tampa, Fl  | date = 1987[/tpl][tpl]cite book | ref=harv  | last = Lastra | first = Frank | title = Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town | publisher = University of Tampa Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59732-003-X [/tpl]
In New York, cigars were made by rollers working in their own homes. It was reported that as of 1883, cigars were being manufactured in 127 apartment houses in New York, employing 1,962 families and 7,924 individuals. A state statute banning the practice, passed late that year at the urging of trade unions on the basis that the practice suppressed wages, was ruled unconstitutional less than four months later. The industry, which had relocated to Brooklyn and other places on Long Island while the law was in effect, then returned to New York.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F0CE7DF1238E033A25753C3A9679C94659FD7CF |title="Tenement cigar making", New York Times (January 30, 1884) |publisher=New York Times |date= 1884-01-30|accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl]
As of 1905, there were 80,000 cigar-making operations in the United States, most of them small, family-operated shops where cigars were rolled and sold immediately.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,803,00.html |title=Frank, Michael "Wise old hands", Cigar Aficionado (Winter 1993) |publisher=Cigaraficionado.com |date=1993-12-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl] While most cigars are now made by machine, some, as a matter of prestige and quality, are still rolled by hand. This is especially true in Central America and Cuba, as well as in small chinchales found in virtually every sizable city in the United States.  Boxes of hand-rolled cigars bear the phrase totalmente a mano (totally by hand) or hecho a mano (made by hand).  These premium hand-rolled cigars are significantly different from the machine-made cigars sold in packs at drugstores or gas stations.  Since the 1990s and onwards, this has led to severe contention between producers and aficionados of premium handmade cigars and cigarette manufacturing companies that create machine made, chemically formulated/altered products resembling cigars, and subsequently labeled as cigars.

===Historical figures===

King Edward VII enjoyed smoking cigarettes and cigars, much to the chagrin of his mother, Queen Victoria. After her death, legend has it, King Edward said to his male guests at the end of a dinner party, "Gentlemen, you may smoke." In his name, a line of inexpensive American cigars has long been named King Edward.  Classical pianist and composer Franz Liszt was quoted as saying "A good Cuban cigar closes the door to the vulgarities of the world".www.jerniganstobacc  Even a female literary giant of the Victorian era, George Sand, observed "The cigar is a perfect complement to an elegant lifestyle".www.jerniganstobacco.com
U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant smoked cigars heavily, an estimated up to 12 a day. In late 1884, Grant was diagnosed with an oral cancer consisting of malignant squamous cell carcinoma. With his health failing, Grant devoted his time to his autobiography; five days after finishing it, he became the only U.S. president to die of cancer.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of Psychoanalysis, smoked 20 cigars a day, despite health warnings from colleagues.[tpl]cite journal |author= Hafner JW, Sturgis EM |title= The famous faces with oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer |journal= Tex Dent J |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=410–29 |year=2008 |pmid=18561797 |url=http://doep.org/ODU2008.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Because of his frequent references to phallic symbolism, it is often claimed that his colleagues challenged him on the "phallic" shape of the cigar. Freud is supposed to have replied "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar," however, there are no records of such a conversation ever having taken place.Attributed in Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 15th Ed. 679 Initially concealing a cancerous growth in his mouth in 1923, Freud was eventually diagnosed with the same cancer as Grant's. Despite over 30 surgeries, and complications ranging from intense pain to insects infesting dead skin cells around the cancer, Freud smoked cigars until his life ended. Freud died at age 83 in a coma induced with morphine to relieve the pain from his cancer.
Winston Churchill, who has been credited with inventing the practice of dunking a cigar in port wine or brandy,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.onlinehavanacigars.com/pages/cigarTips.htm |title= Cigar Tips |author=Online Havana Cigars|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-09[/tpl] was rarely seen without a cigar during his time as Britain's wartime leader, so much so that a large cigar size was named in his honor.
In Cuba, revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were often seen smoking a cigar during the early days of the Cuban Revolution. But Castro has claimed to have given up smoking in the early 1980s as part of a campaign to encourage the Cuban population to smoke less on health grounds.[tpl]cite book |chapter= Tobacco in the Contrapunteo: Ortiz and the Havana cigar |author= Stubbs J | title= Cuban Counterpoints: the Legacy of Fernando Ortiz |editor= Font MA, Quiroz AW (eds.) |publisher=Lexington |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7391-0968-7 |pages=105–24[/tpl] Many other celebrities were well-known cigar smokers, including Groucho Marx, George Burns, Mark Twain, Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Rush Limbaugh, Red Auerbach, Ernie Kovacs, Raul Julia, and Bill Cosby.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Cigar Aficionado |date= Nov–Dec 1999 |url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,1140,00.html |title= The top 100 cigar smokers of the twentieth century[/tpl]
Rudyard Kipling said in his poem "The Betrothed", "And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke."
Charles Spurgeon, the "Prince of Preachers" was also known to enjoy a good cigar now and then "to the glory of God".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/cigars.htm |title= Spurgeon's Love of Fine Cigars | accessdate=2013-08-21[/tpl]
Apart from certain forms of heavily cured and strong snuff, the cigar is the most potent form of self-dosing with tobacco.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] It has long had associations of being a male rite of passage, as it may have had during the pre-Columbian era in America. Its fumes and rituals have in American and European cultures established a "men's hut"; in the 19th century, men would retire to the "smoking room" after dinner to discuss serious issues.

==Manufacture==

Tobacco leaves are harvested and aged using a process that combines use of heat and shade to reduce sugar and water content without causing the large leaves to rot. This first part of the process, called curing, takes between 25 and 45 days and varies substantially based upon climatic conditions as well as the construction of sheds or barns used to store harvested tobacco. The curing process is manipulated based upon the type of tobacco, and the desired color of the leaf. The second part of the process, called fermentation, is carried out under conditions designed to help the leaf dry slowly. Temperature and humidity are controlled to ensure that the leaf continues to ferment, without rotting or disintegrating. This is where the flavor, burning, and aroma characteristics are primarily brought out in the leaf.
Once the leaves have aged properly, they are sorted for use as filler or wrapper based upon their appearance and overall quality. During this process, the leaves are continually moistened and handled carefully to ensure each leaf is best used according to its individual qualities. The leaf will continue to be baled, inspected, un-baled, re-inspected, and baled again repeatedly as it continues its aging cycle. When the leaf has matured according to the manufacturer's specifications, it will be used in the production of a cigar.
Quality cigars are still handmade.[tpl]cite book |last=Butcher |first=Vernon A. |title=The Cigar  |accessdate=January 2013 |year=1949 |publisher=Standard Press |location=Orange, New Jersey[/tpl] An experienced cigar-roller can produce hundreds of very good, nearly identical, cigars per day. The rollers keep the tobacco moist — especially the wrapper — and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called chavetas, to form the filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be "laid down" and aged for decades if kept as close to 21 °C (70 °F), and 70% relative humidity, as the environment will allow. Once cigars have been purchased, proper storage is usually accomplished by keeping the cigars in a specialized wooden box, or humidor, where conditions can be carefully controlled for long periods of time. Even if a cigar becomes dry, it can be successfully re-humidified so long as it has not been handled carelessly and done so gradually. The loss of original tobacco oils, however, will greatly affect the taste.
Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. Long filler cigars are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a "binder", between the filler and the outer wrapper. This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will combine tobaccos from different parts of the island to incorporate several different flavors.
In low-grade and machine-made cigars, chopped tobacco leaves are used for the filler, and long leaves or a type of "paper" made from tobacco pulp is used for the wrapper which binds the cigar together. This alters the burning characteristics of the cigar, causing handmade cigars to be sought-after.
Historically, a lector or reader was always employed to entertain cigar factory workers. This practice became obsolete once audio books for portable music players became available, but it is still practiced in some Cuban factories. The name for the Montecristo cigar brand may have arisen from this practice.

===Dominant manufacturers===

Two firms dominate the cigar industry. Altadis produces cigars in the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras, and has a 50% stake in Corporación Habanos in Cuba. It also makes cigarettes. Scandinavian Tobacco Group, produces cigars in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and the United States; it also makes pipe tobacco and fine cut tobacco. The Group includes General Cigar Co.

===Families in the cigar industry===

Nearly all modern premium cigar makers are members of long-established cigar families, or purport to be.  The art and skill of hand-making premium cigars has been passed from generation to generation; families are often shown in many cigar advertisements and packaging.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/Cigar_Stars_Profile/0,2547,138,00.html |title=The Change at C.A.O. | Cigar Stars |publisher=Cigar Aficionado |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl]
In 1992, Cigar Aficionado magazine created the "Cigar Hall of Fame" and recognized the following six individuals:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,1320,00.html |title=Cigar Aficionado Magazine Cigar Hall of Fame |publisher=Cigaraficionado.com |date=2002-12-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl]

==Marketing and distribution==

Pure tobacco, hand rolled cigars are marketed via advertisements, product placement in movies and other media, sporting events, cigar-friendly magazines such as Cigar Aficionado, and cigar dinners. Since handmade cigars are a premium product with a hefty price, advertisements often include depictions of affluence, sensual imagery, and explicit or implied celebrity endorsement.[tpl]cite journal |journal=JAMA |year=2000 |volume=284 |issue=6 |pages=735–40 |title= Health risks associated with cigar smoking |author= Baker F, Ainsworth SR, Dye JT et al. |pmid=10927783 |doi=10.1001/jama.284.6.735[/tpl]
Cigar Aficionado, launched in 1992, was credited both by cigar companies and readers in transforming the U.S. cigar smoking market from a small blue-collar segment to an upscale market promoted in places like luxury hotels and golf courses. The magazine presents cigars as symbols of a successful lifestyle, and is a major conduit of advertisements that do not conform to the tobacco industry's voluntary advertisement restrictions since 1965, such as a restriction not to associate smoking with glamour. The magazine also presents pro-smoking arguments at length, and argues that cigars are safer than cigarettes, since they do not have the thousands of chemical additives that cigarette manufactures add to the cutting floor scraps of tobacco used as cigarette filler.  The publication also presents arguments that risks are a part of daily life and that (contrary to the evidence discussed in Health effects) cigar smoking has health benefits, that moderation eliminates most or all health risk, and that cigar smokers live to old age, that health research is flawed, and that several health-research results support claims of safety.[tpl]cite journal |author= DeSantis AD, Morgan SE |title=Sometimes a cigar magazine is more than just a cigar magazine: pro-smoking arguments in Cigar Aficionado, 1992–2000 |journal= Health Commun |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=457–80 |year=2003 |pmid=14557079 |doi=10.1207/S15327027HC1504_05[/tpl] Like its competitor Smoke, Cigar Aficionado differs from marketing vehicles used for other tobacco products in that it makes cigars the focus of the entire magazine, creating a symbiosis between product and lifestyle.[tpl]cite journal |author= Wenger LD, Malone RE, George A, Bero LA |title= Cigar magazines: using tobacco to sell a lifestyle |journal= Tob Control |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |year=2001 |pmid=11544394 |pmc=1747592 |doi=10.1136/tc.10.3.279[/tpl]
In the U.S., cigars are exempt from many of the marketing regulations that govern cigarettes. For example, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970 exempted cigars from its advertising ban, and cigar ads, unlike cigarette ads, need not mention health risks. As of 2007, cigars were taxed far less than cigarettes, so much so that in many U.S. states, a pack of little cigars cost less than half as much as a pack of cigarettes. It is illegal for minors to purchase cigars and other tobacco products in the U.S., but laws are unevenly enforced: a 2000 study found that three-quarters of Internet cigar marketing sites allowed minors to purchase cigars.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=2000 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=790–2 |title= Cigars, youth, and the Internet link |author= Malone RE, Bero LA |pmid=10800432 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/90/5/790.pdf |format=PDF |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.5.790 |pmc= 1446234[/tpl]
Inexpensive, non-pure cigars are sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and pharmacies, mostly as self-serve items. Premium cigars are sold in tobacconists, cigar bars, and other specialized establishments.[tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Slade J |chapter= Marketing and promotion of cigars |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_7.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-11 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=195–219[/tpl] Some cigar stores are part of chains, which have varied in size: in the U.S., United Cigar Stores was one of only three outstanding examples of national chains in the early 1920s, the others being A&P and Woolworth's.[tpl]cite book |title= Chain Stores: Their Management and Operation |author= Hayward WS, White P, Fleek HS, Mac Intyre H |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1922 |oclc=255149441 |chapter= The chain store field |pages=16–31[/tpl] Non-traditional outlets for cigars include hotel shops, restaurants, vending machines and the Internet.

==Composition==

Cigars are composed of three types of tobacco leaves, whose variations determine smoking and flavor characteristics:

===Wrappers===

A cigar's outermost leaves, or wrapper, come from the widest part of the plant. The wrapper determines much of the cigar's character and flavor, and as such its color is often used to describe the cigar as a whole. Over 100 wrapper shades are identified by manufacturers, but the seven most common classifications are as follows, from lightest to darkest:Perelman, Richard, Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars Perelman, Pioneer & Co.  ISBN 1-893273-05-9 (2004) p.12 ''
Some manufacturers use an alternate designation:
In general, dark wrappers add a touch of sweetness, while light ones add a hint of dryness to the taste.

===Fillers===

The majority of a cigar is made up of fillers, wrapped-up bunches of leaves inside the wrapper. Fillers of various strengths are usually blended to produce desired cigar flavors. In the cigar industry this is referred to as a "blend". Many cigar manufacturers pride themselves in constructing the perfect blend(s) that will give the smoker the most enjoyment. The more oils present in the tobacco leaf, the stronger (less dry) the filler. Types range from the minimally flavored Volado taken from the bottom of the plant, through the light-flavored Seco (dry) taken from the middle of the plant, to the strong Ligero from the upper leaves exposed to the most sunlight. Fatter cigars of larger gauge hold more filler, with greater potential to provide a full body and complex flavor. However, this effect can be diminished because of the generally poorer burn characteristics of thicker cigars (greater than 50 ring gauge), and the fact that these cigars burn cooler. This can prevent the full spectrum of flavors from being easily detectable. When used, Ligero is always folded into the middle of the filler because it burns slowly.
Fillers can be either long or short; long filler uses whole leaves and is of a better quality, while short filler, also called "mixed", uses chopped leaves, stems, and other bits. Recently some manufacturers have created what they term "medium filler" cigars. They use larger pieces of leaf than short filler without stems, and are of better quality than short filler cigars. Short filler cigars are easy to identify when smoked since they often burn hotter and tend to release bits of leaf into the smoker's mouth. Long filled cigars of high quality should burn evenly and consistently. Also available is a filler called "sandwich" (sometimes "Cuban sandwich") which is a cigar made by rolling short leaf inside long outer leaf. If a cigar is completely constructed (filler, binder and wrapper) of tobacco from only one country, it is referred to in the cigar industry as a "puro" which in Spanish means "pure."

===Binders===

Binders are elastic leaves used to hold together the bunches of fillers. Essentially, binders are wrappers that are rejected because of holes, blemishes, discoloration, or excess veins. In general, they are thicker and heartier than their wrapper leaf counterparts.

==Size and shape==

Cigars are commonly categorized by the size and shape of the cigar, which together are known as the vitola.
The size of a cigar is measured by two dimensions: its ring gauge (its diameter in sixty-fourths of an inch) and its length (in inches). In Cuba, next to Havana, there is a display of the world's longest rolled cigars.

===Parejo===

The most common shape is the parejo, sometimes referred to as simply "coronas", which have traditionally been the benchmark against which all other cigar formats are measured. They have a cylindrical body, straight sides, one end open, and a round tobacco-leaf "cap" on the other end which must be sliced off, have a V-shaped notch made in it with a special cutter, or punched through before smoking.
Parejos are designated by the following terms:
These dimensions are, at best, idealized. Actual dimensions can vary considerably.

===Figurado===

Irregularly shaped cigars are known as figurados and are sometimes considered of higher quality because they are more difficult to make.
Historically, especially during the 19th century, figurados were the most popular shapes; however, by the 1930s they had fallen out of fashion and all but disappeared.
They have, however, recently received a small resurgence in popularity, and there are currently many brands (manufacturers) that produce figurados alongside the simpler parejos. The Cuban cigar brand Cuaba only has figurados in their range.
Figurados include the following:
Arturo Fuente, a large cigar manufacturer based in the Dominican Republic, has also manufactured figurados in exotic shapes ranging from chilli peppers to baseball bats and American footballs. They are highly collectible and extremely expensive, when publicly available. In practice, the terms Torpedo and Pyramid are often used interchangeably, even among very knowledgeable cigar smokers. Min Ron Nee, the Hong Kong-based cigar expert whose work An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Post-Revolution Havana Cigars is considered to be the definitive work on cigars and cigar terms, defines Torpedo as "cigar slang". Nee thinks the majority is right (because slang is defined by majority usage) and torpedoes are pyramids by another name.

===Little cigars===

Little cigars (sometimes called small cigars or miniatures in the UK) differ greatly from regular cigars. They weigh less than cigars and cigarillos,[tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Connolly GN |chapter= Policies regulating cigars |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_8.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=221–32[/tpl] but, more importantly, they resemble cigarettes in size, shape, packaging, and filters. Sales of little cigars quadrupled in the U.S. from 1971 to 1973 in response to the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the broadcast of cigarette advertisements and required stronger health warnings on cigarette packs. Cigars were exempt from the ban, and perhaps more importantly, were taxed at a far lower rate. Little cigars are sometimes called "cigarettes in disguise", and unsuccessful attempts have been made to reclassify them as cigarettes. In the United States, sales of little cigars reached an all-time high in 2006, fueled in great part by favorable taxation.

==Smoking==

To smoke a cigar, a smoker cuts the closed end or 'cap', lights the other end, then puts the unlit end into the mouth and draws smoke into the mouth. Some smokers inhale the smoke into the lungs, particularly with little cigars, but this is uncommon otherwise. A smoker may swirl the smoke around in the mouth before exhaling it, and may exhale part of the smoke through the nose in order to smell the cigar better as well as to taste it.

===Cutting===

Although some cigars are cut on both ends, or twirled at both ends, the vast majority come with one straight cut end and one end in a "cap". Most quality handmade cigars, regardless of shape, will have a cap which is one or more small pieces of a wrapper pasted onto one end of the cigar with either a natural tobacco paste or with a mixture of flour and water. The cap end of a cigar must be cut off for the cigar to be smoked properly. It is the rounded end without the tobacco exposed, and this is the end one should always cut. If the cap is cut jaggedly or without care, the end of the cigar will not burn evenly and smokeable tobacco will be lost. Some cigar manufacturers purposely place different types of tobacco from one end to the other to give the cigar smokers a variety of tastes, body and strength from start to finish. Smoking a cigar from the wrong end may result in a bad experience.
There are three basic types of cigar cutters:

===Lighting===

The "head" of the cigar is usually the end closest to the cigar band. The opposite end of the cigar is called the "foot". The band identifies the type of the cigar and may be removed or left on. The smoker cuts the cap from the head of the cigar and ignites the foot of the cigar. The smoker draws smoke from the head of the cigar with the mouth and lips, usually not inhaling into the lungs.
When lighting, the cigar should be rotated to achieve an even burn and the air should be slowly drawn with gentle puffs.  A flame that may impart its own flavor to the cigar should not be used. The tip of the cigar should minimally touch the flame, the heat of the flame from a butane or torch lighter can burn the tobacco leafs. A match or cedar spill flame is a milder flame to be used.
Cigars can be lit with the use of butane-filled lighters. Butane is colorless, odorless and burns clean with very little, if any, flavor; but are quite hot as a flame source. It is not recommended to use (lighter) fluid-filled lighters and paper matches since they can influence the taste.
A second option is wooden matches, but the smoker must ensure the chemical head of the match has burned away and only the burning wooden section is used to light the cigar. Depending on the manufacturer, the chemical head portion of the matchstick may contain one or more of the following: gelatin, paraffin wax, potassium chlorate, barium chlorate, glue, polyvinyl chlorides, phosphorus trisulfide, and clay.  The strike plate to ignite the match may contain one more of the following: glass particles, red phosphorus and glue.
A third and most traditional way to light a cigar is to use a cedar spill.  A spill is a splinter or a slender piece of wood or twisted paper, for lighting candles, lamps, campfires or fireplaces, etc.  A cedar spill for lighting a cigar is a torn narrow strip of Spanish cedar (ideally) and lit using whatever flame source is handy.Lighting Cigars Article, Cigars4Dummies, 2009
Cigars packaged in boxes or metal tubes may contain a thin wrapping of cedar that may be used to light a cigar, minimizing the problem of lighters or matches affecting the taste.  Cedar spills, matches and lighters are all commercially available.

===Flavor===

Each brand and type of cigar tastes different. While the wrapper does not entirely determine the flavor of the cigar, darker wrappers tend to produce a sweetness, while lighter wrappers usually have a "drier" taste. Whether a cigar is mild, medium, or full bodied does not correlate with quality. Some words used to describe cigar flavor and texture include; spicy, peppery (red or black), sweet, harsh, burnt, green, earthy, woody, cocoa, chestnut, roasted, aged, nutty, creamy, cedar, oak, chewy, fruity, and leathery.
Cigar smoke, which is not typically inhaled, tastes of tobacco with nuances of other tastes. Many different things affect the scent of cigar smoke: tobacco type, quality of the cigar, added flavors, age and humidity, production method (handmade vs. machine-made) and more. A fine cigar can taste completely different from inhaled cigarette smoke. When smoke is inhaled, as is usual with cigarettes, the tobacco flavor is less noticeable than the sensation from the smoke. Some cigar enthusiasts use a vocabulary similar to that of wine-tasters to describe the overtones and undertones observed while smoking a cigar. Journals are available for recording personal ratings, description of flavors observed, sizes, brands, etc. Cigar tasting is in such respects similar to wine, brandy, whisky, tea, coffee, and beer tasting.

===Smoke===

Smoke is produced by incomplete combustion of tobacco during which at least three kinds of chemical reactions occur: pyrolysis breaks down organic molecules into simpler ones, pyrosynthesis recombines these newly formed fragments into chemicals not originally present, and distillation moves compounds such as nicotine from the tobacco into the smoke. For every gram of tobacco smoked, a cigar emits about 120–140 mg of carbon dioxide, 40–60 mg of carbon monoxide, 3–4 mg of isoprene, 1 mg each of hydrogen cyanide and acetaldehyde, and smaller quantities of a large spectrum of volatile N-nitrosamines and volatile organic compounds, with the detailed composition unknown.[tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Hoffmann D, Hoffmann I |chapter= Chemistry and toxicology |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_3.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=55–104[/tpl]
The most odorous chemicals in cigar smoke, and arguably the most responsible for the odor, are pyridines. Along with pyrazines, they are also the most odorous chemicals in cigar smoker's breath. These substances are noticeable even at extremely low concentrations of a few parts per billion. During smoking, it is not known whether these chemicals are generated by splitting the chemical bonds of nicotine, or by Maillard reaction between amino acids and sugars in the tobacco.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bazemore R, Harrison C, Greenberg M |title=Identification of components responsible for the odor of cigar smoker's breath |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=497–501 |year=2006 |pmid=16417311 |doi=10.1021/jf0519109[/tpl]
Cigar smoke is more alkaline than cigarette smoke, and therefore dissolves and is absorbed more readily by the mucous membrane of the mouth, making it easier for the smoker to absorb nicotine without having to inhale.[tpl]cite journal |author=Viegas CA |title=Noncigarette forms of tobacco use |journal=J Bras Pneumol |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1069–73 |year=2008 |pmid=19180343 |doi=10.1590/S1806-37132008001200013 |url=http://scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-37132008001200013&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en [/tpl]

==Humidors==

The level of humidity in which cigars are kept has a significant effect on their taste. It is believed that a cigar's flavor best evolves when stored at a relative humidity of approximately 68-74% and a temperature of 64 °F[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]. An ideal rate of humidity allows an even burning of the cigar. Conversely, dry cigars become fragile and burn faster while damp cigars burn unevenly and take on a heavy acidic flavor. Humidors together with their humidifiers are then used to serve this purpose. Humidor's interior lining is basically constructed with three types of wood: Spanish cedar, American (or Canadian) red cedar, and Honduran mahogany.
Most humidors come with a plastic or metal case with a sponge that works as the humidifier, although most recent versions come on polymer acryl. The latter must be filled only with distilled water, and the former may use a solution of propylene glycol and distilled water. Humidifiers may become contaminated with bacteria and should be replaced every two years to avoid such contamination[tpl]According to whom|date=July 2013[/tpl].
Humidors also come with analog or digital hygrometers. There are three systems of analog hygrometers: analog hygrometers with a metal spring, analog natural hair hygrometers, and analog synthetic hair hygrometers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.humidor-guide.com| title=Humidor Guide|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19[/tpl]

==Accessories==

There are a wide variety of cigar accessories on the market. Their prices may vary depending on the materials used and the quality of the finishing.

===Cigar travel cases===

Travel cases are intended to protect cigars from the environmental elements and to avoid the possibility of cigars being crushed. Most travel cases come in expandable or sturdy leather. They should be thick enough to protect cigars, and the inside should not have a strong leather smell that could affect the cigar's taste. Some of these cases come with either cardboard or metal tubes that add protection and prevent the cigar from becoming permeated with the leather.
