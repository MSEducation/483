Roy C. Start High School is a public high school in West Toledo, Ohio, United States.  The school opened in 1962 and is part of the Toledo Public Schools. It was named after Roy C. Start, two-time mayor of Toledo and founder of the West Toledo YMCA. The school building was recently demolished and a new building is now in place. Students have been attending the new Start since the new semester in January 2008.  The only part of the original Roy C. Start High School building in use is the auditorium (which is now in the West Toledo YMCA building) and is attached to the new building. Although Start is a public school, students are required to adhere to a dress code during the school day. (tan, brown, blue, or black pants with any solid colored collared shirt)

==Rivalries==

From its opening until 1991, Start had a rivalry with the DeVilbiss Tigers, which were located in the same neighborhood and a very short distance south of Start.  When DeVilbiss closed, much of its school district was absorbed by Start after a community effort urging TPS to merge Start into DeVilbiss had failed.[tpl]cite web | last = Krauth| first = Laurie| title = Frenzied supporters argue to keep schools| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = January 11, 1991 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iEdPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2986%2C2834436| accessdate = February 2, 2011[/tpl]
Start's main and long-standing rivals are the Whitmer Panthers, located less than two miles away on Tremainsville Road.  The "Battle of Tremainsville" was a non-conference matchup from Start's inception in the early 1960s until Whitmer joined the City League in 2003.  Beginning with the 2011-12 school year, it reverted to a non-league matchup when Whitmer joined the new Three Rivers Athletic Conference.
