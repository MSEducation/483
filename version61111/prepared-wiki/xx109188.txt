He resigned his seat in 1925 when the prime minister of Canada, William Lyon MacKenzie King, appointed him to the Senate of Canada.
MacArthur promoted his island home as a tourist destination. He built a noted summer home at Foxley River where he entertained extensively, including, in the summer of 1933, the officers and petty officers of the Royal Navy sloop, HMS Scarborough.
He died in office in Summerside at the age of 69.
His daughter Constance married John David Stewart.
