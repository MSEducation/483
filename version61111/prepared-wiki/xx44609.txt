Power Rangers is a long-running American entertainment and merchandising franchise built around a live action children's television series featuring teams of costumed heroes. Produced first by Saban Entertainment, later by BVS Entertainment, and currently by SCG Power Rangers LLC, the television series takes much of its footage from the Japanese tokusatsu Super Sentai, produced by Toei Company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toei.co.jp/en/company/license.html|title= Toei Company Profile[tpl]![/tpl] Toei|accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] Its first entry, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bandai.co.jp/e/company/global.html|title=BANDAI Co.,Ltd [tpl]![/tpl] Global Development|accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl]
Despite initial criticism for its action violence targeted to child audiences, the franchise has continued, and [tpl]as of|2013|lc = on[/tpl] the show consists of 20 television seasons of 17 different themed series and two theatrical films. Creator Haim Saban regained ownership of the franchise in 2010 after seven years under The Walt Disney Company. The current season, Power Rangers Super Megaforce, debuted in the United States on February 15, 2014.

==Premise==

Since Power Rangers derives most of its footage from the Super Sentai Series, it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series.  Each series revolves around a team of young people recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into Rangers, able to utilize special powers and pilot colossal assault machines called Zords to defeat and overcome evil forces that threaten humanity. For example in Mighty Morphin, alien wizard Zordon recruits "teenagers with attitude" to harness the power of the dinosaurs to overcome the forces of evil space alien Rita Repulsa.[tpl]cite episode |title=Day of the Dumpster |episodelink=Day of the Dumpster |series=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers |serieslink=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers |network=Fox |airdate=1993-08-28 |season=1 |number=1[/tpl]
When "morphed," the rangers become powerful superheroes wearing color-coded skin-tight spandex battle suits and helmets with opaque visors. Each team's costumes are nearly identical aside from individual rangers' color and helmet design. Morphed Rangers generally possesses superhuman strength, durability, and ability in hand-to-hand combat. Some possess superhuman abilities such as super-speed or invisibility, attributes somewhat related to their Ranger abilities.Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Power Rangers S.P.D., Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, Power Rangers Jungle Fury In addition, each individual ranger has a unique individual weapon as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting.As the series progresses, one or more of the Rangers will usually receive motorcycles for long-distance travel, as well as individual Zords. In many series, a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons. In some cases, one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers may not have; an example of this is the Battlizer given to the Red Ranger of each series since Power Rangers in Space (up through Operation Overdrive). When enemies grow to incredible sizes, Rangers utilize individual Zords that combine into a larger Megazord.
Rangers teams operate in teams of five or three, with more Rangers joining the team part way into each season. Each team of Rangers, with a few exceptions, obeys a general set of conventions, outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series: Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight (unless forced to do so), nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public.Public servants (rescue squad, police officers, etc.) appearing as Rangers disregarded this convention in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, Power Rangers S.P.D., Power Rangers Operation Overdrive and Power Rangers RPM. The penalty for disobeying these rules, at least in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, would be the loss of their power.
As in Super Sentai, the color palette of each Power Rangers team changes every series.An original Power Ranger, the Titanium Ranger, was created especially for Lightspeed Rescue to add a sixth Power Ranger to the series. Only Red, Blue, and Yellow appear in every Ranger team. The most common color that does not appear every year is Pink, followed by Green, Black, and White.  Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series.Other color designations include metallic colors, violet, and "Shadow", as well as protagonists who have powers and costumes similar to those of the Rangers but are not called "Power Rangers", such as the Blue Senturion and Koragg the Knight Wolf. A Rangers' color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series: civilian clothing often matches Ranger color.A joke highlighted this correlation in Dino Thunder when Tommy Oliver (a former Green Ranger, White Ranger, and Red Ranger) became the new Black Ranger; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black-colored clothing.

==History==

===Adapting the Super Sentai series===

Production of Power Rangers episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original Super Sentai source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage, Power Rangers programs consist of scenes featuring English-speaking actors (either from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom) spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot (Zord and Megazord) battles with English dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the Power Rangers production.[tpl]cite news|last=Heffley|first=Lynne|title=Low-Tech Equals High Ratings : Fox's Offbeat 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' Flexes Its Kidvid Muscle|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/entertainment/ca-60885_1_mighty-morphin-power-rangers|accessdate=August 28, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 25, 1993[/tpl] Like many of Saban Entertainment's previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience, the plot, character names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season.
The series that began the franchise, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series, Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger), began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids block of programing that aired on the Fox network. It lasted for three seasons (from 1993 to 1996).[ref][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/the-original-power-rangers-return-in-2010-11072|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100408032401/http://www.kungfucinema.com/the-original-power-rangers-return-in-2010-11072|archivedate=2010-04-08|title=The original ‘Power Rangers’ return in 2010|work=Kung Fu Cinema|accessdate=2009-10-11[/tpl]

===Broadcast history===

Saban Entertainment distributed the Power Rangers series from 1993 until the end of 2001, and Fox broadcast it until the fall of 2002. The Walt Disney Company purchased the franchise as part of a buyout that took place in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saban.com/html/team/saban.html|title=Haim Saban|work=Saban|accessdate=2009-02-23[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html|title=News Corp. and Haim Saban Reach Agreement to Sell Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $5.3 Billion|date=July 23, 2001|work=saban|accessdate=2009-02-23[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/23/deals/fox_disney/ |title=Disney buys Fox Family for $3B |date=2001-07-23 |accessdate=2007-09-21 |work=CNNfn |publisher=www.money.cnn.com[/tpl] This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming ABC Family Worldwide Inc. This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment, from News Corporation, Fox's parent company, and Haim Saban. The show continued to air on Fox until the company replaced its Fox Kids package with "FoxBox" in the United States. Since September 2002, all Power Rangers shows have aired on various Disney-owned networks (ABC Kids, Toon Disney and Jetix channels worldwide). ABC Family, another Disney-owned network, also used to air Power Rangers until it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31, 2006. Also in the United States, Disney Channel never aired any, if not all, of the Power Rangers incarnations from the Disney era due to its commitment to air its own original programming. On February 12, 2009, Toon Disney ended in the wake of Disney XD, ending cable airings of Power Rangers in certain areas of the United States. Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups, most notably Hearst-Argyle Television and Allbritton,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] declined to air most of the Power Rangers series since 2006 due to the lack of FCC-compliant educational and informational content in the programs.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/lights_out_for_power_rangers_mwqE73QZJZJ4OLgEsS0vMP |title=Lights out for 'Power Rangers'|date=March 10, 2009|work=New York Post|accessdate=2009-10-08[/tpl]

On October 1, 2009, Bandai released a press release that Disney would re-broadcast Mighty Morphin Power Rangers starting in January 2010 on ABC Kids in lieu of a new series utilizing footage from the 2009 Super Sentai television series. A new toy line accompanied the series and appeared in stores in the later part of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bandai.com/blog/press-release/mighty-morphin|title=PRESS RELEASE: Bandai America Powers Up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line [tpl]![/tpl] Bandai America|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2009-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20091001006376&newsLang=en|title=CORRECTING and REPLACING PHOTOS Bandai America Powers up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line|accessdate=2009-10-01|date=2009-10-01[/tpl] ABC's over-the air telecasts ended on August 28, 2010, and turned the hour back to affiliates.

==Television series==

The first series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers through In Space followed a story arc with a gradually changing cast and characters over six years. Beginning with Lost Galaxy, although it had ties with the previous story arc, each Power Rangers series had its own  self-contained storylines, independent of previous series. Crossover episodes between different series featuring rangers, villains, and other characters from past seasons also began with Lost Galaxy, with a few exceptions.

==Feature films==

The Power Rangers franchise has also generated two theatrical films, both distributed by 20th Century Fox. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl] - long after Fox's parent company News Corporation and Haim Saban sold Fox Family (currently ABC Family), including Saban Entertainment and the Power Rangers franchise, to the Walt Disney Company - Fox's home entertainment division maintained worldwide home-entertainment rights to both of these Power Rangers films.

==Distribution==

Power Rangers has long had success in international markets and continues to air in many countries, with the exception of New Zealand, where the series filming takes place [tpl]as of|2009|lc=on[/tpl]. As of 2006, Power Rangers aired at least 65 times a week in more than 40 worldwide markets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/moreinfo/pdfs/2006_disney_boysproperties.pdf |title=Disney Shows Muscle with Boys Properties |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl] Many markets carry or have carried the series on their respective Fox or later Jetix/Disney XD channels or have syndicated the program on regional children's channels or blocks, either dubbed into the local language or broadcast in the original English. Since the 2010 acquisition by Saban Brands, international television distribution rights for Power Rangers have been managed by MarVista Entertainment.[tpl]cite news|title=MarVista to sell 'Rangers' TV library|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118022158.html?categoryid=18&cs=1|accessdate=July 26, 2010|newspaper=Variety|date=July 26, 2010 | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=MarVista to Re-Introduce Power Rangers to International Market|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/26397|accessdate=July 26, 2010|newspaper=WorldScreen|date=July 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=New Partners On Board for Power Rangers Samurai|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/31358|accessdate=September 20, 2010|date=September 13, 2010 | first= Marissa | last=Graziadio[/tpl]
Broadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently than in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of 'the Super Sentai brand originating in Japan. When Power Rangers aired in Malaysia, it was either banned or having its word "Morphin'" being censored or substituted because, as part of its campaign against drugs, it may encourage children to use morphine. In Japan, many Power Rangers television seasons and movies were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past Super Sentai casts, leading to the English-dubbed action sequences being "re-dubbed" or "restored" back to Japanese as well. Power Rangers SPD is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in August 2011, with the Dekaranger cast voicing their counterparts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toei.co.jp/release/tv/1195581_963.html|title=『パワーレンジャー S.P.D.』日本語吹替版プロジェクト　始動！ 東映［テレビ］[/tpl] After broadcast of Power Rangers ended in South Korea with Wild Force, Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed Super Sentai series under the 파워레인저 (Power Ranger) brand on JEI TV.
