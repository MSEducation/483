Vector Markup Language (VML) is an XML-based file format for two-dimensional vector graphics.
VML is specified in Part 4 of the Office Open XML standards ISO/IEC 29500 and ECMA-376. According to the specification, VML should be considered a deprecated format included in Office Open XML for legacy reasons only.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2007/06/is-vml-in-or-ou.html|title=Is VML in or out now, or was that a typo? |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080621213223/http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2007/06/is-vml-in-or-ou.html |archivedate=2008-06-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/New%20proposed%20dispositions%20extend%20progress%20in%20addressing%20all%20National%20Body%20comments.htm |title=Ecma TC45 - New proposed dispositions extend progress in addressing all National Body comments, seek to document and resolve legacy issues – Nearly 2/3 of comments now reviewed |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2010-07-29[/tpl]
VML is pervasively used in MS Office 2007 (and later version) documents (i.e. Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/XML/ooxml_is_defective.aspx |title=Microsoft Office XML formats ?

==History==

VML was submitted to the W3C in 1998 by Autodesk, Hewlett-Packard, Macromedia, Microsoft, and Vision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-VML-19980513|title=Vector Markup Language (VML)|last=Mathews|first=Brian|coauthors=Brian Dister, John Bowler, Howard Cooper stein, Ajay Jindal, Tuan Nguyen, Peter Wu, Troy Sandal|date=13 May 1998|publisher=W3C|accessdate=2009-05-08[/tpl] Around the same time other competing W3C submissions were received in the area of web vector graphics, such as PGML from Adobe Systems, Sun Microsystems, and others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML-19980410|title=Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML)|last=Al-Shamma|first=Nabeel|coauthors=Robert Ayers, Richard Cohn, Jon Ferraiolo, Martin Newell, Roger K. de Bry, Kevin McCluskey, Jerry Evans|date=10 April 1998|publisher=W3C|accessdate=2009-05-08[/tpl] As a result of these submissions, a new W3C working group was created, which produced Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG became a W3C Recommendation in 2001 as a language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in XML.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG10/ |title=Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Specification |author=W3C |date=2001-09-04 |accessdate=2010-07-29[/tpl] VML has been largely deprecated in favor of other formats, such as SVG.[tpl]cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164114.aspx |title= Vector Graphics | publisher = MSDN Magazine |author=Dennis Forbes |date=July 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-29[/tpl] SVG is not compatible with VML.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vector.org.uk/archive/v164/vml164.htm |title=VML — Vector Graphics on the Internet |date=July 2001 |accessdate=2010-07-29[/tpl]

==Syntax==

Below is a VML instance as produced by Microsoft Excel 2010:
Note that, by specifying a root element named "xml", VML contravenes the XML Recommendation of the W3C, which states that names beginning 'x' 'm' 'l' are "reserved for standardization in this or future versions of this specification".
VML, when embedded within HTML markup, is read and processed by Microsoft Internet Explorer (but not other browsers); for example, the following example displays a solid blue oval:

==Implementations==

VML is used by most Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Visio, within HTML files created using the 'Save As HTML' option (plain HTML or MHT). Such files retain complete vector information, and can be reopened for editing using other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft PowerPoint. VML was natively supported by Microsoft's Internet Explorer up to version 9 inline within HTML, using an undefined version of SGML namespaces. Support for VML was dropped in Internet Explorer 10 and subsequent versions.http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-ie10-web-browser-dx-vml,14215.html
Support for "ink annotations" in Office Open XML files was added to LibreOffice during the 3.7 development cycle.http://www.derivativezero.com/blog/2012/09/importing-ooxml-ink-annotations-into-libreoffice/
VML is not natively supported by most web browsers. Web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari or Google Chrome support SVG instead of VML.
