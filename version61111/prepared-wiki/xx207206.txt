Detonator is a tower ride at Thorpe Park in Chertsey, Surrey, England, UK. It was manufactured by Fabbri and is a 'Mega Drop Tower'. It opened in 2001 along with two other 'flat' rides, Vortex and Zodiac. It is around [tpl]convert|115|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and is not released via a computer. The ride operator at the bottom has a button which he/she can press to make the car go at any time once the car has reached the top. Once released, the car is fired downwards by pneumatics rather than simply falling under gravity,
the ride reaches a speed of 46Â mph at the base of the drop, giving the impression of weightlessness for riders. For the 2011 season on ride photos were added.
The ride was originally planned to be placed where Zodiac currently sits but was moved after Wicked Witches Haunt burned down hence the lost city theming seen on other rides such as Vortex & Zodiac. When Nemesis Inferno opened, the queue line was altered.

==History==

In July 2000 Thorpe Park's Wicked Witches Haunt and part of Mr Rabbit's Tropical Travels were destroyed in a fire. Although Mr Rabbit's Tropical Travels was recovered and reopened later in the year Wicked Witches Haunt was destroyed beyond repair. This left a vast open space in the park to which they decided until a later development applied for temporary planning permission for a Fabbri Mega-Drop. 
In 2001 Detonator opened as the parks tallest ride at 115 feet in replacement of Wicked Witches Haunt. The ride's success meant the park applied for extended planning permission meaning that to this day the ride remains. In 2007 the ride opened with a new theme tune after the park decided it was no longer plausible to pay royalties for the original sound track.

==Theming==

Detonator's theme is based around a pirate adventure seeking great treasure and in doing so need to detonate a large quantity of explosives, hence the name Detonator. Around the ride are several 'cannons' to give off the explosive atmosphere.

==Fright Nights==

Detonator audio track at Fright Nights:  Whilst going up the lift hill a music box is playing, slowly running out of energy until a bolt of lightning strikes. Once the rider is at the top, a young child sings "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall". A scream is then heard as the gondola plummets back down to the ground.
