Hard Head is a 1988 arcade platform game made by SunA corporation. In the game, players control the titular character, who must traverse a set of levels by defeating enemies with a bubble gun. Often compared to Nintendo's Super Mario Bros., the game met with some favorable reviews on release and its offbeat sense of humor has been noted. SunA subsequently released a sequel to the game, Hard Head 2, which featured the same characters but different gameplay.

==Gameplay==

Players control the game's titular character Hard Head, who can use a bubble gun to entrap enemies, then jump on their heads to defeat them. Enemies include monsters and ducks. Hard Head can use his head to break bricks, some of which contain power-ups. Levels are completed by finding a soccer ball and kicking it through a goal to finish the stage; there are 16 levels in total. A two-player simultaneous mode is also available, allowing another player to control the second Hard Head twin.
