Lorraine "Rainie" Cross is a fictional character from the BBC One soap opera EastEnders, played by Tanya Franks. Introduced as the drug-addicted sister of Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Franks has had three separate guest stints in 2007 (two episodes), 2008 (four episodes) and 2010 (seven episodes). On 12 April 2011, Franks reprised her role as Rainie, this time as a regular character, departing on 8 December the same year.
Described as "the slightly broken sister who's one step away from a vodka bottle", Rainie's storylines have often centred around her addictions to drugs and alcohol. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie was involved in a highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). It was branded "inappropriate" and "horrid" by the Daily Record. Former EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy also criticised the storyline, saying she was "shocked", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself was not surprised that viewers had complained.

==Storylines==

Rainie first appears at Tanya's house claiming that she is no longer using drugs but Tanya catches her attempting to inject heroin and gives her a choice—take £500 and never see Tanya or her children again, or stay the night and get help with her problems. Rainie leaves with the money without Tanya noticing but ignores the ultimatum, returning the following year. Tanya is in an emotional state, having recently split from her husband Max Branning (Jake Wood). Rainie returns the money to Tanya and says she is not using drugs, so Tanya allows her to stay but she tests positive for cannabis so Tanya asks her to leave.
Rainie returns to Walford in 2010 and tells Max she is clean and sober, and asks Max for Tanya's phone number. Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie to stay and Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get more drugs when Phil steals money from The Queen Victoria public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer. Phil's girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) offers to help him get clean but throws Rainie out of the house, calling her pathetic.
In 2011, Rainie returns to Tanya's house as their mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), is visiting. Rainie says she is now completely clean and is staying with Cora because her counsellor wants her to reconnect with her family. When Tanya and Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) go on their honeymoon, Rainie looks after their house and meets Phil at R&R. They talk about their past but he tells her that he does not want to associate with her and leaves. She and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) then get drunk together and later go to his flat and have sex. Jack rejects Rainie the following morning. Tanya and Greg return and see how much trouble Rainie has caused. She also causes trouble with Shirley so Tanya asks her to leave but Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay, much to Greg's disappointment. Rainie visits Jack's wife Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) to find the knickers she supposedly left behind and taunts Ronnie, asking her to tell Jack to phone her, leading to her being kicked out again. She joins a support group to help her stay off drugs and alcohol which Phil also attends. Rainie struggles and calls her drug dealer but Phil catches Rainie with drugs and takes them from her, destroying them. She gets drunk and goes to Tanya's salon, where Tanya takes her home. Greg throws her out after Tanya lies that Rainie tried to stab her. A few days later, Phil finds Rainie in the pub and Shirley catches them talking and wrongly assumes they are romantically involved but finds out that Phil has been sponsoring Rainie. Shirley almost gives Rainie a job in the café but changes her mind. 
Rainie leaves Walford again but insists on her return that she is still not taking drugs. However, she faces several temptations by people offering her drugs, eventually buying some from Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott). When Phil finds out, he asks Ryan to not sell to Rainie again. Dot Branning (June Brown) takes pity on Rainie and helps her to clean herself up, telling her about drug addict Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) and giving her a Bible, which makes Rainie decide to change as she finds religion. Rainie apologises to Tanya for being rude to her earlier in the week, and Tanya agrees to let her stay with her and Greg. Rainie and Cora confide in one another when Rainie says Tanya treats her like a child. When it is revealed that Tanya had an affair with Max, Rainie nearly turns to drink, but stops herself. She gets a job at the R&R club, unaware that she only got it because her boss, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) wanted to irritate Phil. The next week, Phil demands Janine sack Rainie and she agrees but Rainie later applies for a job as an office worker with Janine's new property management business but Janine makes her a cleaner. When Phil is sent photos relating to an incident from his past, Rainie stops him turning to drink. Phil tells her about the incident and they start to kiss, but are interrupted by Pat Evans (Pam St Clement). Rainie mentions the photos to Shirley, making Shirley think  Rainie is sending them so she threatens Rainie, telling her to stop.
Rainie later discovers that Tanya has cervical cancer. Max returns with his brother, Derek (Jamie Foreman), and Derek recognises Rainie from Max and Tanya's wedding and is attracted to her, later mentioning that they had sex. Rainie demands to know why Tanya stopped her treatment and she explains that it did not work for their father and admits she helped him die, shattering Rainie and Cora. Though Tanya and Cora reconcile, Rainie is still angry, telling Tanya she hopes the cancer kills her. She sleeps rough, but then meets Derek and starts a sexual relationship him.[tpl]Cite episode |title= Episode dated 29/11/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017tb3d |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Nigel Douglas; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Jeff Povey|network=BBC |station=BBC One |city= |airdate=25 November 2011[/tpl] When Rainie asks Tanya to apologise over their father but she refuses, as she does not regret it.

In October 2012, Tanya and Max decide to remarry. Tanya wants Rainie to attend the wedding but doesn't know where she is and asks Cora to track her down.

Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she leave her alone from now on.[tpl]Cite episode |title= Episode dated 25/10/2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nkn2p |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Rupert Such; Executive Producer: Lorraine Newman; Writer: Jesse O'Mahoney |network=BBC |station=BBC One |city= |airdate=25 October 2012[/tpl]

===Notable relationships===

====Phil Mitchell====

Rainie's relationship with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil were to be involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, "If there are people who have a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." She also stated that if EastEnders "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a263922/franks-defends-eastenders-drug-plot.html|title=Franks defends 'EastEnders' drug plot|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=21 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]Quote_box |width=20%|align=right|quote="Rainie needs Tanya in her life"."They're almost acting like sisters now because Rainie's trying this time, and Tanya doesn't want to turn her back on her.

====Tanya====

Rainie's relationship with Tanya has always been fractured, though Rainie tries to resolve the tension with Tanya during her return in 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a332058/eastenders-video-tanyas-family-dilemma.html|title='EastEnders' Video: Tanya's family dilemma|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=28 July 2011|format=video[/tpl] When Rainie was first announced on 13 July 2007, it was said Rainie was said to "drag up a past which Tanya would rather forget".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a65356/summer-preview-eastenders.html|title=Exclusive: Summer Preview: EastEnders|last=Green|first=Kris|date=13 July 2007|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK|accessdate=21 April 2011[/tpl] Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay and forgive her and then going back on the promise, which leads Rainie to be kicked out. When Franks returned in 2010 she said "she was disappointed not to be working with Joyner this time." On her return to for Tanya's wedding, a spokesperson said, “Tanya soon softens towards Rainie and her mother but will the harmony last between all three women or will past problems cause the women to Cross swords once again?”.[tpl]cite web|first=Charlotte|title=Exclusive: Q&A with Bryan Kirkwood|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood|publisher=Walford Web|accessdate=10 July 2011[/tpl]  Franks has commented that she is excited about exploring the family dynamic between the Cross ladies in upcoming storylines and her future in EastEnders.

==Reception==

200px|thumb|right|The storyline in which viewers saw Phil and Rainie on a drug binge prompted over 200 complaints.Franks said that after her stint in 2008, many people recognised her in the street and asked if she would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. ... We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. ... We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a259613/bbc-defends-eastenders-drug-scenes.html|title=BBC defends 'EastEnders' drug scenes|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=11 August 2010|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=11 August 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/response/100810_res_eastenders_drugs|title=EastEnders, scenes featuring Phil and Raine under the influence of drugs inappropriate, BBC One|date=9 August 2010|work=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2011|location=London[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, "I was shocked at the content of the episode.
