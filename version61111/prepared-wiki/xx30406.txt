Leuven (Dutch, pronounced [tpl]IPA-nl|ˈl̪øːvə(n̪)||Nl-Leuven.ogg[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Louvain[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA-fr|luvɛ̃|[/tpl], often used in English) is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region, Belgium. It is located about [tpl]convert|25|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] east of Brussels, close to other neighbouring towns such as Mechelen, Aarschot, Tienen, and Wavre. The township itself comprises the historical city of Leuven and the former municipalities of Heverlee, Kessel-Lo, a part of Korbeek-Lo, Wilsele and Wijgmaal.
It is home to Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer group and one of the top-five largest consumer-goods companies in the world; and to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. It is also home to the UZ Leuven, one of the largest hospitals of Europe.

==History==

The earliest mention of Leuven ("Loven") is from 891, when a Viking army was defeated by the Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia (see: Battle of Leuven). According to city legend, its red-white-red colours depict the blood-stained shores of the river Dijle after this battle.
Situated beside this river, and near to the stronghold of the Dukes of Brabant, Leuven became, between the 11th and 14th centuries, the most important centre of trade in the duchy. A token of its former importance as a centre of cloth manufacture is  reflected in the typical Leuven linen cloth, known in late-14th-century and 15th-century texts as lewyn (other spellings: Leuwyn, Levyne, Lewan(e), Lovanium, Louvain).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/yrl/reference/maps/blaeu/germania-inferior-nt.htm#prima_brabantiae |title=Blaeu Atlas (UCLA Library – YRL Reference and Instructional Services) |publisher=Library.ucla.edu |date=2003-04-02 |accessdate=2011-09-16[/tpl]
In the 15th century, a new golden era began with the founding of the by-now largest and oldest university in the Low Countries, the Catholic University of Leuven, in 1425.
In the 18th century,  the Leuven-located brewery Den Horen (meaning "the horn") flourished. In 1708, Sebastien Artois became the master brewer at Den Horen, and gave his name to the brewery in 1717, now part of AB InBev, whose flagship beer, Stella Artois, is brewed in Leuven and sold in many countries.
During its history, Leuven was besieged or occupied by foreign armies several times, including the Battle of Leuven (891), Siege of Leuven (1635) and Battle of Leuven (1831).
In the 20th century, both world wars inflicted major damage upon the city. Upon Germany's entry into World War I, the town was heavily damaged by rampaging soldiers. Some German soldiers shot the burgomaster, the university rector and all of the city's police officers.Michael S. Neiberg, Fighting the Great War: A Global History, Harvard University Press, 2005. p. 15. In all, about 300 civilians lost their lives.[tpl]Cite EB1922|wstitle=Louvain[/tpl] The university library was also destroyed on 25 August 1914, using petrol and incendiary pastilles.[tpl]cite book |title= Dynamic Of Destruction, Culture and mass killing in the first world war |last= Kramer|first= Alan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn= 9781846140136[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last= Gibson  |first= Craig |title= The culture of destruction in the First World War |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date= January 30, 2008 |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3277792.ece |accessdate= 2008-02-18[/tpl] 230,000 volumes were lost in the destruction, including Gothic and Renaissance manuscripts, a collection of 750 medieval manuscripts, and more than 1,000 incunabula (books printed before 1501).Knuth 2006, p. 164. The destruction of the library shocked the world, with the Daily Chronicle describing it as war not only against civilians but also against "posterity to the utmost generation."Tuchman 1962, p. 321. It was rebuilt after the war, and much of the collection was replaced.  Great Britain (on the initiative of the John Rylands Library, Manchester) and the United States were major providers of material for the replenishment of the collection. The new library building was financed by the National Committee of the United States for the Restoration of the University of Louvain and built to the design of architect Whitney Warren; it was officially opened on 4 July 1928.The burning of the library of Leuven and the international response, Mark Derez, 2012, University Archives KU Leuven (pp. 9-12)
In World War II, after the start of the German offensive, Leuven formed part of the British Expeditionary Force's front line and was defended by units of the 3rd Division and Belgian troops. From 14 to 16 May, the German Army Group B assaulted the city with heavy air and artillery support. The British withdrew their forces to the River Senne on the night of 16 May and the town was occupied the next day.*Ellis, L. F. (1954) The War in France and Flanders 1939–1940. J. R. M. Butler (ed.). HMSO. London (p. 62) The new university library building was set on fire by shelling on 16 May and nearly a million books were lost.Derez p. 13

==Economy==

Given the presence of the KULeuven, an important European institution for academic research and education, much of the local economy is concentrated on spin-offs from academic research. There are several biotech and ICT companies; [tpl]Ill|nl|Gasthuisberg[/tpl], the academic hospital and research centre and a large number of private service providers in the medical and legal fields.
Because it is the capital of the region of Flemish-Brabant, many governmental institutions are located in Leuven, as well as the regional headquarters of transport corporations such as De Lijn.
As the largest and one of the oldest Flemish cities in the immediate vicinity, with a large range of cafés, restaurants, cultural institutions and shopping neighbourhoods, Leuven also attracts people from nearby cities and villages.
Leuven is the worldwide headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest beer company in the world. InBev's Stella Artois brewery and main offices dominate the entire north-eastern part of the town, between the railway station and the canal to Mechelen.

Leuven sports one of the liveliest bar scenes in Belgium. It boasts the "longest bar" in Europe, the Old Market, and dozens of bars and cafés crammed into a central square in Leuven.
The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven; University of Leuven) is the oldest Catholic university still in existence in the world, and the largest university in Belgium.
There are also a number of hogescholen (Vocational university, literally translated: "high schools"), such as the [tpl]Ill|nl|Katholieke Hogeschool Leuven[/tpl] (KHLeuven, the Catholic High School Leuven), and the university college Groep T (Group T).

==Transportation==

Within the city and its immediate surroundings most distances can be covered on foot or with a bicycle. Several streets are off-limits to vehicle traffic and within the city centre road speed regulations prescribe [tpl]convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] as the maximum speed limit, making it a pedestrian and biker-friendly city. There are also a few car parking lots.
There are numerous buses, primarily from the public transportation company De Lijn, that connect the city with the region while providing travel options within the city center. The so-called Ringbus follows the ring road of the city. Except for long distance routes (such as to other cities) and other irregular bus services, most buses come by every 10 minutes. Buses 616, 652 and 651 connect Leuven with Brussels Airport.
The train station of Leuven is located on the railways 35 (Leuven - Aarschot - Hasselt), 36 (Brussels - Liège), 36N (Schaarbeek - Leuven), 53 (Schellebelle - Leuven), and 139 (Leuven - Ottignies). In Bierbeek, south-west of Leuven, lies the beginning of HSL 2, the high-speed railway towards Liège.
