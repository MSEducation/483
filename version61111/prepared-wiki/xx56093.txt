[[Human Being (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1998 albums, Seal albums, Albums produced by Trevor Horn, Warner Bros. Records albums

Human Being  is the third album by Seal.  It was released in 1998 as a tribute to the murdered rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. Human Being received mixed reviews ranging from being panned for its overtly dark and moody feel, to being described in terms such as "pop perfection." The album failed to sell in the same way as his 1994 multi-platinum album, Seal.
A remix of "Lost My Faith" was featured over the closing credits of the 1999 film Entrapment, and the song's single release was accompanied by a music video in which Seal is integrated into scenes from the film alongside Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
