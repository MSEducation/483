[[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]

CATEGORIES: Eurozone fiscal matters

The European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was a system introduced by the European Community in March 1979, as part of the European Monetary System (EMS), to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in Europe, in preparation for Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of a single currency, the euro, which took place on 1 January 1999.
After the adoption of the euro, policy changed to linking currencies of countries outside the eurozone to the euro (having the common currency as a central point). The goal was to improve stability of those currencies, as well as to gain an evaluation mechanism for potential eurozone members. This mechanism is known as ERM II and has superseded ERM. Currently there are just two countries in the ERM II, the Danish krone and the Lithuanian litas.

==Intent and operation of the ERM==

The ERM is based on the concept of fixed currency exchange rate margins, but with exchange rates variable within those margins. This is also known as a semi-pegged system.  Before the introduction of the euro, exchange rates were based on the European Currency Unit (ECU), the European unit of account, whose value was determined as a weighted average of the participating currencies.
A grid (known as the Parity Grid) of bilateral rates was calculated on the basis of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and currency fluctuations had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%).Phase 2: the European Monetary System, European Commission, http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/emu/road/ems_en.htm Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.

==Irish pound breaks parity with pound sterling==

To participate in the ERM, Ireland had to break the Irish pound's parity with the pound sterling in 1979, because the pound sterling, which was not an ERM currency, appreciated against all ERM currencies shortly after the launch of the ERM. The continued parity between the Irish pound and the pound sterling would have taken the Irish pound outside its agreed band. To fulfil the ERM conditions, the Irish government was required to break the parity of the Irish pound with the pound sterling.[ref]

==Pound sterling's forced withdrawal from the ERM==

The United Kingdom entered the ERM in October 1990, but was forced to exit the programme within two years after the pound sterling came under major pressure from currency speculators, including George Soros. The ensuing crash of 16 September 1992 was subsequently dubbed "Black Wednesday". There has been some revision of attitude towards this event given the UK's strong economic performance after 1992, with some commentators dubbing it "White Wednesday".[ref]

Some commentators, following Norman Tebbit, took to referring to ERM as an "Eternal Recession Mechanism",[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/feb/10/freedomofinformation.economy|author=Tebbit, Norman|title=An electoral curse yet to be lifted|accessdate=30 December 2008 | work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=10 February 2005 [/tpl] after the UK fell into recession in 1990. The UK spent over £6 billion trying to keep the currency within the narrow limits with reports at the time widely noting that Soros's individual profit of £1 billion equated to over £12 for each man, woman and child in Britain[tpl]cite book|last=Slater|first=Robert|title=Soros : the life, times & trading secrets of the world's greatest investor|year=1996|publisher=Irwin Professional Pub.|location=Burr Ridge, Ill.|isbn=0786303611|page=186|url=http://books.google.com/books?cd=1&id=js_OAAAAIAAJ&dq=soros+pound+man+woman+and+child+in+britain&q=+man+woman+and+child#search_anchor[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Constable|first=Nick|title=This is gambling|year=2003|publisher=Sanctuary|location=London|isbn=1860744958|pages=46, 168|url=http://books.google.com/books?cd=2&id=3OZTqgObT5EC&dq=soros+pound+man+woman+and+child+in+britain&q=+man+woman+and+child+#search_anchor[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Slater|first=Robert|title=Soros the world's most influential investor|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0071608451|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J7I26pZK8TUC&pg=PP1&dq=soros+pound+man+woman+and+child+in+britain&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%20man%20woman%20and%20child%20in%20britain&f=false[/tpl] and dubbing Soros as "the man who broke the Bank of England".
Britain's membership of the ERM was also blamed for the prolonging of the recession at the time,[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2259648.stm | publisher=BBC News | first=Evan | last=Davis | title=Lessons learned on 'Black Wednesday' | date=15 September 2002[/tpl] and Britain's exit from the ERM was seen as an economic failure which contributed significantly to the defeat of the Conservative government of John Major at the general election in May 1997, despite the strong economic recovery and significant fall in unemployment which that government had overseen after Black Wednesday.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005[/tpl]

==Increase of margins==

In August 1993, the margin had to be expanded to 15% to accommodate speculation against the French franc and other currencies.
