King Zhaoxiang of Qin or King Zhao of Qin (秦昭襄王 or 秦昭王) (324–251 BC) was the son of King Huiwen and younger brother of King Wu. 

==Biography==

After the death of Wu in 306 BC, Zhao contended for the crown of Qin with his younger brother. With the support of King Wuling of Zhao, Zhao finally ascended the throne. During Zhao's reign, the Qin general Bai Qi captured the Chu capital Ying in 278 BC. In 260 BC, King Zhao won the vital Battle of Changping against the State of Zhao when General Bai Qi encircled the Zhao army and forced its surrender. He decided to massacre all 400,000 of the Zhao survivors.
Under Zhao, Qin captured territory of the Yiqu (義渠) semipastoral people, acquiring the later commanderies of Longxi, Beidi (北地), and Shang (上), and built “long walls” for protection against the Hu, a northwestern nomadic people.Nicola Di Cosmo, The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China//The Cambridge History of Ancient China, p. 961
