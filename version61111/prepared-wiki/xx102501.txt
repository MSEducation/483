The South Vietnam national football team (Vietnamese: Đội tuyển túc cầu quốc gia Việt Nam Cộng hòa) was the national team of South Vietnam controlled by Vietnam Football Association (now Vietnam Football Federation) between 1949 and 1975. It took part in the first two Asian Cups finals (1956 and 1960), finishing fourth both times. The team also entered qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup.
The team ceased to exist when the North and South regions combined into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. For results after 1991, see the article Vietnam national football team (no matches were played between 1976 and 1990).
