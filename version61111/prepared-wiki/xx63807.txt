Mendip is a local government district of Somerset in England. The Mendip district covers a largely rural area of [tpl]convert|285|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Download.asp?path=%2FDocuments%2FA+Portrait+of+Mendip%2Epdf|title=A Portrait of Mendip|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=2009-05-19[/tpl] ranging from the Mendip Hills through on to the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 110,000. The administrative centre of the district is Shepton Mallet but the largest town (three times larger than Shepton Mallet) is Frome, pronounced "Froome" and spelt that way until about 1890.
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the municipal boroughs of Glastonbury and Wells, along with Frome, Shepton Mallet, Street urban districts, and Frome Rural District, Shepton Mallet Rural District, Wells Rural District, and part of Axbridge Rural District and part of Clutton Rural District.

==Toponymy==

Several explanations for the name "Mendip" have been suggested. Its earliest known form is Mendepe in 1185. One suggestion is that it is derived from the medieval term "Myne-deepes".[tpl]cite web | title= Mendip Hills Natural Area profile |publisher = English Nature | url= http://www.english-nature.org.uk/science/natural/profiles%5CnaProfile84.pdf | format = PDF |date=January 1998 | accessdate=2006-07-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/publications/up_081015_autumn07_lo.pdf |title=Autumn newsletter 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |format=PDF |work=Mendip Hills AONB [/tpl] However, A D Mills derives its meaning from Celtic monith, meaning mountain or hill, with an uncertain second element, perhaps Old English yppe in the sense of upland, or plateau.Dictionary of English Place Names
An alternative explanation is that the name is cognate with Mened (Welsh mynydd), a Brythonic term for upland moorland. The suffix may be a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon hop, meaning a valley. Possible further meanings have been identified. The first is 'the stone pit' from the Celtic meyn and dyppa in reference to the collapsed cave systems of Cheddar. The second is 'Mighty and Awesome' from the Old English moen and deop.[tpl]cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1-874336-03-2[/tpl]
Yet another explanation is that Mendip is cognate with the Basque word 'mendi' meaning mountain. This would support the theory of a Basque-like language in use in the British isles before the emergence of the Celtic languages. This is supported by recent DNA evidence that shows exceptionally strong genetic links between the British Celtic people and the Basques.

==Settlements==

Frome, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet are the only towns in the district, as Wells has city status and Street has maintained its status as a village  despite a population in excess of 11,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Street Parish Council|url=http://www.street-pc.gov.uk/|publisher=Street Parish Council|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl]
