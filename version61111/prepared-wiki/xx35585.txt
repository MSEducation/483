The park is located in the Napier Range and covers an area of [tpl]convert|91|ha|acre[/tpl].

The tunnel component of Tunnel Creek has a length of approximately [tpl]convert|750|m|abbr=on[/tpl] that runs underground and it one of the oldest cave systems in Western Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kimberleyaustralia.com/tunnel-creek-national-park.html |title=Kimberley Australia - Tunnel Creek National Park|year=2009|accessdate=19 February 2009[/tpl] The reef was first exposed around 250 million years ago and the first cave systems began to form, the present cave systems were created about 20 million years ago.
The cave reaches a maximum height of [tpl]convert|12|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and has a maximum width of [tpl]convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The creek was once known as "The Cave of the Bats" with at least five species of bat inhabiting the cavern. There are large pools of water on the floor of the cave in which freshwater crocodiles have been found. The pools indicate that the water table is only just below the present floor surface and water only flows through the area after heavy rainfall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agfg.com.au/guide/wa/kimberley/kimberley/derby/attractions-tourism/tunnel-creek-national-park|title=Australian Good Food and Travel Guide - Tunnel Creek National Park|year=2009|accessdate=19 February 2009[/tpl]
