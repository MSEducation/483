Giacomo IV Crispo was the last Duke of the Archipelago, ruling from 1564, when he succeeded his father Giovanni IV Crispo (r. 1517–64), until the duchy was attributed to Joseph Nasi in 1566. He then fled to Venice, to which he ceded his titles to the duchy and whose service he entered. He served as an officer in the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1570–1573 over Cyprus, and died in Venice in 1576.
