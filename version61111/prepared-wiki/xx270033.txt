==Career==

Contrary to popular misconception, she is not a Muslim (Amira in Arabic means "Princess"); her adopted Arabic name, 'Amira', was merely given to her by Egyptian friends of hers during a spell in Cairo and she consequently decided to stick with it.
Bennison's most recent book The Great Caliphs: the golden age of the â€˜Abbasid empire was runner-up for the Longman-History Today Book of the Year Award 2009. In the view of critic Hugh N. Kennedy, she has "a lively and engaging style", and the book will be "the first port of call for anyone looking for an introduction to the 'golden age of Islam'."
