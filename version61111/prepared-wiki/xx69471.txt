[[Adaptive Communication Environment]]

CATEGORIES: Application programming interfaces, Cross-platform software, C++ libraries

The Adaptive Communication Environment (often referred to as ACE) is an open-source framework used for network programming. It provides a set of object-oriented C++ classes designed to help address the inherent complexities and challenges in network programming by preventing common errors.C++ Network Programming, Volume 1, Schmidt and Huston, Addison Wesley Professional, 2001

==History==

ACE was initially developed by Douglas C. Schmidt during his graduate work at the University of California, Irvine. Development followed him to the Washington University in St. Louis where he was employed. ACE was released by WU's Distributed Object Computer (DOC) group as open source software. Development continued as part of the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) at Vanderbilt University.ACE Programmer's Guide, The: Practical Design Patterns for Network and Systems Programming, Huston, Johnson and Syyid, Addison Wesley Professional, 2003

==Features==

ACE provides a standardized usage for operating system/machine specific features. It provides common data types and methodsWrapper Facade, A Structural Pattern for Encapsulating Functions within Classes, Schmidt, http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/wrapper-facade.pdf, access October 22, 2008 to access the powerful but complex features of modern operating systems. These include: inter-process communication, thread management, efficient memory management, etc. 
It was designed to be portable and provide a common framework. The same code will work on most Unixes, Microsoft Windows, VxWorks, QNX, OpenVMS, etc., with minimal changes.Porting ACE to a New OS, http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/docs/ACE-porting.html, accessed Oct. 22, 2008 Due to this cross-platform support, it has been widely used in the development of communication software. Some of the successful projects that have used ACE includes: Motorola Iridium satellites, Boeing Wedgetail's Australian airborne early warning & control (AEW&C) system, and others.ACE and TAO Success Stories, http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-users.html, Accessed Oct. 22, 2008
