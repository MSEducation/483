In demonology, Raum is a Great Earl of Hell, ruling thirty legions of demons.  He is depicted as a crow which adopts human form at the request of the conjurer.
" 'Raum', Reym (Rey) or Raim is a great earle, he is seene as a crowe, but when he putteth on humane shape, at the commandement of the exorcist, he stealeth woonderfullie out of the kings house, and carrieth it whether he is assigned, he destroieth cities, and hath great despite unto dignities, he knoweth things present, past, and to come, and reconcileth freends and foes, he was of the order of thrones, and governeth thirtie legions. He loves children and will target their souls."
- Johann Weyer, from the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum.

==Characteristics==

Raum steals treasures out of kings' houses, carrying them where he wishes, and destroys cities and dignities of men (he is said to have great dispraise for dignities). Raum can also tell things past, present and future, reconcile friends and foes, and invoke love.

==Etymology==

'Raum' in German means "space, room, chamber"; 'räumen' means to empty, evacuate.  See lebensraum, literally "living room" (that is, room for living - like an aquarium for fish, not a living room).
Other spellings: Raim, Raym, Räum.
