The calcitriol receptor, also known as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and  also known as NR1I1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 1), is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Moore DD, Kato S, Xie W, Mangelsdorf DJ, Schmidt DR, Xiao R, Kliewer SA | title = International Union of Pharmacology.

In humans, the vitamin D receptor is encoded by the VDR gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Szpirer J, Szpirer C, Riviere M, Levan G, Marynen P, Cassiman JJ, Wiese R, DeLuca HF | title = The Sp1 transcription factor gene (SP1) and the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor gene (VDR) are colocalized on human chromosome arm 12q and rat chromosome 7 | journal = Genomics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 168–73 |date=September 1991 | pmid = 1662663 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90114-T| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0888-7543(91)90114-T [/tpl]
Glucocorticoids are known to decrease expression of VDR, which is expressed in most tissues of the body and regulate intestinal transport of calcium.

==Function==

This gene encodes the nuclear hormone receptor for vitamin D3. This receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid. The receptor belongs to the family of trans-acting transcriptional regulatory factors and shows similarity of sequence to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Germain P, Staels B, Dacquet C, Spedding M, Laudet V | title = Overview of nomenclature of nuclear receptors | journal = Pharmacol.

Downstream targets of this nuclear hormone receptor are involved principally in mineral metabolism though the receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic pathways, such as those involved in the immune response and cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Adorini L, Daniel KC, Penna G | title = Vitamin D receptor agonists, cancer and the immune system: an intricate relationship | journal = Curr Top Med Chem | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 1297–301 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16848743 | doi = 10.2174/156802606777864890| url =  [/tpl]
Mutations in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation start site three codons downstream. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: VDR vitamin D (1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=7421| accessdate = [/tpl] 
The vitamin D receptor plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle. Loss of VDR is associated with hair loss in experimental animals.[tpl]cite journal | author = Luderer HF, Demay MB | title = The vitamin D receptor, the skin and stem cells | journal = J.
