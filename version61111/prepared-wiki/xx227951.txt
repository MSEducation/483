==Political career==

Ashley, who held the rank of Colonel in the British Army,Christof Mauch, Thomas Zeller, The world beyond the windshield: roads and landscapes in the United States and Europe, Ohio University Press, 2008, p. 169 was well known as an activist in various pressure groups before commencing his party political career. He was a leading figure in the Navy League and also set up the anti-state intervention No More Waste Committee during the First World War.Frank McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, appeasement, and the British road to war, Manchester University Press, 1998, p. 96 He was subsequently involved in the foundation of the Comrades of the Great War in 1917 and as President of the group helped to ensure that the ex-servicemen's movement was closely linked to the Conservative Party at its foundation.Niall Barr, The lion and the poppy: British veterans, politics, and society, 1921-1939, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, pp. 12-13
Ashley was elected to parliament in 1906 to represent Blackpool, holding the seat until 1918 before subsequently sitting as member for Fylde until 1922 and New Forest from 1922 to 1932.Cameron Hazlehurst, Sally Whitehead, Christine Woodland, A guide to the papers of British cabinet ministers, 1900-1964, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 30 He served under Andrew Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Parliamentary Secretary to the Office of Works from October 1922 until October 1923, when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War, which he remained until January 1924. Ashley was sworn of the Privy Council in February 1924[tpl]London Gazette |issue=32910 |date=22 February 1924 |startpage=1549 [/tpl] and when the Conservatives returned to power under Baldwin in November of that year he was made Minister for Transport,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=32992 |date=14 November 1924 |startpage=8241 [/tpl] an office he retained until the fall of the Baldwin administration in 1929. He left the House of Commons in 1932 and was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple, of Lee in the County of Southampton,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=33790 |date=15 January 1932 |startpage=346 [/tpl] a revival of the title held by his great-uncle.
Lord Mount Temple remained active within the House of Lords and was a vocal supporter of the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany. He admired Adolf Hitler for his anti-communism, although much of his conviction rested on the belief that the Treaty of Versailles had been unjust to begin with and that it should be revised regardless of who was in government in Germany.McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, pp. 96-97 In order to underline his support for the Germans Ashley was instrumental in establishing the Anglo-German Fellowship in 1935.McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, p. 97 He served as chairman of both this group and Anti-Socialist Union simultaneously in the later 1930s.Thomas P. Linehan, British Fascism, 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture, Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 46
As AGF chairman, Lord Mount Temple (as he now was) visited Germany in mid 1937 and held a meeting with Hitler.N. J. Crowson, Facing fascism: the Conservative party and the European dictators, 1935-1940, Routledge, 1997, p. 23 However, unlike some of his contemporaries in the Fellowship, the laissez-faire capitalist Mount Temple did not support ideological Nazism (perhaps due in part to the fact that his wife was Jewish) and he resigned in protest from the chairmanship in the aftermath of Kristallnacht, although his membership of the group continued.Crowson, Facinf Fascism, p. 32

==Personal life==

Lord Mount Temple married Amalia Mary Maud Cassel, daughter and only child of financier Sir Ernest Cassel, in early January, 1901. Amongst the wedding guests was The Prince Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales (the wedding taking place on 4 January, only eighteen days before Albert Edward became King-Emperor), who was a friend of Cassel.Sidney Lee, King Edward VII: A Biography, Part 2, Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 62 The couple had two daughters: Edwina, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and Ruth Mary Clarisse (wife of Alec Cunningham-Reid, later Gardner, later Lady Delamere). After his first wife's early death he married, as his second wife, Muriel Emily ("Molly") Forbes-Sempill, the former wife of Rear-Admiral The Hon. A.L.O. Forbes-Sempill and daughter of The Rev. Walter Spencer. Lord Mount Temple died in July 1939, aged 71, when the barony became extinct.
