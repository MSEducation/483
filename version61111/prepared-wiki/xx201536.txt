==Notable former players==

===Ireland===

In 1879 Ashley Cummins became the first UCC player to represent Ireland. Since then at least 55 UCC players have played for the full national team. 34 of these played for Ireland while still playing for UCC. Donal Lenihan was the last UCC player to be capped by Ireland while still attached to the club. 

===British and Irish Lions===

As well as representing Ireland, at least 9  UCC players also went onto represent the British and Irish Lions. At least two of these players, Mick Lane and Tom Kiernan, were still UCC players when they toured with the Lions.The Ireland Rugby Miscellany (2007): Ciaran Cronin
