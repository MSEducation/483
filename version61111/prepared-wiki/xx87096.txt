Ftn (Flextech Television Network) was a television channel from Virgin Media Television (formerly known as Flextech) transmitting free-to-air on Freeview and Virgin Media, and as a subscription channel on Sky Digital. The channel was broadcast between 18:00 and 06:00 daily. It launched at 18:00 on 15 January 2003, six hours after neighbouring Freeview channel, UKTV Bright Ideas, also partially owned by Virgin Media Television which itself closed down on 14 October 2007. 
Ftn's schedule featured entertainment and reality programming, and also programming from other Virgin Media Television cable channels, such as Living, Living2, Bravo, Bravo 2, Trouble, and Challenge. This provided a preview to Freeview viewers of what the other Virgin Media channels offered, in a similar fashion to BSkyB's Sky3, a channel also on Freeview.
Ftn +1 launched on Sky and Virgin Media on 9 August 2007. Despite being a one hour timeshift, Ftn +1 only broadcast from 19:00 until 01:00 as Live Roulette TV which was shown on Ftn from 00:00 till 03:00 could not be rebroadcast an hour later for legal reasons.
