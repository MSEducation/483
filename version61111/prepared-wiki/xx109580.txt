Queen Margaret University (formerly Queen Margaret University College and Queen Margaret College) is a modern university located in Musselburgh, East Lothian near Edinburgh in Scotland. It is named after Saint Margaret, wife of King Malcolm III of Scotland.

==History==

Queen Margaret University was founded in 1875, as The Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy, by Christian Guthrie Wright and Louisa Stevenson,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.qmu.ac.uk/the_university_college/history.htm| title = History:  From Edinburgh School of Cookery to Queen Margaret University| accessdate = 2007-04-11| publisher = Queen Margaret University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216191206/http://www.qmu.ac.uk/the_university_college/history.htm  |archivedate = 2007-02-16[/tpl] both members of the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association.  The School was founded as a women-only institution, with twin aims of improving women's access to higher education and improving the diets of working class families.  Teaching was initially delivered via lectures at the Royal Museum, supplemented by a programme of public lectures and demonstrations delivered nationwide, but in 1877 the School established a base at Shandwick Place, in Haymarket.
The school moved in 1891 to Atholl Crescent, expanding its courses and offering residential places to students.  In 1909, the School was designated a Central Institution and brought under the public control of the Scottish Education Department.  The first Principal appointed was Ethel De la Cour.Tom Begg, ‘Cour, Ethel Maud De la (1869–1957)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, OUP, 2004 accessed 11 April 2007  De la Cour retired in 1930, and in the same year the School became the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/07/QMUCUniversityTitle/Q/Page/2| title = Consultation on Award of University Title to Queen Margaret University College| accessdate = 2007-04-11| publisher = Scottish Executive[/tpl]
In 1961, the College acquired its Corstorphine campus, purchasing a portion of the Clermiston estate from developers.  The campus was first occupied by the College in 1970, opened by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester who was Patron of the institution until her death in 2004.  In 1972, the name Queen Margaret College was adopted to dissociate the College from the narrow field of domestic science.  Thereafter, the College broadened its range of courses, especially in the paramedical and healthcare fields.  The following institutions have since been absorbed by Queen Margaret College:
In 1992, the Privy Council granted Queen Margaret College powers to award its own taught degrees, and in 1998, the College was granted full degree powers, which enabled it to award its own research and higher degrees. As a result, in 1999 the College took the name Queen Margaret University College. After further improvements to the college, the institution was awarded full university status, becoming Queen Margaret University in January 2007.QM relocates

==Campuses==

===Former campuses===

Before moving to a new campus in Musselburgh, Queen Margaret University had been based in campuses in Corstorphine (to the West of Edinburgh), in Leith, and at the Gateway Theatre – Scotland's International Drama Centre – (a former television studio previously owned by Scottish Television) on Elm Row, Leith Walk.

===Musselburgh campus===

In 2007-2008, the university brought together students from its three campuses in Edinburgh by moving to a new purpose-built campus in Musselburgh, just east of Edinburgh. Costing £100 million, the new campus covers [tpl]convert|35|acre|m2[/tpl] and holds educational buildings, a students union, a small gym and halls of residence of more than 800 rooms.
QMU has been "touted as the country's greenest University campus".[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/press_releases/royalopening.htm| title =Press release: Royal opening for UK's 'greenest' university| accessdate = 2009-03-04| publisher =Queen Margaret University[/tpl] The campus was designed by Dyer Architects to exceed current environmental standards and sets a new benchmark in sustainable design. The entire development transformed a [tpl]convert|35|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] site from low-grade farmland into landscaped parkland.
The relocation provoked a negative reaction from some students and student union protesters after building firm Carillion failed to complete the campus on time. Drama students were stranded at the already sold Gateway Theatre for several months, and student union and sports facilities were uncompleted as of December 2007: both the Drama School and Student Union facilities opened in March 2008. The new campus has provoked mixed reactions from students and members of the public, with some considering the campus to be a benchmark in design.

====Learning Resource Centre====

The Learning Resource Centre (LRC) comprises approximately 4500 m2 of the main academic building. Located at the heart of the campus, it provides library, IT and AV services to students, staff and visitors of the university. The LRC consists of a facility for both directed and self-directed study, based on an integrated library and information service provision. The LRC has 1,000 study spaces organised as a mixture of silent and group study areas, bookable group study rooms, training rooms, assistive technology, student learning support and a postgraduate study room.

====Education Resource Centre====

The Education Resource Centre provides audio-visual services to the university. This includes the provision of AV equipment in classrooms and lecture theatres as well as more specialised services such as graphics, photography, video-conferencing and TV studio facilities.

===Asia Campus===

The Queen Margaret University, Asia Campus opened in April 2008 and provides business degrees to about 1,600 students. The campus is located in a former school building in the Balestier District of Singapore and is a joint venture with a private education provider.

==Recent achievements==

Queen Margaret University has just launched a new Master’s degree in gastronomy. This is a unique qualification and the first of its kind in the UK, which will allow students to engage with the broad range of issues connected with food, provenance, diet, health, and nutrition. The degree is not just about food, but also encompasses the cultural, historical, and anthropological aspects of Scotland as well as the science of food, the marketplace, and all the political and economic issues that relate to food.
Queen Margaret University is the first higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host the Children’s University. The Queen Margaret Children’s University aims to help school children, aged between 7 and 14 years of age, become confident learners and broaden their horizons. It will be the second Children’s University established in Scotland but the first initiative for young people in the east of the country. 
The South East Scotland Academies’ Partnership (SESAP) is a ground breaking collaboration which is helping young people maximise their educational opportunities and develop transferable skills; smooth the transition between school, college, university and employment; and support the development of Scotland’s most important industries. The Academy model was borne out of a highly successful collaboration between Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh College and East Lothian Council which, in 2012, launched the East Lothian Hospitality and Tourism Academy.
In 2012, QMU became the first university in Scotland to have a Business Gateway [tpl]cite web| url = http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/press_releases/Business-Gateway.htm| title = Business Gateway to be based at Queen Margaret University | accessdate = 2011-02-14 |archiveurl = http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/press_releases/Business-Gateway.htm |archivedate = 2011-02-04[/tpl] on campus.
