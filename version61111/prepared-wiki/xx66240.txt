The Straits of Johor (also known as the Tebrau Strait, Johor Strait, Selat Johor, Selat Tebrau, and Tebrau Reach) is a strait that separates the Malaysian state of Johor on mainland Eurasia to the north from Singapore to the south.

==History==

The Straits of Johor is the location of two Victoria Cross deeds. The award was for Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser and Acting Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis for the sinking of the 9,850-tonne Japanese cruiser Takao on 31 July 1945.
There are currently two man-made land connections over the straits. The Johor-Singapore Causeway, known simply as "The Causeway", links Johor Bahru and Woodlands in Singapore, while a bridge, known as the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, further west of the straits links Gelang Patah in Johor and Tuas in Singapore.
In 2003, Malaysia wanted to build a bridge across the strait to replace the existing causeway, but negotiations with Singapore were not successful. The main reasons cited for the change were: 
In August 2003, Malaysia announced that it was going ahead with a plan to build a gently sloping, curved bridge that would join up with Singapore's half of the existing causeway. The plans included a swing bridge for the railway line.Singapore objected to bridge to replace Causeway However, plans to build the bridge have been called off as of 2006.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The area is also a source of contention due to Singapore's land reclamation projects on its north-eastern islands. There have been suggestions that the ongoing land reclamation projects may impact the maritime boundary, shipping lanes, and water ecology of the Malaysian side. Reclamation projects may also endanger the habitat and food source of dugongs, which are native to the straits.
