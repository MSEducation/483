Saturday's Voyeur is a live theatrical production played in Salt Lake City, run annually since 1978 by the Salt Lake Acting Company, created by Nancy Borgenicht and Allen Nevins.  Saturday's Voyeur is a parody of Utah life, Utah politics, and Utah religion (most notably, Mormonism and Mormon fundamentalism).  In fact, the name itself is a parody of the Mormon production Saturday's Warrior, by Lex de Azevedo.  Each year's production is different and reflects the contemporary issues in Utah news.
Saturday's Voyeur is considered SLAC's annual fundraiser and the theater is cabaret style, where patrons are permitted to bring their own food and alcoholic beverages.
