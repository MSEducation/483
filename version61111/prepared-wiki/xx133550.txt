Samadhi Sound (or samadhisound) is an independent record label founded by singer and musician David Sylvian after his departure from Virgin Records in the late nineties.
The label mainly serves as a platform for Sylvian to release his own work – the album Blemish was the first to appear on Samadhi Sound in 2003 – and that of artists usually associated to him, like his brother Steve Jansen and Harold Budd. Nine Horses, a collaboration between Sylvian, Jansen, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Burnt Friedman, Arve Henriksen and Stina Nordenstam, released their 2005 album  Snow Borne Sorrow on Samadhi Sound.
