==Neighborhood grocery==

Shopsin's first iteration was as a neighborhood grocery at the corner of Bedford and Morton streets in The Village. It, the stock and good will, but not the building, was purchased by Kenny Shopsin for $25,000 in 1973. He was undergoing intensive Freudian psychoanalysis at the time and lived in the neighborhood. His father put up the money. The previous owner had prepared and sold roast beef, a practice Shopsin continued.[tpl]cite book|title=Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin|year=2008|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-26493-0|pages=1, 29â€“31|edition=First|author=Kenny Shopsin and Carolynn Carreno|type=Hardcover[/tpl]
