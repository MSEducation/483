[[Controllability]]

CATEGORIES: Control theory

Controllability is an important property of a control system, and the controllability property plays a crucial role in many control problems, such as stabilization of unstable systems by feedback, or optimal control.
Controllability and observability are dual aspects of the same problem.
Roughly, the concept of controllability denotes the ability to move a system around in its entire configuration space using only certain admissible manipulations. The exact definition varies slightly within the framework or the type of models applied.
The following are examples of variations of controllability notions which have been introduced in the systems and control literature:

==State controllability==

The state of a system, which is a collection of the system's variables values, completely describes the system at any given time. In particular, no information on the past of a system is needed to help in predicting the future, if the states at the present time are known.
Complete state controllability (or simply controllability if no other context is given) describes the ability of an external input to move the internal state of a system from any initial state to any other final state in a finite time interval.[tpl]cite book|author=Katsuhiko Ogata|title=Modern Control Engineering|edition=3rd|year=1997|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-227307-1[/tpl][tpl]rp|737[/tpl]

==Continuous linear systems==

Consider the continuous linear time-variant system A Linear time-invariant system behaves the same but with the coefficients are constant in time.

===Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems===

Consider the continuous linear time-invariant system
where 

==Discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) systems==

===Example===

Assume that the initial state is zero.
The assumption made that the initial state is zero is merely for convenience.
Clearly if all states can be reached from the origin then any state can be reached from another state (merely a shift in coordinates).

===Analogy for example of n = 2===

Consider an analogy to the previous example system.
You are sitting in your car on an infinite, flat plane and facing north.
The goal is to reach any point in the plane by driving a distance in a straight line, come to a full stop, turn, and driving another distance, again, in a straight line.
If your car has no steering then you can only drive straight, which means you can only drive on a line (in this case the north-south line since you started facing north).
You are allowed to:
Although the 3-dimensional case is harder to visualize, the concept of controllability is still analogous.

==Nonlinear systems==

Nonlinear systems in the control-affine form
The controllability matrix for linear systems in the previous section can in fact be derived from this equation.

==Output controllability==

Output controllability is the related notion for the output of the system; the output controllability describes the ability of an external input to move the output from any initial condition to any final condition in a finite time interval. It is not necessary that there is any relationship between state controllability and output controllability. In particular:

==Controllability under input constraints==

In systems with limited control authority, it is often no longer possible to move any initial state to any final state inside the controllable subspace. This phenomenon is caused by constraints on the input that could be inherent to the system (e.g. due to saturating actuator) or imposed on the system for other reasons (e.g. due to safety-related concerns). The controllability of  systems with input and state constraints is studied in the context of reachability  and viability theory.[tpl]cite book|author=Jean-Pierre Aubin |title= Viability Theory |edition= |year=1991 |publisher=Birkhauser |location= |isbn=0-8176-3571-8 [/tpl]

==Controllability in the behavioural framework==

In the so-called behavioral system theoretic approach due to Willems (see people in systems and control), models considered do not directly define an inputâ€“output structure. In this framework systems are described by admissible trajectories of a collection of variables, some of which might be interpreted as inputs or outputs.
A system is then defined to be controllable in this setting, if any past part of a behavior (trajectory of the external veriables) can be concatenated with any future trajectory of the behavior in such a way that the concatenation is contained in the behavior, i.e. is part of the admissible system behavior.[tpl]cite book|author=Jan Polderman, Jan Willems|title=Introduction to Mathematical Systems Theory:  A Behavioral Approach|edition=1st|year=1998|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-98266-3[/tpl][tpl]rp|151[/tpl]

==Stabilizability==

A slightly weaker notion than controllability is that of stabilizability. A system is determined to be stabilizable when all uncontrollable states have stable dynamics. Thus, even though some of the states cannot be controlled (as determined by the controllability test above) all the states will still remain bounded during the system's behavior.[tpl]cite book|author1=Brian D.O.
