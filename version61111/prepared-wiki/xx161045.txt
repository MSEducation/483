Richard "Ricky D." Ditlevsen became a stunt performer in his early career. For 15 years worked with the National Enquirer's chief photo editor, Bill Graham, using the money to pursue his dream of being a television and film producer. Ricky D. was featured in many two page centerfolds for the National Enquirer, National Examiner, Star Magazine as well as hundreds of print syndications worldwide. In one of his notable stunts he rode his jet-ski through the hull of a large river boat, safely exiting the other side as pieces of the boat went flying in all directions.Newspaper: Editor; William Burt, "Man the Torpedo", National Examiner, page 24 & 25, July 26th, 1988. In another he took that jet-ski over a ramp that led him through multiple walls of flaming boards fixed some 20 feet over the river. He escaped with his tuxedo intact and only minor singes to his hair.Newspaper: Editor; William Burt, "All Fired Up!", National Examiner, page 25, Sept 5th, 1989.Newspaper: Editor; Martin Singerman, "Great Walls of Fire", Star Magazine, page 28 & 29, March 29th, 1988.

In the early 1990s he became an artist, and a prolific television producer. While producing over 750 television shows he became a television syndicator and in 1991 founded the Extreme Sports Television Network (ESN, LLC airing on Comcast).

More distribution will be announced soon and ESN is expected to be in 35 million homes by fourth quarter of 09. It’s also expected that by 2010 the network will be in 85 million homes nationally.
