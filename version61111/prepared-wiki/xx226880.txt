CATEGORIES: Shinto, Japanese religions terms, Buddhism in Japan, Shinbutsu shūgō

During the era of shinbutsu shūgō (religious syncretism of kami and buddhas) in Japan, a [tpl]nihongo|gongen|権現[/tpl] was believed to be the manifestation of an Indian buddha in the form of a local kami, an entity who had come to guide the people to salvation.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Gongen accessed on October 5, 2008Tamura (2000:87) The words [tpl]nihongo|gonge|権化[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|kegen|化現[/tpl] are synonyms of gongen. [tpl]nihongo|Gongen shinkō|権現信仰|lit. gongen belief[/tpl] is the belief in the existence of gongen.
The gongen concept is the cornerstone of the honji suijaku theory, according to which Indian Buddhist deities choose to appear to the Japanese as native kami in order to save them.

==History==

left|thumb|Tablet on torii at Nikkō Tōshō-gū reads "Tōshō Daigongen" (calligraphy by Emperor Go-Mizunoo)It is sometimes assumed that the word gongen derives from Tokugawa Ieyasu's posthumous name (Tōshō Daigongen). The term however was created and started being used in the middle of the Heian period in an effort to harmonize Buddhism and Shinto in what is called shinbutsu shūgō, or "syncretism of kami and buddhas".Tamura (2000:87) At that time, the assumption that Japanese kami and buddhas were essentially the same evolved into a theory called [tpl]nihongo|honji suijaku|本地垂迹[/tpl] which held that kami were manifestations (avatars) of buddhas, bodhisattvas and other Buddhist deities. The theory gradually spread around the country and the concept of gongen, a dual entity composed of a buddha and a kami, evolved. Under the influence of Tendai Buddhism and of Shugendō, the gongen concept was adapted to religious beliefs tied to Mount Iwaki, a volcano, so that female kami Kuniyasutamahime became associated with Jūichimen Kannon Bosatsu (eleven-faced Kannon), kami Ōkuninushi with Yakushi Nyorai, and Kunitokotachi no Mikoto with Amida Nyorai.Breen, Teeuwen (2000:194) 
The title gongen started being attached to the names of kami and shrines were built within the premises of large Buddhist temples to enshrine their tutelary kami.Tamura (2000:87) During the Japanese Middle Ages, shrines started being called with the name gongen to uderline their ties to Buddhism.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Gongen shinkō, accessed on October 5, 2008 For example, in Eastern  Japan there are still many Hakusan shrines where the shrine itself is called either gongen or jinja. Because it represents the application of Buddhist terminology to Shinto kami, the use of the term was legally abolished by the Meiji government with the [tpl]nihongo|Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order|神仏判然令|Shin-butsu Hanzenrei[/tpl], and shrines began to be called jinja.

==Gongen-zukuri==

[tpl]nihongo|Gongen-zukuri|権現造[/tpl] is the name of a complex Shinto shrine structure in which the haiden, or worship hall, and the honden, or main sanctuary, are interconnected under the same roof in the shape of an H.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Gongen-zukuri accessed on October 5, 2008For details about these terms, see the article Shinto shrine. One of the oldest examples of gongen-zukuri is Kitano Tenmangū in Kyoto. The name comes from Nikkō Tōshō-gū in Nikkō because, as we have seen, it enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen and adopts this structure.Jaanus, Gongen-zukuri, accessed on October 5, 2008
