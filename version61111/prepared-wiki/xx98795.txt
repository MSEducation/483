[[M-168 (Michigan highway)]]

CATEGORIES: Former state highways in Michigan, Transportation in Benzie County, Michigan

M-168 was one of the shortest state trunkline highways in the US state of Michigan, extending [tpl]convert|0.953|mi|km[/tpl] from a junction with M-22 in downtown Elberta to the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks. It followed the south shore of Lake Betsie (formed by the Betsie River before flowing into Lake Michigan). The highway was commissioned in 1931 and served as a connection to the car ferries until 1984. The road was being reconstructed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in preparation to transfer it to village control. That transfer happened on April 24, 2012, and now the former highway is a village street.

==Route description==

M-168 began at a junction with M-22 just west of where M-22 crosses over Lake Betsie.  Known as Frankfort Avenue, M-168 then traveled to the northwest near the shore of the lake through a mixed residential and commercial area before turning slightly westward onto Furnace Avenue. Along Furnace Avenue, the roadway is lined with homes on one side and lake frontage on the other. Eventually, the road curves to the west where it intersects Betsie Valley Trail coming to its terminus shortly thereafter at the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Frankfort+Ave&daddr=Furnace+St&hl=en&geocode=FTTVqAIdEEvc-g%3BFXD4qAIdRhDc-g&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=19&sll=44.619417,-86.226159&sspn=0.001798,0.001819&ie=UTF8&ll=44.624137,-86.233535&spn=0.028773,0.029097&t=h&z=15 |title=Overview Map of M-168 |accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

M-168 had existed in its current location since 1931.  It was originally assumed into the state trunkline system at [tpl]convert|0.8|mi|km[/tpl] in length.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=July 1, 1931 |cartography= H.M. Gousha [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=October 1, 1931 |cartography= H.M. Gousha [/tpl] Aside from a minor realignment of the junction with M-22 in 1987, the route had remained in this configuration since 1931.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1987 |scale=1 in:14.5 mi/1 in:23 km |section=[/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Department of Transportation Map |year=1988 |scale=1 in:14.5 mi/1 in:23 km |section=[/tpl] From its creation until 1984, the road was the main entrance for cars bound for boarding the car ferry.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Transportation Map |year=1985 |scale=1 in:14.5 mi/1 in:23 km |section=[/tpl]
An MDOT document indicated that in 2010, a $2.1 million project would reconstruct M-168. Upon completion of the project, the route would be jurisdictionally transferred to the Village of Elberta, thereby removing M-168 from the state trunkline system.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |title= Jobs Today Initiative and SAFETEA-LU Earmark Project Investments |date= March 30, 2006 |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_SAFETEA_LU_andJobsToday11-16-05_142402_7.pdf |accessdate= February 12, 2008 |format= PDF[/tpl] This transfer was finalized on April 24, 2012, and afterwards, the former M-168 was reclassified a village street.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |title= Contract Number 2012-0366 |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |date= April 24, 2012 |url= http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/greatlakesroads/message/16786 |accessdate= May 7, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]registration required[/tpl]
