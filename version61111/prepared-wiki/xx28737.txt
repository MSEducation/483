==Origins==

The dish originated in rural Quebec, Canada, in the late 1950s. Several Québécois communities claim to be the birthplace of poutine, including Drummondville (by Jean-Paul Roy in 1964),[tpl]cite news |last=Sekules |first=Kate |title=A Staple From Quebec, Embarrassing but Adored |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/dining/23pout.html?ex=1337572800&en=42c5e67c003989af&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink |work=The New York Times |date=23 May 2007 |accessdate=19 May 2008[/tpl] Article on Poutine coming to New York City Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] and Victoriaville.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kane |first=Marion |title=The war of the curds |date=8 November 2008 |journal=The Star |url=http://www.thestar.com/living/Food/article/530474 |accessdate=16 December 2001[/tpl]  One often-cited tale is that of Fernand Lachance, from Warwick, Quebec, which claims that poutine was invented there in 1957;[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/inventions/inventions.html |title=The 50 Inventions — Poutine |accessdate=19 May 2008 |work=The Greatest Canadian Invention |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Lachance is said to have exclaimed, "ça va faire une maudite poutine" ("it will make a damn mess") when asked to put a handful of curds on some french fries, hence the name. The sauce was allegedly added later, to keep the fries warm longer. Over time the dish's popularity spread mainly across the province (and later throughout Canada), often served in small town restaurants, bars, as well as being quite popular in ski resorts.

===Etymology===

The Dictionnaire historique du français québécois lists 15 different meanings of poutine in Quebec and Acadian French, most of which are for kinds of food; the word poutine in the meaning "fries with cheese and gravy" is dated to 1978. Other senses of the word have been in use at least since 1810.[tpl]cite book |last1=Poirier |first1=Claude |last2=Canac-Marquis |first2=Steve |title=Dictionnaire historique du français québécois |publisher=Université Laval |year=1998 |isbn=2-7637-7557-8[/tpl]
While the exact provenance of the word "poutine" is uncertain, some of its meanings undoubtedly result at least in part from the influence of the English word pudding. Among its various culinary senses, that of "a dessert made from flour or bread crumbs" most clearly shows this influence; the word pouding, borrowed from the English pudding, is in fact a synonym in this sense. The pejorative meaning "fat person" of poutine (used especially in speaking of a woman) is believed to derive from the English pudding "a person or thing resembling a pudding" or "stout, thick-set person".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/bdlp/quebec.asp|title= Poutine |accessdate=19 May 2008 |work=Base de données lexicographiques du Québec |publisher=Trésor de la langue française au Québec – Université Laval[/tpl]
In other meanings of poutine, the existence of a relation to the English word pudding is uncertain. One of these additional meanings — the one from which the name of the dish with fries is thought to derive — is "unappetizing mixture of various foods, usually leftovers." This sense may also have given rise to the meaning "complicated business, complex organization; set of operations whose management is difficult or problematic."
The Dictionnaire historique mentions the possibility that the form poutine is simply a gallicization of the word pudding. However, it considers it more likely that it was inherited from regional languages spoken in France, and that some of its meanings resulted from the later influence of the similar-sounding English word pudding. It cites the Provençal forms poutingo "bad stew" and poutité "hodgepodge" or "crushed fruit or foods"; poutringo "mixture of various things" in Languedocien; and poutringue, potringa "bad stew" in Franche-Comté as possibly related to poutine. The meaning "fries with cheese and gravy" of poutine is among those held as probably unrelated to pudding provided the latter view is correct.

==Recipe==

In the basic recipe for poutine, French fries are covered with fresh cheese curds, and topped with brown gravy. In a Quebec poutine:
Heavy beef or pork-based brown gravies are rarely used. To maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curd and gravy are added immediately prior to serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over the cold cheese curds, so that the cheese is warmed without completely melting. It is important to control the temperature, timing and the order in which the ingredients are added, so as to obtain the right food textures which is an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.

===Variations===

There are many variations of poutine. Some restaurants offer poutine with such additions as chicken, bacon, or Montreal-style smoked meat. Some such restaurants even boast a dozen or more variations of poutine. For instance, more upscale poutine with three-pepper sauce, merguez sausage, foie gras[tpl]cite news | first = Christopher | last = Koentges | title = How To Make Poutine 2.0: Gravy Hacks, Cheese Curd Modification | date = 2012-10-04 | url = http://veryethnic.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/how-to-make-poutine-2-0-gravy-hacks-cheese-curd-modification/ | work = Very Ethnic | accessdate = 2013-08-05[/tpl] or even caviar and truffle can be found.[tpl]cite news |last=Krauss |first=Clifford |title=Quebec Finds Pride in a Greasy Favorite |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/26/international/americas/26mont.html?ex=1398312000&en=27b2d7db41c369a4&ei=5007 |work=The New York Times |date=26 April 2004 |accessdate=19 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Some variations eliminate the cheese, but most Québécois would call such a dish a frite sauce ("french fries with sauce") rather than poutine. Shawinigan and some other regions have patate-sauce-choux where shredded raw cabbage replaces cheese. Fast food combination meals in Canada often have the option of getting french fries "poutinized" by adding cheese curds (or shredded cheese in the Prairies and Western Canada) and gravy.
Over the years, there have been many variations to this Classic Canadian Dish. Sweet potato, for example, has been invented to be a healthy alternative to french fries. The idea of adding dietary fiber and vitamins in this classic dish is widely appraised by the public.

Outside Canada, poutine is found in northern border regions of the United States such as New England, the Pacific Northwest and the Upper Midwest. These regions offer further variations of the basic dish. Cheeses other than fresh curds are commonly used (most commonly mozzarella cheese), along with beef, brown or turkey gravy.  In the county culture especially, a mixed fry can also come with cooked ground beef on top and is referred to as a hamburger mix, though this is less popular than a regular mix.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, most non-national chain restaurants serve a traditional dish called chips, dressing and gravy (a.k.a. "Newfie fries"). "Dressing" is a mixture of mainly white bread crumbs and savoury and is often referred to as "stuffing" outside of Atlantic Canada. Chips, dressing and gravy is served much like poutine, except for the dressing substituting for the cheese. While loved by Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, the dish is not very widely known of outside the Canadian province, and within pockets of NL exiles.

In Southern California, the fast food chain Tommy's has a thick, brown gravy based meat chili, and the ingredients of their chili cheese fries are comparable to those of Poutine. The chili is thicker, however, and the cheese is American cheese.
Cheese fries are also served in many diners in the American Southwest; in Texas, for example, they usually include at least one variety of grated Cheddar cheese, and are commonly served with ranch dressing and, sometimes, bacon, jalapenos and chives, whereas in New Mexico, the fries are typically served with green chili and cheese, creating a dish that combines two Southwest favorites, french fries and chile con queso. The secret menu at In-N-Out Burger includes "animal fries," a dish consisting of cheese, grilled onions, and the chain's "secret sauce" over fries. Around Chicago in Northern Illinois, up though Wisconsin and into Minnesota, cheese fries are often made using a natural cheddar spread such as Merkt's brand, which has an intense flavor and distinctive texture. Chili cheese fries are a common variation.

==Poutine in politics==

In a Talking to Americans segment on the Canadian mock television news show This Hour Has 22 Minutes during the 2000 American election, comedian Rick Mercer posed as a reporter and asked several people (including then-Texas governor George W. Bush) what they thought of "Prime Minister Jean Poutine" and his endorsement of Bush for president. (The Prime Minister of Canada at the time was Jean Chrétien).  None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of "Poutine." A few years later when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as President, he joked during a speech, "I told Minister Paul Martin that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine." The remark was met with laughter and applause.[tpl]cite press release |title=President Discusses Strong Relationship with Canada |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/12/20041201-4.html |accessdate=19 May 2008[/tpl]
