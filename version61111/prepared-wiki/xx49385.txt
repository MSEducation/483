The Eaton's Pintail (Anas eatoni) is a dabbling duck of the genus Anas. The species is restricted to the island groups of Kerguelen and Crozet in the southern Indian Ocean. It resembles a small female Northern Pintail.  It was named after the English explorer and naturalist Alfred Edmund Eaton.[tpl]cite book|last=Beolens|first=Bo|title=Whose Bird?

There are two subspecies: A. eatoni eatoni (Kerguelen Pintail) and A. eatoni drygalskii (Crozet Pintail).
