The International Air Transport Association (IATA [tpl]IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|ɑː|t|ə[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/IATA?q=IATA|title=IATA|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=11 July 2013[/tpl]) is the trade association for the world’s airlines. It represents some 240 airlines or more than 84% of total air traffic. IATA supports airline activity and helps formulate industry policy and standards. It is headquartered in Montreal, Canada with Executive Offices in Geneva, Switzerland.[tpl]cite web|title=Official IATA website|url=http://www.iata.org[/tpl]

==History==

IATA was formed in April 1945 in Havana, Cuba.[tpl]cite web|title=International Air Transport Association|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/International_Air_Transport_Association.html|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]  It is the successor to the International Air Traffic Association, which was formed in 1919 at The Hague, Netherlands. At its founding, IATA consisted of 57 airlines from 31 countries. Much of IATA’s early work was technical and it provided input to the newly created International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which was reflected in the annexes of the Chicago Convention, the international treaty that still governs the conduct of international air transport today.
The Chicago Convention couldn’t resolve the issue of who flies where, however, and this has resulted in the thousands of bilaterals in existence today. The benchmark standard for the early bilaterals was the 1946 United States-United Kingdom Bermuda Agreement.[tpl]cite web|title=Contemporary Issues in Air Transport Air Law & Regulation|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/files/iasl/C12-Sanat_Kaul-Chicago_Convention_revisited.pdf|publisher=Institute of Air & Space Law, McGill University, Montreal|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Bilateral Air Service Agreements|url=http://aviationknowledge.wikidot.com/aviation:bilateral-air-service-agreements|publisher=Aviation Knowledge|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]Naeem
IATA was also charged by the governments with setting a coherent fare structure that avoided cut-throat competition but also looked after the interests of the consumer. The first Traffic Conference was held in 1947[tpl]cite web|last=Airline Tariff Publishing Company|title=ATPCO corporate history|url=http://www.atpco.net/atpco/abouthis.shtml|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]  in Rio de Janeiro and reached unanimous agreement on some 400 resolutions.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Aviation|url=https://www.onlinetraveledu.com/Understanding%20Aviation/Sample%20Chapter/History%20of%20Aviation.swf|publisher=Online Travel and Tourism Courses|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl]
Aviation grew rapidly over the following decades and IATA’s work duly expanded. It transformed its trade association activities to take account of the new dynamics in aviation, which was seeing increasing demand from the leisure sector. Price flexibility became increasingly important and the United States led the way into deregulation in 1978.[tpl]cite web|title=Airline Deregulation|url=http://www.shmoop.com/federal-bureaucracy/airline-deregulation.html|publisher=Federal Bureaucracy, Shmoop|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Airline Deregulation|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AirlineDeregulation.html|publisher=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|accessdate=18 November 2013|author=Fred L. Smith Jr.|coauthors=Braden Cox[/tpl]
IATA has cemented its position as the voice of the aviation industry in recent years, launching a number of important programs and lobbying governments in the wake of successive crises.

==Priorities==

===Safety===

Safety is the number one priority for IATA. The main instrument for safety is the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and its successor, Enhanced IOSA. IOSA has also been mandated at the state level by several countries. In 2012, aviation posted its safest year ever. The global Western-built jet accident rate (measured in hull losses per million flights of Western-built jets) was 0.20, the equivalent of one accident every 5 million flights.[tpl]cite web|title=2012 safest year ever for IATA airlines|url=http://atwonline.com/operations/2012-safest-year-ever-iata-airlines|publisher=Air Transport World|accessdate=18 November 2013|author=Karen Walker[/tpl]  Future improvements will be founded on data sharing with a database fed by a multitude of sources and housed by the Global Safety Information Center.

===Security===

Security has become increasingly important following the tragedy of 9/11. Following a series of uncoordinated rules by different countries, the industry has developed a Checkpoint of the Future,[tpl]cite news|title=IATA Reveals Checkpoint of the Future|url=http://evaint.com/industry-news/iata-reveals-checkpoint-of-the-future|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=EVA International Media LTD, Aviation Publishers & Events Specialists[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=IATA reveals checkpoint of the future|url=http://secureidnews.com/news-item/iata-reveals-checkpoint-of-the-future/|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=SecureIDNews[/tpl]   which is based on risk assessment and passenger differentiation.

===Simplifying the Business===

Simplifying the Business[tpl]cite news|last=Gouldman|first=Anna|title=Airlines to Scrap Paper Tickets by 2007: Industry Feedback|url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/btn2005042510410790/|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=Breaking Travel News|date=25 April 2005[/tpl]  was launched in 2004. This initiative has introduced a number of crucial concepts to passenger travel, including the electronic ticket[tpl]cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Gemma|title=IATA makes final paper ticket order|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/iata-makes-final-paper-ticket-order-57032.html|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=Arabian Travel News|date=27 August 2007[/tpl]  and the bar coded boarding pass. Many other innovations are being established as part of the Fast Travel initiative, including a range of self-service baggage options.
A new program that has drawn plenty of interest is New Distribution Capability.[tpl]cite news|last=Boehmer|first=Jay|title=IATA Votes To Adopt New Distribution Standards|url=http://www.thebeat.travel/post/2012/10/18/iata-votes-to-adopt-new-distribution-standards.aspx|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=The Beat|date=18 October 2012[/tpl]  This will replace the old EDIFACT messaging standard that is still the basis of the global distribution system /travel agent channel and replace it with an XML standard. This will enable the same choices to be offered to high street travel shoppers as are offered to those who book directly through airline websites. A filing with the US Department of Transportation brought over 400 comments.[tpl]cite news|last=Vanasse|first=Zachary-Cy|title=New Distribution Capability Or New Industry Model?|url=http://www.travelhotnews.com/reportages.php?sequence_no=43366|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=Travel Hot News|date=1 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Orukpe|first=Abel|title=IATA urges stakeholders to collaborate, give passengers value|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2012/10/iata-urges-stakeholders-to-collaborate-give-passengers-value/|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=Daily Independent[/tpl]

===Environment===

IATA members and all industry stakeholders have agreed to three sequential environmental goals:
At the 69th IATA AGM in Cape Town, South Africa, members overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution on “Implementation of the Aviation Carbon-Neutral Growth (CNG2020) Strategy.”[tpl]cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|title=Airlines agree to curb their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/airlines-agree-to-curb-greenhouse-gas-emissions|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 June 2013[/tpl]
The resolution provides governments with a set of principles on how governments could:
IATA member airlines agreed that a single mandatory carbon offsetting scheme would be the simplest and most effective option for an MBM.

===Services===

IATA provides consulting and training services in many areas crucial to aviation.
Travel Agent accreditation is available for travel professionals. Full accreditation allows agents to sell tickets on behalf of all IATA member airlines.
Cargo Agent accreditation is a similar program.
IATA also runs the Billing and Settlement Plan, which is a $300 billion-plus financial system that looks after airline money.
And it provides a number of business intelligence publications and services.
Training covers all aspects of aviation and ranges from beginner courses through to senior management courses.

===Publications - Standards===

A number of standards are defined under the umbrella of IATA. One of the most important is the transport of dangerous goods (HAZMAT).
