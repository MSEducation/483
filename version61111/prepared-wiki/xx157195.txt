State Road 121 (SR 121) is a major state highway that runs north and south in northern Florida. The road is part of a long multi-state route that also goes through Georgia and South Carolina.

==Route description==

Beginning in Lebanon Station at a channelized intersection with US 19-98 and County Road 336, State Road 121 runs through Goethe State Forest where it turns east and intersects with CR 337. The road makes a sharp left curve to the northeast where it runs through desolate farmland; the only resemblance to a major intersection is CR 326.  Within the city of Williston, SR 121 overlaps CR 316, until the intersection with US 41.  It then joins US 41 as CR 316 continues eastward, which then joins the east end of ALT US 27, and then the US 27-41 concurrency before breaking away to the northeast again, taking the DeSoto Trail away from US 41.
North of CR 335, SR 121 hugs the west side of the Levy-Marion County Line, but never crosses it, choosing to enter Alachua County instead. Immediately after the interchange with Interstate 75(Exit 382), SR 121 makes a sharp left onto Northwest 34th Street as SR 331 becomes the designation for Williston Road. As it crosses SR 24 it borders the University of Florida to the east until crossing SR 26A and then SR 26. North of US 441, the DeSoto Trail breaks away.
After the intersection with CR 236 in Santa Fe, SR 121 is carried along bridges across the former Seaboard Coast Line railroad line to Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant and Santa Fe River in Worthington Springs, where it intersects with SR 18.
Briefly running parallel to SR 100 in Lake Butler, it intersects with SR 100 as it continues northeast. The road also intersects SR 16 in Raiford, and Interstate 10(Exit 335) and US 90 in Macclenny close to SR 228 before crossing the Georgia border on its way to South Carolina.

==History==

State Road 23 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as:
Prior to the renumbering, this had been:
At some point, SR 23 was renumbered as part of SR 121, probably to match Georgia State Route 121. Before that, however, SR 23 had been extended around the west side of Gainesville to end at US 441/SR 25 at Rocky Point, and the southernmost part did not become part of SR 121. It was later given to the county, and has a possibility of becoming County Road 23.[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The State Road 23 designation has since been reused for a partial beltway around Jacksonville.

==County Road 121A==

County Road 121A is the sole suffixed alternate of SR 121 that exists within the State of Florida. It is a former segment of SR 121 that exists entirely in LaCrosse. The route is unmarked, and runs along the east side of SR 121 south of downtown to halfway between the SR 121/235 overlap across from the LaCrosse Post Office.
