</ref> On 2 September 1996, [[Bruce Gyngell]] made the controversial move of re-branding Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television under the unified brand "Channel 3"<ref>http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/58464/</ref>  While Yorkshire used a scaled-back version of this branding (still using the Yorkshire chevron logo and being verbally known as "Channel 3 Yorkshire"), Tyne Tees was re-branded as "Channel 3 North East". It dropped the familiar TTTV logo, and relegated the Tyne Tees name to secondary branding.

===Granada plc and ITV plc===

In the summer of 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by Granada Group plc (now ITV plc).MAM unlikely to back Granada's YTTV offer.Eric Reguly. The Times (London, England), Thursday, 26 June 1997; pg. 27 Granada's first move was to scrap the Channel 3 branding, from 9 March 1998. However, dual branding with the "ITV" name was introduced a year later. In 1998, transmission control and presentation for all of Granada's stations in the North of England moved to Yorkshire, with the creation of the Northern Transmission Centre. This highly automated server based system was the source to Border, Tyne Tees and Granada as well as the Yorkshire regional output. The continuity department closed down in 2002 after a unified presentation department for ITV1 in England was set up by London News Network.
On 28 October 2002, Yorkshire Television was rebranded as ITV1 Yorkshire. The "Yorkshire" did not appear, even before regional programmes; only "ITV1" was shown. The famous chevron continued to appear after programmes made by ITV Yorkshire, until 31 October 2004. Today, programmes made at the Leeds studios by ITV are credited to ITV Studios.
The licence for Yorkshire is now held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c3/ytv/

==Studios==

The studios were built on [tpl]convert|5|acre|m2[/tpl] of slum clearance land on Kirkstall Road, purchased from the former Leeds Corporation.
Construction commenced in early 1967. A mild winter aided building work and by mid-1968 studios one and two were equipped for transmission (studios three and four being completed by early 1969). During construction, pre-launch shows were produced at the ABC studios at Didsbury, Manchester while a former trouser-press factory next to the Leeds facility was used as an administration centre.
The studio was officially opened by The Duchess of Kent on 29 July 1968. It was the first purpose-built colour television production centre in Europe and cost over £4 million to build and equip (2008 equivalent: £50 million). Equipment was installed by EMI Electronics and the Marconi Corporation. The studios contained seven 2" Quadruplex VTR machines, six telecines and twelve cameras. The cameras were a mixture of Marconi MkVII's (studios 1, 2 and 3) and EMI 2001 models (studio 4).
The regional news show Calendar was produced at the centre for many years but in 1989 was moved to a dedicated newsroom and broadcast facility based in a converted ice rink next to the main studios.
Recent productions include Countdown (which has since moved to The Manchester Studios), the revived Bullseye, Mastermind (while asbestos was removed from The Manchester Studios in 2006), My Parents Are Aliens, new Channel 4 gameshow Win My Wage and a new children's comedy-drama for Cartoon Network called My Spy Family. The site is now home to continuity for ITV's northern transmission areas (although this is now managed, along with its southern counterpart, by Technicolor Network Services http://www.technicolornetworkservices.com/pdfs/TNS_20061219_ITV.pdf) and a number of independent producers. The production facilities are marketed as The Leeds Studios and sister companies ProVision, Film Lab North and The Finishing School occupy adjacent buildings, although the operation continues to be widely referred to as the Yorkshire Television studios or YTV.
In March 2009, ITV plc announced that the Leeds Studios were to be largely closed in an effort to save costs following a reported loss of £2.7 billion for 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7922770.stm |title= Troubled ITV cuts jobs and costs |date= 4 March 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2009 |work = BBC News Online | publisher = BBC[/tpl] However, seven months later ITV changed its mind, choosing instead to close the nearby studios dedicated to the production of Emmerdale and transferring production of this programme to Kirkstall Road which would be upgraded for HDTV production.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/rip-yorkshire-tv/ITV39s-Leeds-base-saved-in.5883990.jp |title=ITV's Leeds base saved in £5m refurbishment |work=Yorkshire Post |date=3 December 2009[/tpl]

==Identity==

For almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television's on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television's idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at", a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station's jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts in November 1969.[tpl]cite web|last=Piercy|first=Robert|title=Yorkshire TV idents|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/itvyorkshire/idents.html|work=TVARK|publisher=TVARK|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] Contains videos of all of the YTV idents.[tpl]cite web|title=ITV1 Yorkshire|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-yorkshire-01-01.html|publisher=TV Room|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] Contains images of the idents
The new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card "Yorkshire Television Colour Production", along with a simplified version of "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at". This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption "Colour Production" was changed to "In Colour", and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed.
Supplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station's coverage, with the slogan "Serving Six Million Viewers". One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron.
In 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled "Liquid Gold", featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost £40,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity.
In 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo, addition ident was also used where a static chevron on the same background as the main ident. On 2 September 1991, the ident was revised to allow the Chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the 'V' which the company used until 4 September 1994.  The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming.

===1990s===

Upon YTV dropping the generic look on 5 September 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron's appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced.[tpl]cite web|title=ITV1 Yorkshire Idents 2|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-yorkshire-01-05.html|publisher=TV Room|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl]
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region in 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral '3', and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to 'Channel 3 North East, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees's revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire's Channel 3 look included an ident where the chevron span against a light blue background with numeral '3's covering the background. Another ident featured the chevron with the '3' numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch.[tpl]cite web|title=ITV1 Yorkshire Idents 5|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-yorkshire-01-20.html|publisher=TV Room|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl]
The Channel 3 look was dropped in 9 March 1998, following Granada's acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings.
In 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box. In 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only. These regional idents however were dropped by 2006.

==Programming==

Yorkshire Television was a major producer within the ITV network and produced programming in all genres. The presenter Alan Whicker became a shareholder in the company at its inception and made many programmes for the station, most notably interviews with the Cat's Eye inventor Percy Shaw and the Haiti dictator Baby Doc Duvalier.
In drama the company had many critical successes including Hadleigh, Neville's Island, Micawber, Shipman, The Main Chance, Flambards, Harry's Game, Heartbeat, Stay Lucky, The Governor, Trial & Retribution, The Darling Buds of May, Rich Tea and Sympathy, A Is for Acid, The Brides in the Bath, At Home with the Braithwaites, A Touch of Frost, Coming Home, Shoot To Kill, Supply and Demand and The Beiderbecke Trilogy.
In comedy, it produced many populist shows such as In Loving Memory, Duty Free, Rising Damp, Only When I Laugh, Home to Roost, Jokers Wild, Oh No, It's Selwyn Froggitt!, Queenie's Castle, The New Statesman, Farrington of the F.O. and gave the comedian Les Dawson his first major series.
For children, YTV contributed many networked shows including Animal Kwackers, Adam's Family Tree, The Big Bang, The Riddlers, The Raggy Dolls, Junior Showtime, Bad Influence!, The Flaxton Boys, Follyfoot and My Parents Are Aliens as well as the long-running hit How We Used to Live for ITV's Schools and Colleges' output. In entertainment, it produced a large number of networked quiz shows such as 3-2-1, Talkabout, Countdown, Tarby's Frame Game and Winner Takes All and religion-oriented shows such as Stars on Sunday.
In 1969 it launched its first soap opera Castle Haven which was cancelled after one year. When the restrictions on daytime broadcasting were relaxed in 1972 it launched an afternoon drama called Emmerdale Farm, which is still being broadcast as Emmerdale.
The company invested heavily in outside broadcast facilities and was a large contributor to ITV Sport, responsible primarily for covering northern-based horserace meetings (with London Weekend Television and Thames Television covering the south and ATV covering the Midlands) amongst other sporting events.
In the field of investigative journalism the station soon gained an international reputation for award-winning documentaries: 1975 saw the transmission of the BAFTA award-winning Johnny Go Home, a startling exposé of teenage male prostitution and homelessness in London. In the same year the station transmitted Too Long a Winter (also a BAFTA award-winner), featuring Yorkshire Daleswoman Hannah Hauxwell who lived an austere and harsh lifestyle whilst running her small farm.
In 1979 the documentary Rampton: The Secret Hospital, making public the treatment of patients at the Nottinghamshire mental care facility Rampton Hospital, led to a Government investigation – it also won an international Emmy award for the station. The 1989 documentary Four Hours in My Lai (broadcast as part of the monthly First Tuesday strand) revealed new information about the 1968 massacre. Yorkshire Television also produced the 1989 documentary One Day in the Life of Television.
YTV has often led the way in British commercial broadcasting. As well as building the first purpose-built colour studios on Europe it was the first to offer breakfast television. In 1977, the station took part in a nine-week trial offering viewers an extra hour of programming at breakfast time, beginning transmission at 8:30am with a 15-minute national and regional news bulletin called Good Morning Calendar alongside cartoons and episodes of Peyton Place. A similar experiment was carried out by Tyne Tees Television around the same time.
In August 1986, the station was the first to offer 24-hour transmission (when both the BBC and ITV companies closed down at around 12:30 to 1am). This was achieved by simulcasting the satellite station Music Box – both YTV and Music Box were partly owned by the same company (W H Smith). The experiment ended shortly before Music Box closed down in January 1987 and was replaced by a teletext-based Jobfinder service which broadcast for one hour after closedown. YTV re-introduced 24-hour programming 18 months later along with the rest of the ITV network, beginning 24-hour broadcasting on 30 May 1988.
In the mid-1980s, Yorkshire broke from the network by refusing to screen the BAFTA Awards, claiming them to be slaps on the backs of the BBC. The movie The Sting was a replacement in 1986. As the rest of the network overran in the live BAFTA screening, Yorkshire had to cobble together minor programmes until other regions were able to screen the late-running ITN News. In the 1990s, while Bruce Gyngell was managing director, Yorkshire declined to show The Good Sex Guide, replacing the programme with Alan Whicker repeats.
