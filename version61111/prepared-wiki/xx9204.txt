Oregano ([tpl]IPAc-en|US|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|ɡ|ən|oʊ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|UK|ɒr|ɨ|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|oʊ[/tpl], scientific name Origanum vulgare) is a common species of Origanum, a genus of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to warm-temperate western and southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region.
Oregano is a perennial herb, growing from 20–80 cm tall, with opposite leaves 1–4 cm long. Oregano will grow in a pH range between 6.0 (mildly acidic) and 9.0 (strongly alkaline) with a preferred range between 6.0 and 8.0. The flowers are purple, 3–4 mm long, produced in erect spikes. It is sometimes called wild marjoram, and its close relative O. majorana is known as sweet marjoram.

==Description and biology==

Oregano is related to the herb marjoram, sometimes being referred to as wild marjoram. Oregano has purple flowers and spade-shaped, olive-green leaves. It is a perennial,[tpl]cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ORVU|title=Origanum vulgare L. oregano|publisher=Plants Database, United States Department of Agriculture, http://plants.usda.gov/|accessdate=30 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/02-049.htm|title=Growing Culinary Herbs In Ontario |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Rural Affairs, http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca|accessdate=30 January 2011[/tpl] although it is grown as an annual in colder climates, as it often does not survive the winter months.[tpl]cite book| last =Peter| first =K.

Oregano is planted in early spring, the plants being spaced [tpl]convert|12|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1[/tpl] apart in fairly dry soil, with full sun. It prefers a hot, relatively dry climate, but will do well in other environments.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

Many subspecies and strains of oregano have been developed by humans over centuries for their unique flavors or other characteristics. Tastes range from spicy or astringent to more complicated and sweet. Simple oregano sold in garden stores as Origanum vulgare may have a bland taste and larger, less dense leaves, and is not considered the best for culinary uses, with a taste less remarkable and pungent. It can pollinate other more sophisticated strains, but the offspring are rarely better in quality.
The related species, Origanum onites (Greece, Turkey) and O. syriacum (West Asia), have similar flavors. A closely related plant is marjoram from Turkey, which, however, differs significantly in taste, because phenolic compounds are missing from its essential oil. Some varieties show a flavor intermediate between oregano and marjoram.

==Subspecies==

Notable subspecies are:

==Cultivars==

Example cultivars are:
Cultivars traded as Italian, Sicilian, etc. are usually hardy sweet marjoram (O. ×majoricum), a hybrid between the southern Adriatic O. v. hirtum and sweet marjoram (O. majorana). They have a reputation for sweet and spicy tones, with little bitterness, and are prized for their flavor and compatibility with various recipes and sauces.

==Uses==

===Culinary===

Oregano is an important culinary herb, used for the flavour of its leaves, which can be more flavourful when dried than fresh.http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Orig_vul.html. Oregano leaves are more flavorful when dried It has an aromatic, warm and slightly bitter taste, which can vary in intensity. Good quality oregano may be strong enough almost to numb the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates often have a lesser flavor. Factors such as climate, seasons and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants. Among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are carvacrol, thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene.The essential oil of Origanum vulgare L. ssp. vulgare growing wild in vilnius district (Lithuania) Phytochemistry. 2001 May;57(1):65-9.
Oregano's most prominent modern use is as the staple herb of Italian-American cuisine. Its popularity in the US began when soldiers returning from World War II brought back with them a taste for the “pizza herb”,Epikouria Magazine, Fall/Spring 2007 which had probably been eaten in southern Italy for centuries. There, it is most frequently used with roasted, fried or grilled vegetables, meat and fish. Unlike most Italian herbs,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] oregano combines well with spicy foods, which are popular in southern Italy. It is less commonly used in the north of the country, as marjoram generally is preferred.
The herb is also widely used in Turkish, Palestinian, Lebanese, Egyptian, Syrian, Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Philippine and Latin American cuisines.
In Turkish cuisine, oregano is mostly used for flavoring meat, especially for mutton and lamb. In barbecue and kebab restaurants, it can be usually found on table, together with paprika, salt and pepper.
The dried and ground leaves are most often used in Greece to add flavor to Greek salad, and is usually added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that accompanies many fish or meat barbecues and some casseroles.
Oregano is also used by chefs in the southern Philippines to eliminate the odor of carabao or water buffalo when boiling it, while simultaneously imparting flavor.

===Medicinal===

Hippocrates used oregano as an antiseptic, as well as a cure for stomach and respiratory ailments. A Cretan oregano (O. dictamnus) is still used today in Greece as a palliative for sore throat.
Oregano is high in antioxidant activity, due to a high content of phenolic acids and flavonoids.[tpl]cite journal |last=Faleiro |first=Leonor |coauthors=et al. |year=2005 |title=Antibacterial and Antioxidant Activities of Essential Oils Isolated from Thymbra capitata L.

==Chemical Components==

The essential oil of oregano is composed primarily of  monoterpenoids and monoterpenes, however the concentrations of the specific compounds vary widely depending on geographic location and other varying factors. Over 60 different compounds have been identified with the primarily ones being carvacrol and thymol ranging from 0 over 80% while lesser abundant compounds include p-cymene, γ-terpinene, caryophyllene, spathulenol, germacrene-D, β-fenchyl alcohol and δ-terpineol.[tpl]cite journal | last = Teixeira | first = Bárbara | title = Chemical composition and bioactivity of different oregano (Origanum vulgare) extracts and essential oil | journal = J Sci Food Agric | year = 2013 | volume = 93 | issue = 11 | pages = 2707–2714 | publisher = | location = Portugal | date = | doi = 10.1002/jsfa.6089 | accessdate = 2014-05-01 [/tpl]
Drying of the plant material effects both quantity and distribution of volatile compounds, with methods using higher heat and longer drying times having greater negative impact. A sample of fresh whole plant material found to contain 33g/kg dry weight (3.1g/kg wet) decreased to below a third after warm air convection drying. Much higher concentrations of volatile compounds are found to be towards the end of the growing season.[tpl]cite journal | last = Figiel | first = Adam | title = Composition of oregano essential oil (Origanum vulgare) as affected by drying method | journal = Journal of Food Engineering | year = 2010 | volume = 98 | issue = 2 | pages = 240–247 | doi = 10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.01.002 | accessdate = 2014-05-01[/tpl]

==Other plants called "oregano"==

==Etymology==

Oregano is the anglicised form of the Italian word origano, or possibly of the medieval Latin organum; this latter is used in at least one Old English work. Both were drawn from the Classical Latin term origanum, which probably referred specifically to sweet marjoram, and was itself a derivation from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ὀρίγανον[/tpl] (origanon), which simply referred to "an acrid herb".ὀρίγανον, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseusoriganum, on Oxford Dictionaries The etymology of the Greek term is often given as oros [tpl]lang|grc|ὄρος[/tpl] "mountain" + the verb ganousthai [tpl]lang|grc|γανοῦσθαι[/tpl] "delight in", but the Oxford English Dictionary notes it is quite likely a loanword from an unknown North African language.Oxford English Dictionary Online.
