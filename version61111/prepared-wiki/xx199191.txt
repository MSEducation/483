==Accomplishments as NYC DOT Commissioner==

Janette Sadik-Khan famously converted a segment of Broadway into a pedestrian plaza, but this was part of a larger framework of wherein the DOT would paint, measure, then finalize street re-designs. The pedestrian plazas built by the DOT tended to be where streets intersected at non-right angles, as with Broadway, or where the space was under-utilized for parking, as in the early Pearl Street Plaza project. Under her predecessor, Iris Weinshall, traffic designs were finalized on paper and then built based on the AASHTO Highway Designs that have long been criticized as being tailored for rural and suburban needs. Under JSK, the NYC DOT worked with NACTO on street designs more appropriate for city needs and would do street redesigns with paint and temporary breakaway bollards, then measure changes in capacity and collision frequency and severity before repaving or making other permanent changes. Her DOT also issued the first strategic plan in the agency's history.http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/stratplan.shtml
