Liquefaction, sometimes liquification, generally refers to the process of becoming a liquid or liquid-like.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Geology==

In geology, soil liquefaction refers to the process by which water-saturated, unconsolidated sediments are transformed into a substance that acts like a liquid, often in an earthquake. By undermining the foundations and base courses of infrastructure, liquefaction can cause serious damage.[tpl]cite web|author=USGS|title=About Liquefaction|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/sfgeo/liquefaction/aboutliq.html[/tpl]

==Physics and chemistry==

In physics and chemistry, the phase transitions from solid and gas to liquid (melting and condensation, respectively) may be referred to as liquefaction. The melting point (sometimes called liquefaction point) is the temperature and pressure at which a solid becomes a liquid.
In commercial and industrial situations, the process of condensing a gas to liquid is sometimes referred to as liquefaction of gases.

===Dissolution===

Liquefaction is also used in commercial and industrial settings to refer to mechanical dissolution of a solid by mixing, grinding or blending with a liquid.
====Food preparation====	
In kitchen or laboratory settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes in combination with a liquid, for example in food preparation or laboratory use. This may be done with a blender, or liquidiser in British English.

==Biology==

In biology, liquefaction often involves organic tissue turning into a more liquid-like state. For example, liquefactive necrosis in pathology,Robbins and Cotran: Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th Ed. 2010. Pg. 15 or liquefaction as a parameter in semen analysis.[tpl]cite book|last=Gardner|first=Kavid|title=Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=63|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BuS2CqreU3gC&dq|accessdate=2013-11-03[/tpl]
