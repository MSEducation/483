==Controversy==

Direct Marketing Associations have attracted controversy, as people believe they aim to promote spam and to defend junk mail and unsolicited telemarketing, which many consumers find irritating and intrusive. They have been accused, by the The Spamhaus Project and Electronic Frontier Foundation respectively, of promoting spam[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spamhaus.org/consumer/removelists/ |title=Spam "Unsubscribe" Services |publisher=spamhaus.org[/tpl] and working against open standards (i.e., Do Not Track) that seek to protect consumer privacy from tracking by online marketers.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ad-industrys-assault-do-not-track-continues-w3c-amsterdam-meeting |title=Ad Industry's Assault on "Do Not Track" Continues at the W3C Amsterdam Meeting |publisher=eff.org[/tpl] They have also been accused of using a "limited," unrealistic definition of spam.[tpl]cite web |url=http://chiefmarketer.com/email-marketing/dma-back-anti-spam-law |title=DMA to Back Anti-Spam Law |publisher=chiefmarketer.com[/tpl]

==Telemarketing legislation==

The United States National Do Not Call Registry, went into effect in 2003. Under the law, it is illegal for telemarketers to call anyone who has registered themselves on the list.  After the list had operated for one year, over 62 million people had signed up.http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/06/dncanny.htm The telemarketing industry opposed the creation of the list, but most telemarketers have complied with the law and refrained from calling people who are on the list.
Canada has passed legislation to create a similar Do Not Call List. In other countries it is voluntary, such as the New Zealand Name Removal Service.
