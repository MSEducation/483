Play on Words is a dice word game, where players try to make words from a series of letters on dice.  The tricks to the game are that players only have a minute, must use a particular start letter for their first word, and must write down the words in intersecting lines.  It was published by Winning Moves Games USA in 2008.

==Gameplay==

The game plays very quickly and is often played over multiple rounds when playing with two or more people.  Players choose a start player and that player shakes the device, randomizing the letters.  The start player then decides whether the pink die or the green die will be the start letter for that round.  Whichever they don't pick will be the bonus die for the round.  The start letter must be used to start the first letter of the first word each player writes once the game begins.  Once the start player has chosen which die will be the start letter, they press the timer button on the side of the device and all players begin to find and write down words.  Player do not make simple lists, however.  When writing the words, they must work off of a word they've already written, crossword-style.  Players cannot use any letter die twice in a word.  The special die face "Wild" may be used as any letter and may change word to word, but can only be used once in a word.  Similarly, the "Vowel" face on a die can be used an A, E, I, O, or U once in a word.  Players write as many intersecting words as possible.  Once the timer runs out, the players tally their score.

==Scoring==

Valid words can not be proper nouns, foreign words, or words with punctuation.  Players score points based on word length, using the bonus letter in a word, writing down 8 or more words, and for creating a closed box of words (a series of intersecting words that create an enclosed space).  Player score zero points for a word (and all words connecting to it) using a letter not rolled.

==Game End==

The game ends after players have played the number of round agreed upon before starting (typically 5, or 1 for each player).  The person with the most points wins.
