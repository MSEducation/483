The Pont de Bercy is a bridge over the Seine in Paris, France.
The structure links the 12th and 13th arrondissements of Paris by extending the Boulevard de Bercy and the Boulevard Vincent-Auriol.  In addition to roadway, the bridge also carries line 6 of the Paris Metro.

==History==

The Pont de Bercy was built at the site of another bridge, a suspension bridge opened in 1832 to replace a ferry that had become overcrowded and thus exceeded its tonnage limit.  The former bridge had a toll: one sou (5 centimes) for pedestrians, 3 sous per two-wheeled cabriolet (including persons transported) and 5 sous per car with four wheels attached to two horses.
Between 1863 and 1864, it was replaced by a stronger stone structure.
In 1904, the bridge was enlarged to 5.5 meters (18 feet) to support Line 6 of the Metro.
In 1986, the decision was made to further enlarge the bridge in order to create three additional lanes for traffic.  The winning bid proposed doubling the bridge by adding extensions perfectly symmetrical to the underground viaduct. Although identical in all respects to the original, the new addition is built of reinforced concrete and covered with a stone dressing. The work started in 1989 and the bridge was opened in 1992, effectively adding 16 meters (50 feet) for a total width of 35 meters (130 feet).
