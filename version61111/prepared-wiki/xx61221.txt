The President of Guatemala (Spanish: Presidente de Guatemala), is the head of state and head of government of Guatemala. The title of "President of Guatemala" has been the usual title of the leader of Guatemala since 1839, when that title was assumed by Mariano Rivera Paz. Earlier, Guatemala had been a state within the United Provinces of Central America since 1823, before that part of the First Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide, and before 1821 ruled by the Captain General of Guatemala, a Spanish colonial official owing allegiance to the Viceroy of New Spain and the King of Spain, back to the Spanish conquest of the region in the early 16th century.
The title of "President" has been used by democratically elected leaders and appointed heads of state, as well as by dictators who took power by military coup.
