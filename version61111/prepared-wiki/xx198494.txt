[[UWA School of Music]]

CATEGORIES: University of Western Australia, Music schools in Australia

The UWA School of Music is part of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Western Australia. It is located at the North-East corner of the Crawley campus and teaches predominately Classical music, with focus in the undergraduate curriculum on performance, as well as overall strength in musicology, composition and ethnomusicology.

==History==

The school started life as part of the education faculty under the foundation Professor Sir Frank Callaway. It was the fourth Australian university to establish courses in music (after Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney).[tpl]cite book|last=complied|title=Touches of sweet harmony : music in the University of Western Australia : 1953-1998|year=1999|publisher=CIRCME|location=Nedlands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-86422-914-4|page=13|coauthors=Meyer, edited by John A.[/tpl] The first graduates to include a significant study of music in their degrees were two Music Education students in 1957. This followed shortly thereafter with the appointment of Frank Callaway as the foundation professor, concurrently with the establishment of the department of music in 1959.
First graduates followed in 1960 (one being the noted composer Jennifer Fowler) with a BA in Music, and the first graduates from the Bachelor of Music degree emerged in 1965. The first students to graduate with post-graduate qualifications emerged in 1971, and the late seventies saw the beginning of the Bachelor of Music Education - the department now having come full circle from its roots.[tpl]cite book|last=complied|title=Touches of sweet harmony : music in the University of Western Australia : 1953-1998|year=1999|publisher=CIRCME|location=Nedlands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-86422-914-4|pages=19–20|coauthors=Meyer, edited by John A.[/tpl]
In 1991, the Department of Music became a School in its own right, as part of the change of structure across the university that reduced the number of faculties.[tpl]cite book|last=complied|title=Touches of sweet harmony : music in the University of Western Australia : 1953-1998|year=1999|publisher=CIRCME|location=Nedlands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-86422-914-4|page=94|coauthors=Meyer, edited by John A.[/tpl]

==Undergraduate courses==

In 2012, UWA adopted a new set of standard degrees, similar to other universities in Australia who have been examining the "Melbourne Model"[tpl]cite news|last=Healy|first=Guy|title=UWA to Streamline Courses|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education-old/business-education/uwa-to-streamline-courses/story-e6frgcp6-1111114657812|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 October 2007[/tpl] This requires students to take at least one major, and other related areas. In line with this model, there are four modes of study for Music at UWA.[tpl]cite web|title=Future Studies in Music at UWA|url=http://www.music.uwa.edu.au/courses[/tpl]
The school has an enviable reputation in performance, evidenced by the list of alumni below that represent professional members of all major Australian orchestras (see below). In composition, there are large number of outstanding alumni. In 2011, James Ledger's (both an Alumni and member of the music faculty) work Chronicles was voted as a "Classical Masterpiece", and the best Australian Masterpiece since 2000.

==Entry==

Entry to the School of Music is a two stage process that requires both an audition for the school of music, and admission to the university. Auditions are held towards the end of the year, and require students to undertake both performance and aural activities.[tpl]cite web|title=UWA Music Application Procedures & FAQ|url=http://www.music.uwa.edu.au/courses/applying[/tpl]
Admission to the university usually requires an ATAR of 80 or more.[tpl]cite web|title=TISCOnline|url=http://www.tisc.edu.au/static/guide/uni-info-uwa.tisc#music[/tpl] UWA does, however, offer many points of access, and non-standard admission to the university is not unusual.[tpl]cite web|title=UWA Admission Policy|url=http://www.universitypolicies.uwa.edu.au/search?method=document&id=UP11%2F33[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Hiatt|first=Bethany|title=UWA Scheme is Music to Sarah's Ear|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/news/13112434/uwa-scheme-is-music-to-sarahs-ears/|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The West|date=8 March 2012[/tpl]

==Post graduate degrees==

The UWA School of Music graduated its first postgraduate student in 1967, and its first PhD student in 1971.[tpl]cite book|last=complied|title=Touches of sweet harmony : music in the University of Western Australia : 1953-1998|year=1999|publisher=CIRCME|location=Nedlands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-86422-914-4|pages=150–155|coauthors=Meyer, edited by John A.[/tpl] Currently, the School offers the following postgraduate qualifications:

==Music buildings==

Located on the North Eastern corner of the Crawley campus, the School of Music overlooks the Swan River. The current buildings were opened in 1978. In a contemporary report discussing the large number of towering pine trees in the adjacent outdoor auditorium, the architects noted "the retention of the present special qualities of Sommerville Auditorium and its unique character is considered a priority in the total solution".[tpl]cite book|last=complied|title=Touches of sweet harmony : music in the University of Western Australia : 1953-1998|year=1999|publisher=CIRCME|location=Nedlands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-86422-914-4|page=64|coauthors=Meyer, edited by John A.[/tpl] The most recent work (2012) has been the addition of a large elevator on the northern edge.
Within the School of Music are a number of specialist facilities. The Wigmore Music Library,[tpl]cite web|title=UWA Information Services Wigmore Library|url=http://www.is.uwa.edu.au/contact/music[/tpl] named for the mother of a significant donor, is one of the leading academic music collections in Australia, housed in a building whose large glass wall is designed to bring the gardens and pine trees of Sommerville Auditorium into the study area. The Eileen Joyce studio, dedicated to the memory of one of Australia's great pianists, houses a significant collection of antique and current keyboard instruments, and is an regularly used for chamber music performances. It received a considerable upgrade to the facility as part of the repair process following devastating storms in March, 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=Widespread Damage from Freak Storms|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-23/widespread-damage-from-freak-storm/375954|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=ABC Online News|date=23 March 2010[/tpl]
The Callaway auditorium, dedicated to the foundation Professor of Music, is an oft-used small concert venue, and houses most of the large scale lectures. The Tunley Lecture Theatre, named for a former long serving faculty member and Head of School, is a small lecture theatre. In 2012, both the Callaway Auditorium and the Tunley Lecture Theatre received upgraded IT infrastructure to allow for lecture control from the podium, and the digital recording and broadcasting of lectures and performances.
