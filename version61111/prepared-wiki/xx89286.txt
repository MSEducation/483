==Commonly used splints==

==Assisted cough technique==

Commonly used after surgery to provide support to an incised area and decrease pain on coughing.
While the patient attempts to cough the area is braced by the patient (or assistant) using pillow, folded blanket or extended hand placed over the incision.
Gentle pressure is applied for bracing only during the attempt to cough.

==Origins==

Different forms of the splint have been used sparingly throughout history; however, the splint gained great popularity as a medical device during the French and Indian War[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl].  Generally consisting of two small wooden planks, the splint was commonly tied around the fracture with rope, cloth, or even rawhide during frontier times in American history.  To this day, the splint is commonly used to secure small fractures and breaks. (See, for example, Henry Gassett Davis.)
