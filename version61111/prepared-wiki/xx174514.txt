The Fleetwings BT-12 Sophomore, also known by the company designation Model 23, was a 1940s all-metal basic training monoplane built by Fleetwings for the United States Army Air Forces. Only 24 production examples of the type were built before the contract was cancelled.

==Design and development==

With the outbreak of the Second World War, the United States Army Air Corps (later U.S. Army Air Forces) was ill-prepared for a major war. In an effort to obtain as many aircraft as possible the USAAF contracted Fleetwings, a specialist fabricator of sheet stainless steel,[tpl]cite book|last=Pattillo|first=Donald M.|title=Pushing the Envelope: The American Aircraft Industry|year=2001|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, MI|isbn=978-0472086719|page=131[/tpl] to produce a basic training monoplane. A prototype Model 23 was ordered as the XBT-12 during 1939.[tpl]cite book|last=Gunston|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Gunston|title=World Encyclopaedia of Aircraft Manufacturers|year=1994|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-1557509390|page=118[/tpl]
The XBT-12 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear and powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 engine. The aircraft had two identical tandem cockpits for instructor and pupil covered by a continuous canopy. It was the first military aircraft to be constructed primarily from welded stainless steel.[tpl]cite book|last=Pitkin|first=Walter|title=What's That Plane?: The Handbook for Practical Aircraft Identification|edition=2nd|year=1942|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|page=60|asin=B001DEMTMO[/tpl]
