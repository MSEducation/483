When Biden was sworn into office on January 5, 1973, by Francis R. Valeo, the Secretary of the Senate, it was in a small chapel at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.  Beau was wheeled in with his leg still in traction; Hunter, who had already been released, was also there, as were other members of the extended family.  Witnesses and television cameras were also present and the event received national attention.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yadYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pfgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5556,1874966 | title=Oath Solemn | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle | date=January 6, 1973 | page=11[/tpl]
At age 30 (the minimum age required to hold the office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm | title=Youngest Senator | publisher=United States Senate | accessdate=August 25, 2008[/tpl] But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: "I liked to around seedy neighborhoods at night when I thought there was a better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me."Biden, Promises to Keep, p. 81.
To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career.  In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator.  In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12389154 | title=On Becoming Joe Biden | work=Morning Edition | publisher=NPR | date=August 1, 2007 | accessdate=September 12, 2008[/tpl]  A single father for five years, Biden left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called.  In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident. Biden's elder son, Beau, became Delaware Attorney General and an Army Judge Advocate serving in Iraq; his younger son, Hunter, became a Washington attorney and lobbyist.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/12/27/2008-12-27_from_a_blind_date_to_second_lady_jill_bi.html?page=0 | title=From a blind date to second lady, Jill Biden's coming into her own | author=Evans, Heidi |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York | date=December 28, 2008 | accessdate=January 3, 2009[/tpl]
In 1975, Biden met Jill Tracy Jacobs, who grew up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and would become a teacher in Delaware. They had met on a blind date with the help of Biden's brother, although it turned out that Biden had already noticed her picture in a local advertisement.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/us/politics/25wife.html | title=Jill Biden Heads Toward Life in the Spotlight | author=Seelye, Katharine Q. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 24, 2008 | accessdate=August 25, 2008[/tpl]  Biden would credit her with renewing his interest in both politics and life.Biden, Promises to Keep, p. 113.

===Early Senate activities===

During his first years in the Senate, Biden focused on legislation regarding consumer-protection and environmental issues and called for greater accountability on the part of government. In mid-1974, freshman Senator Biden was named one of the 200 Faces for the Future by Time magazine, in a profile that mentioned what had happened to his family and characterized Biden as "self-confident" and "compulsively ambitious".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879402-6,00.html |title=200 Faces for the Future|magazine=Time |date =July 15, 1974|accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl]
Biden became ranking minority member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981.
In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time.  
Biden first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.Germond; Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, p. 216
Regarding foreign policy, during his first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control issues.  In response to the refusal of the U.S. Congress to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden took the initiative to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, educated him about American concerns and interests, and secured several changes to address objections of the Foreign Relations Committee.[tpl]cite book | last=Salacuse | first=Jeswald W. | title=Leading Leaders: How to Manage Smart, Talented, Rich and Powerful People | publisher=American Management Association | year=2005 | isbn=0-8144-0855-9[/tpl] p. 144.  When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT I Treaty loosely in order to allow the Strategic Defense Initiative to proceed, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty's terms.  Biden clashed again with the Reagan administration in 1986 over economic sanctions against South Africa;Current Biography Yearbook 1987, p. 45. he received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George P. Shultz at a Senate hearing because of the administration's support of that country, which continued to practice the apartheid system.[tpl]cite news|title=Biden Keeps Sights Set On White House | author=Leubsdorf, Carl P. | newspaper=The Dallas Morning News | date=September 6, 1987 | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3CF5858543A33&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/tpl] Reprinted in [tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/washington/cleubsdorf/stories/082308dnpolbiden87profile.4d6e19b.html|title=Lifelong ambition led Joe Biden to Senate, White House aspirations|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=August 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919060037/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/washington/cleubsdorf/stories/082308dnpolbiden87profile.4d6e19b.html |archivedate=September 19, 2008[/tpl]

===1988 presidential campaign===

Biden ran for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, formally declaring his candidacy at the Wilmington train station on June 9, 1987.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD91538F933A25755C0A961948260 | title= Biden Joins Campaign for the Presidency | author=Dionne Jr., E. J. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 10, 1987 | authorlink= E. J. Dionne[/tpl]  He was attempting to become the youngest president since John F. Kennedy. When the campaign began, Biden was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability on the stump, his appeal to Baby Boomers, his high profile position as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his fundraising appeal. He raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of 1987, more than any other candidate.Taylor, See How They Run, p. 83.
By August 1987, Biden's campaign, whose messaging was confused due to staff rivalries,Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 108–109. had begun to lag behind those of Michael Dukakis and Dick Gephardt,[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6123AF932A0575BC0A961948260 | title= Biden, Once the Field's Hot Democrat, Is Being Overtaken by Cooler Rivals | author=Toner, Robin | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 31, 1987[/tpl] although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.[tpl]cite book | last=Cook | first=Rhodes | chapter=The Nominating Process | title=The Elections of 1988 | editor=Nelson, Michael (ed.) | publisher=Congressional Quarterly | year=1989 | isbn=0-87187-494-6[/tpl] p. 46.  In September 1987, the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of plagiarizing a speech that had been made earlier that year by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour Party.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1531F931A2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad | author=Dowd, Maureen | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 12, 1987 | authorlink= Maureen Dowd[/tpl] Kinnock's speech included the lines:  
 "Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? pointing to his wife in the audience Why is Glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was it because all our predecessors were thick?"
 While Biden's speech included the lines:  
 "I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?  pointing to his wife in the audience Why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college? Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?" 
Biden had in fact cited Kinnock as the source for the formulation on previous occasions.[tpl]cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/139229851.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic | title=Plagiarism Suggestion Angers Biden's Aides | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=September 13, 1987 | page=A6[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]  But he made no reference to the original source at the August 23 Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair being reported on,Germond and Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, pp. 230–232. nor in an August 26 interview for the National Education Association.[tpl]cite news | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-16/news/mn-5412_1_biden-speech | title=Differing Versions Cited on Source of Passages : Biden Facing New Flap Over Speeches | date= September 16, 1987 | first=James | last=Risen | authorlink=James Risen | first2=Robert | last2=Shogan[/tpl] Moreover, while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other, Biden's use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own family's background in order to match Kinnock's.[tpl]cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/18/us/biden-admits-plagiarism-in-school-but-says-it-was-not-malevolent.html?src=pm | title=Biden Admits Plagiarism in School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent' | date= September 18, 1987 | first=E. J. | last=Dionne, Jr. | authorlink=E. J. Dionne[/tpl] Biden was soon found to have earlier that year lifted passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which Biden aides took the blame) and a short phrase from the 1961 inaugural address of John F. Kennedy, and in two prior years to have done the same with a 1976 passage from Hubert H. Humphrey.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/16/us/biden-is-facing-growing-debate-on-his-speeches.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title=Biden Is Facing Growing Debate On His Speeches | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 16, 1987 | authorlink= Maureen Dowd[/tpl]
A few days later, Biden's plagiarism incident in law school came to public light.  Video was also released showing that when earlier questioned by a New Hampshire resident about his grades in law school, Biden had stated that he had graduated in the "top half" of his class, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, and that he had received three degrees in college,[tpl]cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1j0FS0Z6ho |  publisher=C-SPAN via YouTube | title= 1988 Road to the White House with Sen. Biden | date=August 23, 2008 | accessdate=October 3, 2012[/tpl] each of which were untrue or exaggerations of his actual record.
The Kinnock and school revelations were magnified by the limited amount of other news about the nomination race at the time,[tpl]cite book | last=Pomper | first=Gerald M. | chapter=The Presidential Nominations | title=The Election of 1988 | publisher=Chatham House Publishers|year=1989 | isbn=0-934540-77-2[/tpl] p. 37. when most of the public were not yet paying attention to any of the campaigns; Biden thus fell into what The Washington Post writer Paul Taylor described as that year's trend, a "trial by media ordeal".Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 86, 88.  Biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis.Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 88–89.  He withdrew from the nomination race on September 23, 1987, saying his candidacy had been overrun by "the exaggerated shadow" of his past mistakes.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DF173AF937A1575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden Withdraws Bid for President in Wake of Furor | author=Dionne Jr., E. J. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 24, 1987 | authorlink= E. J. Dionne[/tpl]
After Biden withdrew from the race, it was revealed that the Dukakis campaign had secretly made a video highlighting the Biden–Kinnock comparison and distributed it to news outlets.[tpl]cite news|title=Offers Briton His Talks `Without Attribution' Biden Meets Kinnock, but He's Not Speechless|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 12, 1988[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite news | title=Joseph Biden's Plagiarism; Michael Dukakis's 'Attack Video' – 1988 | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/biden.htm | newspaper=The Washington Post | accessdate=August 19, 2008 | date=July 21, 1998[/tpl]  
Later in 1987, the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility cleared Biden of the law school plagiarism charges regarding his standing as a lawyer, saying Biden had "not violated any rules".[tpl]cite news | title=Professional Board Clears Biden In Two Allegations of Plagiarism | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DD1230F93AA15756C0A96F948260 | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 29, 1989[/tpl]
In February 1988, after suffering from several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by long-distance ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and given lifesaving surgery to correct an intracranial berry aneurysm that had begun leaking;[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/us/politics/20health.html | title=Many Holes in Disclosure of Nominees' Health |author=Altman, Lawrence, M.D. | newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl] the situation was serious enough that a priest had administered last rites at the hospital.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203657.html | title=Campaign Curriculum | author=Copeland, Libby | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=October 23, 2008 | accessdate=October 25, 2008 | authorlink=Libby Copeland[/tpl]  While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, which represented a major complication.  Another operation to repair a second aneurysm, which had caused no symptoms but was also at risk from bursting, was performed in May 1988.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940de5d81739f937a35756c0a96e948260 | title= Biden Resting After Surgery For Second Brain Aneurysm | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 4, 1988[/tpl]  The hospitalization and recovery kept Biden from his duties in the U.S. Senate for seven months.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/aug/22/biden-speaks-_-and-speaks-_-his-own-mind/ | title=Biden speaks – and speaks – his own mind | agency=Associated Press | publisher=Las Vegas Sun | date=August 22, 2008 | accessdate=September 7, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123915/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/aug/22/biden-speaks-_-and-speaks-_-his-own-mind/  | archivedate=August 28, 2008[/tpl]  Biden has had no recurrences or effects from the aneurysms since then.  In retrospect, Biden's family came to believe that the early end to his presidential campaign had been a blessing in disguise, for had he still been campaigning in the midst of the primaries in early 1988, he might well have not have stopped to seek medical attention and the condition might have become unsurvivable.Biden, Promises to Keep, p. 225.

===Judiciary Committee===

Biden was a long-time member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which he chaired from 1987 until 1995 and on which he served as ranking minority member from 1981 until 1987 and again from 1995 until 1997. In this capacity, he dealt with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties.
While chairman, Biden presided over the two most contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings in history, those for Robert Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991.  In the Bork hearings, Biden stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately.Bronner, Battle for Justice, pp. 138–139, 214, 305. At the close, Biden won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage, as his 1988 presidential campaign collapsed in the middle of the hearings.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF153BF93BA35753C1A961948260 | title= Washington Talk: The Bork Hearings; For Biden: Epoch of Belief, Epoch of Incredulity | author=Greenhouse, Linda | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 8, 1987 | authorlink= Linda Greenhouse[/tpl]  Rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other Bork opponents were making, Biden framed his discussion around the belief that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text, and that Bork's strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view.  Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote, and then rejected in the full Senate by a 58–42 margin.
In the Thomas hearings, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often long and convoluted, sometimes such that Thomas forgot the question being asked.Mayer; Abramson, Strange Justice, p. 213, 218, 336.  Viewers of the high-profile hearings were often annoyed by Biden's style.  Thomas later wrote that despite earlier private assurances from the senator, Biden's questions had been akin to a beanball.[tpl]cite news | title = Clarence Thomas: A Silent Justice Speaks Out: Part VI: Becoming a Judge – and perhaps a Justice| author = Greenburg, Jan Crawford| publisher = ABC News| date = September 30, 2007| url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=3664944&page=4| accessdate =October 18, 2008 [/tpl] The nomination came out of the committee without a recommendation, with Biden opposed.  In part due to his own bad experiences in 1987 with his presidential campaign, Biden was reluctant to let personal matters enter into the hearings.  Biden initially shared with committee, but not the public, Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges, on the grounds she was not yet willing to testify.  After she did, Biden did not permit other witnesses to testify further on her behalf, such as Angela Wright (who made a similar charge) and experts on harassment.[tpl]cite news | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/biden-and-anita-hill-revisited/ | title=Biden and Anita Hill, Revisited | author=Phillips, Kate | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 23, 2008 | accessdate=September 12, 2008[/tpl]  Biden said he was striving to preserve Thomas's right to privacy and the decency of the hearings.  The nomination was approved by a 52–48 vote in the full Senate, with Biden again opposed.  During and afterwards, Biden was strongly criticized by liberal legal groups and women's groups for having mishandled the hearings and having not done enough to support Hill.  Biden subsequently sought out women to serve on the Judiciary Committee and emphasized women's issues in the committee's legislative agenda.
Biden was involved in crafting many federal crime laws.  He spearheaded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, also known as the Biden Crime Law, which included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004 after its ten-year sunset period and was not renewed.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/412f47b0-5694-11e2-aad0-00144feab49a.html#axzz2JYR1txDj | title=Biden faces key role in second term | author=Fifield, Anna | newspaper=Financial Times | date=January 4, 2013[/tpl]  It also included the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat domestic violence and provides billions of dollars in federal funds to address gender-based crimes. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Morrison that the section of VAWA allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence exceeded Congress's authority and therefore was unconstitutional.[tpl]cite web|title=United States v.

Biden was critical of the actions of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, and said "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another Independent Counsel is granted the same powers.Almanac of American Politics 2000, p. 372.  Biden voted to acquit on both charges during the impeachment of President Clinton.
As chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. "Drug Czar", who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In April 2003, he introduced the controversial Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, also known as the RAVE Act. He continued to work to stop the spread of "date rape drugs" such as flunitrazepam, and drugs such as Ecstasy and Ketamine. In 2004, he worked to pass a bill outlawing steroids like androstenedione, the drug used by many baseball players.
Biden's legislation to promote college aid and loan programs allows families to deduct on their annual income tax returns up to $10,000 per year in higher education expenses. His "Kids 2000" legislation established a public/private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, Internet access, and technical training to young people, particularly to low-income and at-risk youth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&&|title=Kids 2000 Program|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223064751/http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&& |archivedate=December 23, 2007|accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl]

===Foreign Relations Committee===

Biden was also a long-time member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1997, he became the ranking minority member and chaired the committee in January 2001 and from June 2001 through 2003. When Democrats re-took control of the Senate following the 2006 elections, Biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in 2007.  Biden was generally a liberal internationalist in foreign policy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/world/americas/24iht-policy.4.15591832.html | title=In Biden, Obama chooses a foreign policy adherent of diplomacy before force | author=Gordon, Michael R. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 24, 2008 | accessdate=November 5, 2009 | authorlink=Michael R. Gordon[/tpl]  He collaborated effectively with important Republican Senate figures such as Richard Lugar and Jesse Helms and sometimes went against elements of his own party.  Biden was also co-chair of the NATO Observer Group in the Senate.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/1997/9705-05.htm | title=Transatlantic relations: Stormy weather on the way to enlargement? | author=Sloan, Stanley | publisher=NATO Review|date=October 1997| accessdate=August 29, 2008[/tpl]  A partial list covering this time showed Biden meeting with some 150 leaders from nearly 60 countries and international organizations.[tpl]cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/09/23/meetings_with_foreign_leaders.html | title=Meetings with Foreign Leaders?

Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.  Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the "lift and strike" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.  Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.  In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/06/AR2008100602681.html | title=Biden Played Less Than Key Role in Bosnia Legislation | author=Kessler, Glenn | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=October 7, 2008 | accessdate=November 5, 2009 | authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist)[/tpl]  Biden related that he told Milošević, "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one."  Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. The 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina then led to the Dayton Agreement and a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.  Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his "proudest moment in public life" that related to foreign policy.  In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo.[tpl]cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121954185485266719.html | title=Biden, McCain Have a Friendship – and More – in Common | author=Holmes, Elizabeth | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=August 25, 2008 | accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl]  In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of "Twelve Who Made a Difference" for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.
Biden had voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/24/nation/na-foreignpol24 | title=Joe Biden respected – if not always popular – for foreign policy record | author=Richter, Paul and Levey, Noam N. | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=August 24, 2008 | accessdate=November 5, 2009[/tpl] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DD1738F930A25752C0A967958260 | title=Congress Acts to Authorize War in Gulf | author=Clymer, Adam | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 13, 1991 | authorlink=Adam Clymer[/tpl]  Biden was a strong supporter of the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying "Whatever it takes, we should do it." Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security, and that there was no option but to eliminate that threat.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18381961/page/2 | title=MTP Transcript for April 29, 2007 | author=Tim Russert | publisher=MSNBC | date=April 29, 2007  |page=2[/tpl] The Bush administration rejected an effort Biden undertook with Senator Richard Lugar to pass a resolution authorizing military action only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War.  While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal.  He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about the cost and length of the conflict.Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 365.
By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted, and he opposed the troop surge of 2007, saying General David Petraeus was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work. Biden was instead a leading advocate for dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/weekinreview/19shanker.html | title=Divided They Stand, but on Graves | author=Thom Shanker | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 19, 2007[/tpl] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H.

In September 2007, a non-binding resolution passed the Senate endorsing such a scheme.  However, the idea was unfamiliar, had no political constituency, and failed to gain traction. Iraq's political leadership united in denouncing the resolution as a de facto partitioning of the country, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement distancing itself.
In March 2004, Biden secured the brief release of Libyan democracy activist and political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, after meeting with leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/27/international/africa/27libya.html | title=For a Critic, Libya's Nascent Openness Doesn't Apply | author=Smith, Craig S. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 27, 2004 | accessdate=November 5, 2009 | authorlink=Craig S.

Bush for his speech to Israel's Knesset in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting in the same way some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stated: "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated, "Since when does this administration think that if you sit down, you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?"[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/15/bush.dems/index.html | title=Dems fire back at Bush on 'appeasement' statement | author=Henry, Ed | publisher=CNN | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=September 2, 2008[/tpl]

===Delaware matters===

Biden was a familiar figure to his Delaware constituency, by virtue of his daily train commuting from there,  and generally sought to attend to state needs.  Biden was a strong supporter of increased Amtrak funding and rail security; he hosted barbecues and an annual Christmas dinner for the Amtrak crews, and they would sometimes hold the last train of the night a few minutes so he could catch it.  He earned the nickname "Amtrak Joe" as a result (and in 2011, Amtrak's Wilmington Station was named the Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Railroad Station, in honor of the over 7,000 trips he made from there).[tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/03/amtrak-joe-biden-gets-his-own-train-station.html | title='Amtrak Joe' Biden Gets His Own Train Station | author=Travers, Karen | publisher=ABC News | date=March 16, 2011 | accessdate=March 16, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110319/NEWS03/110319015/Biden-I-don-t-deserve-Amtrak-station-honor?odyssey=tab%7Cmostpopular%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE | title=Biden: 'I don't deserve' Amtrak station honor | author=Bothum, Kelly | newspaper=The News Journal | date=March 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] He was an advocate for Delaware military installations, including Dover Air Force Base and New Castle Air National Guard Base.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://carper.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=246342 | title=Senate Approves $24.4 Million for Guard, Dover Air Force Bases | publisher=United States Senate for Thomas R.

In 1975, Biden broke from liberal orthodoxy when he took legislative action to limit desegregation busing.  In doing so, he said busing was a "bankrupt idea violated the cardinal rule of common sense," and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.  Three years later, Wilmington's federally mandated cross-district busing plan generated much turmoil, and in trying to legislate a compromise solution, Biden found himself alienating both black and white voters for a while.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/politics/18biden.html | title=Biden's Record on Race Is Scuffed by 3 Episodes | author=Broder, John M. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 17, 2008 | accessdate=November 2, 2008[/tpl]
Since 1991, Biden has served as an adjunct professor at the Widener University School of Law, Delaware's only law school, where he has taught a seminar on constitutional law.[tpl]cite web | url=http://law.widener.edu/Academics/Faculty/ProfilesDeAdj/BidenJosephR.aspx | title=Faculty: Joseph R.

Biden was a sponsor of bankruptcy legislation during the 2000s, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies, and other credit card issuers.  Biden fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid anti-abortion felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines; the overall bill was vetoed by Bill Clinton in 2000 but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting.  The downstate Sussex County region is the nation's top chicken-producing area, and Biden held up trade agreements with Russia when that country stopped importing U.S. chickens.
In 2007, Biden requested and gained $67 million worth of projects for his constituents through congressional earmarks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/clinton-tops-2008-rivals-gets-530m-in-earmarks-2007-11-09.htm|title=Clinton tops 2008 rivals, gets $530M in earmarks |date=November 9, 2007|accessdate=August 24, 2008|newspaper=The Hill|author=Bolton, Alexander[/tpl]

===Characteristics as senator===

Following his initial election in 1972, Biden was re-elected to six additional terms, in the elections of 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, usually getting about 60 percent of the vote.  He did not face strong opposition; Pete du Pont, then a governor, chose not to run against him in 1984.Current Biography Yearbook 1987, p. 44.  Biden spent 28 years as a junior senator due to the two-year seniority of his Republican colleague William V. Roth, Jr. After Roth was defeated for re-election by Tom Carper in 2000, Biden became Delaware's senior senator. He then became the longest-serving senator in Delaware history.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/23/biden.democrat.vp.candidate/ | title= Obama introduces Biden as running mate | publisher=CNN | date=August 23, 2008 | accessdate=September 18, 2008[/tpl]  In May 1999, Biden set the mark for youngest senator to cast 10,000 votes.[tpl]cite web | url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itps/0301/ijpe/pj61bios.htm | title=Senator Joseph Biden (Democrat, Delaware) | publisher=U.S. State Department |date=March 2001 | accessdate=November 26, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712124319/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itps/0301/ijpe/pj61bios.htm |archivedate = July 12, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

Nor is Biden known for modesty; journalist James Traub has written that "Biden's vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the rarefied standards of the U.S. Senate."
Political writer Howard Fineman has said that, "Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift."  Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better."  Traub concludes that "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself."

===2008 presidential campaign===

Biden had thought about running for president again ever since his failed 1988 bid.[tpl]refn|group=nb| Biden chose not to run for president in 1992 in part because he had voted against the resolution authorizing the Gulf War.

During his campaign, Biden focused on the war in Iraq and his support for the implementation of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy.  Despite speculation to the contrary,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/candidate-secretary-state |title=A Candidate For Secretary Of State|newspaper=The New York Observer|date = June 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl] Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates?

Biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy.  On the day of his January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator Barack Obama: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/36658|title=Biden Unbound: Lays Into Clinton, Obama, Edwards |author=Horowitz, Jason|work=The New York Observer|date=February 4, 2007[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|   Several linguists and political analysts stated that the correct transcription includes a comma after the word "African-American", which one said "would significantly change the meaning (and the degree of offensiveness) of Biden's comment".[tpl]cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004131.html|title=Language Log: Biden's Comma|author=Liberman, Mark|date=February 1, 2007|publisher=Language Log|authorlink=Mark Liberman[/tpl][/tpl] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities;Heilemann and Halperin, Game Change, p. 336. it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1690170_1690790,00.html | title=Top 10 Campaign Gaffes | author=Lim, Christine| coauthors=M.J.

Overall, Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton;[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080825_3122.php | title=Conventions 2008: Sen.

Despite the lack of success, Biden's stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign.  In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama.  Although the two had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close, with Biden having resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,Wolffe, Renegade, p. 218. and Obama having viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.Heilemann and Halperin, Game Change, pp. 28, 337–338.  Now, having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaigning style and appeal to working class voters, and Biden was convinced that Obama was "the real deal".

===2008 vice-presidential campaign===

Since shortly following Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Obama had been privately telling Biden that he was interested in finding an important place for him in a possible Obama administration.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/20/081020fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all | title=Biden's Brief | author=Lizza, Ryan |work=The New Yorker | date=October 20, 2008 | accessdate=November 24, 2008 | authorlink=Ryan Lizza[/tpl]  Biden declined Obama's first request to vet him for the vice presidential slot, fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his senate position, but subsequently changed his mind.  In a June 22, 2008, interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Biden confirmed that, although he was not actively seeking a spot on the ticket, he would accept the vice presidential nomination if offered.[tpl]cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/06/23/biden-id-say-yes-to-being-vp/ |title=Biden: I'd say yes to being VP|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 23, 2008|date=June 23, 2008[/tpl] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss a possible vice-presidential relationship, and the two hit it off well personally.

After his selection as a vice presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/sep/08090212.html |title=Scranton Bishop Says He will Refuse Communion to Joseph Biden |publisher=Lifesitenews.com |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008[/tpl]  The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden would not be allowed to speak at Catholic schools.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.catholicexchange.com/2008/08/28/113619/ | title=Biden's Bishop Will not Permit Him, Even if Elected VP, to Speak at Catholic Schools | author=Westen, John-Henry | publisher=Catholic Exchange | date=August 28, 2008 | accessdate=October 2, 2008[/tpl]  Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights;[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Abortion Issue Again Dividing Catholic Votes  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/us/politics/17catholics.html?bl&ex=1221883200&en=1e3acb5115249581&ei=5087%0A |work=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 19, 2008 [/tpl] however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish.

Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'"
