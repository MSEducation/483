The Springfield Terminal railroad bridge in Deerfield, Massachusetts is a three-span deck-truss bridge which crosses the Connecticut River.

==History==

The railroad crossing at this location dates to 1850 when a branch of the Fitchburg Railroad opened from Grout's Corner west to Greenfield. This line would later connect to the Hoosac Tunnel, which opened to rail traffic in 1875.
Currently, the bridge carries rail traffic in and out of the former Boston & Maine Railroad yard at East Deerfield, MA, which is now owned by Pan Am Railways.  It is located at the east end of the yard.
