==Marriage and issue==

The Duke of Kent married Katharine Worsley at York Minster on 8 June 1961. Katharine is the only daughter of Sir William Arthrington Worsley, 4th Bt., and his wife, Joyce Morgan Brunner. After their wedding, she was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Kent, though in 2002, she ceased to use the style of Royal Highness and has expressed a preference to be known as  Katharine, Duchess of Kent, the latter the typical style of a divorced or widowed peeress, which she is not. However she remained legally HRH The Duchess of Kent.
The Duke and Duchess of Kent have three children, none of whom carries out royal duties:
The Duchess of Kent converted to Roman Catholicism in 1994.[tpl]cite news|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|title=Duke of Kent being treated in hospital after 'mild’ stroke|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9947240/Duke-of-Kent-being-treated-in-hospital-after-mild-stroke.html|accessdate=21 March 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 March 2013[/tpl]   Because this conversion did not occur until many years after their marriage, it did not cause the Duke to lose his place in the line of succession (the Act of Settlement 1701 only applies where the spouse is a Catholic at the time of marriage). The couple's son Lord Nicholas also converted to Roman Catholicism following his mother's example.
