The average depth of Platte Lake is 24 feet deep. The deepest point of the lake is measured at 95 feet deep. The Platte River flows through the lake at a speed of 120 cubic feet per second. This means the residence time for the water in Platte lake is 6 months. Also meaning that every hour 3.3 million gallons of water are passing through Big Platte Lake. This is an extremely fast residence time. The Platte River flows in and back out Platte lake and continues downstream in and out through Loon Lake until it finally reaches Lake Michigan.

==Geography==

Big Platte Lake is located in Benzie county, which was molded into a land full of sand dunes by the glacial formations. Along with the sand dunes, the glaciers also left many lakes in the area, not only in Benzie but throughout the area. Big Platte Lake is located at an elevation of 584 feet (178 meters) above sea level. Platte Lake is one of the largest of the lakes located in Benzie Michigan.

==Geology==

Big Platte Lake is surrounded by sand dunes that were formed by glaciers and it is believed that these same glaciers also formed the many lakes in the Benzie area, not excluding Platte Lake. These sand dunes and glacial formations have since 1970 been protected under state law. The lakes bottom is filled with sand much like the sand that rolls over the massive dunes that overlook Lake Michigan and that make up Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.

A foreign species of mussel, called the zebra mussel has over the past 20 years inhabited Platte Lake as well as many other lakes in the Great Lake area. These mussels help water clarity, but they are not native to the Northern Michigan area. They have been transported to North America by large vessels from Asia. They are a serious problem because they have nearly eliminated the native clam population in Platte Lake and many other bodies of water in the area.
