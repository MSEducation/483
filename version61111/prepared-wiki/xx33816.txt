The Goonies is a 1985 American adventure–comedy film directed by Richard Donner. The screenplay was written by Chris Columbus from a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg. The film's premise features a band of pre-teens who live in the "Goon Docks" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon attempting to save their homes from demolition, and in doing so, discover an old Spanish map that leads them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willie, a legendary 17th-century pirate.

==Plot==

The Goonies, a group of friends living in the "Goon Docks" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon, face foreclosure on their families' homes from the expanding Astoria Country Club. On their last weekend together their morale sinks particularly low because Mikey's (Sean Astin) older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) failed his driver's license exam, thwarting their plans to "cruise the coast in style." While rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and an artifact relating to a rumor of a lost pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Hearing the call of adventure, Mikey tries to persuade his friends to join him in search for the treasure hoarded by a pirate named One-Eyed Willie. Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Brand, and escape for one last "Goonie adventure."
They head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon. They are unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout. After first encountering the family, the Goonies come back after the Fratellis have left and discover their criminal intents. They send Chunk (Jeff Cohen), the group's clumsy, heavy-set dreamer and teller of tall tales, to get help. However, the Fratellis return before they can leave, forcing the Goonies to use a cavern underneath the restaurant to escape. The Fratellis capture Chunk and interrogate him, learning nothing until a colony of bats burst out of the cavern beneath the restaurant. Chunk is placed in the same room with the forsaken and deformed Fratelli brother, Sloth (John Matuszak), while the rest of the Fratellis enter the cavern and follow the Goonies' trail.
As the Goonies traverse the cavern, Mikey discovers that it matches up with the map and convinces the rest of the group to continue to follow it to find the treasure. They overcome many deadly traps set by One-Eyed Willie, and eventually arrive at a large underground cavern and a lagoon where Willie's ship, the Inferno, lies waiting. While others begin to fill their pockets with the riches on the ship, Mikey locates Willie's remains, and reverently acknowledges him as the "first Goonie", leaving part of the treasure with him as a mark of respect. However, as the Goonies exit the hold, they are cornered by the Fratellis, who take the kids' treasure and force them to walk the plank. The Goonies are saved by the timely arrival of Chunk and Sloth, now close friends, who help the rest of the group to shore. With the children no longer a threat, the Fratellis ransack the rest of the ship, including the share of the treasure Mikey left for Willie. This sets off a final booby trap, causing the cave to begin collapsing. The Goonies flee through a hole in the cave, finding themselves on a beach. Two passing policemen spot them and call in for help.
The Goonies are soon reunited with their families while the Fratellis are taken into custody and Chunk offers to take Sloth into his home. As the Astoria Country Club calls upon Mikey's father to sign over the final deed to his property, Rosalita (Lupe Ontiveros), the Walshes' maid, discovers that Mikey's marble bag contains a large handful of precious jewels taken from the ship. Mikey's father quickly estimates that their value is more than enough to save the Goon Docks. As the families rejoice, they spot the unmanned Inferno, now free of the cave, drifting away.

Notes

==Production==

Principal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984 and lasted five months. There was an additional six weeks of ADR recording.[tpl]cite video | title=Audio commentary from The Goonies DVD (2001)[/tpl] The shooting script was lengthy, over 120 pages, and several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's denouement, mention is made of an octopus which seems like an exaggeration of the actual events but actually refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut.
In The Making of The Goonies, director Richard Donner notes the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. Donner praises them for their energy and excitement, but says that they were a handful when brought together. The documentary frequently shows him coaching the young actors and reveals some of the techniques he used to get realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willie's ship, which was actually an impressive full-sized mock-up of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the child actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters. The characters' first glimpse of the ship was thus basically also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, Corey Feldman admits to having seen it beforehand with another co-star he does not name,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] and that particular scene in the movie is actually the second shot, as the cast was so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be re-shot. It was later noted that the entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-goonies |title=10 Things You Might Not Know About The Goonies |publisher=Tor.com |accessdate=November 5, 2013[/tpl]
In his book There and Back Again, Sean Astin claims that Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg were "like codirectors" on the film as he compares and contrasts their styles when directing scenes.[tpl]cite book |title=There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale |author1=Sean Astin |author2=Joe Layden |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn=9780312331474 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p_YvkXQ-djQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA135#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=135[/tpl]
Some of the on-location filming was done in Astoria, Oregon. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/travel/index.ssf/2010/05/loony_for_the_goonies_astoria.html |title=Loony for 'The Goonies'? Astoria film museum awaits |author=Jennifer Margulis |date=May 30, 2010 |publisher=OregonLive.com[/tpl] The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home at 368 38th Street. The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willie's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vipstudiotour.warnerbros.com/extended-hours/ |title=Warner Bros. to Extend Tour to Weekends March 26-August 27 |publisher=Warner Bros. |accessdate=May 20, 2012[/tpl]

==Video games==

Datasoft produced a Goonies video game for Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family and Apple II in 1985, which was later ported to the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC by US Gold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/goonies_|title=The Goonies for Amstrad CPC (1986)|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/goonies/goonies.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: The Goonies|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl] This game featured eight screens in which a player had to use two members of the Goonies group to solve puzzles and reach an exit to advance to the next stage. The screens were largely inspired by actual sets and puzzles seen in the film. A reference to the aforementioned "octopus scene" is included, as the seventh level.
In 1986, Konami created two versions of The Goonies for the MSX (The Goonies) in Japan and Europe, and Family Computer (The Goonies)  in Japan. The Goonies II was also released on the Famicom (and its international counterpart, the Nintendo Entertainment System). The Goonies II was released in North America, Europe and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the Nintendo Vs. System arcade machine in the 1980s. The Goonies II had little to do with the film, but achieved a following for its inventive gameplay. In it the Fratellis have managed to kidnap all of the Goonies (except Mikey, whom the player guides) and hide them in hidden cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named Annie.
In February 2007, DaimlerChrysler's Jeep division sponsored The Goonies: Return to Astoria, a Flash based game, developed by Fuel Industries. The player's goal is to collect map pieces and doubloons, and then race the Fratellis to One-Eyed Willie's treasure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.returntoastoria.com |title=ReturnToAstoria.com |publisher=ReturnToAstoria.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-13[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fuelindustries.com/casestudies/returntoastoria |title=Jeep presents The Goonies: Return To Astoria |publisher=Fuel Industries |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30[/tpl]

==Soundtrack and score album==

The Goonies: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack featured music by Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon, The Bangles, and others. The cast members (except Kerri Green) appeared alongside professional wrestlers "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and "Captain" Lou Albano in the 12 minute "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" music video. Steven Spielberg makes a cameo appearance. Lauper also has a cameo in the film, performing the song on TV, although the song was not completed until after filming.
Dave Grusin's score was unavailable for 25 years. The main theme, "Fratelli Chase", has been used in numerous trailers (such as Innerspace and Guarding Tess), and was re-recorded by Grusin and the London Symphony Orchestra for the album Cinemagic. The score makes liberal use of the Max Steiner-composed theme from Adventures of Don Juan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/11/02/the_goonies_25th_anniversary_collector|title='The Goonies 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition' On DVD & Blu-ray Nov. 2|work=starpulse.com|accessdate=2010-11-02|date=2010-11-02[/tpl]
Soundtrack label Varèse Sarabande released the score in March 2010 in a limited edition of 5000 copies.

The possibility of a film sequel has been confirmed and denied many times in recent years by the original cast and crew.
