Affleck also directed his third feature, Argo, for producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov.

==Activities==

===Charitable and humanitarian projects===

Affleck is a philanthropist. Affleck's support of the non-profit charitable organization the A-T Children's Project,[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://www.communityatcp.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&id=118 |publisher=AT Children's Project |title=Update |date=September 2001 |accessdate=September 22, 2007 [/tpl] began while he was filming Forces of Nature. Affleck met a then nine-year-old child, Joe Kindregan, who has the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). The disease, described as like having muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency and cancer all at once, is progressive; children with A-T usually do not live beyond their late teens. Affleck attends benefits and spoke to Congress to advocate for the charity, and in 2007 was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony of Falls Church High School in Fairfax, Virginia, from which Kindregan was graduating.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/01/arts/NA-A-E-CEL-US-Ben-Affleck-Graduation.php |title=Ben Affleck pays tribute to teen friend at high school graduation |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |date=June 1, 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune[/tpl]
In June 2008 he appeared in an ABC News exclusive report exploring the humanitarian crisis in the Eastern Congo. Affleck travelled to the African nation and interviewed refugees, warlords, and members of parliament. "I think the more painful something is, the more you want to distance yourself from it," he said. "I think the hard part is actually to let some of that go and to realize that when you see some of these images of people suffering in some way or another, to kind of remember that these are people who are in fact just in different circumstances than you are, but that are kind of dealing with circumstances in a pretty brave and enduring way."[tpl]cite news |first=Katie |last=Escherich |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=5214496&page=1 |title=Ben Affleck's Journey Through the Congo |accessdate=June 30, 2008 |date=June 23, 2008|publisher=ABC News[/tpl] In December 2008, he teamed up with the United Nations releasing a short film highlighting the plight of Congolese refugees,[tpl]cite news | first=Maha | last=Saad |author2=Margaret Besheer | title=Ben Affleck, UN Team Up to Raise DRC Refugee Awareness | date=December 17, 2008 | url =http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-12-17-voa97.cfm | publisher = Voice Of America | accessdate = December 22, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081219141303/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-12-17-voa97.cfm| archivedate= December 19, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and in March 2010, Affleck announced the formation of the Eastern Congo Initiative, which he founded as "the first U.S.-based advocacy and grant-making initiative wholly focused on working with and for the people of eastern Congo".[tpl]cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/03/22/congo.affleck/index.html |title=Ben Affleck Launches Aid Group for Eastern Congo |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 31, 2010 | date=March 23, 2010[/tpl] In April 2013, Affleck announced that he would take part in Global Poverty Project's "Live Below the Line" campaign, which consists in living on $1.50 a day to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the world.[tpl]cite web|last=Billups|first=Andrea|title=Ben Affleck to Live in Extreme Poverty – on $1.50 a Day|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20694093,00.html|work=People|accessdate=April 25, 2013|date=April 24, 2013[/tpl]

===Political activism===

In the final weeks of the 2000 Presidential campaign, Affleck promoted the Democratic ticket, supporting Al Gore and repeatedly delivering a get-out-the-vote plea: "It's very important to vote. The president will appoint three or four Supreme Court justices."[tpl]cite web |first=Roger |last=Simon |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/001120/archive_009683_2.htm |title=A Long, Strange Journey |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |date=November 12, 2000 |work=U.S. News and World Report[/tpl] During the final week of the race, Affleck—along with Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen, Rob Reiner and other actors—spent an hour at a phone bank calling registered Democrats.[tpl]cite web |first=Monique |last=Simpson |url=http://dailybruin.ucla.edu/stories/2000/nov/1/gore-rallies-supporters-in-wes/ |title=Gore rallies supporters in Westwood |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |date=November 1, 2000 |work=Daily Bruin [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] "People in my generation have a low voter turnout. One of the reasons that I'm here is to demonstrate that no matter who you are going to vote for ...I think it's important to get involved and get out and vote," he told reporters. "But I'm going to tell people to vote for Gore."
On October 28, 2000, Affleck flew with Hillary Clinton, who was running for a Senate seat, to Ithaca, New York, where he introduced her at a Cornell University rally. He told the college crowd that Clinton had been advocating for women and working families since "Rick Lazio was running around the frat house in his underwear". Lazio, then a Long Island congressman, was Clinton's Republican opponent.[tpl]cite web |first=J.D. |last=Heyman |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/benaffleck/articles/story/5931795/the_bachelor |title=The Bachelor: Ben Affleck |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |date=June 15, 2001 |work=Rolling Stone| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080513233517/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/benaffleck/articles/story/5931795/the_bachelor| archivedate= May 13, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl]
On November 6, 2000, the final day of the campaign, Affleck was one of several high-profile celebrities summoned to Miami Beach by Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein for a late-night Gore rally, just hours before polls opened nationwide. The Gore campaign's last event, a final effort to energize South Beach voters, did not end until about 1:00 am, but Affleck flew back to New York that morning and made a surprise live appearance on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. It was 10:15 am when he made his final public pitch from a Rockefeller Center studio, noting that he was "a little bit tired ... I've been out getting involved, doing stuff and trying to get people to vote. And that's why I came by here". Also, "Today is the get-out-the-vote day and ... I think this is the time to get involved, especially the young folks who are here ... I'm about to go vote," He then said, "I am personally gonna vote for Al Gore".
As votes were tallied that night, Affleck told Salon.com's Amy Reiter, "I'm nervous this evening, but one of the things that's exciting to me is the number of people who voted. No matter who wins, I think it's a healthy thing for our country that so many voters have come out and participated in the process. Either way, I think the most important number will be the turnout".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/11/08/reacts_ny/|title=Ben Affleck: "I hope Nader can still sleep"|last=Reiter|first=Amy|date=November 8, 2000|work=Salon|accessdate=September 1, 2009[/tpl]
In the May 2001 issue of GQ, Affleck said, "My fantasy is that someday I'm independently wealthy enough that I'm not beholden to anybody, so I can run for Congress on the grounds that everyday people should be in government". However, when he was asked about his political ambitions in an April 2009 interview to promote the 2009 film, State of Play, Affleck said, "I really like my job that I have now. Plus, unlike in Hollywood where you need one director to hire you, in politics you have to have a lot of people to vote for you. I think it's harder work. I really am happy with what I'm doing now. In fact I've never been at a place where I've felt better about going to work everyday. I'm more engaged and very, very happy."
In 2004, Affleck actively campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.[tpl]cite news |first=Carl |last=Hulse |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/26/politics/trail/26TRAIL-BEN.html |title=Ben Affleck Plays Himself at Convention |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |date=July 26, 2004 |work=The New York Times[/tpl] During the first day of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, he was featured on Larry King Live with Tucker Carlson and Al Sharpton.[tpl]cite news |first=Richard |last=Corliss |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993703-1,00.html |title=The Trial of Ben Affable |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |date=March 29, 2004 |work=Time[/tpl] Larry King asked if he would consider running for office, and Affleck admitted to contemplating the proposition. Specific attention focused on whether he would run for Kerry's open Senate seat (as Affleck was from Massachusetts). He noted that the line between politics and entertainment is becoming increasingly blurred, as Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger both came from the entertainment business.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/07/28/loc_cvn1z.html|title=Convention notebook|date=July 28, 2004|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=April 28, 2009[/tpl]
Affleck supports legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004, "I don't think the government should be involved in any way in people's bedrooms or lives. With so much hatred and unpleasantness in the world, why would you want to get in the way of people who love each other marrying each other? Anybody who wants to be able to get married to anybody else should be able to.

Despite his opposition to George W. Bush's policies as president, in an interview with Bill O'Reilly in July 2004 Affleck said, "I had the pleasure of and the honor of meeting the President of the United States at the Daytona 500. I found him to be a collegial, affable, kind guy." He went on to say Bush "is a patriot and he's a man who believes in the country. He's trying to further an agenda he believes in. I happen to disagree with most of his policies, but I respect the man."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127324,00.html|title=Ben Affleck Talks Politics |accessdate=July 28, 2004 |date=July 27, 2008 |publisher=Fox News[/tpl]
On December 21, 2010, Affleck appeared on NPR and criticized CEOs for making so much money. "CEOs' pay shouldn't be 200 times the average worker.

On 12 March 2013, Affleck was officially censured by the parliament of New Zealand for misportraying the role of New Zealand diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis in his film Argo.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/movie-argo-misled-the-world/story-e6frf7k6-1226595680820 |title= Movie Argo 'misled the world' |publisher= Herald Sun |date= 12 March 2013 |accessdate= 12 March 2013[/tpl]
On 26 February 2014, Affleck was set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the mass killings of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Affleck is criticized for not having a "qualified resume" to take part in such activities–his only experience consisting of his philanthropic organization, the Eastern Congo Initiative. One aide at the House Foreign Affairs Committee claimed "People serious about resolving problems - especially problems related to life and death - want to have serious conversations with experts and leaders in the field; not celebrities." In response, to defend Affleck, another aide state "I think there's value in having someone like Ben there, he's pretty invested in the issue."[tpl]cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=Exclusive: Ben Affleck to Testify Before Congress as an Africa Expert|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/02/19/ben_affleck_to_testify_before_congress_as_an_africa_expert|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Cable|date=20 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Heil|first=Emily|title=Ben Affleck set to testify in the Senate, but the House said ‘no, thanks’|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2014/02/20/ben-affleck-set-to-testify-in-the-senate-but-the-house-said-no-thanks/|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=20 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=McMurry|first=Evan|title=Ben Affleck to Testify Before Senate as Congo Expert|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/ben-affleck-to-testify-before-senate-as-congo-expert/|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=Mediaite|date=20 February 2014[/tpl]
