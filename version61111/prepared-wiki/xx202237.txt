Frankfort would be the only Union state capital captured in the war.  Confederate general Kirby Smith would capture the town on September 3, 1862, and would continue a Confederate force until the Battle of Perryville, which forced the Confederacy away from any future control of Kentucky during the American Civil War.  This would cause the Union citizenry to build two forts to protect Frankfort.  These forts prevented John Hunt Morgan from recapturing the city for the Confederacy in 1864.Confederate Invasion of Kentucky, late 1862
