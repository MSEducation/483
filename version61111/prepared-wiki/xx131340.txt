==History==

European-Canadians first settled the area around Russell around 1880.  The first post office began operations at a site north of the present town in 1880, and was called "Shell River".  The closest CPR (Canadian Pacific Railway) point was renamed to Russell in 1889.  Also in 1889, a Dr Barnardo's Home for boys was established.  The home and local farmers sponsored transportation for British orphans to come to the area to work on farms.  The town of Russell was officially incorporated in 1913.

==Industrial development==

Recent changes to agriculture, such as the elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Subsidy, have put the region in a unique position. With one of the highest freight rates in western Canada, the Russell area is well-positioned to experience an explosion in value-added processing.  Bunge Canada, an advanced canola-processing plant, is located at Harrowby, 15 km west of Russell.
Nearby potash mining in Saskatchewan provides jobs for numerous Russell residents, as well as purchasing supplies and services locally. The first potash mine in Manitoba has been proposed for a site just southwest of Russell.
The town of Russell and the surrounding rural municipalities are promoting tourism through the Asessippi Parkland Economic Development Corp.
