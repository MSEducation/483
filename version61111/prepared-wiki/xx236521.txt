The 2013 Los Angeles mayoral election was held on March 5, 2013, to elect the mayor of Los Angeles. No candidate received a majority of the primary votes to be elected outright, and the top two finishers, Democrats Eric Garcetti and Wendy Greuel advanced to a runoff vote. On May 21, 2013 Garcetti was elected mayor with a majority of the votes in the runoff.
Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan but candidates receive support and endorsements from their respective parties or affiliated organizations. The Los Angeles County Republican Party endorsed Kevin James, the lone Republican in the field, while the Los Angeles County Democratic Party supported the candidacies of Garcetti, Greuel, Perry and Pleitez without making an endorsement.
Incumbent mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was ineligible to run because of term limits.

Articles in the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News suggested that the fiscal state of Los Angeles will likely play a major role in the election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/11/la-faces-1-billion-deficit-by-2013-budget-chief-calls-for-pension-reforms.html|title=L.A. faces $1-billion deficit by 2013; budget chief calls for pension reforms|date=November 25, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Phil|last=Willon[/tpl] Also a question is the role that Villaraigosa's popularity will play; in 2009 his support was seen as more of a liability than an asset.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/21/local/me-city21|title=Trutanich defeats Weiss in L.A. city attorney's race|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|first1=David|last1=Zahniser|first2=Maeve|last2=Reston[/tpl]
