CATEGORIES: Phantom islands, Reefs of the Pacific Ocean

Jupiter Reef or Jupiter Breakers is a supposed reef in the South Pacific (south of French Tuamotu islands and east of New Zealand); it appears to be a phantom reef.
Mr. Kinge, commanding the German barque Jupiter on a voyage between Newcastle, New South Wales and Tahiti, reported having passed breakers during the night of December 3rd, 1878, in [tpl]coord|36|37|S|150|15|W|[/tpl]. The breakers were observed in two places, each of which had a diameter of about 30 yards, and appeared to be a quarter of a mile apart. No further intelligence has been obtained regarding this shoal.[tpl]cite book |last=Great Britain Hydrographic Dept |title=Pacific Islands, v. 3 |edition=3 |publisher= |location=London |year=1900 |isbn= |page=27 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IwqwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA27 |accessdate=2011-09-26 [/tpl]
