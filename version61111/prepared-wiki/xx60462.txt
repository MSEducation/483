A Perfect Circle is an American rock supergroup formed in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. The original incarnation of the band also included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Tim Alexander on drums, with Josh Freese being the band's primary drummer after the band's initial round of touring prior to their first album. The latest lineup features Puscifer and Ashes Divide bassist Matt McJunkins and former guitarist for The Smashing Pumpkins, James Iha. Despite having a varied cast since inception, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and melodies.
A Perfect Circle has released three albums: Mer de Noms (2000),  Thirteenth Step (2003) and Emotive (2004). A CD-DVD set, Amotion, was released alongside Emotive released and contains thirteen music videos in addition to a number of song remixes created by Danny Lohner, Robert Del Naja and other artists.
The band went into hiatus in 2004. Since then band members have worked on other projects, the most notable being Keenan's work on Tool's 2006 album 10,000 Days and Howerdel's album Keep Telling Myself It's Alright under Ashes Divide, his name for his solo work. The two announced they had reformed to work on new material in late 2008, although the band was not publicly active until 2010, when the band began touring again.
On November 19, 2013, the band released a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, which contains one new song, "By and Down", and on November 26, 2013, the band released a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo. While the band continues to work on new material since its reformation, few details exist regarding a timetable or form of the release.

==History==

===Mer de Noms (1999–2001)===

A Perfect Circle was conceived by Billy Howerdel, a former guitar technician for Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fishbone and Tool. Howerdel met singer Maynard James Keenan in 1992 when Tool was opening for Fishbone, and the two became friends. Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his North Hollywood home. This provided Howerdel the opportunity to play demos of his music for Keenan. Pleased with what he heard, Keenan remarked, "I can hear myself singing songs."[tpl]cite book |last= Summers |first= Jodi |title= Making and Marketing Music |publisher= Allworth Communications, Inc. |year= 2004 |page=16 |isbn= 1-58115-387-2 [/tpl] Although he originally desired a female vocalist, Howerdel agreed that Keenan would be a good fit, and A Perfect Circle was formed a short time later.[tpl]cite web|title= ASHES dIVIDE official website I |publisher= Island Records |url=http://www.islandrecords.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=680 |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] They were then joined by bassist and violinist Paz Lenchantin, former Failure guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, and the previous drummer for Primus, Tim Alexander. The band played their first show at LA's Viper Club Reception on August 15, 1999. After playing shows in L.A., the band entered the studio to begin work on their first album.[tpl]cite book|last= McIver |first= Joel |title= Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |publisher= Omnibus Press |year= 2002 |page=27 [/tpl] Alexander was soon replaced with session drummer and member of The Vandals and former member of Guns N' Roses, Josh Freese, but Alexander's performance can still be heard on the album version of the song "The Hollow".
The band's debut album, Mer de Noms (French for "Sea of Names"), was released on May 23, 2000. The album is distinctive in that it is the highest ever debut for a rock band, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week, and appearing at number four on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web|title= A Perfect Circle Storms Onto Chart with Highest Debuting First Album Ever From a Rock Band |publisher=NY Rock |date=June 2, 2000 |url= http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/06_2000/060200.asp |accessdate=2008-09-03 [/tpl]
Howerdel had been working on some of the music, including tracks "The Hollow" and "Breña", as far back as 1988.[tpl]cite book | last = Corp | first = Hal | title = Guitar World Presents Nu-Metal | publisher = Hal Leonard | location = Milwaukee, Wisconsin | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-634-03287-9 |pages=91–94[/tpl] Soon after recording for the album was finished,[tpl]cite news|last=Kielty |first=Tom |title=New on disc; A Perfect Circle Mer de Noms Virgin |date=June 22, 2000 |work=Boston Globe |page=Calendar; 8 [/tpl] the band began touring.

In the album review by Rolling Stone, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan "added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel's songs" and concluded that "A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that's the point."Blashill, Pat (June 8, 2000). Mer de Noms Album Review. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Allmusic's review expressed that "there's little question that the addicting combination of Keenan's aching voice and Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000's best splashes in whatever was left of 'modern rock'."Raggett, Ned.

===Thirteenth Step (2002–2003)===

During the recording, release and tour for Tool's album Lateralus, from 2000 to 2002 the band experienced a considerable amount of downtime. This made the band extremely dynamic in terms of its members. During the recording of Thirteenth Step, A Perfect Circle lost two of its members, Paz Lenchantin & Troy Van Leeuwen. Lenchantin left to join Billy Corgan's new band Zwan in April 2002,[tpl]cite web |last= Kaufman |first= Gil |title= Billy Corgan In Search Of Personal 'Jesus' On Zwan Debut |publisher= MTV.com |date= January 22, 2003 |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459600/20030121/zwan.jhtml |accessdate= 2008-08-26 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080725005539/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459600/20030121/zwan.jhtml| archivedate= 25 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] while Van Leeuwen left to handle touring duties as the new guitarist for Queens of the Stone Age.

The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. With the new album came a new sound. While Mer de Noms had a heavier, deeper sound, Thirteenth Step was more melodic and straightforward.[tpl]cite web |last=Allen |first=Ryan |title=A Perfect Circle Biography |publisher=Musician Guide |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004481/A-Perfect-Circle.html |accessdate=2008-08-28 [/tpl] After the release of the album, John Lappen from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "They were never a band who beat the listener over the head with metal brutality, but now they're even more song-oriented than before—a move that illustrates that the band has a knack for writing instrumental hooks that show off a melodic talent that was not as apparent on the first album."[tpl]cite web |last= Lappen |first= John |title= A Perfect Circle |work= The Hollywood Reporter |date= June 8, 2004 |url= http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4923457-1.html |accessdate=2008-08-28 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] This different sound can be heard in the three singles that came off the album: "Weak and Powerless", "The Outsider" and "Blue".

The album received mostly positive reviews. Allmusic's review stated the album "is the sound of a musical and lyrical maturity that normally doesn't occur until a band's third or fourth albums".Jurek, Thom.

Album Review: Thirteenth Step. Yahoo! Music. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Rolling Stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that it "sounds more like the dusky thrum of Disintegration-era Cure than it does any of the members' previous bands", and continued "Thirteenth Step doesn't bludgeon listeners into submission—it lulls them with droning guitars, dub-deep bass and simmering vocals."Cherry, Robert (October 2, 2003).

===eMOTIVe and aMOTION (2004)===

A third album, Emotive, was released on November 2, 2004 (election day in the United States), and contains covers of anti-war songs by artists such as John Lennon ("Imagine") and Joni Mitchell ("Fiddle and the Drum"). Emotive was recorded with current and former members of the band, but is mostly the work of Keenan and Howerdel. The single "Passive" was adapted from the defunct band Tapeworm, a project composed mainly of Keenan, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and Danny Lohner. "Passive" first appeared under the title "Vacant" at a show played by A Perfect Circle in Portland, Oregon on January 31, 2001, notably, without the blessing of Reznor to play the song.[tpl]cite web |last= Wiederhorn |first= Jon |title= Nine Inch Nails, Tool Frontmen Recording Together |publisher= MTV.com |date= August 6, 2002 |url= http://www.mtv.com |accessdate= 2008-08-26 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080831022702/http://www.mtv.com/| archivedate= 31 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The song remained unreleased by any artist until it appeared on Emotive as the song "Passive".[tpl]cite web |title= A Perfect Circle – Emotive |publisher= Sputnik Music |date= July 26, 2005 |url= http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=1021 |accessdate= 2008-08-26 [/tpl] The single "Passive" can also be heard in the 2005 movie Constantine when John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) enters Papa Midnite's office in his club in the second half of the movie. The song "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums" is used in the teaser trailer for The Fantastic Four as well as the trailer for The Taking of Pelham 123.

Emotive Review. The Guardian. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Ken Micallef of Yahoo! Music wrote "the band builds on the power of the previous Thirteenth Step, applying hypnotic arrangements, brooding melodies, and droning rhythms to a collection that sounds absurd on its surface, but is woven together by A Perfect Circle's heavy and dark-lidded instrumental approach."Micallef, Ken (November 4, 2004).

===Return and touring (2010–2012)===

There have been conflicting reports as to what degree the band will be releasing new material. Keenan's initial thoughts in 2008 referred to focusing on "one or two songs at a time", which would most likely be released digitally via the internet, rather than a full album release on compact disc. Keenan jokingly mentioned that CDs have become "plastic discs that no one cares about anymore." In June 2010, Keenan stated that he was working on a fourth LP for A Perfect Circle.Doyle, Patrick (June 10, 2010). "Tool Weigh Unleashing New Tracks on Summer Tour". Rolling Stone.

===Compilations and future releases (2013-present)===

In September 2013, it was announced that the band would release two separate compilations in November 2013. The first is a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, containing one new song, "By and Down", the second a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo.http://m.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-maynard-james-keenan-knows-where-to-score-a-good-wig-20130917 The box set contains their three concerts in 2011 where they played one album in its entirety each night, and a performance of the band at Red Rocks.
In regards to future material from the band, Keenan stated "Of course, there's always writing going on constantly. It's just stuff that's not quite sitting right yet, so you don't know about it".http://music.yahoo.com/news/q-maynard-james-keenan-knows-where-score-good-131529651-rolling-stone.html In November 2013, Howerdel stated that "there are fully developed songs without lyrics and melody...as far as the music end goes, I’ve got 75% of the foundation of next A Perfect Circle record ready to go."http://www.alternativenation.net/?p=37905 He did concede that this could change depending on Keenan's stance on music, and that Keenan prefers smaller releases, while Howerdel prefers the form of a full album.
