[[Christchurch East by-election, 2013]]

CATEGORIES: 2013 elections in New Zealand, By-elections in New Zealand

A by-election was held in the New Zealand electorate of Christchurch East on 30 November 2013.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Date-set-for-Christchurch-East-by-election/tabid/1607/articleID/315225/Default.aspx |title= Date set for Christchurch East by-election |publisher= 3 News NZ |first= Simon |last= Wong |date= 30 September 2013 |accessdate= 30 September 2013[/tpl] The seat was vacated following the resignation of Lianne Dalziel of the Labour Party from parliament, who contested and won the Christchurch mayoralty in October 2013.
The electorate is regarded as a safe Labour seat; the party has, apart from the 50-year gap when the electorate was abolished, held the electorate since the [tpl]NZ election link|1922[/tpl], although significant population changes since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake had made this allegiance to Labour less certain. Prior to the election, National's top party official in Canterbury had conceded that the by-election was "very, very hard for National to win". The by-election was won by Labour's Poto Williams, who prior to her selection as Labour's candidate was virtually unknown.

Doocey is a member of the well-known Carter family.
