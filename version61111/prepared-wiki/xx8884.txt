Naked News, billing itself as "the program with nothing to hide", is a subscription website featuring a real television newscast. The show is prepared in Toronto and runs daily, with 25-minute episodes 6 days per week. The female anchors read the news fully nude or strip as they present their news segments.  Naked News TV is its offshoot pay-per-view or subscription service.  Naked News also aired briefly as a late night television series on Citytv Toronto.
Alongside the English language version, there is also Naked News Japan. An Italian version existed but closed after a few years.https://web.archive.org/web/20100301150717/http://www.nakednews.it/  Naked News en Españolhttps://web.archive.org/web/20081216235741/http://www.nakednewsenespanol.com/ was briefly trialled. A male version in English was also launched but ceased production on 31 October 2007.

==History==

Naked News was conceived by Fernando Pereira and Kirby Stasyna and debuted in June 2000[tpl]cite web|title=whois lookup|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/nakednews.com|work=whois.domaintools.com|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=wayback machine|url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nakednews.com|work=web.archive.org[/tpl]  as a web-based news service featuring an all-female cast. It began with only one anchor, Victoria Sinclair (who is still with the program), and has currently grown to eight female anchors, plus guest anchors.  The website was popularized entirely by word of mouth, and quickly became a popular web destination. During the height of its popularity, the website was receiving over 6 million hits per month. Part of the large amounts of web traffic in the site's early days was because the entire newscast could be viewed for free and supported by advertising. By 2002, after the crash of Internet advertising,[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] only one news segment could be viewed freely, and by 2004, no free content remained on the website. Beginning in 2005, a nudity-free version of Naked News was available to non-subscribers.  Beginning in June 2008, two news segments could be viewed freely. However, this ended in December 2009. The British channel Sumo TV briefly showed episodes of Naked News, while the free-to-view Playboy One broadcast the show at 9:30pm Mondays-Fridays until its closure in 2008.
A male version of the show was created in 2001 to parallel the female version, but has ceased production as it did not enjoy the female version's popularity and fame. Although it was originally targeted towards female viewers (at one point said to be 30% of the website's audience), the male show later promoted itself as news from a gay perspective.

==Cast==

Most of the show's announcers have been recruited through classified ads in alternative newspapers in Toronto.  As such, most of the show's crew comes from the Toronto area.  The show features occasional on-the-street interviews by topless newscasters, which are made possible by Ontario's Topfree equality laws.   Since the show's inception in 2000, there has been much turnover among the newscasters, and many guest anchors.  The female announcers have been featured in almost every medium including television (CBS Sunday Morning, The Today Show, The View, Sally Jessy Raphaël, and numerous appearances on Entertainment Tonight and ET Insider) newspapers and magazines, (TV Guide, Playboy) and as guests on multiple radio shows including Howard Stern.
