TASIS England, also known as "The American School in England," is one of five American schools located in and around London. It was founded in 1976  in the village of Thorpe, Surrey, south west of London.
The school consists of an early years program called Frog Hollow, a Lower School (pre-kindergarten to 4th grade), a Middle School (5th-8th grade) and an Upper School (9th-12th grades). In total there are approximately 750 students and 100 full-time faculty. The Upper School has about 390 students, 165 of whom board.
The Lower and Middle schools teach the American Core Knowledge curriculum. The Upper School, starting in 2005-2006, offers the International Baccalaureate together with the traditional American AP system, which it has offered since its founding.
One of the many programs that TASIS offers is its INPRO, "in-program", travel week during October. During this week off, students travel, if they wish, to various countries throughout the world. Past destinations have included France, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Russia, Italy, Greece, Morocco and various Eastern European countries. The Greece trip has traditionally been the Senior class trip.

==Origin of name==

TASIS stands for The American School in Switzerland.  TASIS England was originally set up as a branch of that school based in Surrey, England.  Its current official relationship to the original TASIS (other than sharing private ownership) is that of a sister school. TASIS England was founded in 1976 by Mary Crist Fleming for the purpose of expanding the TASIS family. Although fairly young, it is the second oldest international school in the London area.

==Campus and surrounding areas==

The school was converted from a 17th-century manor. Hence, the Coach House buildings were the coach houses of the manor. Dr James Lander, a history teacher at the school, wrote an extensive history of the school and surrounding area in The Heart of Thorpe.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl]
The school is divided into North and South campuses, separated by Coldharbour Lane. The Lower and Middle Schools are completely located on the North side of campus. Several dorms, Thorpe House, the Admissions building, cafeteria and Student Center are located on the South side of campus.
With the help of a $745,000 grant from the US embassy, TASIS augmented its campus security with the addition of an extensive infra-red CCTV network and a new public address system. The campus is secured by security personnel who routinely patrol campus. In the event of campus invasion or any incident that should require swift evacuation from the campus, TASIS is served by a comprehensive emergency plan by which students and staff are transported via a protected route to a safe haven. It is important that on hearing about an evacuation, no TASIS parents attempt to return to campus or attempt to pick up their child. When it is safe for students to be released, parents will be contacted by phone.
The school is currently undergoing rebuilding under a ten-year Master Plan. Thus far, extensions have been built to provide more classroom space, and the gyms have been expanded. There is a new fitness center, concessions booth, four new changing rooms, two dance studios and a new PE department office. These new changes were financed on a one-off surcharge to tuition which families are expected to pay during their first year at TASIS.
The school is located near Staines, which has a cinema, shops, as well as a train station. The school runs shuttles on the weekend allowing boarding students easier access to the town. The school is not immediately accessible by public transport.
The school is located 30 minutes away from Heathrow Airport and 45 minutes away from London by train. The nearest train stations are in Virginia Water and Staines.

==Dress code==

Lower and middle school students are required to wear a uniform, though this varies depending on which school division the student is in. The middle school wears navy.
Starting  2007-2008, the Upper School introduced a new dress code to cut down on dress code violation. The dress code change was controversial among many parents and students, as could be expected of any tightening of dress code. Dress code for boys did not change greatly, but girls had much less freedom than had been previously allowed. During the 2007-2008 academic year, administration planned a new dress code for use in the 2008-2009 academic year and further as deemed appropriate. This new uniform rotates every semester. Mimicking professional attire, it tightens during the winter term from TASIS polos and TASIS sweaters to TASIS button-down shirts and a jacket and tie for boys and a TASIS button-down shirt and sweater for girls. The dress code loosens again for the spring term.

==Academics==

Overall, the school has lower than average levels of unexcused absences from students and equally low rates of punishable offenses committed on campus. The teacher student ratio is 1 : 7.
The Upper School is college preparatory and currently operates on a block schedule. The school is also a boarding school, with a boarding body of over 160 students.
