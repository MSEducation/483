In early August 1912, invitations were sent to candidates for the football team for training camp at Ferry Field in mid-September.  Instead of holding training camp at Whitmore Lake, Michigan, as had been the tradition for several years, the 1912 training camp was held on campus.[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Football Candidates to Work Out at Ferry Field|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 11, 1912|page=20|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749076292.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Aug+11%2C+1912&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=20&desc=MICHIGAN%27S+FOOTBALL+CANDIDATES+TO+WORK+OUT+AT+FERRY+FIELD[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Football Men Keep in Shape|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 8, 1912|page=21|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1748957592.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+8%2C+1912&author=Special+to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=21&desc=MICHIGAN+FOOTBALL+MEN+KEEP+IN+SHAPE[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Football Men Will report on Tuesday|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 16, 1912|page=9|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1748997012.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+16%2C+1912&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=9&desc=MICHIGAN+FOOTBALL+MEN+WILL+REPORT+ON+TUESDAY[/tpl]  On the eve of the opening of training camp, Michigan announced that former Michigan star, Henry Schulte, would join Fielding H.

On September 23, 1912, the Detroit Free Press reported from training camp that one of the Michigan players had broken the program's marathon eating record.  The player, who asked that his identity not be disclosed, reportedly required two waiters "to minister to his wants alone."  At the team's lunch on September 22nd, the player consumed a bowl of cream of tomato soup, a dish of celery, "half a dozen or so bunches of grapes," a dish of crackers, more than ten slices of bread and butter, two helpings of chicken, "three thick slices of roast beef with brown gravy," four side dishes of potatoes, two side orders of string beans, three dishes of ice cream, two dishes of rice pudding, two glasses of milk, and a pitcher of water.  The meal was consumed in "the fast time of 2:13."  After the contest, Michigan's trainer Stephen Farrell aid, "More could not have been asked," to which the person in charge of feeding the team replied, "More would not have been given."[tpl]cite news|title=U. of M.

On the day before the season opener, Coach Yost declined to give the press his final starting lineup.  He noted that George C. Paterson would start at center with George C. Thomson at fullback and Jimmy Craig at left halfback.  However, questions remained as to whether Yost would start Herbert Huebel or Michael Boyle at quarterback and Miller Pontius or Roy Torbet at left end.[tpl]cite news|title=Yost Front Is All But Concluded: Students Can Almost Figure on Lineup That Will Start in Opening Game With Case -- Flock of Subs May Get In; Huebel Is Choice for Signal Post; Cleveland School Will Have "Vets" Against Michigan's Comparatively Weak Forwards|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 5, 1912|page=12|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749004812.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+5%2C+1912&author=Special+to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=12&desc=YOST+FRONT+IS+ALL+BUT+CONCLUDED[/tpl]

===Case===

Michigan opened its 1912 season with a 34–0 victory over the team from Cleveland's Case Scientific School.  The game was the 16th meeting between the two programs.  Michigan had won 14 times and tied once.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Case Institute of Technology (OH)|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=582[/tpl]  
The game was played in hot weather in front of a crowd totaling somewhat over 6,000 persons at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor.  The Detroit Free Press wrote that the heat slowed both teams and "made anything except pop hard work."  Halfback Jimmy Craig and fullback George C. Thomson were the principal ground gainers for Michigan.  The Free Press praised Craig for his "wonderful 'crooked' running" and Thomson for his accurate forward passing, solid defense, and for "hitting the line like a wild engine."  Michigan scored three touchdowns in the first half, two by Thomson and one by Herbert Huebel.  Craig and Thomas Bushnell also scored touchdowns in the fourth quarter.  George C. Paterson kicked four extra points.[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Humbles Case, 34-0: Swamps Ohioans in Opener in Overheated Game. FORWARD PASSES SUCCESS.

The Aggies took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on an 85-yard interception return by left end Blake Miller.  The touchdown was the first ever scored by a Michigan Aggies team against Michigan.

===at Ohio State===

In the third week of the season, Michigan defeated [tpl]cfb link|year=1912|team=Ohio State Buckeyes|title=Ohio State[/tpl] by a 14–0 score at Columbus, Ohio. It was the 14th game in the Michigan - Ohio State football rivalry, and Michigan had an 11–0–2 record in the 13 prior meetings.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Ohio State |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=2380[/tpl]  On October 19, 1912, more than 500 Michigan supporters traveled on a special train to Columbus to attend the game.[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Students Out Strong 500 Leave For O.S.U.

Michigan's touchdowns were scored by Jimmy Craig and George C. Thomson.  George C. Paterson kicked both extra points.  The game was played in front of a crowd of 9,000 persons, the largest to watch a Michigan-Ohio State game up to that time.  With Ohio State having been admitted into the Western Conference for the 1913 season, the 1912 Michigan-Ohio State game marked the close of athletic relations between the schools.    Michigan and Ohio State did not resume their football rivalry until 1918, when Michigan returned to the conference.
After the Ohio State game, the Detroit Free Press wrote: "The material is undoubtedly on hand to make the team one of the greatest that has ever worn the Maize and Blue but the men are not playing together nor are they putting up the game that they seem to be capable.  Individually the squad contains many stars and players of good calibre but collectively the team is mediocre."[tpl]cite news|title=Michigan Has the Stars But Lacks Team Work: When Men Get to Playing in Cohesion and Arouse Their Ire Yost Will Have Eleven That Should Trim Them All -- Center Trio and Ends Appear to Good Advantage and Probably Will Stick|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 20, 1912|page=20|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1748908592.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+20%2C+1912&author=Special+to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=20&desc=MICHIGAN+HAS+THE+STARS+BUT+LACKS+TEAM+WORK[/tpl]

===at Syracuse===

In the fourth week of the season, Michigan lost to [tpl]cfb link|year=1912|team=Syracuse Orange|title=Syracuse[/tpl] by an 18–7 score at Standard Oil Stadium in Syracuse, New York. It was Michigan's fifth game against Syracuse, with Michigan having a 2–1–1 record in the four prior meetings.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Syracuse (NY)|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=3150[/tpl] 
The game was played in light rain and on a wet field.  The day before the game, E. A. Batchelor described the condition of the field in the Detroit Free Press: "Judging by the condition of the Standard Oil stadium tomorrow's football game between Michigan and Syracuse is more likely to be a test of seamanship than of speed, strength and strategy.  When it comes to collecting and retaining water, the local gridiron asks no odds of the Atlantic ocean. . . . Syracuse is rather tickled over the especially fine crop of mud now ripening in the stadium, but Yost doesn't like it a bit. . . . On a hard, dry gridiron Michigan undoubtedly would be a top-heavy favorite over the Orange. . . .  In the approaching amphibious test, however, everybody seems to look for a bad football game in which the worst team may win."[tpl]cite news|author=E. A.

Michigan took a 7–0 lead in the first quarter on a 70-yard scoring drive capped with a three-yard run by fullback George C. Thomson and an extra point by Herbert Huebel.  Michigan was held scoreless in the remaining three quarters, and Syracuse scored a touchdown in each of those quarters.  Michigan center Charles Barton was blamed for five bad long snaps to Thomson that "proved disastrous for the Ann Arborites."  Syracuse halfback Castle scored two touchdowns.  Syracuse's final touchdown followed a fumble by Huebel that was returned 45 yards by Castle.
Michigan's lineup against Syracuse was Torbet and Tessin (left end), Cole (left tackle), Quinn (left guard), Barton and Musser (center), Allmendinger (right guard), McHale (right tackle), Pontius and Carpell (right end), Huebel and Bushnell (quarterback), Craig (left halfback), Hughitt and Boyle (right halfback), and Thomson (fullback).

===at Penn===

On November 9, 1912, Michigan lost to the Penn Quakers, 27–21, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. The 1912 game was the eighth meeting between the schools.  Penn won the first four games, and Michigan went 2–0–1 from 1909 to 1911.[tpl]cite web|title=Michigan vs Pennsylvania |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan/opponents_records.php?teamid=2519[/tpl] 
The game was played in cold weather and heavy winds.  Michigan took a 21–0 lead in the game, but Penn staged a comeback culminating in a long touchdown run in the final minute of the game.  Herbert Huebel ran for Michigan's first touchdown, and George C. Paterson kicked the extra point.  Michigan scored again on the next drive, this time on a touchdown run by George C. Thomson.
