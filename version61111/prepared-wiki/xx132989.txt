[[Dorn method]]

CATEGORIES: Alternative medicine

The Dorn method is a form of manual, holistic alternative therapy used to correct claimed misalignments in the spinal column and other joints. In its theoretical approach, it is somewhat related to chiropractic and osteopathy, although it is different in its practical application. It was developed in the 1970s by the German lay-healer Dieter Dorn.
Early students of Dorn, like Helmuth Koch (who coined the name Dornmethode), Hildegard Steinhauser, Harald Fleig and others, started to teach the method in the 1990s, enabling its use to spread through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. According to its founder's wish, the Dorn method should become a kind of folk medicine, free from trademark or copyright so that anyone may access it.

==The method==

The Dorn method is based on the correction of uneven leg length, which, according to Dorn, can be diagnosed in almost every human. Because of that, the pelvis is said to become twisted, and this can supposedly result in an asymmetrical, crooked or displaced spinal column.
Corrections of joint or spinal cord misalignments are done in a 'dynamic', moving action. According to Dorn, our muscles always try to hold the positions of the joints and spine, and when they are out of order the muscles assume this 'wrong' position as the correct one and hold it there. Dorn proponents maintain that a static correction, such as that used in chiropractic therapy, is difficult because it needs to overcome the strength of the holding muscles, and because the patient is often tense since the treatment is done 'on' him and not 'with' him.
The Dorn method therefore uses motion to divert the muscles' tension, and in this relaxed state it is supposedly possible to realign the bones.
During a treatment, the practitioner palpates the patient's spine. If any 'unbalanced' areas are found, possible underlying misalignments are treated with gentle pressure using the thumb or hand against the spinous processes, while the patient enacts guided movements such as swinging the leg or arms to distract the muscles' inertia; this is similar to the principle of mechanics known as 'counter pressure'.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://ph.88db.com/ph/html/lifestyle/feature_health_dorn_method.htm|title=Healing Hands|publisher = 88DB.com.ph Lifestyle Magazine|author=Romina Tobias|date=2009-01-09|accessdate=2009-10-05[/tpl] In case of pain, the patient is advised to stop the procedure in order to avoid any damage to the body.

==Critics==

The Dorn Method is not accepted by mainstream medicine due to the lack of independent scientific research. The Dorn Method’s short learning period, usually done in weekend workshops, is often regarded as insufficient from the Medical Profession and many claims made by Dorn Method Practitioners are incompatible with anatomical and physiological science.
Research was done to study the effect of the Dorntherapy on Tinnitus Patients.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brill K, Weiler EW |title=Dorntherapy: its effect on electroencephalographic activity in tinnitus patients with craniocervical dysfunction |journal=Int Tinnitus J |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=138–42 |year=2003 |pmid=15106291 [/tpl]
