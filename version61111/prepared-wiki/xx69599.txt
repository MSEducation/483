The Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl is an NCAA college football bowl game that has been played since 1989. The game is one of several games that takes place prior to New Year's Day.
Since its inception, the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl has been played in the state of Arizona at three separate venues. For the first ten years, the game was played at Arizona Stadium, on the campus of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. In 2000, the bowl's organizers moved the game to Bank One Ballpark, a baseball-specific stadium, in downtown Phoenix. Finally, in 2006, the game moved to Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State University in Tempe to replace the Fiesta Bowl which had moved to University of Phoenix Stadium in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale.
The game was formerly known as the Copper Bowl from 1989 until 1996 when sponsorship and naming rights were assumed by Insight Enterprises and it became the Insight.com Bowl (1997 to 2001), and then the Insight Bowl. For 2012, Buffalo Wild Wings assumes sponsorship after Insight Enterprises elected not to renew the fifteen-year agreement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/ncaa/01/27/insight.bowl.ap/index.html |title=Insight Bowl loses its title sponsor after 15 years |date=26 January 2012 |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] It has featured teams from the WAC, the Big 12, the Big East and Pac-10. Starting in 2006, the Insight Bowl began featuring an annual matchup between teams from the Big Ten and the Big 12.  Starting in 2014, it will feature a Pac-12/Big-10 matchup.
The 2006 game saw the biggest comeback in NCAA Division I FBS postseason history, as Texas Tech came back from a 38–7 third-quarter deficit to defeat Minnesota 44–41 in overtime.
For the first three playings of the Copper Bowl, TBS carried the game. Beginning in 1992 and continuing until the 2005 playing, the game aired on ESPN. After a four-year hiatus, during which NFL Network carried the game, ESPN regained the rights beginning in 2010.
