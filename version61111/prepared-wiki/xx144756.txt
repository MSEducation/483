√â (Cuneiform: [tpl]cuneiform|íÇç[/tpl])The word is phonologically simply /e/; the acute accent is an assyriological convention specifying the corresponding cuneiform sign. is the Sumerian word or symbol for house or temple.
The Sumerian term  √â.GAL  ("palace", literally "big house") denoted a city's main building. 
√â.LUGAL ("king's house") was used synonymously. In the texts of Lagash, the √â.GAL is the center of the ensi's administration of the city, and the site of the city archives.Aage Westenholz, Old Sumerian and old Akkadian texts in Philadelphia, Volume 3 of Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, Volume 1 of Bibliotheca Mesopotamica,  Museum Tusculanum Press, 1987, ISBN 978-87-7289-008-1,p. 96
Sumerian √â.GAL "palace" is the probable etymology of Semitic words for "palace, temple", such as Hebrew ◊î◊ô◊õ◊ú heikhal,The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew-English Lexicon by Francis Brown et al. (ISBN 0-913573-20-5), p. 228 and Arabic ŸáŸäŸÉŸÑ haykal. It has thus been speculated that the word √â originated from something akin to *hai or *ÀÄai, especially since the cuneiform sign √à is used for /a/ in Eblaite.
The term temen appearing frequently after √â in names of ziggurats is translated as "foundation pegs", apparently the first step in the construction process of a house; compare, for example, verses 551‚Äì561 of the account of the construction of E-ninnu:
Temen has been occasionally compared to Greek temenos "holy precinct", but since the latter has a well established Indo-European etymology (see temple), the comparison is either mistaken, or at best describes a case of popular etymology or convergence.
In E-temen-an-ki, "the temple of the foundation pegs of heaven and earth", temen has been taken to refer to an axis mundi connecting earth to heaven (thus re-enforcing the Tower of Babel connection), but the term re-appears in several other temple names, referring to their physical stability rather than, or as well as, to a mythological world axis; compare the Egyptian notion of Djed.
