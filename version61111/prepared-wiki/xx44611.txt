Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is an American live action children's television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids weekday afternoon block. The show is about a group of teenagers who were chosen to protect the world from a group of alien invaders and were given the ability to "morph" into super-powered warriors and to pilot giant robots called "Zords." It was adapted and used stock footage from the Japanese television show Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger, which was the 16th installment of Bandai Visual and Toei Company's Super Sentai franchise.[tpl]cite news|title= Pop culture: For two decades, Toei Studios of Japan has churned out versions of those ubiquitous Power Rangers-- and as long there are kids, they'll keep right on going.|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1995-03-09|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-09/news/ls-40804_1_power-ranger|accessdate=2010-08-22 | first=Teresa | last=Watanabe[/tpl] Both the show and its related merchandise saw unbridled overnight success, becoming a staple of 1990s pop culture in mere months.[tpl]cite news|title= Mighty Raters|work=Time|date=1993-12-06|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979778,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Ninja Turtles, Eat Our Dust|work=Newsweek|date=|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/115680|accessdate=2010-03-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= With Power Rangers Scarce, A Frenzied Search by Parents|work= The New York Times|date=1994-12-05|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/us/with-power-rangers-scarce-a-frenzied-search-by-parents.html?scp=6&sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&st=cse&pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Glenn | last=Collins[/tpl] Under the original name, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," the series ran from 1993 to 1995 and spawned the feature film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.[tpl]cite news|title= FILM REVIEW; For Power Rangers, Bikinis Are Not The Issue|work= The New York Times|date=1995-06-30|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/30/movies/film-review-for-power-rangers-bikinis-are-not-the-issue.html?scp=2&sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Caryn | last=James[/tpl]
The second and third seasons of the show drew on footage and elements from the Super Sentai series Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger respectively, though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the lead cast. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger costume (worn by the White Ranger) were retained from Dairanger for the second season, while only the mecha from Kakuranger were featured in the third season. However the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the title characters of the mini-series, Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. The series was produced by MMPR Productions, distributed by Saban Entertainment, and aired on Fox Kids. The show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment.
In 1996, the series was rebranded as the Power Rangers franchise, renaming the series every year after, and using costumes, props, and footage from subsequent Super Sentai series, as well as changing the cast and story line. While an overarching story line would continue until Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, subsequent series after MMPR are not sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense.
In 2010, a re-version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with a new logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative special effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20091001006376&newsLang=en|title=Correcting and replacing photos Bandai America Powers up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line|accessdate=2009-10-01|date=2009-10-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bandai.com/blog/press-release/mighty-morphin|title=Press release: Bandai America Powers Up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line [tpl]![/tpl] Bandai America|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2009-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/mighty-morphin-power-rangers/tv-listings/203104|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: TV Listings|work=TV Guide|accessdate=20 December 2009[/tpl]

==Series overview==

===Season 1 (1993–94)===

The series takes place in the fictional town of Angel Grove, California.[tpl]cite news|title= TELEVISION; . . . And a Parents' Guide to the Politics of Angel Grove|work= The New York Times|date=1995-02-12|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/arts/television-and-a-parents-guide-to-the-politics-of-angel-grove.html?scp=8&sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Patricia S. | last=McCormick[/tpl] On an exploratory mission, two astronauts discover an extraterrestrial container (referred to as a dumpster as a result of its smell) and breach the unit, inadvertently releasing the evil alien sorceress Rita Repulsa from 10,000 years of confinement. Upon her release, she and her army of evil space aliens set their sights on conquering the nearest planet: Earth. The wise sage Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita Repulsa, becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant Alpha 5 to select five "teenagers with attitude" to defend the Earth from Rita's attacks. The five teens chosen are Jason Lee Scott, Kimberly Hart, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan, and Billy Cranston. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers, providing them with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, as well as colossal assault machines called Zords, which can combine into the Megazord.[tpl]cite news|title= From Power Bow to Hip-Hop-Kido |publisher= The Baltimore Sun|date=|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-29/features/1993363109_1_zord-power-rangers-popular-power|accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Superhero Teens Are Hip, Hot |publisher= Orlando Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-12-18/lifestyle/9312170714_1_rita-repulsa-zord-saban|accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl]Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season One; "Day of the Dumpster"
The series begins with five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies Bulk and Skull. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers: by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason's in a martial-arts contest held in Angel Grove. The new teen, Tommy Oliver, passes Rita's tests, becoming the Green Power Ranger. Entrusted with Rita's Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers, especially when Rita causes a solar eclipse that temporarily drains the Megazord's power. However, the Green Ranger is ultimately defeated, and the Sword of Darkness is destroyed by Jason. Now free from Rita's spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the other Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place. His Zord, the Dragonzord, is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season One; "Green With Evil, Parts I-V"
As time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy in order to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy's powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers' Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon's help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers' Power Coins. However, Tommy's regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who mentions that the Green Ranger's powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season One; "The Green Candle, Parts I-II"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season One; "Return of an Old Friend, Parts I-II"

===Season 2 (1994–95)===

Lord Zedd, Rita's superior, arrives at Rita's Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd's monsters, which are superior to the ones Finster made for Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords. However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his powers being too weak to support a new Zord.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "The Mutiny, Parts I-III"
After several defeats, Zedd's attack on the Rangers progressively becomes more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita's biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Coin. The Green Ranger's powers were rapidly deteriorating, but Zedd's efforts had enhanced the process. He eventually does so with a special Green Crystal, using it to take away the Green Ranger's powers permanently. The crystal also powers up Zedd's Dark Rangers, but when Tommy smashes it, the Dark Rangers powers are transferred back to the regular Rangers. Nevertheless, Zedd finally succeeds in destroying the Green Ranger's powers for good. Following the permanent loss of the Green Ranger's powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "Green No More, Parts I-II"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "White Light, Parts I-II"
During the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park, and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam, and Aisha discover the Rangers' identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon himself, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "The Ninja Encounter, Parts I-III"
Later on, Jason, Zack, and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at the World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. In order to transfer the powers of the Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on the Deserted Planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the Deserted Planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam, and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack, and Trini as the Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers, respectively.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "The Power Transfer, Parts I-II"
Some time before the power transfer, Rita had returned to Earth when Tommy made his debut as the White Ranger, and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special "makeover" to gain a younger and "prettier" face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and thus join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Two; "The Wedding, Parts I-III"

===Season 3 (1995)===

Rito Revolto, Rita's skeletal brother, comes to Earth and, with the help of a group of monsters, destroys the Rangers' Thunderzords and the Tigerzord. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of Ninjor, alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords and the Falconzord.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Three; "Ninja Quest, Parts I-IV"
An Australian girl named Kat Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends Kimberly, and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found that Rita had captured Kat and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a normal cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly's Ninja Coin, vastly weakening the Pink Ranger, whose life force, like that of the other Ninja Rangers, is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords ever: the Shogunzords. Eventually, Kat overcomes Rita's evil spell and returns Kimberly's Ninja Coin to her. A short time thereafter, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon's blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Kat to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Kat eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as a Ranger.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Three; "A Ranger Catastrophe, Parts I-II"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Three; "Changing of the Zords, Parts I-III"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Three; "A Different Shade of Pink, Parts I-III"
After several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita's father, Master Vile. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, which leads to the next incarnation of the Power Rangers franchise, entitled Power Rangers Zeo.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Season Three; "Rangers in Reverse"

==Production==

After all available stock footage from Zyuranger was used for the first 40 episodes of season one, Saban commissioned Toei to produce 25 new monster costumes and new battle footage using the existing Zyuranger suits. Saban was able to produce 20 additional episodes using 15 of the monster suits. This new footage has been referred to as "Zyu2" by Power Rangers fans. Saban then used the remaining suits and footage for the first 12 episodes of season two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grnrngr.com/zyu2/essay |title=Zyu2 |publisher=GrnRngr.com |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2013-11-11[/tpl]
Mid-way through the production of season two, Austin St. John, Thuy Trang, and Walter Emanuel Jones left the show over contract disputes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.awwman.com/ais/jason.html |title=Actors in Spandex - Austin St. John |publisher=Awwman.com |date=1975-09-17 |accessdate=2011-12-23[/tpl] To disguise this incident, a combination of body doubles, voice doubles, and stock footage were used to continue featuring Jason, Trini, and Zack. The subplot of those three Rangers leaving Angel Grove for the World Peace Conference was made to bridge the transition to their replacements Rocky, Aisha, and Adam (played by Steve Cardenas, Karan Ashley, and Johnny Yong Bosch, respectively).
The appearance of Lord Zedd sparked outrage among parents, who deemed him too dark and grim for a children's show.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] In response, Saban counterbalanced Zedd's character by bringing back Rita Repulsa. For this, Carla Perez was brought in to play Rita (with Barbara Goodson still providing her voice), with the makeover subplot explaining her change in appearance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Reception and controversy==

Despite the popularity of the series, it was also subject to much controversy from parents who felt the show was too violent for young children. The show had aired before television stations issued content warnings, the V-chip, and television ratings. In the USA, numerous complaints were sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1993, the Canadian broadcast rights to  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers were jointly purchased by the over-the-air Canwest Global System and the YTV cable channel, and the series played to a receptive audience on weekday mornings on Global Television in Ontario and weekday afternoons on YTV, the latter trailing the American broadcast by several months. However, due to complaints sent to the recently formed Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and a negative assessment from that body over the show's violent content,CBSC.ca, Canadian Broadcast Standards Council — Ontario Regional Council October 24, 1994 decision regarding CanWest Global's broadcasting of the show. YTV removed the series from their line-up.[tpl]cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | title = Morphin Prohibited in the Great North | work = Heroes on Screen | pages = 68–69 | publisher = Wizard #43 |date=March 1995[/tpl] Despite not actually being a member of the CBSC, YTV complied and pulled the series before the end of its first season; Global (which was a CBSC member) ultimately did the same. While a phone-in poll was conducted to see if viewers wanted MMPR back on YTV, no further installments of the Power Rangers franchise aired on the network until 2011's Power Rangers Samurai, although commercials for toys and videos were still advertised on it.[tpl]cite news|title= Television: So what's on in Tokyo?|work=Time|date=1996-02-19|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984155,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante[/tpl] Later Disney-era versions of the series were broadcast on Family.
In Malaysia, the phrase "Mighty Morphin" was censored and removed from the logo due to the word "morphin" being too similar to the drug Morphine.
In 1994, the murder of a young Norwegian girl by two of her young friends prompted Swedish-owned TV3 to pull MMPR from its broadcast schedule in all of its market countries. However, MMPR was not related to the event. Instead, the young children responsible were fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon.[tpl]cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/382495/NORWAY-PULLS-THE-PLUG-ON-POWER-RANGERS.html |title=Norway Pulls The Plug On `Power Rangers' |publisher=Deseret News |date=1994-10-20 |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl]
In 1994, the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) upheld several complaints from members of the public about the level of violence in the show. The main concern of those complainants was that the show portrayed violence as the primary means of resolving conflict, and that this was influencing children to behave more violently more frequently. Immediately following the BSA decision, the second season of the show was all but canceled by Television New Zealand. New Zealand is the only country in the world where this show has been prematurely withdrawn from public broadcast to date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/12863/bpinnz.pdf |title=Broadcasting Policy in New Zealand |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] DVD and video releases of the more-recent Power Rangers series that were filmed in New Zealand can be found at The Warehouse, although general sales through video stores and other retailers are scarce. Later series in the Power Rangers franchise, such as Power Rangers: Mystic Force and Power Rangers: Jungle Fury, were filmed in New Zealand, but the programs were still not shown in the country, until 2011, when Samurai premiered.
When brought up on VH1's I Love the '90s, the original cast members Amy Jo Johnson, and Walter Emanuel Jones as well as other celebrity commentators, made fun of how the original line-up had Jones' role as the Black Ranger and Thuy Trang's role as the Yellow Ranger because the actors and characters were of African and Asian descent, respectively.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
In a 2010 interview with fan blog "No Pink Spandex", David Yost revealed that he had left the show in the subsequent Power Rangers: Zeo production due to homophobic reactions to his sexuality, citing that he walked off set one day because "he was called 'faggot' one too many times." He also stated that the producers would often ask other cast members what they thought about his homosexuality, and this made him uncomfortable as well.[tpl]cite web| last=Advocate.com editors |title=Blue Power Ranger Comes Out |publisher=Advocate.com |date=2010-08-26 |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/08/26/Blue_Power_Ranger_Comes_Out/ |accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Interview with David Yost Part 3|work= No Pink Spandex|date=|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmlcuY8bOUk&feature=related|accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl] Shortly after this interview, producer Scott Page-Pagter stated that Yost left over a pay dispute and that the allegations of homophobia are false; he added that Yost did not get along with any of the crew.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/27/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-blue-ranger-david-yost-gay-producer-scott-page-pagter-money/|title=Morphin Producer -- Blue Ranger Was 'Pain in the Ass'|publisher=TMZ.com|accessdate=2010-08-28[/tpl] In the episode where Yost's character appeared for the last time, "Rangers of Two Worlds", footage from previous episodes was used as well as vocal work from a separate, uncredited actor, to conceal the fact that Yost was not present during filming. A tribute to the Blue Ranger and Billy was seen in the closing credits of this last Billy episode.
