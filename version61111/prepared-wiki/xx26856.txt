This article is about the demographic features of Chile, including population density, ethnicity, economic status and other aspects of the population.
Chile's 2002 census reported a population of 15,116,435 people. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, due to a declining birth rate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/estadisticas_vitales/pdf/anuarios/vitales2003.zip|title=Anuario Estadísticas Vitales 2003|publisher=Instituto National de Estadísticas[/tpl] By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/proyecciones/Informes/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20InforP_T.pdf|title=Chile: Proyecciones y Estimaciones de Población. Total País 1950-2050|publisher=Instituto National de Estadísticas[/tpl] About 85% of the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in Greater Santiago. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6 million people, Greater Concepción with 861,000
and Greater Valparaíso with 824,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.observatoriourbano.cl/indurb/pre_ciudades.asp?id_user=0&idComCiu=0|title=List of Chilean cities|publisher=Observatorio Urbano, Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo de Chile[/tpl]

==Population==

According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 17,114,000 in 2010, compared to only 6,082,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 22.1%, 68.6% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 9.3% was 65 years or older

==Ethnic structure==

Chile is a multiethnic society,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mer.cl/modulos/catalogo/print_noticia.asp?idnoticia=C49415020100912&fecha=2010-09-12 |title=La riqueza de los chilenos está en su gran diversidad genética |publisher=El Mercurio |date= 2010-09-12 |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. Studies on the ethnic structure of Chile vary significantly from one another.
A public health book from the University of Chile states that 30% of the population is of Caucasian origin; Mestizos with an average 60% Caucasian ancestry and 40% Native American ancestry are estimated to amount a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%.[tpl]cite web | title=5.2.6.

UNAM professor of Latin American studies, Francisco Lizcano, in his social research estimates that a predominant 52.7% of the Chilean population can be classified as culturally European, with an estimated 44% as Mestizo.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.cl/books?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&pg=PA93|title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI[/tpl] Other social studies put the total amount of Whites at over 60 percent.[tpl]cite web|author=Esteva-Fabregat |year=1988 |title=El mestizaje en lberoamérica |quote=a white majority that would exceed 60% of the Chilean population[/tpl] Some publications, such as the CIA World Factbook, state that the entire population consist of a combined 95.4% of "Whites and White-Amerindians", and 4.6% of Amerindians. These figures are based on a national census held in 2002, which classified the population as indigenous and non-indigenous, rather than as White or Mestizo.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Chile |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl]
Despite the genetic considerations, many Chileans, if asked, would self-identify as white. The 2011 Latinobarómetro survey asked respondents in Chile what race they considered themselves to belong to. Most answered "white" (59%), while 25% said "mestizo" and 8% self-classified as "indigenous".Informe Latinobarómetro 2011, Latinobarómetro. A 2002 national poll revealed that a majority of Chileans believed they possessed some (43.4%) or much (8.3%) "indigenous blood", while 40.3% responded that they had none.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cepchile.cl/enc_encuestas.html|title=Encuesta CEP, Julio 2002|date=July 2002|accessdate=2012-05-18|language=Spanish[/tpl]

===European immigration===

Chile was never an attractive place for migrants simply because it was far from Europe, and the difficulty of reaching such a remote place,[tpl]cite book |title= Historia Contemporánea de Chile |last1=Salazar Vergara |first1=Gabriel |last2=Pinto |first2=Julio |year= 1999 |publisher= LOM Ediciones |location= Santiago de Chile |isbn= 956-282-174-9 |trans_chapter= |chapter= La Presencia Inmigrante |chapterurl= |quote= |pages= 76–81 |accessdate= September 16, 2012 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Vyx8JQtvU78C&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=Chile+migracion+europea&source=bl&ots=Ue7voYbx53&sig=Uuw7q8OWubJY8i5e6coLUsqc_dE&hl=es&sa=X&ei=56pVULKDBY-68wSlz4GoCg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBzgKw [/tpl] a situation recognized in the census of 1907, census which recorded the highest percentage of Europeans versus the total population of Chile (2.2%).

The European migration did not result in a remarkable change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan.Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas de Chile: Censo de población de 1907, page-PDF 55/1277 and page-PDF 1249/1277 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
The Spaniard was actually the only relevant among European immigration to Chile,De los Vascos, Oñati y los Elorza DE LOS VASCOS, OÑATI Y LOS ELORZA Waldo Ayarza Elorza. Page 59, 65, 66 since there was never a massive immigration, as happened in neighboring nations such as Argentina or Uruguay. Therefore, neither have whitened the Chilean population to level of overall percentages. Facts about the amount of the flow of immigration do not coincide with certain national chauvinistic discourse, in which Chile, like Argentina or Uruguay, would have been constituted due to immigration in one of the "white" Latin American countries, in contrast to what prevails in the rest of the continent. However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a role in Chilean society. Between 1851 and 1924 Chile only received the 0.5% of the European immigration flow to Latin America, against 46% of Argentina, 33% of Brazil, 14% of Cuba, and 4% of Uruguay. This was because most of the migration occurred across the Atlantic, not the Pacific, and that this migration occurred mostly before the construction of the Panama Canal. Also, Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking that long tour across the Straits of Magellan or crossing the Andes. In 1907, European-born reached a top of 2.2% of Chilean population,Censo de Población 1907 it down to 1.9% in 1920,Censo de Población 1920 and 1.6% in 1930.Censo de Población 1930
The largest contingent of people to have arrived in post-independence Chile came from Spain and the Basque country, a region divided between northern Spain and southern France. Estimates of the number Chileans who have one or two surnames from Basque origin ranges from 10% (1,600,000) to as high as 20% (3,200,000).Diariovasco. Diariovasco.

Chile's various waves of non-Spanish immigrants include Italians, Irish, French, Greeks, Germans, English, Scots, Croats, and Poles.
In 1848 an important and substantial German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Los colonos[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Alemanes en Chile. Sponsored by the Chilean government for the colonization of the southern region, the Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians), strongly influenced the cultural and racial composition of the southern provinces of Chile. It is difficult to count the number of descendants of Germans in Chile, given the great amount of time. Because many areas of southern Chile were sparsely populated, the traces of German immigration that are quite noticeable.  An independent estimate calculates that about 500,000 Chileans could be descendants of German immigrants.
Other historically significant immigrant groups included Croats, whose descendants today are estimated at 380,000 persons, or 2.4% of the Chilean population[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Diaspora Croata.Splitski osnovnoškolci rođeni u Čileu.

Altogether, these immigrants with their descendants, they have transformed the country culturally, economically and politically.

===Indigenous communities===

The 1907 census reported 101,118 Indians, or 3.1% of the total country population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered, irrespective of their "racial purity."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl//temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0007943 |title=1907 census |publisher=Memoriachilena.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl]
According to the 2002 census, only indigenous people that still practiced a native culture or spoke a native language were surveyed, and 4.6% of the population (692,192 people) fit that description. Of that 4.6%, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf|title=Censo 2002 – Síntesis de Resultados|work=Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas[/tpl] Most of the indigenous population show varying degrees of mixed ancestry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medwave.cl/ciencia/11.act |title=El gradiente sociogenético chileno y sus implicaciones ético-sociales |publisher=Medwave.cl |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl]
Chile is one of the twenty-two countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 |title=ILOLEX: submits English query |publisher=Ilo.org |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl] It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark ruling in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upholds rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17739:chiles-supreme-court-upholds-indigenous-water-use-rights&catid=19:other&Itemid=142 |title=Chile's Supreme Court Upholds Indigenous Water Use Rights |publisher=The Santiago Times |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-03-02[/tpl]

===Other ethnic groups===

It is estimated that about 5% of the population (800,000) is descendant of Asian immigrants, chiefly from the Middle East (i.e. Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Middle East Armenians, see Arab Chileans).[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Arabes de Chile.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] En Chile viven unas 700.000 personas de origen árabe y de ellas 500.000 son descendientes de emigrantes palestinos que llegaron a comienzos del siglo pasado y que constituyen la comunidad de ese origen más grande fuera del mundo árabe. (This may include Israelis, both Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of the nation of Israel.) Chile is also home to a large population of immigrants, mostly Christian, from the Levant.Arab. Roughly 500,000 Palestinian descendants are believed to reside in Chile.Chile: Palestinian refugees arrive to warm welcome.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] 500,000 descendientes de primera y segunda generación de palestinos en Chile.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Santiago de Chile es un modelo de convivencia palestino-judía.Exiling Palestinians to Chile.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] Chile tiene la comunidad palestina más grande fuera del mundo árabe, unos 500.000 descendientes.En detrimento de Israel Acercamiento arabe a America Latina
In recent years, Chile has had a growing East Asian population, mainly from China (see Chinese Chilean), but also from Japan (see Japanese Chilean) and South Korea (see Koreans in Chile). The earliest wave of East Asian immigration took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly Chinese and Japanese contract laborers.
Chile administers Easter Island a territory 4,100 km west of the mainland.  The Rapa Nui people are native to the island and are Polynesian in origin.  About 3,500 live on the island,Instituto Nacional de Estadistica de Chile(INE). but around 10,000 came to the mainland in the 20th century.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

They are widely and easily recognized, and continue to hold on to their traditions and language, and many continue to live semi-nomadic lifestyles traveling from city to city and living in small tented communities.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Recent immigration===

Since the reestablishment of democracy in Chile, the former tendency for emigrants from the country to outnumber immigrants to it has reversed. Chile now is one of the two countries in Latin American with a positive migration rate.United Nations Population Division
Today, the principal immigrant groups correspond to the countries bordering Chile. Argentines constitute the largest group, followed by Peruvians. One of the main factors contributing to such immigration has been the growth of the Chilean economy during the past few decades. Immigration from other Latin American countries has also occurred.
According to the 2002 report of the International Organization for Migration, more than 10,000 people from the United States have emigrated to Chile. Most of these arrived in Chile initially to work for multinational corporations. Most possess professional degrees, and most are well situated economically.

==Languages==

The Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and "s" sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830-1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=1994-03-31[/tpl]
There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Quechua, Aymara and Rapa Nui. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CL|title=Languages of Chile[/tpl]
German is spoken to a great extent in southern Chile,[tpl]cite web|author=Oliver Zoellner |url=http://www.research-worldwide.de/article-chile2005.html |title=Oliver Zoellner | Generating Samples of Ethnic Minorities in Chile |publisher=Research-worldwide.de |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17[/tpl] either in small countryside pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.
Through initiatives such as the English Opens Doors program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090908/lack-english-proficiency |title=Repeat after me: Hello, my name is |publisher=Globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl] Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622005000200010&script=sci_arttext |title=Anglicism in Chilean Spanish |publisher=Scielo.cl |date=2004-05-04 |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl] Since 2010, all students from 3rd grade in secondary school have been tested on listening and reading comprehension for English language. The evaluation is compulsory and the instrument is TOIEC Bridge, developed by Educational Testing Service.

==Religion==

In the most recent census (2002), 70 percent of the population over age 14 identified as Roman Catholic and 15.1 percent as evangelical. In the census, the term "evangelical" referred to all non-Catholic Christian churches with the exception of the Orthodox Church (Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian, and Armenian), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Seventh-day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses. Approximately 90 percent of evangelicals are Pentecostal. Wesleyan, Lutheran, Reformed Evangelical, Presbyterian, Anglican, Episcopalian, Baptist and Methodist churches are also present.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108518.htm|title=Chile|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=United States Department of State|date=2008-09-19[/tpl] Non-religious people, atheists and agnostics, account for around 8% of the population.

According to the Chilean census held in 2012, the population of Chile was 16,634,603.http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2013/04/statistics-chile
The methodology used for the census was questioned by advisors to the National Statistics Institute (INE), however, which led to an investigation and the resignation of its director, Francisco Labbé, in April 2013. At the same time, the Chilean government ruled out doing the census over again.http://www.censo.cl/
