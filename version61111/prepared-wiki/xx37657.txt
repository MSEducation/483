"The Independent". Guitar World. March 2002.
He is a co-founder and owner of Dischord Records, a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label.
A key figure in the development of hardcore punk, straightedge, and an independent-minded, do it yourself punk ethic, MacKaye also works as a producer, and has produced releases by Q and Not U, John Frusciante, 7 Seconds, Nation of Ulysses, Bikini Kill, Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty, and Rollins Band among others. Along with his seminal band Minor Threat, he is credited with coining the term "straight edge" to describe a personal ideology that promotes independence by countering the popular appeal of drug and alcohol abuse, though MacKaye has stated many times that he did not intend to turn it into a movement.

==Biography==

===Youth===

Ian MacKaye was born in Washington D.C. on April 16, 1962, and grew up in the Glover Park neighborhood of Washington D.C. His father was a writer for the Washington Post, first as a White House reporter, then as a religion specialist; the senior MacKaye remains active with the socially progressive St. Stephen's Episcopal Church.Azerrad, Michael (2002). Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981–1991. Back Bay Books. ISBN 0-316-78753-1 According to MacKaye's longtime friend, singer Henry Rollins, MacKaye's parents "raised their kids in a tolerant, super-intellectual, open-minded atmosphere."Azerrad, 2002
MacKaye first learned to play piano as a child. He eventually took lessons, but quit when his mother placed him in a more academic environment to continue his instrument. He first attempted guitar at around ten due to inspirations such as Jimi Hendrix, but again he quit when he was unable to understand the correlation between piano and guitar.[tpl]cite web|last=Bogosian|first=Daniel|title=Ian MacKaye: 'It Took Me Some Time To Figure Out How Punk Was Music'|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/ian_mackaye_it_took_me_some_time_to_figure_out_how_punk_was_music.html|publisher=Ultimate Guitar|accessdate=11 October 2012[/tpl]
MacKaye listened to many types of music, but was especially fond of mainstream hard rock like Ted Nugent and Queen before discovering punk music in 1979Ian MacKaye speaking at Loyola University; Nov 14, 2006[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] when he saw The Cramps perform at nearby Georgetown University. He was particularly influenced by the California hardcore scene. MacKaye looked up to hardcore bands like Bad Brains and Black Flag and was childhood friends with Henry Garfield (who later changed his name to Henry Rollins).

===Early bands===

Ian MacKaye's first band consisted of one performance as The Slinkees in the summer of 1979, performing a song titled "I Drink Milk."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.slowcode.com/published/2006/05/the_ap_history_of_punk_part_x.html |title=The AP History of Punk Rock X: Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2007-06-10 |year=1996 |publisher=Alternative Press[/tpl] The band also recorded two demo tapes of covers as well as songs that would later be recorded by the Teen Idles.
In MacKaye's next project, The Teen Idles, he played bass guitar and sang back up vocals in from 1979–1980, and the short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union (1981–1982).
His brother Alec MacKaye has also been active in several notable bands, such as Untouchables, The Faith and Ignition.[tpl]cite book|last=Andersen|first=mark|title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital|year=2003|publisher=Asashic Books|isbn=1-888451-44-0|pages=44[/tpl]

===Minor Threat===

After feeling creatively limited in the Teen Idles, MacKaye was determined to be the frontman and primary lyricist for Minor Threat (1980–1983). MacKaye cited the dynamic performance of singer Joe Cocker in Woodstock as a major influence on his own animated stage persona. The Teen Idles and Minor Threat were modestly successful in and around Washington D.C., but would later be cited as two of the earliest and most influential hardcore punk groups, and as pioneers of the straight edge philosophy that rejects use of drugs (including alcohol). In his early teens, MacKaye saw the negative effects of drug abuse on several close friends and one immediate family member, and he vowed to never use tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.
After Minor Threat broke up, MacKaye was active with several relatively short-lived groups, including Embrace (1985–1986) and Egg Hunt (1986). Pailhead (1987–1988), a collaboration between MacKaye and the industrial metal band Ministry, then consisting of Al Jourgensen, Paul Barker, and William Rieflin, featured MacKaye on lead vocals.

===Fugazi===

In 1987, MacKaye founded Fugazi. It has been cited as one of the most important post-hardcore groups. Fugazi set itself apart from most other bands by never playing a show with high-priced tickets. They would often turn down venue options for this very rule, and the band would go so far as to stop a show and have unruly concert goers escorted out of the venue - complete with a refund of their ticket money. The band famously turned down at least one offer to headline Lollapalooza because festival organizers refused to price tickets cheaply; MacKaye disagreed with a $30 ticket price. MacKaye also has never conducted an interview with Rolling Stone magazine or any other similar publication, stating he'd only do so if the magazine agreed to not advertise cigarettes or alcohol. [tpl]cite web|last=S.|first=George|title=Long distance runner: The private and public evolution of Ian Mackaye|url=http://leoweekly.com/music/sight-unsound/long-distance-runner-the-private-and-public-evolution-ian-mackaye|publisher=Leo Weekly|accessdate=11 October 2012[/tpl] MacKaye estimates that for every concert Fugazi played, they turned down another 50 venue options. Fugazi were active until 2003 and have since been on an indefinite hiatus.

===The Evens===

MacKaye currently sings and plays baritone guitar in The Evens with drummer and vocalist Amy Farina of the Warmers. The band pride themselves on playing in non-standard locations, such as community centres, bookshops, or other atypical spaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crasierfrane.com/interviews/ian-mackaye |title=Ian MacKaye |publisher=Crasier Frane |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] The Evens released their self-titled album in early 2005, breaking a three-year silence by MacKaye. Their second album, "Get Evens", was released in November 2006. On 22nd of September they announced on Dischord Records' website: "The Evens are currently mixing a new record, due out at the end of this year (or early 2013 at the latest)."[tpl]cite web|title=Upcoming Reissues and New Releases|url=http://www.dischord.com/news/505/2012/8/upcoming-reissues-and-new-releases|publisher=Dischord Records|accessdate=22 September 2012[/tpl] The new album is called The Odds and was released November 20, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Evens - The Odds|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/180/odds|accessdate=5 November 2012[/tpl]

===Other projects===

In 1982, MacKaye sang lead vocals on one version of a Government Issue song titled "Asshole". The previously unreleased track was featured on the 20 Years of Dischord collection released in 2002. Backing vocals and collaborations—as, for example, with brother Alec MacKaye's former band Ignition—are numerous.
MacKaye contributed an extra guitar track to "Youth Against Fascism", the second single from Sonic Youth's 1992 album Dirty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/sy/song104.html |title=Sonic Youth Site Menu |publisher=Sonicyouth.com |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl]
In 1988, he recorded vocals with Ministry's Al Jourgensen, Paul Barker, and Bill Rieflin for the band Pailhead's EP titled "Trait." He also co-wrote the song "I Will Refuse" which was also released by the Wax Trax! record label.
In February 2004, MacKaye produced the recording sessions for John Frusciante's solo album titled DC EP. After working with MacKaye, Frusciante states "Ian is one of the only living people who I really respect and look up to, so it was an honor and a pleasure as well as a great learning experience to hear his perspective."[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
MacKaye has also contributed guitar and backing vocals to Joe Lally's solo albums There to Here, released in October 2006, and Nothing Is Underrated, released in November 2007.[tpl]cite web|title=Joe Lally|url=http://www.dischord.com/band/joelally|work=Dischord Records|publisher=Dischord Records|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl]
Throughout his music career MacKaye has engineered and produced releases by a number of bands primarily on his Dischord label including 7 Seconds, Antelope, Bikini Kill, Black Eyes, Lungfish, Nation of Ulysses, One Last Wish, Q and Not U, Rites of Spring, Rollins Band, and others.

===Dischord Records===

MacKaye co-founded Dischord Records with Jeff Nelson in 1980 and it continued as a DIY project, whereby those involved learned how to produce records—MacKaye claims that they crafted 10,000 singles by hand for a Teen Idles release.[tpl]cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Ian MacKaye Walks the Walk|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/07/entertainment/et-kot7/2|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=11 October 2012[/tpl] The label was originally formed as a means to distribute a Teen Idles 7-inch EP, but over time it transformed into a well-established independent record label that worked with different Washington, D.C.-area artists. MacKaye notes that the focus on Washington, D.C. musicians was inspired by folk labels such as Folkways Records and Arhoolie Records.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
As of 2013, over 150 titles have been released by Dischord. The label has garnered attention for its ability to achieve success despite a tendency to avoid tactics typically used by major labels to attract monetary gain.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Campaigning, business and activism==

Throughout his career, MacKaye has opted to advertise in independent and underground media and perform in unconventional venues. Such practices keep admission prices low (in the $5–$15 range) and allow fans of all ages to attend performances. Maintaining a low overhead and protecting monetary assets are also important ideals for MacKaye, who in the summer of 1990 formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd"Lunar Atrocities Limited." mblr.dc.gov. Retrieved on February 23, 2009.[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] in order to shield his own and his band mates personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As Seth Martin, MacKaye's financial adviser explained to the Washington Post in a 1993 interview: "protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be a little harder to go after their personal assets."[tpl]cite web|title=PUNK LIVES! Washington's Fugazi Claims It's Just a Band.

MacKaye has also been known to rebuke concert violence and to confront crowd surfers and other unruly concert attendees who start fights. This is especially true of his days with Fugazi. When audience members became belligerent or violent at a Fugazi show, the band would cease to play (sometimes right in the middle of a song) and MacKaye would tell them to stop. If those people continued their deviant behavior, he would have their admission price refunded and have them ejected from the concert venue.[tpl]cite web|last=Kellman |first=Andy |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist |id=p4319/biography |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Fugazi |publisher=AllMusic |date=2000-11-30 |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=‘Rear Window’ with Ian MacKaye – Vol. X|url=http://paradigmmagazine.com/site/2013/03/11/rear-window-with-ian-mackaye-vol-x/|work=Paradigm Magazine|publisher=the Paradigm Magazine|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=Ed Templeton|date=11 March 2013[/tpl]
In 2007 MacKaye provided technical audio assistance to Alan Canfora, a former Kent State University student who, in 1970, was injured by a gunshot while protesting the U.S. invasion of Cambodia. MacKaye cleaned up a field recording of the incident made by another student named Terry Strubbe. According to Canfora, a voice can be heard on the tape yelling, "Right here! Get set! Point! Fire!" before a 13-second volley of gunfire commences.[tpl]cite web|title=Ian MacKaye helping with Kent State shooting investigation|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/23611|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Punknews.org|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=aubin|coauthors=Anonymous Source|date=8 May 2007[/tpl]

==Straight edge philosophy==

The song "Straight Edge" was written by MacKaye for his band, Minor Threat and was released in 1981 on Minor Threat's self-titled EP. It was a song that described his personal life free of the "drugs" and the self-destructive idea of "sex as a conquest" which served as a part of the "sex, drugs and rock'n roll" banner originating as a rebellion in the 1960s—smoking, drinking, and drug use. The song came about through MacKaye witnessing his friends abusing alcohol/drugs and acting recklessly. He decided early on that it was not the lifestyle for him, having never fit in with it. MacKaye's main goal was to fight against the people around him that abused substances.[tpl]cite video |people=Adam Small, Peter Stuart |year=1984 |title=Another State of Mind |medium=Motion Picture |publisher=Time Bomb[/tpl] His decision to abstain from substances began to influence youth culture as Minor Threat gained popularity through numerous live shows and through sales of the song on their EP. Although to MacKaye the song did not represent a philosophy or a movement, over time people adopted the philosophy of the song and many bands began to label themselves straight edge, founding the straight edge movement. Although straight edge is not explicitly supportive of vegetarianism, MacKaye has stated that he is a vegetarian because he regards it as a logical progression of his straight edge views.[tpl]cite web|title=Famous Vegetarians - Ian MacKaye|url=http://www.ivu.org/people/music/mccaye.html|work=International Vegetarian Union|publisher=International Vegetarian Union|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=2 April 2010[/tpl] He follows a strict vegetarian or vegan diet.[tpl]cite web|title=Ian MacKaye on vegetarianism|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1K5lWESm20|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=XVedgeEdgeX|format=Video upload|date=15 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=interview with ian mackaye|url=http://rockproper.com/blog/interview-with-ian-mackaye.html|work=rock proper|publisher=rock proper|accessdate=27 April 2013|author=casey|date=25 November 2009[/tpl]
Although "Straight Edge" gets the most attention, MacKaye wrote other songs with Minor Threat describing his clean lifestyle as well, most notably "Out of Step (With the World)," in which he said "I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't fuck. At least I can fucking think." "In My Eyes" is also at least partially about his philosophies, with lines such as "You tell me it calms your nerves; you just think it looks cool."

==Relationship and involvement with Riot Grrrl==

Ian MacKaye has been a strong proponent of the Riot Grrrl movement, going as far as to produce Bikini Kill's self-titled EP. Because of the male dominated tendencies of punk concerts during the 1980s, he feels women were pushed away from the movement. He has discussed gender inequalities in some of his songs such as Fugazi's "Suggestion". Despite being a supporter of Riot Grrrl, he came under criticism by those within the movement who claimed MacKaye was simply capitalizing on gender inequality for ulterior motives and that it was not his position to be a part of Riot Grrrl. MacKaye dismissed these claims as unfounded and ignorant.[tpl]cite video |people=Kerri Koch |year=2005 |title=Don't Need You |medium=Motion Picture |publisher=Urban Cowgirl Productions[/tpl] Arguing the success of the movement, MacKaye mentions that he used to note the oddity of a woman playing in a band, but now it has become a normality.

Contrary to popular belief, he had never used any effects.

==Personal life==

On May 24, 2008, Ian MacKaye and Amy Farina had their first child together, a son named Carmine Francis Farina MacKaye.[tpl]cite web|title=This Is a Birthday Pony|url=http://dcist.com/2008/05/27/this_is_a_birth.php|work=DCist|publisher=Gothamist LLC|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=27 May 2008[/tpl]
His younger brother is Alec MacKaye, also a musician. His musical collaborations with Ian are limited but he is known for appearing in the iconic photograph used for many Minor Threat releases including Complete Discography.
He has been close friends with Henry Rollins since childhood[tpl]cite web|url=http://welcometoflavorcountry.com/2011/06/27/interview-with-ian-mackaye/ | title = Interview with Ian Mackaye | publisher=welcometoflavorcountry.com | date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2011-12-09[/tpl] and was the first person to take the stage at Rollins' 50th birthday performance at the National Geographic Explorers' Hall in Washington DC on February 13, 2011.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021406090.html | title=Punk and politics: Henry Rollins toasts to his 50th | publisher=The Washington Post | date=February 15, 2011 | accessdate=March 20, 2014 | author=Jenkins, Mark[/tpl]
Despite persistently voting Democratic, MacKaye does not explicitly consider himself a Democrat. He has explained that he votes solely for the politician least likely to engage in war. He also noted that he had voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election.[tpl]cite web|last=Calle|first=Jacob|title=Interview: Ian MacKaye|url=http://www.freepresshouston.com/music/interview-ian-mackaye/|publisher=Free Press Houston|accessdate=11 October 2012[/tpl] When further probed for a summation of his political views, he explained: [tpl]Quotation| My rule of thumb in terms of voting for presidential elections always boils down to one thing. Who ever becomes the president of this country is what the people of this country deserve, because it was either they voted for that person or they allowed that election to be rigged, or they didn’t put enough of a fight about it. However, the rest of the world does not deserve whoever our president is. It shouldn’t be their problem at all. It’s our problem. Our country has an enormous impression on the rest of the world. In my opinion at least, the most visceral effect on the rest of the world is war, essentially murder. This country has excelled in murdering people in other places, certainly in the last 10 years. So my rule of thumb in terms for voting is voting for the person who is electable and is least likely to engage in war. And that is it. It’s a very simple equation. So historically, I’ve always voted for Democrats.[/tpl]
