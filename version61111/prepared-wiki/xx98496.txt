[[Spitz Prize]]

CATEGORIES: American literary awards

The David and Elaine Spitz Prize is an award for a book in liberal and/or democratic theory.
It is awarded annually by a panel based in the Department of Political Science of Columbia University, for the best book in the field published two years earlier. To be eligible, the book must be primarily theoretical rather than historical, and not a textbook or edited work. The latest prizewinner, After Adam Smith: A Century of Transformation in Politics and Political Economy, written by Murray Milgate and Shannon Stimson and published by Princeton University Press, was announced at the APSA Meetings in 2011.
