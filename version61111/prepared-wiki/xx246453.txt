[[Ed, Edd n Eddy (season 6)]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 television seasons, Ed, Edd n Eddy seasons

The animated comedy television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, created by Danny Antonucci, revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. Its sixth season was ordered along with a fifth season and three holiday specials after Cartoon Network renewed the series, meaning that the fourth season would not be the final, as it was set to be. The four original seasons were set during perpetual summer vacation, the new seasons showed the Eds and children going to school, the fifth during fall, and the sixth during winter. 
Although with the season, the series was set to air a total of 78 half-hours, although only one, consisting of two episodes, aired on June 29, 2008; the season was postponed due to Antonucci's production team at a.k.a. Cartoon wanted to concentrate on the TV movie series finale Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, after the series broke records as the longest-running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date. Both aired episodes were created in 2007.
