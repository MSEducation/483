==Playing career==

Undrafted, Sjögren played youth hockey in Sweden within Rögle BK. He made his professional debut in the HockeyAllsvenskan with Rögle BK, helping gain promotion to the Elitserien. He transferred to fellow top division club, Färjestad BK, for the 2010–11 season.
On June 1, 2011, Sjögren as a free agent to a two-year contract, reportedly worth 1.8 million dollars, with the Washington Capitals.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jun/1/caps-tap-swedish-pipeline/  | title = Caps sign Swedish forward Mattias Sjogren  | publisher = Washington Times | date = 2011-06-01 | accessdate = 2011-06-01[/tpl] In the 2011–12 season, after attending the Capitals training camp, he was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears. In November of 2011, Sjögren elected to return to Sweden, allowable by his contract, after becoming displeased with the Capitals for not calling him up from the Hershey Bears for an extended period of time. General Manager George McPhee said, "When we signed him, we told him we had a job available and promised him we’d give him a look this year. His training camp wasn't good enough to keep him at the start of the year and he was developing OK, but I guess he got impatient and decided to go home. And if you’re going to quit on us you might as well go."
