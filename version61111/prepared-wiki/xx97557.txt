==Biography==

Laurana was born in Vrana near Zadar in Dalmatia. Later in life, the Italians in Urbino called him Schiavone. Little is known about his early years. His father Martin was a stonecutter in Zadar, who worked together with the famous sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico) on the Šibenik Cathedral (Cathedral of St. James).
Around 1465 he is known to have collaborated in Mantua with Leon Battista Alberti. From 1466 to 1472 he directed the works of the new palace commissioned by Federico III da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino.[ref]
 ; includes a translation of Federico III da Montefeltro's commission of Luciano Laurana.[/ref] The exact attribution of the works is still disputed, as it is known that also Francesco di Giorgio had a role in the construction: the innovative façade, however, is traditionally recognized as Laurana's. Laurana improved Italian Renaissance tradition by using a system of columns, pilasters, and arcades to produce elegant facades and spacious rooms. In the arcaded palace courtyard Laurana achieved a rhythmic lightness, amplitude, and sophistication far in advance of contemporary Florentine work.
Later he worked in Naples for the king Ferrante II of Naples. From 1472 he was in Pesaro, where he attended the construction of the Castle (Rocca) until his death, occurred in 1479. The famous anonymous picture La città ideale, housed in the Urbino National Gallery, has been attributed to him.
