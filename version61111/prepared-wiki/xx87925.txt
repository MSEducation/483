This is a list of hospitals in Finland. Majority of the healthcare in Finland is offered by public service providers. The private sector is very small. Primary health care is offered in municipal health centers, whose services include physical examinations, oral health, medical care, ambulance services, maternity and child health clinics, school and student health care and other basic services. Specialized medical care, including outpatient and institutional treatment is provided by hospital districts. Diseases requiring highly demanding treatment are handled by regional arrangements or centrally according to a specific decree.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stm.fi/en/social_and_health_services/health_services |title=Health services |work=Ministry of Social Affairs and Health |accessdate=2011-12-13[/tpl]
