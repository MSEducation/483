==History==

The present church is the second one on the site. The first church at Dun was consecrated in 1900, but burned down after a lightning strike on 10 July 1944. The present church was built a few years later to replace it.  Before Dun, the local church was located in Fosnavågen on the northeast coast of the island of Jøa (where Fosnes Chapel is now located).  A church has been at that site since around 1250.  After the church there burned down in 1896, there was much debate about where the main church for Fosnes would be located, and the present site at Dun was chosen.
