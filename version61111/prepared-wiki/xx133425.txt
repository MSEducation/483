[[March 2006 Consistory]]

CATEGORIES: Holy See, 2006 in religion

The March 2006 Consistory, held on 24 March, was the first consistory where Pope Benedict XVI created new cardinals.
The announcement was made on 22 February that fifteen new cardinals would be created that year. 12 of them are under 80 years old, which is the age limit for participating in a conclave. This means that Benedict XVI has decided to continue with the tradition of having 120 cardinals, which was previously the practice, but had been discontinued by John Paul II.
During the consistory, fifteen red cardinals' hats were taken in a ceremony in St. Peter's Square. After the liturgical prayers and Pope's address, the candidates kneeled before the Pope's biretta and took their cardinal titles. This was followed by prayers of thanksgiving, intercession, the Lord's Prayer, and other prayers.
Three of the cardinals belong to the Roman Curia, and nine others lead bishoprics. The fifteen new cardinals come from eleven different countries.
One of the cardinals who took part in the consistory, Father Albert Vanhoye, is not a bishop. Benedict XVI has followed tradition by naming a foremost theologian in the consistory. The Pope can choose whether or not to ordain the candidate as bishop. The two others are emeritus bishops.
