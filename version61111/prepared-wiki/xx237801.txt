==EMA 2010==

RTV SLO launched an open call for songs for the competition. All interested parties could submit entries until 14 December, with all songs sung in the Slovene language. An appointed jury selected 14 songs to progress to a semi-final (EMA Predizbor). A number of these songs were to progress to the final (EMA Izbor), where they would be joined by seven songs submitted by prominent local composers invited by the broadcaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14404|title=Slovenia calls for songs for Eurovision 2010|last=Floras|first=Stella|date=2009-10-18|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=6592|title=Deadline to submit songs scheduled|last=Costa|first=Nelson|date=2009-10-17|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] EMA 2010 will be held in the first fortnight of March 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14604|title=EMA to be held in the first half of March|date=2009-12-11|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=12 December 2009[/tpl]
EMA 2010 introduced a number of new features to the contest: for the first time the winner was decided solely by the televoting public; during the selection of the songs by a jury, special number and letter codes were used to identify the songs, rather than the names of the authors; and all songs were to be sung in the Slovene language, both in EMA and at the Eurovision Song Contest - this is due to certain legal restrictions made on RTV SLO to promote the Slovene language, despite controversy among professional and public audiences, and debates on the authors' artistic rights, and promotion of Slovene culture in foreign languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14410|title=Slovenian Eurovision Song in own language|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-10-21|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-10-21[/tpl]
