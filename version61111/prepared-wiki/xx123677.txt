==Incident==

The massacre took place on the night of May 13, 2006 in the villages of Allaipiddy, Puliyankoodal, and Vangalady. In all three incidents, Sri Lankan Navy entered a home and opened fire on the residents. The deadliest incident took place in Allaipiddy, where nine people, including two children, died. Three more were killed in Puliyankoodal and one in Vangalady. Several people were wounded. The killings took place two days after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched a suicide assault on a naval convoy in which 18 sailors died.
At least 150 people fled Allaipiddy after the massacre. Refugees who reached the de facto rebel capital Killinochchi, who spoke through an LTTE translator, alleged harassment by the Sri Lankan Navy and accused it of carrying out the massacre.[ref]

==Reactions==

The Sri Lankan government denounced the killings and blamed the LTTE, suggesting that the massacre "could very well be a part of the LTTE strategy to divert international opinion". The LTTE, meanwhile, blamed the government.
The International Crisis Group identified the Sri Lankan Navy and members of the Eelam Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party, an anti-LTTE Tamil political party and paramilitary organization, as the most likely culprits.[ref]
