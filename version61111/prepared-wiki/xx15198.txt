[[Alkaline earth metal]]

CATEGORIES: Alkaline earth metals, Periodic table, Groups in the periodic table

The alkaline earth metals are a group of chemical elements in the periodic table with very similar properties. They are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/PAGES/data/intro_groupii_data.html |title=Visual Elements: Group 2–The Alkaline Earth Metals |author=Royal Society of Chemistry |work=Visual Elements |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=13 January 2012[/tpl] and readily lose their two outermost electrons to form cations with charge 2+ and an oxidation state, or oxidation number of +2.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd[/tpl] In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkaline earth metals comprise the group 2 elements.[tpl]#tag:ref|In both the old IUPAC and the CAS systems for group numbering, this group is known as group IIA (pronounced as "group two A", as the "II" is a Roman numeral).[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E. |year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table|journal=Pure Appl.

The alkaline earth metals are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).[tpl]RedBook2005|pages=51[/tpl]. This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table as all alkaline earth metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/upload/periodic_table_composite_2010_nobleed.pdf |title=Periodic Table: Atomic Properties of the Elements |date=September 2010 |work=nist.gov |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book | editor = Lide, D.

All the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/properties/text/image-flash/abund-crust.html|title = Abundance in Earth's Crust|publisher = WebElements.com|accessdate =14 April 2007[/tpl] Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of element 120, which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, element 120 may not be an alkaline earth metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&M/TexasA&M.pdf|title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |author=Gäggeler, Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&M |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Chemical===

As with other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electronic configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior:
Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of radium is not well-established due to its radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.
The alkaline earth metals are all silver-colored and soft, and have relatively low densities, melting points, and boiling points. In chemical terms, all of the alkaline metals react with the halogens to form the alkaline earth metal halides, all of which being ionic crystalline compounds (except for beryllium chloride, which is covalent). All the alkaline earth metals except beryllium also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and, thus, should be handled with great care. The heavier alkaline earth metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones. The alkaline metals have the second-lowest first ionization energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their somewhat low effective nuclear charges and the ability to attain a full outer shell configuration by losing just two electrons. The second ionization energy of all of the alkaline metals is also somewhat low.
Beryllium is an exception: It does not react with water or steam, and its halides are covalent. If beryllium did form compounds with an ionization state of +2, it would polarize electron clouds that are near it very strongly and would cause extensive orbital overlap, since beryllium has a high charge density. All compounds that include beryllium have a covalent bond.[ref]
