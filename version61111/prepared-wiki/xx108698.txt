English-speaking Quebecers (also known as Anglo-Quebecers, English Quebecers, or Anglophone Quebecers, all with the optional spelling Quebeckers; in French Anglo-Québécois, Québécois Anglophone, or simply Anglo) refers to the English-speaking (anglophone) minority of the primarily French-speaking (francophone) province of Quebec, Canada.  The English-speaking community in Quebec constitutes an official linguistic minority population under Canadian law.[tpl]cite web| author= Department of justice Canada  |publisher= Department of Justice Canada  |title=  Constitutuion Acts 1867 to 1982 |accessdate=2006-11-16 |url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#education[/tpl]
English-speaking Quebeckers are not one but many ethnic groups, with large emigration with Canadian provinces, an early and strong English language education program in Quebec schools, and waves of international immigration.  This makes estimating the population difficult. According to the 2011 Canadian census, 599,225 (7.7% of population, including 4% Italian Canadian) in Quebec declare English as a mother tongue.
More ambiguous are the 834,950 (10.7%) that use mostly English as their home language, and 1,058,250 (13.5%) that comprise the Canadian Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official Canadian language spoken.

Statistics Canada uses census data to keep track of minority language communities in Canada. It has recorded mother tongue (the first language learned as a child and still spoken) since 1921, home language (language spoken at home) since 1971,  and first official language  learned (English or French) since 1991. In addition, conversational knowledge of English and French is documented.
A considerable number of census respondents in each category cite equal proficiency, knowledge, and use of different languages. In this case, census respondents are divided evenly among the language groups involved.
As allophone immigrants (mother tongue other than English or French) generally arrive with knowledge of either English or French and eventually integrate into these two linguistic groups,  first official language learned is used to determine the Official Language minority population. It is used by the federal government and Quebec anglophone community organizations to determine the demand for minority language services. Specifically, it classifies members of immigrant groups who learn English before French as English-speaking. Half of the people equally proficient since childhood in both English and French are placed into each linguistic community.
The English-speaking population has shown an accelerated decline in population between 1971 and 2001. During this interval, the number of mother tongue anglophones has decreased from 788,830 to 591,365 representing a drop in its share of the Quebec population from 13.1% to 8.3%. This is attributed primarily to an exodus of anglophones to other provinces and raised questions about the sustainability of the community.[tpl]cite book|author= Marc V.

Immigration from other countries and integration of allophones helped to partially alleviate the impact of this trend. In 2001, one in three immigrants to Quebec was English-speaking and settled in Montreal. This made the decrease in home-language anglophones less pronounced, particularly in the Montreal area.[tpl]cite web| author= Government of Canada Privy Council Office |title= Action Plan for Official Languages | date = 2003-03-12  |accessdate= 2007-04-27 |url= http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/default.asp?Language=E&Page=ActionPlan&doc=ActionPlan/chap4_e.htm#S4.2 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070224070544/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/default.asp?Language=E&Page=ActionPlan&doc=ActionPlan/chap4_e.htm#S4.2  |archivedate = 2007-02-24[/tpl] This situation is rapidly changing as the vast majority of immigrants now adopt French as their first language: three quarters of linguistic transfers of allophones arriving between 2001 and 2006 allophones arriving have been towards French instead of English.[tpl]cite web| author=   The Canadian Press |title= Quebec immigrants turning to French: census | publisher = CTV News | date = 2007-12-04  |accessdate= 2008-01-22 |url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071204/quebec_census_071204/20071204/[/tpl]
The 2006 census showed an increase of the Anglophone population in Quebec.2006 Census: The Evolving Linguistic Portrait, 2006 Census: Findings The rise of 16,000 people (from 591,000 in 2001 to 607,000 in 2006) represents a growth rate of +2.7%, which is higher than that for the Francophone population (+2.0%) for the same period. This increase is attributed to a much reduced net outmigration of Anglophones, with some 34,000 departures vs 26,000 arrivals (primarily from Ontario).
Emigration to other Canadian provinces was perceived as the biggest challenge facing the continued presence of English-language communities in Quebec, particularly outside Montreal, during the 1976 to 2001 period. English-speakers accounted for half the out-migrants from Quebec as they are extremely mobile compared to their francophone neighbours because they share a language and cultural identity with most other Canadians and North Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ocol-clo/going_forward-e/html/archives/sst_es/2004/jedwab/jedwab_2004_e.htm#II_a | title= Going Forward: The Evolution of Quebec’s English-Speaking Community|accessdate=2007-03-17 |last= Jedwab |first= Jack |authorlink= Jack Jedwab |coauthors= |date=November 2004 |publisher= Commissioner of Official Languages |quote= [/tpl] In a survey on the matter, English-speaking Quebecers cited limited economic prospects and politics (Quebec's language policies and the Quebec independence) as primary reasons for leaving.[tpl]cite web| first = Marie-Odile| last = Magnan | first2 = Madeleine | last2= Gauthier| work = Groupe sur la recherche sur le migration des jeunes | title = To stay or not to stay: Migrations of young Anglo-Quebecer  | publisher =  Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS): Urbanisation, Culture, et Société |date=October 2005 | url = http://www.ucs.inrs.ca/pdf/RapportMagnanVersionAglaise050222.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-17|format=PDF[/tpl] These political factors are also cited as having led to fewer Canadians from other provinces settling in Quebec.
Anglophones are also less likely to migrate within the province than Francophones and Allophones. This is due to a strong sense of belonging among those in the Montreal area, the relative lack of English-language services and institutions outside Montreal, and a weak sense of identification with Quebec.
Despite a lull in this outflux during an economic boom and break from separatist governments in 2003, this outmigration had returned to established levels by 2006 and is projected to continue at these rates over the next five years[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]. At the time, this forecast made researcher Jack Jedwab predict a continued long term decline of the community.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Quebec%20Turns%20Red%20on%20Migration.pdf |title= Quebec Turns Red Again When it Comes to Interprovincial Migration |accessdate=2007-03-17 |last= Jedwab |first= Jack |authorlink= Jack Jedwab |coauthors= |date=2007-01-15 |format= PDF |work= |publisher= Association for Canadian Studies |quote= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070809121802/http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Quebec+Turns+Red+on+Migration.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-08-09[/tpl]

==Locations==

===Montreal===

A large proportion of Quebec's English-speaking population resides in or near Montreal. Most reside on the Island of Montreal, particularly in the West Island and in the western half of Montreal's urban core, where there is a network of English language educational, social, cultural, economic, and medical institutions.
The earliest English-speaking Quebecers arrived in Montreal at the beginning of the British regime in the second half of the 18th century. American merchants, United Empire Loyalists and Anglo-Scot Protestants founded Quebec's public and private English-language institutions and would represent Quebec's elite merchant and financial classes up until the 1960s; the heritage of this era remains in neighbourhoods such as Westmount and the Golden Square Mile.
Irish Quebecers established their  schools, churches and hospitals in the mid-19th century in traditionally working-class neighbourhoods such as Point St. Charles and Griffintown. Separate English-language confessional (Protestant and Catholic) school systems emerged and would be guaranteed in the British North America Act in 1867 thanks to D'Arcy McGee, a prominent Irish Montrealer. In 2000, these school boards were merged into English boards.
An English-speaking Black Canadian community grew in the 1860s with the coming of the railway industry centered in Montreal, settling in Little Burgundy and Saint-Henri.
The early 1900s brought waves of settlers from all over Europe. Jews from Poland, Romania and Russia established a large Jewish community, and integrated into the English-speaking "Protestant" schools and businesses. Italian immigrants would adopt the Catholic institutions of either the Irish or French-Canadian community. These and many other immigrant communities would initially settle along Saint Lawrence Boulevard (nicknamed "The Main"), before moving on to more prosperous suburbs such as Côte Saint-Luc and  Saint-Léonard.
Immigrants of today come from all over the world and are largely more secular than members of the established English-speaking communities. Also, a larger proportion are French-speaking than before. However, immigrants from English-speaking countries such as Britain, the United States, and Jamaica  usually come with a knowledge of English; Asians account for the fastest growing segment of the population, with over 26,000 Asians coming to Quebec between 1996 and 2001 and having English as their first official language spoken in 2001; as a result, over a quarter  of anglophones now come from visible minority groups.[ref]
