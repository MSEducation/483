[[Viroqua ultima]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae, Animals described in 1881

Viroqua is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species, V. ultima, is only found in Australia. It is likely that the Peckham's derived the name from Viroqua, Wisconsin, as they named genera after unrelated locations on several other occasions.
