Državna himna Bosne i Hercegovine (Cyrillic: Државна химна Босне и Херцеговине, National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina) is the national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is one of the four national anthems (along with that of Spain, San Marino and Kosovo) in the world to have no official lyrics.[tpl]cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/spain-marcha-real/ | title=Spain - Marcha Real | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-23 [/tpl]  The anthem was adopted on 25 June 1999, by the promulgation of the Law on the National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ohr.int/decisions/statemattersdec/default.asp?content_id=354 |title=Decision imposing the Law on the National Anthem of BiH |author=Office of the High Representative |date=25 June 1999 |accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl] replacing the previous anthem, "Jedna si jedina", which excluded the country's Serb and Croat communities, though, was in use from 10 February 1998, as the flag and coat of arms.
