The flag of the state of Oregon is a two-sided flag in navy blue and gold with an optional gold fringe. On the front is the escutcheon from the state seal and on the reverse is a gold figure of a beaver, the state animal. Oregon is currently the only U.S. state to have a two-sided flag (the Flag of Massachusetts was changed in 1971 to be single-sided).http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Oregon/stateFLAG.html Statesymbolsusa.org
