Polar Trappers is a 1938 Donald Duck and Goofy cartoon in the South Pole trapping polar animals. This is the first cartoon that Donald Duck and Goofy appear without Mickey Mouse.

==Plot==

Goofy is setting up an animal trap while Donald is in an igloo preparing a meal. Donald explains how sick he is of eating beans all the time, and, while noticing a penguin outside, he hatches a plan while thinking of the penguin as roast chicken. The rest of the cartoon deals with him trying to lure a large group into his pot while Goofy is stuck trying desperately to catch a walrus.
The name of Donald's and Goofy's trapping business is "Donald & Goofy Trapping Co". Their slogan is "We Bring 'Em Back Alive". This is Donald's first time encountering penguins, but it is not his last. The music played while Donald leads the penguins is the instrumental piece "March of the Toys", from the operetta "Babes in Toyland", also known as Parade Of The Tin Soldiers.
When a baby penguin's tear turned into a snowball, after being kicked out of the march by Donald, the other penguins notice the snowball coming and quickly dived into the snow for safety, but Donald runs for his life. When he gets into collision with Goofy, they both run for their lives until they get caught in the snowball, and fall on their workplace, completely destroying it. Donald and Goofy are then seen in the cages they brought for the animals they plan to catch, and a can of beans falls into Donald's mouth, making him grumble in anger when the show ends.
