====Powder River Basin====

Not all coalbed methane produced water is saline or otherwise undesirable. Water from coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, US, commonly meets federal drinking water standards, and is widely used in the area to water livestock.US EPA, of Impacts to Underground Sources of Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane Reservoirs, The Powder River Basin, June 2004, EPA 816-R-04-003 Attachment 5. Its use for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio.

===Groundwater===

Depending on aquifer connectivity, water withdrawal may depress aquifers over a large area and affect groundwater flows.Montana State University; Frequently Asked Questions; Coal Bed Methane (CBM) In Australia, the CBM industry estimates extraction of [tpl]convert|126000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|280000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off[/tpl] of groundwater per year; while the National Water Commission estimates extraction above [tpl]convert|300000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off[/tpl] a year.

===Australia===

Commercial recovery of coal seam gas (CSG) began in Australia in 1996. As of 2013, coal seam gas, from Queensland and New South Wales, made up about ten percent of Australia's gas production. Demonstrated reserves were estimated to be 33 trillion cubic feet as of January 2012.Geoscience Australia, Coal seam gas fact sheet, accessed 10 Oct. 2013.
Complaints have been made that the NSW State Government failed to adequately investigate the Pilliga forest drilling water spills of 2010 and 2011. The case was closed and only reopened after local landholders paid for samples to be taken.[ref]
</ref> A NSW Legislative Council<ref name=NSW-Parl-Inq /> inquiry found that [tpl]quote|It has been revealed that a previously-dismissed concern, namely the pollution of the Pilliga Forest by Eastern Star Gas, was ultimately proven correct. The Committee considers it inexcusable that this pollution went undetected by NSW Government authorities. Given this example of the NSW Governmentâ€™s failure to adequately police the industry, the Committee is sceptical that all coal seam gas companies are meeting their licence conditions, particularly given the large geographic area in which exploration activity is occurring.|NSW Legislative Council, General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5[/tpl]

===Canada===

In Canada, British Columbia is estimated to have approximately [tpl]convert|90|e12cuft|abbr=off[/tpl] of coalbed gas. Alberta, in 2013 the only province with commercial coalbed methane wells, is estimated to have approximately [tpl]convert|170|e12cuft|abbr=off[/tpl] of economically recoverable coalbed methane.John Squarek and Mike Dawson, Coalbed methane expands in Canada, Oil & Gas Journal, 24 July 2006, p.37-40.
Coalbed methane is considered a non-renewable resource, although the Alberta Research Council, Alberta Geological Survey and others have argued coalbed methane is a renewable resource because the bacterial action that formed the methane is ongoing.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] This is subject to debate since it has also been shown that the dewatering that accompanies CBM production destroys the conditions needed for the bacteria to produce methane[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2004/11/renewable_natur.html |title=Renewable Natural Gas? The Discovery of Active Methane Biogenesis in Coalbeds |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=16 November 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-21[/tpl] and the rate of formation of additional methane is undetermined.  This debate is currently causing a right of ownership issue in the Canadian province of Alberta, as only non-renewable resources can legally be owned by the province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mytelus.com/ncp_news/article.en.do?pn=tech&articleID=2970245 |title=TELUS, news, headlines, stories, breaking, canada, canadian, national |publisher=Mytelus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21[/tpl]

===United Kingdom===

Although gas in place in Britain's coal fields has been estimated to be 2,900 billion cubic meters, it may be that as little as one percent might be economically recoverable. Britain's CBM potential is largely untested. Some methane is extracted by coal mine venting operations, and burned to generate electricity. Assessment by private industry of coalbed methane wells independent of mining began in 2008, when 55 onshore exploration licences were issued, covering 7,000 square kilometers of potential coalbed methane areas. IGas Energy became the first in the UK to commercially extract coalbed methane separate from mine venting; as of 2012, the Igas coalbed methane wells at Doe Green, extracting gas for electrical generation, were the only commercial CBM wells in the UK.DECC, The Unconventional Hydrocarbon  Resources of Britain's Onshore Basins - Coalbed Methane, 2012.

===United States===

United States coalbed methane production in 2011 was 1,76 trillion cubic feet (TCF), 7.3 percent of all US dry gas production that year.  The 2011 production was down from the peak of 1.97 TCF in 2008.US Energy Information Administration, Coalbed methane production, accessed 9 Oct. 2013. Most CBM production came from the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.
