Berry Island is a locality adjacent to Wollstonecraft on the lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.  It was originally one of Sydney's Harbour Islands,  but it is now connected to the mainland by a constructed isthmus.
The area is now a council reserve, open to the public and there is an interpretive bushland walk, playground and picnic area at the site.

==History==

Berry Island was part of a grant of land made by Governor Macquarie to Alexander Berry and Edward Wollstonecraft in 1820  and is named after Alexander Berry.
The island was first linked to the mainland by stone causeway over the mudflats.  During the 1960s the land between the island and the mainland was reclaimed and made into a grassed area.

==Aboriginal relics==

Berry Island contains aboriginal carvings, middens, a smoke stained cave and a stone tool grinding site.
It has a 20 minute (750 metre) loop walk with interpretive signage describing the aboriginal significance of points around the island.
