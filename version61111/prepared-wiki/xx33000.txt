CATEGORIES: Obfuscation, Human behavior, English phrases, Ambiguity

Obfuscation (or beclouding) is the hiding of intended meaning in communication, making communication confusing, willfully ambiguous, and harder to interpret.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]. The word comes from Latin obfuscatio, from obfuscāre (“to darken”), from ob (“over”) + fuscāre (“to make dark”), from fuscus (“dark”).

==Background==

Obfuscation may be used for many purposes. Doctors have been accused of using jargon to conceal unpleasant facts from a patient; American author Michael Crichton claimed that medical writing is a "highly skilled, calculated attempt to confuse the reader".Appendix 25 - Medspeak B. F. Skinner, noted psychologist, commented on medical notation as a form of multiple audience control, which allows the doctor to communicate to the pharmacist things which might be opposed by the patient if they could understand it.Skinner, B.F. (1957) Verbal Behavior p.232 Similarly text-based language, like some forms of leet, are obfuscated to make them incomprehensible to outsiders.

==Eschew obfuscation==

"Eschew obfuscation", also stated as "eschew obfuscation, espouse elucidation", is a humorous fumblerule used by English teachers and professors when lecturing about proper writing techniques. Literally, the phrase means "avoid being unclear" or "avoid being unclear, support being clear", but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion, making the statement an example of irony, and more precisely a heterological phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a NASA document.United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA Technical Memorandum (1959), p. 171.
An earlier similar phrase appears in Mark Twain's Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses,Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses (1895) where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as "eschew surplusage".
The philosopher Paul Grice used the phrase in the "Maxim of Manner", one of the Gricean maxims.
