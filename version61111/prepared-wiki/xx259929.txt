The ballpark was named for Tinker Street, its adjacent street to the south, which was later renamed Seventh Street and then 16th Street. Other names for the ballpark were Athletic Park and Seventh Street Park. Other bordering streets were Mississippi Street (now Senate Avenue) to the west and Capitol Street to the east.
The ballpark was used for weekday games. Due to blue laws, Sunday games were staged outside the city limits, in Bruce Grounds (1887), and Indianapolis Park (1888-1889).
The ballpark site is now occupied by the Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis.
