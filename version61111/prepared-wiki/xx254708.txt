At the 1936 United States Women's Olympic Trials she tied for third place, which led to a jump-off against Ida Myers that left Kelly with a bronze medal from the event and a spot on the national Olympic team.[tpl]Cite book|last = Kirkpatrick|first = Mac C.|coauthors = Thomas K.

Davis, however, called upon South Carolina state senator Harry I. Hughes to convince the legislature, successfully, to pay for her journey. Prior to leaving for the Germany she dined with the 1932 champion Jean Shiley and, during the Olympics, she roomed with gold medalists Helen Stephens and Betty Robinson. She planned to train for the 1940 Summer Olympics,[tpl]Cite news|last = Bernadette|first = Hoyle|title = S.C.

She then took up women's basketball, which she played until the birth of her first daughter in 1942, and eventually settled with a career as a beautician.
