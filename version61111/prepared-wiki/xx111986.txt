gtkmm (formerly known as gtk-- or gtk minus minusThe gtkmm FAQ) is the official C++ interface for the popular GUI library GTK+. gtkmm is free software distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
gtkmm allows the creation of user interfaces either in code or with the Glade Interface Designer, using the Gtk::Builder class. Other features include typesafe callbacks, a comprehensive set of GUI widgets, and the extensibility of widgets via inheritance.

==Features==

Due to the fact that gtkmm is the official C++ interface of the GUI library GTK+, C++ programmers can use the common OOP techniques such as inheritance, and C++-specific facilities such as STL (In fact, many of the gtkmm interfaces, especially those for widget containers, are designed to be similar to the Standard Template Library (STL)).
Main features of gtkmm are listed as follows:
