==History==

Various models of resolving the relationship between the God the Father and the God the Son were proposed in the 2nd century, but later rejected in favor of the doctrine of the Trinity as expounded at the First Council of Constantinople. It was decided that God was one being who consisted of three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Monarchianism was generally credited to Paul of Samosata, a bishop of Antioch.
Two contradictory models of monarchianism have been propounded:
Both schools of Monarchians found a strong wall of opposition to them elevated very quickly in the form of the Logos theologians (Tertullian, Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen of Alexandria).The SCM Press A-Z of Patristic Theology, entry Monarchianism, p. 227
The name Monarchian properly does not stricly apply to the Adoptionists, or Dynamists, as they (i.e., the latter) "did not start from the monarchy of God, and their doctrine is strictly Christological".Catholic Encyclopedia - Monarchians
