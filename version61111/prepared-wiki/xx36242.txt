Until January 1, 2007 Løkken-Vrå was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in North Jutland County on the northwest coast of the island of Vendsyssel-Thy at the top of the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark.  The municipality covered an area of 181 km², and had a total population of 8,828 (2005).  Its last mayor was Knud Rødbro. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Vrå.
Løkken-Vrå municipality ceased to exist due to Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007).  It was merged with existing Hjørring, Hirtshals, and Sindal municipalities to form an enlarged Hjørring municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 929 km² and a total population of ca. 67,816.  The new municipality belongs to Region Nordjylland ("North Jutland Region").
