The Burnelli UB-14 was a 1930s American prototype lifting-fuselage airliner designed and built by Vincent Burnelli.

==Design and development==

Following on from his earlier designs Vincent Burnelli designed a commercial transport version using the lifting-fuselage concept. Burnelli's designs were based on the idea that an aerofoil-section fuselage would contribute to the lift generated. The Burnelli UB-14 first flew in 1934, the aerofoil-section fuselage was the centre-section of the wing. The aircraft had twin tailbooms and a widespan tailplane and elevator fitted with twin fins and rudders.  The UB-14 had a retractable landing gear and was powered by two Pratt & Whitney radial engines.  An enclosed cockpit for the crew of two was located on the centre wing's upper surface. The cabin held 14 to 18 passengers.

==Operational history==

The first prototype, UB-14, was destroyed in a 1935 accident attributed to faulty maintenance on the aileron control system.Website for Burnelli successor company 
Burnelli then designed and built an improved version, the UB-14B. A modified version of the UB-14B design was built under licence in the United Kingdom by Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft powered by two Bristol Perseus XIVC radials as the Cunliffe-Owen OA-1. "Fast Air Liner To Compete In Atlantic Race" Popular Mechanics, May 1937 photo shows the mockup of original UB-14B to be built by Scottish Aviation before bankruptcy. This design was going to have streamline inline engines.  The OA-1 used radial engines.
The Cunliffe-Owen failed its airworthiness certification due to excessive take off run and poor workmanship. It was performance tested at the A&AEE Boscombe Down in 1939.Mason, The Secret Years Hidoki 1998 p242
