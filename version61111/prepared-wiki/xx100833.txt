The Division of Grey is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Sir George Grey, who was Governor of South Australia from 1841â€“45 (and later Prime Minister of New Zealand). 
The division covers the rural mid-north and north of South Australia, with a size of [tpl]convert|904881|km2|sqmi[/tpl] spanning 92% of the state. The borders of the electorate include the Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales borders, in addition to much of the southern coastal border. The electorate spans to Marion Bay and Eudunda in the south. The main population centres of the electorate include Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Roxby Downs, Coober Pedy, Port Pirie, Kadina, Maitland, Orroroo, Peterborough, Burra and Eudunda.
Grey was held by the Australian Labor Party for much of its history. From 1943 to 1993, Labor held it for all but one term. Since 1993, redistributions (such as the latest inclusion of Yorke Peninsula and the upper east) and the decline of the Labor vote in the mining and pastoral areas (due to the closure of many mining operations) have made it today a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party.
