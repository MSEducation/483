Come on Do the Jerk (Tamla 54109) was a 1964 song recorded by R&B group the Miracles on Motown Records' Tamla label subsidiary. A single-only release, it did not appear on any original Miracles studio album, and was the group's last single release of 1964.http://s3.excoboard.com/exco/archive.php?ac=t&forumid=29211&date=07-08-2011&t=718833-5
Co-written by Miracles members Marv Tarplin, Bobby Rogers, Smokey Robinson, and Ron White, "Come On Do The Jerk" charted at #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at # 22 on the Cash Box R&B chart.(Billboard had temporarily suspended its R&B chart at this time). An instructional dance number, this song was one of several songs based on the jerk, a very popular 1960s "dance craze".http://motownjunkies.co.uk/2012/08/03/511/
Described by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson as the intended follow-up song to the group's 1963 million-selling smash "Mickey's Monkey" the previous year, "Come On Do the Jerk" was actually recorded in a similar tempo. As the song begins, longtime Miracles drummer Donald "Spike" Whited and Miracles member, guitarist Marv Tarplin begin the song, while Smokey, as the song's narrator, offers the invitation:
The other Miracles, Ronnie White, Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, and Bobby Rogers, echo Smokey's lead,  with chants of the song's title, in classic call and response style. 
Then, midway through the song, Smokey's role changes... from narrator to dance instructor, as he instructs the listener on the Jerk's simple dance steps:
The Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield, performed a cover of this song on a 1964 telecast of the ABC TV series, Shindig!.(available on YouTube).[tpl]YouTube|oU6SG5Th6Zo[/tpl][tpl]YouTube|oU6SG5Th6Zo[/tpl]
