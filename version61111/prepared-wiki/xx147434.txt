Vincent Briant (born January 9, 1986 in Quimperlé, France) is a French professional football player. He is a product of the FC Nantes training center in a show on Gol TV called Soccer Academy. He was one of two players to sign a professional contract with FC Nantes after the show followed the everyday lives of the players in the academy. The four favorites to gain the contract were Vincent, Dimitri Payet (a striker also from France), Fréjus Tchetgna (a defender from Cameroon) and Francisco Donzelot (a midfielder from Columbia). With the departure of Mickaël Landreau from FC Nantes it was decided that the club would sign Briant as their third string at only 19.
