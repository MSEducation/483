[[Multiplication sign]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical symbols, Multiplication

The multiplication sign or times sign is the symbol ×. The symbol is similar to the lowercase letter x but is a more symmetric saltire, and has different uses. It is also known as St. Andrew's Cross[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.2000.tb17262.x |last=Stallings |first=L. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month= |title=A Brief History of Algebraic Notation |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=230–235 |issn=00366803 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] and dimension sign.

==Uses==

In mathematics, the symbol × (read as times or multiplied by) is primarily used to denote the
In biology, the multiplication sign is used in a botanical hybrid name, where it is read as "cross".
The multiplication sign is also used by historians for an event between two dates. When employed between two dates, for example 1225 and 1232, 1225×1232 means "no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232". It can also be used in a date range: 1225×1232–1278.[tpl]citation |title=New Hart's rules: the handbook of style for writers and editors |year=2005 |publisher=University of Oxford Press |isbn=978-0-19-861041-0 |page=183[/tpl]

==History==

The × symbol for multiplication was introduced by William Oughtred in 1631.[tpl]cite book | title = A History of Mathematics | author = Florian Cajori | year = 1919 | publisher = Macmillan | url = http://books.google.com/?id=bBoPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157&dq=inauthor:cajori+william-oughtred+multiplication [/tpl] It was chosen for religious reason to represent the cross.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.2000.tb17262.x |last=Stallings |first=L. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month= |title=A Brief History of Algebraic Notation |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=230–235 |issn=00366803 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl]  

==Similar notations==

The letter "x" is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.
In the algebraic notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause a confusion: "[tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] multiplied by [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl]" can be written as [tpl]math|ab[/tpl] or [tpl]math|a b[/tpl].
Other symbols are used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign × and the commonly used variable [tpl]mvar|x[/tpl]. In many non-Anglophone countries, rather than ×, the primary symbol for multiplication is [tpl]unichar|22C5|dot operator[/tpl], for which the interpunct · may be substituted as a more accessible character. This symbol is also used in mathematics wherever multiplication should be written explicitly, such as in "[tpl]math|1= ab = a⋅2[/tpl] for [tpl]math|1=b = 2[/tpl]", not excluding English-language texts. In some languages (especially, French[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]) the use of full stop as a multiplication symbol, such as [tpl]math|a.b[/tpl], is common.
In programming languages, the standard notation of multiplication operator is [tpl]unichar|002A|asterisk[/tpl] due to traditional restriction of all syntax of computer languages to the ASCII character repertoire.

==In computer software==

The × symbol is listed in the Latin-1 Supplement character set and is [tpl]unichar|00D7|MULTIPLICATION SIGN|html=[/tpl] in Unicode.  It can be invoked in various operating systems as per the table below.
The × symbol is used by the APL programming language to denote the sign function.
There is a similar character ⨯ at U+2A2F, but this is not always considered identical to U+00D7, as it is intended to explicitly denote the cross product of two vectors.
