==November 8, 1898 eruption==

Reports were received of eruptions in the Ruby Mountain area, about 80 km south of Gladys Lake, near the end of the 19th century. Miners working in the area were said to be able to work during the dark nights under the glow of the eruption. However, there has been no evidence found, such as lava flows, that is young enough to have been the site of a historical eruption.
