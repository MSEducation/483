Joel Chandler Harris House, also known as The Wren's Nest or Snap Bean Farm, is a Queen Anne style house in Atlanta, Georgia built in 1870. It was home to Joel Chandler Harris, editor of the Atlanta Constitution and author of the Uncle Remus Tales, from 1881 until his death in 1908. He is most known as author of the "Uncle Remus" tales, based upon stories he heard slaves tell during his youth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-525&sug=y|title=New Georgia Encyclopedia[/tpl]
The home still contains furnishings owned by Harris and utilizes the original paint colors. The house became known as Wren's Nest in 1900 after the Harris children found a wren had built a nest in the mail box; the family built a new mailbox in order to leave the nest undisturbed. The structure was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962.Blanche Higgins Schroer (May 15, 1975) National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Joel Chandler Harris House / The Wren's Nest; Snap Bean Farm, National Park Service and Accompanying one photo, front porch, from 1975[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/atlanta/har.htm |title=Joel Chandler Harris Home |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2007-07-01[/tpl]
