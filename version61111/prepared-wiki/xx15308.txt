In the 1960s Alfa Romeo became famous for its small cars and models specifically designed for the Italian police and Carabinieri; among them the "Giulia Super" or the 2600 Sprint GT, which acquired the nickname of "Inseguimento" (literally "to chase or predate"). The colours of the Alfa Romeos used by the Polizia were/are green/blue with white stripes and writing, known as "Pantera" (Panther), enhancing the aggressive look of the Alfa (particularly the Giulia series), while the Carabinieri Alfas were dark blue with white roofs and red stripes, known as the "Gazzella" (Gazelle) denoting the speed and agility of these "Pattuglie" (armed response patrol units). However, the term "Pantera" became used interchangeably and the image helped create a no-nonsense, determined and respected perception by the general public of the men that drove these cars, true to their history.[[Image:It police alfa giulia 2.jpg|thumb|left|292px

Since then, Alfas remain the chosen mount of the Carabinieri (arm of the Italian armed forces seconded only partly for civilian policing purposes), Polizia Autostradale (highway police) and the conventional police service (Polizia). Successively, the following Alfa Romeo Berlinas have found favour for Italian police and government employment[tpl]Cite web|url=http://poliziadistato.it/articolo/1453-Le_Alfa_Romeo_con_il_Centauro|title=Le Alfa Romeo con il Centauro|accessdate=2010-09-12|work=poliziadistato.it[/tpl] [tpl]It icon[/tpl]
Since the 1960s, the Italian Prime Minister has used Alfa Romeos (and lately the new Maserati Quattroporte) as preferred government limousines. The 164 and 166 have found particular employment in the last two decades.

===Recent developments===

Alfa Romeo has been suffering from falling sales. Some analysts concluded that the automaker suffered large operating losses in the mid-2000s - estimated to be about 15 percent to 20 percent of annual revenues, or about 300 million to 500 million euros a year. For the year of 2010, it sold a total of about 112,000 units which was significantly lower than Fiat CEO Marchionne's global sales target of 300,000. Alfa then wanted to achieve 170,000 sales in 2011, including 100,000 Giulietta and 60,000 MiTo, but it actually sold 130,000 units that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiatspa.com/en-US/investor_relations/financial_reports/FiatDocuments/Bilanci/2011/Fiat_AnnualReport_2011_ENG.pdf|title=FIAT S.p.A.

==Design and technology==

===Technological development===

Alfa Romeo has introduced many technological innovations over the years, and the company has often been among the first users of new technologies.

Alfa Romeo tested one of the very first electric injection systems (Caproni-Fuscaldo) in the Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 with "Ala spessa" body in 1940 Mille Miglia. The engine had six electrically operated injectors, fed by a semi-high pressure circulating fuel pump system.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/spideralfaromeo/1940b.htm|title=1940 6C 2500 Touring "Ala Spessa"|accessdate=2009-04-11|work= digilander.libero.it[/tpl] [tpl]It icon[/tpl]

===Body design===

Many famous automotive design houses in Italy have accepted commissions to produce concepts and production vehicle shapes for Alfa Romeo. These include:
The last mentioned, the Centro Stile, has rapidly gained international credibility[tpl]Vague|date=July 2013[/tpl] with its work. The 8C Competizione super-coupé, and the MiTo hatchback are the results.
Construction techniques used by Alfa Romeo have become imitated by other car makers, and in this way Alfa Romeo body design has often been very influential. The following is a list of innovations, and where appropriate, examples of imitation by other car manufacturers:
Alfa Romeo models have also inspired some very interesting and often beautiful concept cars. Here follows a short list of concept cars, and their impact on car design:
The Berlina Aerodinamica Tecnica prototype cars were designed by Bertone as an exercise in determining whether streamlining and wind-tunnel driven designs would result in high performance on a standard chassis, and whether the resulting vehicles would be palatable to public. Alfa 1900 Sprint were the basis of the B.A.T. 5, 7 and 9.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z4824/Alfa-Romeo-BAT-7.aspx|title=1954 Alfa Romeo B.A.T. 7|accessdate=2009-06-11|work=conceptcarz.com/vehicle[/tpl] The later B.A.T. 11 was based on the 8C Competizione.
The Tipo 33 racing car, with its high-revving 2000 cc V8 engine became the basis for a number of different concept cars during the 1960s and 1970s, two of which ultimately resulted in production vehicles. Most made their appearances at the Auto Salon Genève. Here is a brief list:
In general, concept cars for Alfa Romeo have generally become production vehicles, after some modification to make them suitable for manufacture, and to provide driver and passenger safety. The Zagato SZ, GTV and Spider (descended from the Proteo), Brera and 159 are all good examples of Alfa Romeo's stylistic commitment in this direction.
Alfa Romeo concept cars have mostly emphasized performance in combination with historical tradition. The Nuvola Concept, and the independently designed Diva Concept cars have demonstrated that this ethos is the centre of Alfa conceptualisation. The Centro Stile website also gives designers very good direction in terms of the combination of line and form Alfa prefers to see in the design process of its cars' bodywork.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===The badge===

Alfa's badge incorporates emblems from fifth century Italy. It was designed in 1910 by an Italian draughtsman, Romano Cattaneo, who used two heraldic devices traditionally associated with Milan: on the right is the Biscione, the emblem of the House of Visconti, rulers of Milan in the 14th century; on the left is a red cross on a white field, the emblem of Milan, which Cattaneo had seen on the door of the Castello Sforzesco.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TUBWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Romano+Cattaneo%22&dq=%22Romano+Cattaneo%22 |title=Autocar & Motor, Volume 185|page=67 |publisher=Haymarket, 1990 |accessdate=2010-09-13 [/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ultimateitaly.com/culture-antropology/visconti-family.html|title=The Visconti Family|accessdate=2010-08-17|work=ultimateitaly.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100731015820/http://www.ultimateitaly.com/culture-antropology/visconti-family.html| archivedate= 31 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 1918, after the company was bought by Nicola Romeo, the badge was redesigned with the help of Giuseppe Merosi. A dark blue metallic ring was added, inscribed "ALFA — ROMEO" and "MILANO" separated by two Savoy dynasty knots to honour the Kingdom of Italy. After the victory of the P2 in the inaugural Automobile World Championship in 1925, Alfa added a laurel wreath around the badge. In 1946, after the abolition of the monarchy, the Savoy knots were replaced with two curvy lines. The name "MILANO", the hyphen, and the lines were eliminated when Alfa Romeo opened its factory at Pomigliano d'Arco, Naples in the early 1970s. The serpent and man appear to be Jonah and the serpent, images often found in liturgical art as far back as the third century.

==Motorsport==

Alfa Romeo has been involved with motor racing since 1911, when it entered two 24 HP models on Targa Florio competition. In the 1920s and 30s it scored wins at many races and motoring events such as Targa Florio, Mille Miglia and Le Mans. Great success continued with Formula One, Prototypes, Touring and Fast Touring. Private drivers also entered some rally competitions, with fine results. Alfa Romeo has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries Alfa Corse, Autodelta and private entries. Alfa Romeo's factory racing team was outsourced to Enzo Ferrari's Scuderia Ferrari between 1933 and 1938. Drivers included Tazio Nuvolari, who won the 1935 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

==Quadrifoglio==

The quadrifoglio emblem (also called the 'cloverleaf') has been the symbol of Alfa Romeo racing cars since 1923. Following WWII, it has also been used to designate the higher trim models of the range (comparable to BMW M Performance or Volkswagen GTI models). The quadrifoglio is usually placed on the side panels of the car, above or behind the front wheels. The symbol consists of a green or gold cloverleaf with four leaves, contained with a white triangle.

===History of the symbol===

The quadrifoglio has been used on Alfa Romeo cars since the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923. As a friend of Enzo Ferrari, Sivocci was hired by Alfa Romeo in 1920 to drive in the three-man works team: (Alfa Corse) with Antonio Ascari and Enzo Ferrari. Sivocci was thought to have enormous experience, but often hampered by bad luck and considered the eternal second-placer.  To banish his bad luck, when the Targa Florio came around, the driver painted a white square with a green four-leaf clover (the quadrifoglio) in the centre of the grille of his car. Sivocci had immediate success, crossing the finish line first. The quadrifoglio subsequently became the symbol of the racing Alfa Romeos with the victory at the Targa Florio. Almost as if to prove the magic effects of this symbol, Sivocci was killed while testing Merosi's new P1 at Monza, a few months after winning the Targa Florio. The Salerno driver's P1, which went off the track on a bend, did not have the quadrifoglio. Since this period in 1923, the bodies of Alfa Romeo racing cars have been adorned with the quadrifoglio as a lucky charm. The white square was replaced with a triangle in memory of Uvo Sivocci.[tpl]cite web|title=Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio History|url=http://www.alfaromeo.com/com/#/models/quadrifoglio-verde/history|work=Alfa Romeo Automobillismo Storico, Centre Documentazione|accessdate=11 January 2013[/tpl]
Cloverleaf, or Quadrifoglio, badges now denote high-end in comfort and engine size variants of Alfa Romeo cars. Some modern Alfas wear a cloverleaf badge which is typically a green four leaf clover on a white background (quadrifoglio verde), but variants of blue on white have been recently observed as well.
The Alfettas of the early 1980s had models available sold as the "Silver Leaf" and "Gold Leaf" (quadrifoglio oro). These models were the top of the range. Badging was the Alfa cloverleaf in either gold or silver to denote the specification level. The Gold Leaf model was also sold as the "159i" in some markets, the name in homage to the original 159.

==Production==

Until the 1980s, Alfa Romeos, except for the Alfasud, were rear-wheel-drive.
According to the current Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne, in order to reap economies of scale, all new Alfa Romeo models will be made from the same basic platform (i.e., frame). Even Maserati will share components with some Alfas."Saving Fiat", The Economist, 3 December 2005, p. 64, vol. 377.
The trim levels (option packages) offered today on the various nameplates (model lines) include the lusso ("luxury"), turismo ("touring"), and the GTA (gran tourismo alleggerita) ("light-weight grand tourer"). The GTA package is offered in the 147 and 156 and includes a V-6 engine. In the past, Alfa Romeo offered a Sprint trim level.
During the 1990s, Alfa Romeo moved car production to other districts in Italy. The Pomigliano d’Arco plant produced the 155, followed by the 145 and the 146, while the Arese plant manufactured the 164 and new Spider and GTV. The 156 was launched in 1997, and became quite successful for Alfa Romeo; in 1998 it was voted “Car of the Year”. The same year a new flagship, the 166 (assembled in Rivalta, near Turin) was launched. At the beginning of the third millennium, the 147 was released, which won the prestigious title of “Car of the Year 2001”. In 2003 the Arese factory was closed.
The Arese factory today hosts almost nothing and is nearly abandoned. What remains are some offices and the great Alfa Romeo Historical Museum, a must-see for Alfa Romeo fans.
In the 60s, the main Alfa Romeo seat was moved from inside Milan to a very large and nearby area extending over the municipalities of Arese, Lainate and Garbagnate Milanese. However, since then the Alfa seat is known to be in Arese, since the offices and the main entrance of the area are there.
In the late 1960s, a number of European automobile manufacturers established facilities in South Africa to assemble right hand drive vehicles. Fiat and other Italian manufacturers established factories along with these other manufacturers, Alfa-Romeos were assembled in Brits, outside Pretoria in the Transvaal Province of South Africa. With the imposition of sanctions by western powers in the 1970s and 1980s, South Africa became self-sufficient, and in car production came to rely more and more on the products from local factories. This led to a remarkable set of circumstances where between 1972 and 1989, South Africa had the greatest number of Alfa Romeos on the road outside of Italy. Even stranger, Alfa Romeos Brits plant was used from March 1983[tpl]Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | ref = TAM85 | year = 1985 | pages = 30–31 | language = Italian | location = Milano | isbn = 88-7212-012-8 [/tpl] until 1985 to build Daihatsu Charades for local consumption, but also for export to Italy in order to skirt Italian limits on Japanese imports.
In late 1985, with the impending Fiat takeover and an international boycott of the South African Apartheid government, Alfa Romeo withdrew from the market and closed the plant. Tons of valuable parts were then bulldozed into the ground to escape paying import duties.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Trucks and light commercial vehicles===

In 1930 Alfa Romeo presented a light truck in addition to heavy LCVs based to Büssing constructions.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://newedgeconcept.com/host33/KB104/ALFA+TROLLEY5.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605150251/http://newedgeconcept.com/host33/KB104/ALFA+TROLLEY5.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-05|format=PDF|title=Alfa Romeo trolleybusses |accessdate=2009-07-16|work=newedgeconcept.com via web.archive.org[/tpl] In the Second World War Alfa Romeo also built trucks for the Italian army ("35 tons anywhere") and later also for the German Wehrmacht. After the war, commercial motor vehicle production was resumed.
In co-operation with FIAT and Saviem starting from the 60s different light truck models were developed.
The production of heavy LCVs was terminated in 1967. In Brazil the heavy trucks were built still few years by Alfa Romeo subsidiary Fábrica Nacional de Motores under the name FNM. The last Alfa Romeo vans were the Alfa Romeo AR6 and AR8, rebadged versions of Iveco Daily and Fiat Ducato. The company also produced trolleybuses for many systems in Italy, Latin America,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tramz.com/tb/i.html|title=Latin American Trolleybus Installations|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=tramz.com[/tpl] Sweden,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sparvagssallskapet.se/atlas/pdf/stockholm_trolley.pdf?PHPSESSID=5c5c5e86fc8bed850540ff764b28528f|title=Stockholm Trådbuss 20/1-1941 -- 31/8-1964|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=sparvagssallskapet.se[/tpl] Greece,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sptc.spb.ru/trol_rus.htm|title=Europe - Soviet Union & Exported ZIU Trolleybuses|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=sptc.spb.ru[/tpl] Germany, Turkey and South Africa. Later, Alfa Romeo concentrated only on passenger car manufacturing.

===Concepts===

Design has always played a large role in the history of Alfa Romeo. There have been many Alfa Romeo concept cars, often made by famous design houses and designers. The BAT series of concepts from the 1950s was a collaboration with the Italian design house Bertone. Other famous Italian coachbuilders and design houses like Pininfarina, Bertone, Zagato and ItalDesign-Giugiaro have also played a great role in Alfa Romeo's history, and even today some of models are designed and constructed by them.

==Other production==

Although Alfa Romeo is best known as automobile manufacturer it has also produced commercial vehicles of various size, railway locomotives, tractors, buses, trams, compressors, generators, an electric cooker,http://forum.clubalfa.it/attachment.php?attachmentid=39226&d=1254043793http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/8391/0580001.jpghttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8242/dsc00846u.jpgMade after the WWII in about 500 examples marine and aircraft engines.

In the 1930s when Alfa Romeo engines were used for aircraft on a larger scale; the Savoia Marchetti SM.74, Savoia-Marchetti SM.75, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Savoia Marchetti SM.81 and Cant Z506B Airone all used Alfa Romeo manufactured engines.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.aerei-italiani.net/Marco_Rigoni/Alfa%20Romeo_Album%20Modelli%20Aerei_Nov.05.pdf|format=PDF|title=Alfa Romeo AEREI Collezione Modelli di Marco Rigoni Settembre 2005|accessdate=2007-04-25|work=aerei-italiani.net| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070605150251/http://www.aerei-italiani.net/Marco_Rigoni/Alfa%20Romeo_Album%20Modelli%20Aerei_Nov.05.pdf| archivedate= 5 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 1931, a competition was arranged where Tazio Nuvolari drove his Alfa Romeo 8C 3000 Monza against a Caproni Ca.100 airplane.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/air10/f104/sfide_f1.htm|title=La storia di due "duelli" inconsueti avvenuti a 50 anni di distanza l'uno dall'altro|accessdate=2007-04-25|work=digilander.libero.it| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070427205202/http://digilander.libero.it/air10/f104/sfide_f1.htm| archivedate= 27 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]It icon[/tpl] Alfa Romeo built various aircraft engines during the Second World War; the best known was the RA.1000 RC 41-I Monsone, a licensed version of the Daimler-Benz DB 601. This engine made it possible to build efficient fighter aircraft like the Macchi C.202 Folgore for the Italian army. After the Second World War Alfa Romeo produced engines for Fiat, Aerfer and Ambrosini. In the 1960s Alfa Romeo mainly focused upgrading and maintaining Curtiss-Wright, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and General Electric aircraft engines. Alfa Romeo also built Italy's first turbine engine, installed to the Beechcraft King Air. Alfa Romeo's Avio division was sold to Aeritalia in 1988,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/ft/feature/retrospective/5654/1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090104213019/http://www.channel4.com/4car/ft/feature/retrospective/5654/1|archivedate=2009-01-04|title=Retrospective: Automobiles and aeroplanes: Alfa Romeo|accessdate=2012-06-07|work=channel4[/tpl] from 1996 it was part of Fiat Avio.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.madeinfiat.com/oct96/newsc.htm|title=FiatAvio acquires Alfa Romeo Avio|accessdate=2007-08-20|work=madeinfiat.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927231131/http://www.madeinfiat.com/oct96/newsc.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Alfa Avio was also part of developing team to the new T700-T6E1 engine to the NHI NH90 helicopter.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Helicopter-Markets-and-Systems/Alfa-Romeo-Avio-Italy.html|title=Alfa Romeo Avio (Italy), Buyer's Guide Engine Manufacturers|accessdate=2008-12-23|work=janes.com[/tpl]

==Media and public profile==

In Italian, an Alfa Romeo enthusiast is an "Alfista", and a group of them are "Alfisti".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=alfista|title=alfista |accessdate=2010-09-15|work=urbandictionary.com[/tpl] There are many thriving Alfa Romeo owners clubs and Alfa Romeo Model Registers.
Probably the most famous appearance and presence on screen of any Alfa is in the 1967 hit film The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman, Katharine Ross and Anne Bancroft.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://imcdb.org/movie_61722-The-Graduate.html|title=The Graduate, Movie, 1967|accessdate=2010-09-15|work=imcdb.org[/tpl] It gave worldwide celebrity to the "Spider".  The Spider depicted on screen had its engine note accurately recorded, and electrical foibles (the non-functional fuel gauge) reproduced.
On the strength of the Spider's appeal, Alfa Romeo continued sales of the Spider into the 1990s, and a special edition named the Alfa Graduate was available in the United States in the 1980s.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z1351/Alfa-Romeo-Spider-Graduate.aspx|title=1986 Spider Graduate|accessdate=2010-09-15|work=conceptcarz.com/vehicle[/tpl]
The entire set of scenes featuring the Spider in the Graduate were replicated in satire by Mike Myers in his comedy, Wayne's World 2.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3689083087556924737#|title=Wayne's World 2-duetto|accessdate=2010-09-15|work=video.google.com[/tpl] The Spider here cuts out Simon & Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson" when passing under a bridge (implying music being played on a radio), but still has a non-functional fuel gauge - causing it to ultimately grind to halt (fortunately at the correct church!)
The Spider was designed by Pininfarina; derived from several design studies dating back to the late 1950s, the Spider is believed to be the last design on which Battista Farina personally worked.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/alfa-romeo/spider/alfa-romeo-spider-concept-by-pininfarina.html|title=Alfa Romeo Spider Concept by Pininfarina|accessdate=2010-09-15|work=insideline.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100927023304/http://www.insideline.com/alfa-romeo/spider/alfa-romeo-spider-concept-by-pininfarina.html| archivedate= 27 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
One of the most prominent roles was when James Bond (Roger Moore) stole and then drove a graphite GTV6 in 1983's Octopussy. In the scene it is pursued by two Bavarian BMW 5-series police cars.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.007.info/FactfileOCTO.asp|title=Octopussy|accessdate=2010-09-15|work=007.info| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100909015809/http://www.007.info/FactfileOCTO.asp| archivedate= 9 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A pair of black Alfa Romeo 159 Ti cars appeared in the opening scenes of the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbhyz9hMcd4|title=Alfa 159 3.2 V6 - Agente 007 - Quantum of Solace |accessdate=2012-06-07|work=youtube.com[/tpl] in the car chase with James Bond's Aston Martin DBS around Lake Garda, Italy. Noteworthy attention was paid to the auditory qualities of the Alfa Romeos, which have the characteristic 'Big V-6' sound on-screen. The same film also features a Carabineri Alfa 156. Rene Mathis also has an Alfa Romeo, a white 2600 GT coupé.
In the first printing of Dan Brown's novel Angels & Demons, the members of the Swiss Guard all drive Alfa Romeo sedans (called 'Alpha Romeos' throughout the book).
In the Ian Fleming novel Moonraker, James Bond becomes involved in an impromptu race with a young man driving an Alfa Romeo while he pursues Hugo Drax. This scene results in the death of the young man, the destruction of his car, and the eventual destruction of Bond's Bentley Mark IV.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lvb7hH5SHvQC&dq=moonraker&q=Alfa&pgis=1#search|title=Moonraker By Ian Fleming|accessdate=2008-03-20|work=books.google.com | isbn=978-0-14-200206-3 | year=2002 | publisher=Penguin Books[/tpl]

==Marketing and sponsorship==

During the years Alfa Romeo has been marketed with different slogans like: "The family car that wins races" used in the 1950s in Alfa Romeo 1900 marketing campaign, "racing since 1911" used on most 1960s Alfa advertisements,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ranwhenparked.net/2010/09/11/alfa-romeo-advertisements-the-1960s/|title=Alfa Romeo advertising: the 1960s.|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=ranwhenparked [/tpl] In the 1970s the Alfa Romeo 1750 GTV was marketed as "if this kind of handling is good enough for our racing cars, it’s good enough for you."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ranwhenparked.net/2010/09/19/alfa-romeo-advertising-the-1970s/|title=Alfa Romeo advertising: the 1970s.|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=ranwhenparked [/tpl] The Giulia Sprint GTA was marketed as "The car you drive to work is a champion".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.autointell.com/european_companies/fiat/alfa-romeo/alfa-147-gta-03/alfa_147-gta-03.htm|title=Alfa Romeo : Alfa 147 GTA|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=autointell.com[/tpl]
More recent slogans used are "Mediocrity is a sin", "Driven by Passion", "Cuore Sportivo", "Beauty is not enough" and present day "Without heart we would be mere machines".
Also other more recent ones are: "It's not a car, it's an Alfa Romeo.", one of them after a couple argue in Italian. Another instance where a female colleague tells her male colleague that she didn't get a car she got an Alfa Romeo.
As part of its marketing policy, Alfa Romeo sponsors a number of sporting events, such as the Mille Miglia rally.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.1000miglia.eu/inglese/home.html?http://www.1000miglia.eu/inglese/partecipare/informazioni/disposizioni_generali.html#|title=sponsors|accessdate=2009-07-09|work=1000miglia.eu[/tpl] It has sponsored the SBK Superbike World Championship and Ducati Corse since 2007, and the Goodwood Festival of Speed for many years, and was one of the featured brands in 2010 when Alfa Romeo celebrated its 100th anniversary.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo/11/goodwood/2111.html|title=21.11.2009 Centenary celebrating Alfa Romeo to take centre stage at Festival Of Speed|accessdate=2009-11-21|work=www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091125161938/http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo/11/goodwood/2111.html| archivedate= 25 November 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/site/content/festivalofspeed/Sponsors.aspx|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed - Sponsors |accessdate=2009-07-09|work=goodwood.co.uk| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090614023534/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/Site/Content/FestivalOfSpeed/Sponsors.aspx| archivedate= 14 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  The Alfa Romeo Giulietta has been used since Monza 2010 race as the safety car in Superbike World Championship events.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.worldsbk.com/en/news/latest-news/3354-alfa-romeo-present-new-giulietta-safety-car.html|title=Alfa Romeo present new Giulietta Safety Car|accessdate=2010-05-15|work=worldsbk.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100618033307/http://www.worldsbk.com/en/news/latest-news/3354-alfa-romeo-present-new-giulietta-safety-car.html| archivedate= 18 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
