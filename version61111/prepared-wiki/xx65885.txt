The Fulda ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈfʊlda[/tpl]) is a river in Hesse, Germany. It is one of two headstreams of the Weser (the other one being the Werra). The Fulda is 218 km in length.
The source is located at Wasserkuppe in the Rhön mountains. From here it runs northeast surrounded by the Knüll mountains in the west and the Seulingswald in the east. Near Bebra it changes direction to the northwest.
After joining the Eder river it flows straight north until Kassel and changes direction to the northeast, with the Kaufungen Forest east and the beginning of the Reinhardswald forest northwest.  The north end of the river meets the Werra in Hannoversch Münden, where the Fulda and the Werra join to form the Weser river.
