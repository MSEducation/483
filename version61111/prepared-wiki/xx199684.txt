The Saab 38 (also known as B3LA or A 38/Sk 38) was a single engine jet trainer and attack aircraft planned by Saab during the 1970s. The project was a collaboration between Saab and the Italian aircraft manufacturer Alenia Aermacchi. The aircraft was to replace the older Saab 105 jet trainer in the Swedish Air Force, however the aircraft never got past the drawing board and was canceled in 1979 in favour of the more advanced Saab 39 Gripen fighter. 
Many ideas developed for the B3LA was later used on the AMX International AMX used by the Italian Air Force and the Brazilian Air Force today.[tpl]cn|date=November 2011[/tpl]
