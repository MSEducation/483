Cortisol is a steroid hormone, more specifically a glucocorticoid, produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex.[tpl]Cite web| author =Scott E | url = http://stress.about.com/od/stresshealth/a/cortisol.htm | title = Cortisol and Stress: How to Stay Healthy |publisher=About.com | date = 2011-09-22 | accessdate = 2011-11-29 [/tpl][tpl]better source|date=November 2012[/tpl] It is released in response to stress and a low level of blood glucocorticoid. Its primary functions are to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid with fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolisms.[tpl]cite book | author = Hoehn K, Marieb EN | title = Human Anatomy & Physiology | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2010 | isbn = 0-321-60261-7  [/tpl] It also decreases bone formation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chyun YS, Kream BE, Raisz LG | title = Cortisol decreases bone formation by inhibiting periosteal cell proliferation | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages = 477–80 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6690287 | doi = 10.1210/endo-114-2-477 [/tpl]
Various forms of cortisol are used to treat a variety of diseases.  Hydrocortisone (INN, USAN, BAN), which is an identical molecule to cortisol, is one such medication.  It can be used to treat people who lack adequate stores of endogenous cortisol. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Physiology==

===Production and release===

Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland in the zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. The cortex forms the outer "bark" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain.  The secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it  to the adrenal cortex.

===Main functions in the body===

In the fasting state, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (formation of glucose, in the liver, from certain amino acids, glycerol, lactate, and/or propionate), and activates anti-stress and anti-inflammatory pathways.| [tpl] cite web | title = Hormones-cortisol| work = Home Better Health Channel| publisher = 2014 State Government of Victoria| date = June 2013 | url = http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Hormones_cortisone| accessdate = 4/1/2014[/tpl] It down regulates the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) on "helper" (CD4+) T-cells.  This results in the inability of interleukin-2 to up regulate the Th2 (humoral) immune response, and results in a Th1 (cellular) immune dominance, which then leads to a decrease in B-cell antibody production.
Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.  It is used to treat conditions resulting from over activity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and rheumatoid diseases, as well as allergies. Low-potency hydrocortisone, available over the counter in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as rashes, eczema, and others.
Cortisol plays an important role in glycogenolysis, the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose, in liver and muscle tissue. Glycogenolysis is stimulated by epinephrine and/or norepinephrine. Cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for epinephrine to have an effect on glycogenolysis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Coderre L, Srivastava AK, Chiasson JL | title = Role of glucocorticoid in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle | journal = Am. J. Physiol. | volume = 260 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = E927–32 |date=June 1991 | pmid = 1905485 | doi = [/tpl]
Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to proteolysis and muscle wasting.[tpl]cite journal | author = Simmons PS, Miles JM, Gerich JE, Haymond MW | title = Increased proteolysis. An effect of increases in plasma cortisol within the physiologic range | journal = J. Clin.

===Pregnancy===

During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135,[tpl]cite journal | author = Mescher EJ, Platzker AC, Ballard PL, Kitterman JA, Clements JA, Tooley WH | title = Ontogeny of tracheal fluid, pulmonary surfactant, and plasma corticoids in the fetal lamb | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 1017–21 |date=December 1975 | pmid = 2573 | doi =  [/tpl]  and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days,  88 percent or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hennessy DP, Coghlan JP, Hardy KJ, Scoggins BA, Wintour EM | title = The origin of cortisol in the blood of fetal sheep | journal = J. Endocrinol. | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–9 |date=October 1982 | pmid = 7130892 | doi =10.1677/joe.0.0950071 [/tpl]  Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Magyar DM, Fridshal D, Elsner CW, Glatz T, Eliot J, Klein AH, Lowe KC, Buster JE, Nathanielsz PW | title = Time-trend analysis of plasma cortisol concentrations in the fetal sheep in relation to parturition | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 107 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–9 |date=July 1980 | pmid = 7379742 | doi =10.1210/endo-107-1-155 [/tpl]  In several livestock species (e.g. the cow, sheep, goat and pig), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and myometrial contraction.  The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species.  In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation,[tpl]cite journal | author = Ricketts AP, Flint AP | title = Onset of synthesis of progesterone by ovine placenta | journal = J. Endocrinol. | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 337–47 |date=August 1980 | pmid = 6933207 | doi =10.1677/joe.0.0860337 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Al-Gubory KH, Solari A, Mirman B | title = Effects of luteectomy on the maintenance of pregnancy, circulating progesterone concentrations and lambing performance in sheep | journal = Reprod.

Dev. | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 317–22 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10972299 | doi =10.1071/RD99079 [/tpl] the pre-partum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen.  (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and oxytocin receptor development.)  In the pregnant cow, where progesterone maintaining pregnancy is provided by the corpus luteum, luteolysis is induced by endometrial release of prostaglandin F2alpha, in response to fetal cortisol (and estrogen).[tpl]cite book | editor = Hafez ESE, Hafez B | title = Reproduction in farm animals | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstwon, MD | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-683-30577-8 | chapter = Gestation, prenatal physiology, and parturition | author = Jainudeen MR, Hafez  ESE | pages =140–155  [/tpl]
Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Mustoe et al. (2012) showed that infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices (BMI) than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (approximately 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants was more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre- and post-natal growth in primates.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 22212825 | doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.12.020 | volume=175 | issue=3 | title=Natural variation in gestational cortisol is associated with patterns of growth in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix geoffroyi) | pmc=3268124 |date=February 2012 | journal=Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. | pages=519–26 | author=Mustoe AC, Birnie AK, Korgan AC, Santo JB, French JA[/tpl]

===Other effects===

Cortisol is released in response to stress, sparing available glucose for the brain, generating new energy from stored reserves, and diverting energy from low-priority activities (such as the immune system) in order to survive immediate threats or prepare for the exertion of rising to a new day. However, prolonged cortisol secretion (which may be due to chronic stress or the excessive secretion seen in Cushing's syndrome) results in significant physiological changes.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

====Immune system====

Cortisol can weaken the activity of the immune system. Cortisol prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to interleukin-1 (IL-1), and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Palacios R, Sugawara I | title = Hydrocortisone abrogates proliferation of T cells in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction by rendering the interleukin-2 Producer T cells unresponsive to interleukin-1 and unable to synthesize the T-cell growth factor | journal = Scand. Journal of Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 |date=January 1982 | pmid = 6461917 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1982.tb00618.x [/tpl] Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on interleukin-1.[tpl]cite book | author = Besedovsky HO, Del Rey A, Sorkin E | chapter = Integration of Activated Immune Cell Products in Immune Endocrine Feedback Circuits | editor = Oppenheim JJ, Jacobs DM | title = Leukocytes and Host Defense | series = Progress in Leukocyte Biology | volume = 5 | publisher =  Alan R. Liss | location =  New York | year = 1986 | page = 200 [/tpl]
IL-1 must be especially useful in combating some diseases; however, endotoxic bacteria have gained an advantage by forcing the hypothalamus to increase cortisol levels (forcing the secretion of CRH hormone, thus antagonizing IL-1). The suppressor cells are not affected by glucosteroid response-modifying factor (GRMF),[tpl]cite journal | author = Fairchild SS, Shannon K, Kwan E, Mishell RI | title = T cell-derived glucosteroid response-modifying factor (GRMFT): a unique lymphokine made by normal T lymphocytes and a T cell hybridoma | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 821–7 |date=February 1984 | pmid = 6228602 | doi = [/tpl] so the effective setpoint for the immune cells may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes (reflecting leukocyte redistribution to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin). Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous Type I and Type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific Type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution. Natural killer cells are affected by cortisol.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mavoungou E, Bouyou-Akotet MK, Kremsner PG | title = Effects of prolactin and cortisol on natural killer (NK) cell surface expression and function of human natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30) | journal = Clin.

====Bone metabolism====

Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring long-term development of osteoporosis. It transports potassium out of cells in exchange for an equal number of sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Deutsch E | title = of thrombocytopenia. 2.

====Collagen====

Collagen is a molecule that makes connective tissue. It's vital for structural support and is found in muscles, tendons and joints, as well as throughout the entire body. Cortisol inhibits Collagen.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kucharz EJ | title = Hormonal control of collagen metabolism. Part II | journal = Endocrinologie | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 229–37 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3062759 | doi =  [/tpl] Stress studies showed that in laboratory rats, cortisol-induced collagen loss in the skin is ten times greater than in any other tissue.[tpl]cite journal | author = Houck JC, Sharma VK, Patel YM, Gladner JA | title = Induction of collagenolytic and proteolytic activities by anti-inflammatory drugs in the skin and fibroblast | journal = Biochem.

====Wound healing====

Cortisol and the stress response have known, deleterious effects of the immune system. High levels of perceived stress and increases in cortisol have been found to increase wound healing time in healthy, male adults. Those who had the lowest levels of cortisol the day following a 4mm punch biopsy had the fastest healing time.Ebrecht, M., Hextall, J., Kirtley, L, Taylor, A., Dyson, M., & Weinman, J. (2004). Perceived stress and cortisol levels predict speed of wound healing in healthy male adults. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 29 (6), 798-809. In dental students, wounds from punch biopsies took an average of 40% longer to heal when performed three days before an examination as opposed to biopsies performed on the same students during summer vacation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marucha PT, Kiecolt-Glaser JK, Favagehi M | title = Mucosal wound healing is impaired by examination stress | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 362–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9625226 | doi = [/tpl]
In mice, glucocorticoids have been shown to increase following an acute stressor. Mice that underwent a restrained stress test showed wound healing times longer than that of control mice. In addition, glucocorticoids were shown to increase in the restraint stress test mice, but not in control mice or restraint test mice given a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.[tpl]cite journal | author = Padgett DA, Marucha PT, Sheridan JF | title = Restraint stress slows cutaneous wound healing in mice | journal = Brain Behav. Immun. | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–73 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9570862 | doi = 10.1006/brbi.1997.0512 [/tpl] In a study of Siberian hamsters, stress only increased glucocorticoids and wound healing time in rodents who were exposed to a stressor and kept in isolation. Social facilitation speeded wound healing time, mitigating the effects of the stressor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Detillion CE, Craft TK, Glasper ER, Prendergast BJ, DeVries AC | title = Social facilitation of wound healing | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 1004–11 | year = 2004  | pmid = 15219651 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2003.10.003 [/tpl]

====Insulin====

Cortisol counteracts insulin, contributes to hyperglycemia-causing hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral utilization of glucose (insulin resistance)[tpl]cite book | author = Brown DF, Brown DD | title = USMLE Step 1 Secrets: Questions You Will Be Asked on USMLE Step 1 | publisher = Hanley & Belfus | location = Philadelphia | year = 2003 | page = 63 | isbn = 1-56053-570-9 [/tpl][tpl]better source|date=November 2012[/tpl] by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane.[tpl]cite book | author = King MB | title = Lange Q & A | publisher = McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub.

====Amino acids====

Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum. It does this by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |author=Manchester, KL |editors=Allison, NH & Munro JB|year=1964 |title =Sites of Hormonal Regulation of Protein Metabolism |encyclopedia=Mammalian Protein Metabolism |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |page=229? 273?[/tpl] Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves.[tpl]cite journal | author = Husband AJ, Brandon MR, Lascelles AK | title = The effect of corticosteroid on absorption and endogenous production of immunoglobulins in calves | journal = Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 707–10 |date=October 1973 | pmid = 4207041 | doi = 10.1038/icb.1973.67 [/tpl] Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE.[tpl]cite journal | author = Posey WC, Nelson HS, Branch B, Pearlman DS | title = The effects of acute corticosteroid therapy for asthma on serum immunoglobulin levels | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 340–8 |date=December 1978 | pmid = 712020 | doi = 10.1016/0091-6749(78)90134-3 [/tpl]

====Gastric and renal secretion====

Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion.[tpl]cite book | title=The Human Adrenal Gland | publisher=Lea & Febiger | author=Soffer LJ, Dorfman RI, Gabrilove JL | year=1961 | location=Philadelphia[/tpl] Cortisol's only direct effect on the hydrogen ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kokshchuk GI, Pakhmurnyi BA | title = Role of Glucocorticoids in Regulation of the Acid-Excreting Function of the Kidneys | journal =Fiziol.

J. Physiol. | volume = 240 | issue = 5 | pages = G365–70 |date=May 1981 | pmid = 6112881 | doi = [/tpl]

====Water====

Cortisol acts as antidiuretic hormone, controlling one-half of intestinal diuresis; it has also been shown to control kidney diuresis in dogs. The decline in water excretion following a decline in cortisol (dexamethasone) in dogs is probably due to inverse stimulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH or arginine vasopressin), which is not overridden by water loading.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boykin J, DeTorrenté A, Erickson A, Robertson G, Schrier RW | title = Role of plasma vasopressin in impaired water excretion of glucocorticoid deficiency | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 738–44 |date=October 1978 | pmid = 701472 | pmc = 371824 | doi = 10.1172/JCI109184 [/tpl] Humans and other animals also use this mechanism.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dingman JF, Gonzalez-Auvert Ahmed ABJ, Akinura A | title = Plasma Antidiuretic Hormone in Adrenal Insufficiency | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 44 | issue =  6| pages = 1041 | year = 1965 | url = http://www.jci.org/articles/view/105202/scanned-page/1041 | doi = 10.1172/JCI105202 [/tpl]

====Copper====

Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), probably to increase copper availability for immune purposes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Weber CE | title = Copper response to rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Med. Hypotheses | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–48 |date=December 1984 | pmid = 6152006 | doi =10.1016/0306-9877(84)90150-6 [/tpl][tpl]rp|337|date=November 2012[/tpl] This includes lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen and elastin.[tpl]rp|334|date=November 2012[/tpl]  Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the superoxide dismutase,[tpl]cite book | author = Flohe L, Beckman R, Giertz H, Loschen G | chapter = Oxygen Centered Free Radicals as Mediators of Inflammation | editor = Sies H | title = Oxidative stress | publisher = Orlando | location = London | year = 1985 | page = 405 | isbn = 0-12-642760-7 [/tpl] since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria.
Cortisol causes an inverse four- or fivefold decrease of metallothionein (a copper storage protein) in mice;[tpl]cite journal | author = Piletz JE, Herschman HR | title = Hepatic metallothionein synthesis in neonatal Mottled-Brindled mutant mice | journal = Biochem. Genet. | volume = 21 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 465–75 |date=June 1983 | pmid = 6870774 | doi = 10.1007/BF00484439 [/tpl] however, rodents do not synthesize cortisol themselves. This may be to furnish more copper for ceruloplasmin synthesis or to release free copper. Cortisol has an opposite effect on aminoisobuteric acid than on the other amino acids.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chambers JW, Georg RH, Bass AD | title = Effect of hydrocortisone and insulin on uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by isolated perfused rat liver | journal = Mol. Pharmacol. | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–76 |date=July 1965 | pmid = 5835080 | doi = [/tpl] If alpha-aminoisobuteric acid is used to transport copper through the cell wall, this anomaly might be explained.

====Sodium====

Cortisol inhibits sodium loss through the small intestine of mammals.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sandle GI, Keir MJ, Record CO | title = The effect of hydrocortisone on the transport of water, sodium, and glucose in the jejunum. Perfusion studies in normal subjects and patients with coeliac disease | journal = Scand. J. Gastroenterol. | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 667–71 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7323700 | doi = 10.3109/00365528109182028 [/tpl] Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels[tpl]cite journal | author = Mason PA, Fraser R, Morton JJ, Semple PF, Wilson A | title = The effect of sodium deprivation and of angiotensin II infusion on the peripheral plasma concentrations of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, aldosterone and other corticosteroids in man | journal = J. Steroid Biochem. | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 799–804 |date=August 1977 | pmid = 592808 | doi = 10.1016/0022-4731(77)90086-3 [/tpl] so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish utilize cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium.[tpl]cite book | author = Gorbman A, Dickhoff WW, Vigna SR, Clark NB, Muller AF | title = Comparative endocrinology | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1983 | pages = | isbn = 0-471-06266-9 [/tpl]

====Potassium====

A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. Corticosterone is comparable to cortisol in this case.[tpl]cite book | author = Muller AF, Oconnor CM | title = An International Symposium on Aldosterone | publisher = Little Brown & Co | location = | year = 1958 | page =  58 [/tpl] For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell.[tpl]cite journal | author = Knight RP, Kornfeld DS, Glaser GH, Bondy PK | title = Effects of intravenous hydrocortisone on electrolytes of serum and urine in man | journal = J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 176–81 |date=February 1955 | pmid = 13233328 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-2-176 [/tpl] This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect).
Nevertheless, cortisol consistently causes serum alkalosis; in a deficiency, serum pH does not change. The purpose of this may be to reduce serum pH to an optimum value for some immune enzymes during infection, when cortisol declines. Potassium is also blocked from loss in the kidneys by a decline in cortisol (9 alpha fluorohydrocortisone).[tpl]cite journal | author = Barger AC, Berlin RD, Tulenko JF | title = Infusion of aldosterone, 9-alpha-fluorohydrocortisone and antidiuretic hormone into the renal artery of normal and adrenalectomized, unanesthetized dogs: effect on electrolyte and water excretion | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 804–15 |date=June 1958 | pmid = 13548099 | doi = 10.1210/endo-62-6-804 [/tpl]

====Memory====

Cortisol works with epinephrine (adrenaline) to create memories of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of flash bulb memories, and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus;[tpl]cite journal | author = McAuley MT, Kenny RA, Kirkwood TB, Wilkinson DJ, Jones JJ, Miller VM | title = A mathematical model of aging-related and cortisol induced hippocampal dysfunction | journal = BMC Neurosci | volume = 10| pages = 26 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19320982 | pmc = 2680862 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2202-10-26 [/tpl] this damage results in impaired learning. Furthermore, it has been shown that cortisol inhibits memory retrieval of already stored information.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Quervain DJ, Roozendaal B, McGaugh JL | title = Stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term spatial memory | journal = Nature | volume = 394 | issue = 6695 | pages = 787–90 |date=August 1998 | pmid = 9723618 | doi = 10.1038/29542 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = de Quervain DJ, Roozendaal B, Nitsch RM, McGaugh JL, Hock C | title = Acute cortisone administration impairs retrieval of long-term declarative memory in humans | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 313–4 |date=April 2000 | pmid = 10725918 | doi = 10.1038/73873 [/tpl]

====Maternal separation====

Changes in cortisol have also been linked to various types of separation. One widely studied form of separation is maternal separation. Following maternal separation, there is a significant increase in cortisol among both the mother and the infant. These changes are due to dysfunctions in the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during a critical period in childhood. One study found that cortisol levels measured in the hair significantly decreased in peer-reared Rhesus monkeys in comparison to mother-reared monkeys at the age of two years. This difference was significant at the mark of two years, and remained significant when tested again at three and a half years.[tpl]cite journal | author = X. Feng, L. Wang , Yang S., D. Qin, J. Wang , C. Li, L. Lv, Y. Ma, X. Hu | title = Maternal separation produces lasting changes in cortisol and behavior in rhesus monkeys | journal = PNAS | volume = 34 | pages = 14312–14317 |date=November 2012 | doi =10.1073/pnas.1010943108[/tpl] This study marks the importance of maternal care, showing that despite being raised by a large peer support group, Rhesus monkeys experience long-lasting hypocortisolism when raised without their mother. 
These effects of maternal separation on cortisol also continue much later in life. One study which examined mid-aged men and women and found that separation lasting 1 or more years during childhood is associated with greater cortisol levels upon daily awakening but decreased magnitude of natural diurnal cortisol fluctuations, possibly symbolizing a diminished activity of the HPA axis.[tpl]cite journal | author = M. Kumari, J. Head, M Bartley, S. Stansfeld, M. Kivimaki | title = Maternal separation in childhood and diurnal cortisol patterns in mid-life: findings from the Whitehall II study | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 633–643 |date=July 2012 | doi =10.1017/S0033291712001353[/tpl] Another study examined adults who were put in to foster care during World War II.
Those separated from both of their parents had higher levels of cortisol in comparison to those who were not separated. These effects were seen more than 60 years after the childhood separation had occurred. This study also found that the length of separation did not affect hormonal responses. .[tpl]cite journal | author = A. Pesonen, K Raikkonwn, K. Feldtm K Heinonen, C. Osmond, D. Philips, D. Barker, J. Eriksson, E. Kajantie | title = Childhood separation experience predicts HPA axis hormonal responses in late adulthood:  A natural experience of World War II  | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 35 | pages = 785 - 767 |date=April 2010 | doi =10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.10.017[/tpl]
These studies mark the importance of maternal care and its effect on cortisol levels not only during childhood separations, but also cortisol levels later in life. More research is needed in this area to be sure of the definite cause of different HPA axis functioning later in life. Also, future research is needed to be sure there is indeed a critical period for maternal separation and its resulting decrease in cortisol.[tpl]cite journal | author = M. Kumari, J. Head, M Bartley, S. Stansfeld, M. Kivimaki | title = Maternal separation in childhood and diurnal cortisol patterns in mid-life: findings from the Whitehall II study | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 633–643 |date=July 2012 | doi =10.1017/S0033291712001353[/tpl]
Aside from maternal separation, studies have found that increases in cortisol levels are also associated with romantic partner separations. These increases in cortisol were more commonly found when the partner who was left for a period of 4 to 6 days has a high attachment anxiety. This could be due to increased stress when their partner was away. But, further evidence is needed to identify the relationship between romantic separation and cortisol.[tpl]cite journal | author = L. M. Diamond, A. M. Hicks, K. D. Otter-Henderson | title = Every time you go away: Changes in affect, behavior, and physiology associated with travel-related separations from romantic partners. | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | pages = 385–493 |date=November 2008 | doi =10.1037/0022-3514.95.2.385 [/tpl]

====Additional effects====

- Increases blood pressure by increasing the sensitivity of the vasculature to epinephrine and norepinephrine; in the absence of cortisol, widespread vasodilation occurs
-Inhibits secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), resulting in feedback inhibition of ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone or corticotropin) secretion. Some researchers believe that this normal feedback system may become dysregulated when animals are exposed to chronic stress[tpl]cite web|title=Holsboer|last=Holsboer|first=Florian|url=http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000096/CH094.html|accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]

- In addition to cortisol's effects in binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, because of its molecular similarity to aldosterone it also binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Aldosterone and cortisol have a similar affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor; however, glucocorticoids circulate at roughly 100 times the level of mineralocorticoids. An enzyme exists in mineralocorticoid target tissues to prevent overstimulation by glucocorticoids and allow selective mineralocorticoid action. This enzyme—11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (Protein:HSD11B2)—catalyzes the deactivation of glucocorticoids to 11-dehydro metabolites

===Normal levels===

Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normals vary among species).
Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the analytical method used and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result.

In humans, the amount of cortisol present in the blood undergoes diurnal variation; the level peaks in the early morning (approximately 8 am) and reaches its lowest level at about midnight-4 am, or three to five hours after the onset of sleep. Information about the light/dark cycle is transmitted from the retina to the paired suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus. This pattern is not present at birth; estimates of when it begins vary from two weeks to nine months of age.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Weerth C, Zijl RH, Buitelaar JK | title = Development of cortisol circadian rhythm in infancy | journal = Early Hum.

Changed patterns of serum cortisol levels have been observed in connection with abnormal ACTH levels, clinical depression, psychological stress, and physiological stressors such as hypoglycemia, illness, fever, trauma, surgery, fear, pain, physical exertion, or temperature extremes. Cortisol levels may also differ for individuals with autism or Asperger's syndrome.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7976489.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | title=Asperger's stress hormone 'link' | date=2009-04-02 | accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]
There is also significant individual variation, although a given person tends to have consistent rhythms.[tpl]cite web|title=The Canary Club|url=http://www.canaryclub.org/adrenal-stress-cortisol-dhea-hormone-profile.html|publisher=The Canary Club|accessdate=3 July 2013[/tpl]
Ultradian as well as circadian cycles of cortisol secretion have been observed, e.g. a cycle period of about 2 h in cattle[tpl]cite journal | author = Lefcourt AM, Bitman J, Kahl S, Wood DL | title = Circadian and ultradian rhythms of peripheral cortisol concentrations in lactating dairy cows | journal = J.

===Binding===

Most serum cortisol (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes, where they bind intracellular cortisol receptors.[tpl]cite book | author = Boron WF, Boulpaep EL | title = Medical Physiology | edition = 2nd | publisher = Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 1-4377-1753-5 [/tpl]

===Regulation===

The primary control of cortisol is the pituitary gland peptide, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Davies E., Keyon C.J., Fraser R. | year = 1985 | title = The role of calcium ions in the mechanism of ACTH stimulation of cortisol synthesis | url = | journal = Steroids | volume = 45 | issue = 6|pmid=3012830 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128X(85)90019-4 | pages = 551–60 [/tpl] ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control. CRH acts synergistically with arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and epinephrine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Plotsky PM, Otto S, Sapolsky RM | title = Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 1126–30 |date=September 1986 | pmid = 3015567 | doi = 10.1210/endo-119-3-1126 [/tpl]  (In swine, which do not produce arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin acts synergistically with CRH.[tpl]cite journal | author = Minton JE, Parsons KM | title = Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol response to corticotropin-releasing factor and lysine vasopressin in pigs | journal = J. Anim. Sci. | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 724–9 |date=March 1993 | pmid = 8385088 | doi = [/tpl])
When activated macrophages start to secrete interleukin-1 (IL-1), which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF or GAF) as well as IL-1; both  increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells.  Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dvorak M | year = 1971 | title = Plasma 17-Hydroxycorticosteroid Levels in Healthy and Diarrheic Calves | url = | journal = British Veterinarian Journal | volume = 127 | issue = | page = 372 [/tpl] The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF (known as GAF in this reference) affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stith RD, McCallum RE | title = General effect of endotoxin on glucocorticoid receptors in mammalian tissues | journal = Circ.

====Factors generally reducing cortisol levels====

====Factors generally increasing cortisol levels====

==Disorders of cortisol production==

The relationship between cortisol and ACTH, and some consequent conditions, are as follows:
A 2010 study has found that serum cortisol predicts increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0022/ea0022OC4.6.htm |title=Serum cortisol predicts increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome |publisher=Endocrine-abstracts.org |accessdate=2010-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Terzolo M, Bovio S, Pia A, Conton PA, Reimondo G, Dall'Asta C, Bemporad D, Angeli A, Opocher G, Mannelli M, Ambrosi B, Mantero F | title = Midnight serum cortisol as a marker of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with a clinically inapparent adrenal adenoma | journal = Eur.

==Pharmacology==

Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent Addisonian crisis.  It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, and certain other inflammatory skin conditions.  It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout. Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid used in nasal sprays and asthma inhalers.
Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about four times as strong and dexamethasone about forty times as strong, in their anti-inflammatory effect.[tpl]cite web|title=Dexamethasone|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/dexamethasone.html|publisher=drugs.com|accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]  For side effects, see corticosteroid and prednisolone.
Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only. Covering the skin after application increases the absorption and effect.  Such enhancement is sometimes prescribed, but otherwise should be avoided to prevent overdose and systemic impact.
Advertising for the dietary supplement CortiSlim originally (and falsely) claimed that it contributed to weight loss by blocking cortisol.  The manufacturer was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission in 2007 for false advertising and no longer claims in their marketing that CortiSlim is a cortisol antagonist.[tpl]Cite news|author=Iwata, Edward |title=Diet pill sellers fined $25M |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-04-weight-loss-pills_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=5 January 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-26[/tpl]

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===

Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. (The name cortisol is derived from cortex.) While the adrenal cortex also produces aldosterone (in the zona glomerulosa) and some sex hormones (in the zona reticularis), cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species.  (However, in cattle, corticosterone levels may approach[tpl]cite journal | author = Willett LB, Erb RE | title = Short term changes in plasma corticoids in dairy cattle | journal = J. Anim. Sci. | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–11 |date=January 1972 | pmid = 5062063 | doi =  [/tpl] or exceed. cortisol levels.). The medulla of the adrenal gland lies under the cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.
The synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); ACTH production is in turn stimulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory) protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme).[tpl]cite book | author = Margioris AN, Tsatsanis C | editor = Chrousos G | title = Adrenal physiology and diseases | year = 2011 | chapter= ACTH Action on the Adrenal | chapterurl = http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenalframe5.htm | publisher = Endotext.org [/tpl]

===Metabolism===

Cortisol is metabolized by the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: 11-beta HSD1 and 11-beta HSD2.
Overall, the net effect is that 11-beta HSD1 serves to increase the local concentrations of biologically active cortisol in a given tissue;  11-beta HSD2 serves to decrease local concentrations of biologically active cortisol.
Cortisol is also metabolized into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone (THE).
An alteration in 11-beta HSD1 has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance known as metabolic syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tomlinson JW, Walker EA, Bujalska IJ, Draper N, Lavery GG, Cooper MS, Hewison M, Stewart PM | title = 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1: a tissue-specific regulator of glucocorticoid response | journal = Endocr.

An alteration in 11-beta HSD2 has been implicated in essential hypertension and is known to lead to the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME).

==Health disparities==
