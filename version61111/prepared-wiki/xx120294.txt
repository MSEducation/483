Ugie Hospital is a small hospital in Peterhead, Scotland, providing psychogeriatric services.

==History==

Originally named the Burgh Hospital, it was built as a fever hospital, founded in 1905 and opened in 1907 with 2 wards.[tpl]cite web | title=Ugie Hospital | work=NHS Grampian | url=http://www.nhsgrampian.org/nhsgrampian/gra_display_simple_index.jsp?pContentID=4217&p_applic=CCC&p_service=Content.show& | accessdate=2006-07-13[/tpl]
In August 2005 Aberdeenshire Community Health Partnership issued a consultation document on Older People’s Services, Maternity Services and Diagnostic and Treatment Services which includes several proposals for reorganisation of services in these areas. One of the options would "create one centralised Aberdeenshire psycho-geriatric assessment unit.  This would allow for the relocation of all psychogeriatric services out of Ugie Hospital and enable it to be closed".[tpl]cite web | title=Older People’s Services, Maternity Services and Diagnostic and Treatment Services | work=Aberdeenshire Community Health Partnership | url=http://193.195.78.72/nhsgrampian/files/Aberdeenshire.rtf | accessdate=2006-07-05[/tpl]

==MRSA outbreak==

In 2004 the Ravenscraig geriatric ward at the hospital was closed to new admissions because of an outbreak of MRSA among the elderly patients. Eight of the 13 patients were found to be carriers of the bacteria, although none of the patients was actually infected.[tpl]cite web | title=Geriatric ward closes after superbug colonises patients | work=British Nursing News Online | url=http://www.bnn-online.co.uk/news_search.asp?page=4&PaperID=&TextChoice=MRSA&TextChoice2=MSSA&Operator=or&Year=2004 | accessdate=2006-07-05[/tpl]
