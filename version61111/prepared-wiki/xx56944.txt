==History==

The paper was established on 15 June 1946 and was published in Pingshan, Hebei, until its offices were moved to Beijing in March 1949. Ever since its founding, the People's Daily has been under direct control of the Party's top leadership. Deng Tuo and Wu Lengxi served as editor-in-chief from 1948–1958 and 1958–1966, respectively, but the paper was in fact controlled by Mao's personal secretary Hu Qiaomu.
During the Cultural Revolution, the People's Daily was one of the few sources of information from which either foreigners or Chinese could figure out what the Chinese government was doing.  During this period, an editorial in the People's Daily would be considered an authoritative statement of government policy and was studied nationwide.
Newspaper articles in the People's Daily are often not read for content so much as placement.  A large number of articles devoted to a political figure or idea is often taken as a sign that the mentioned official is rising.  
Editorials in the People's Daily are also regarded both by foreign observers and Chinese readers as authoritative statements of government policy. Distinction is made between editorials, commentaries, and opinions.  Although all must be government approved, they differ sharply on the amount of official authoritativeness they contain.  For example, although an opinion piece is unlikely to contain views that are opposed to those of the government, it may express a viewpoint, or it may contain a debate that is still under consideration and may reflect only the opinions of the writer.  By contrast, an official editorial, which is rather infrequent, means that the government has reached a final decision on an issue.
During the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989, the People's Daily editorial of 26 April, which condemned "unlawful parades and demonstrations," marked a significant moment in the newspaper's history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsquare.tv/chronology/April26ed.html |title=April 26 Editorial |publisher=Tsquare.tv |date=26 April 1989 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl]  The editorial increased tension between the government and protesters, and top CPC leaders argued about whether to revise it.   
Since the mid-1990s, the People's Daily has faced a decline of governmental subsidies combined with increasing competition from international news sources and Chinese tabloids.  As part of its effort to modernize, it began an online edition in 1997, and the web bulletin forums, such as the Strengthening Nation Forum in the Chinese edition, has been known for their surprisingly candid content. 
The People's Daily is also responsible for the publication Global Times,[tpl]cite news|author=Tania Branigan in Beijing |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/20/china-newspaper-launch |title=Guardian Article |publisher=Guardian Article |accessdate=10 May 2012 |date=20 April 2009[/tpl] and hosts the Strengthening Nation Forum on its website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bbs1.people.com.cn/ |title=Strengthening Nation Forum |work=People's Daily  |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl]
The internet new portal of People's Daily includes pages in Arabic, French, Russian, Spanish, Japanese and English. In comparison to the original Chinese version, the foreign language version offer less in-depth discussion of domestic policies and affairs and more editorial about China's foreign policies and motives, often explaining China's positive intentions.Chinese and English versions of China's leading news portals – Two styles of journalism, Thinking Chinese, August 2011 In addition, the portals runs an English page dedicated to Tibet, which can be understood as means to show China's positive attitude towards the province, which has become a major point of controversy worldwide.
The People's Daily also maintains a multilingual internet presence; and established the People's Daily Online (人民网) in 1997 and the search engine Jike (即刻 "immediately") in 2010.[tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/01/10/a-loyal-customer-people%E2%80%99s-daily-and-beijing-2/ |title=A Loyal Customer: People’s Daily and Beijing |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 January 2012[/tpl]
