Three weeks later, Hazell received a phone call from Muskingum University head coach, Jeff Heacock, asking Hazell to come on a recruiting visit. Hazell agreed to take a visit, also scheduling a visit with Waynesburg College the same weekend. In four hours, Hazell fell in love with, and ultimately choose Muskingum.
