</ref> Larger groups called [[star cluster]]s also exist. These range from loose [[stellar associations]] with only a few stars, up to enormous [[globular clusters]] with hundreds of thousands of stars.
It has been a long-held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. However the proportion of single star systems increases for smaller stars, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.[ref]

Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe, but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies in the observable universe.[tpl]cite web | title=What is a galaxy?

The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years away. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to get there.3.99 × 1013 km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. Distances like this are typical inside galactic discs, including in the vicinity of the solar system.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Holmberg | first1=J. | last2=Flynn | first2=C. | title=The local density of matter mapped by Hipparcos | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=313 | issue=2 | year=2000 | pages=209–216 | bibcode=2000MNRAS.313..209H | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.02905.x |arxiv = astro-ph/9812404 [/tpl] Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.
Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common.[tpl]cite news | title=Astronomers: Star collisions are rampant, catastrophic | publisher=CNN News | date=June 2, 2000 | url=http://archive.is/8lKf | accessdate=2014-01-21 [/tpl] Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity in the cluster.[tpl]cite journal | display-authors=1 | first1=J.

==Characteristics==

Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including essential characteristics such as luminosity and size, as well as its evolution, lifespan, and eventual fate.

===Age===

Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the Universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.798 ± 0.037.)
The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.[ref]

===Chemical composition===

When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium,[ref]
</ref> as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. Because the molecular clouds where stars form are steadily enriched by heavier elements, a measurement of the chemical composition of a star can be used to infer its age.<ref>
</ref>[tpl]dubious|date=February 2014[/tpl] The portion of heavier elements may also be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.<ref>
</ref>
The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun.[ref]
