The National Security Agency (NSA) is a U.S. intelligence agency responsible for providing the United States government with encrypted communications (information assurance) and the reading of encrypted communications (signals intelligence) of other nations. The NSA also creates and maintains secure computer network operations for the U.S. Government and prepares for network warfare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml[/tpl] 
Originating as a unit to decipher code communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Truman in 1952. Since then, it has become one of the largest of U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget,Bamford, James. Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, Random House Digital, Inc., December 18, 2007 operating under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and reporting to the Director of National Intelligence.
The NSA is tasked with the global monitoring, collection, decoding, translation and analysis of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, including surveillance of targeted individuals in U.S. territory. The agency is authorized to accomplish its mission through clandestine means,Executive Order 13470 — http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2008-08-04/pdf/WCPD-2008-08-04-Pg1064.pdf 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333], United States Intelligence Activities, July 30, 2008 (PDF) among which are bugging electronic systemsMalkin, Bonnie.

The NSA is also responsible for the protection of U.S. government communications and information systems. As part of the growing practice of mass surveillance in the United States, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens.[tpl]cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records|work=Associated Press|accessdate=October 15, 2013|quote="Is it the goal of the NSA to collect the phone records of all Americans?" Udall asked at Thursday's hearing. "Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it. Yes," Alexander replied.[/tpl]
Unlike the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA has no authority to conduct human-source intelligence gathering, although it is often portrayed doing so in popular culture. Instead, the NSA is entrusted with coordination and deconfliction of SIGINT components of otherwise non-SIGINT government organizations, which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities without the approval of the NSA via the Defense Secretary.Executive Order 13470 — 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, Section C.2, July 30, 2008
As part of these streamlining responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which was created to facilitate cooperation between NSA and other U.S. military cryptanalysis components. Additionally, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service.
The NSA has been a matter of political controversy on several occasions in its short history. During the Watergate affair, as a result of a congressional inquiry led by Sen. Frank Church Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE. PBS.

However, in 2013, the extent of the NSA's secret surveillance programs was revealed to the public by Edward Snowden. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts phone and internet communications of over a billion people worldwide and tracks the movement of hundreds of millions of people using cellphones. It has also created or maintained security vulnerabilities in most software and encryption (by collaborating with, coercing, or infiltrating numerous technology companies), so that the majority of the internet is susceptible to cyber attacks from the NSA and other parties.

==History==

===Army predecessor===

The origins of the National Security Agency can be traced back to April 28, 1917, three weeks after the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany in World War I.  A code and cipher decryption unit was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the Cipher Bureau and Military Intelligence Branch, Section 8 (MI-8).  It was headquartered in Washington, D.C. and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization.  During the course of the war it was relocated in the army's organizational chart several times.  On July 5, 1917, Herbert O. Yardley was assigned to head the unit.  At that point, the unit consisted of Yardley and two civilian clerks.  It absorbed the navy's cryptoanalysis functions in July 1918. World War I ended on November 11, 1918, and MI-8 moved to New York City on May 20, 1919, where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/457.html|title=The National Archives, Records of the National Security Agency|accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/many_lives.pdf|title=The Many Lives of Herbert O. Yardley|accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl]

===Black Chamber===

MI-8 also operated the so called "Black Chamber".[tpl]cite book|last=Yardley|first=Herbert O.|title=The American black chamber|year=1931|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=1591149894[/tpl] The Black Chamber was located on East 37th Street in Manhattan.  Its purpose was to crack the communications codes of foreign governments. Jointly supported by the State Department and the War Department, the chamber persuaded Western Union, the largest U.S. telegram company, to allow government officials to monitor private communications passing through the company’s wires.[tpl]cite news|last=James Bamford|title=Building America’s secret surveillance state|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/06/10/building-americas-secret-surveillance-state/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=November 9, 2013[/tpl]
Other "Black Chambers" were also found in Europe. They were established by the French and British governments to read the letters of targeted individuals, employing a variety of techniques to surreptitiously open, copy, and reseal correspondence before forwarding it to unsuspecting recipients.[tpl]cite news|title=Roman Empire to the NSA: A world history of government spying|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24749166|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 9, 2013|quote=Across Europe, they established departments called "black chambers" (from the French, cabinet noir) to read the letters of targeted individuals.|date=November 1, 2013[/tpl]
Despite the American Black Chamber's initial successes, it was shut down in 1929 by U.S. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson, who defended his decision by stating: "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail".

===World War II and its aftermath===

During World War II, the Signal Security Agency (SSA) was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the Axis powers.[tpl]cite web|title=Army Security Agency Established, 15 September 1945|url=http://www.army.mil/article/110544/|publisher=United States Army|accessdate=November 9, 2013[/tpl] When the war ended, the SSA was reorganized as the Army Security Agency (ASA), and it was placed under the leadership of the Director of Military Intelligence.
On May 20, 1949, all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA). This organization was originally established within the U.S. Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[tpl]cite web|title=The Origins of the National Security Agency 1940–1952 (U)|last=Burns|first=Thomas L.|publisher=National Security Agency|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB278/02.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=August 11, 2010|page=60[/tpl] The AFSA was tasked to direct Department of Defense communications and electronic intelligence activities, except those of U.S. military intelligence units. However, the AFSA was unable to centralize communications intelligence and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In December 1951, President Harry S. Truman ordered a panel to investigate how AFSA had failed to achieve its goals. The results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the National Security Agency.[tpl]cite web|title=The Creation of NSA - Part 2 of 3: The Brownell Committee|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/The_Creation_of_NSA_Part_3.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=July 2, 2013[/tpl]
The agency was formally established by Truman in a memorandum of October 24, 1952, that revised National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) 9.[tpl]cite web|title=Memorandum|author=Truman, Harry S.|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/truman/truman_memo.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=National Security Agency |date=October 24, 1952 |accessdate=July 2, 2013[/tpl] Since President Truman's memo was a classified document, the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time. Due to its ultra-secrecy the U.S. intelligence community referred to the NSA as "No Such Agency".[tpl]cite news|last=Anne Gearan|title=‘No Such Agency’ spies on the communications of the world|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-06/world/39779097_1_intelligence-agencies-communications-secrecy|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 November 2013|date=June 7, 2013[/tpl]

===Vietnam War===

In the 1960s, the NSA played a key role in expanding America's commitment to the Vietnam War by providing evidence of a North Vietnamese attack on the American destroyer [tpl]USS|Maddox|DD-731|6[/tpl] during the Gulf of Tonkin incident.[tpl]cite news|last=SCOTT SHANE|title=Vietnam Study, Casting Doubts, Remains Secret|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/31/politics/31war.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 31, 2005|quote=The National Security Agency has kept secret since 2001 a finding by an agency historian that during the Tonkin Gulf episode, which helped precipitate the Vietnam War[/tpl]
A secret operation code-named "MINARET" was set up by the NSA to monitor the phone communications of Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker, as well as major civil rights leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King, and prominent U.S. journalists and athletes who criticized the Vietnam War."Declassified NSA Files Show Agency Spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK Operation Minaret Set Up in 1960s to Monitor Anti-Vietnam Critics, Branded 'Disreputable If Not Outright Illegal' by NSA Itself" The Guardian, 26 Sept. 2013 However the project turned out to be controversial, and an internal review by the NSA concluded that its Minaret program was "disreputable if not outright illegal."

===Church Committee hearings===

In the aftermath of the Watergate Scandal, a congressional hearing in 1975 led by Sen. Frank ChurchPre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain’s SIGINT intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-Vietnam war leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr. Benjamin Spock.[tpl]cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |date= |title=No Holiday: 80 Places You Don't Want to Visit |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pj1_-1a79kkC&dq=9781932857290&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1YcjU57nNJOfkQe5zYCIAw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 14, 2014[/tpl] Following the resignation of President Richard Nixon, there were several investigations of suspected misuse of FBI, CIA and NSA facilities. Senator Frank Church uncovered previously unknown activity, such as a CIA plot (ordered by the administration of President John F. Kennedy) to assassinate Fidel Castro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_IV.pdf|format=PDF|title=Book IV, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Foreign and Military Intelligence (94th Congress, Senate report 94-755)|date=April 23, 1976|publisher=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|accessdate=June 28, 2013|page=67 (72)[/tpl] The investigation also uncovered NSA's wiretaps on targeted American citizens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_II.pdf|format=PDF|title=Book II, Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans (94th Congress, Senate report 94-755)|date=April 26, 1976|publisher=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|accessdate=June 28, 2013|page=124 (108)[/tpl]
After the Church Committee hearings, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was passed into law. This was designed to limit the practice of mass surveillance in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10262007/profile2.html|title=The Church Committee and FISA|date=October 26, 2007|author=Bill Moyers Journal|publisher=Public Affairs Television|accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl]

===1980s and 1990s===

In 1986, the NSA intercepted the communications of the Libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the Berlin discotheque bombing. The White House asserted that the NSA interception had provided "irrefutable" evidence that Libya was behind the bombing, which U.S. President Ronald Reagan cited as a justification for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya.[tpl]cite news|last=Seymour M.

===War on Terror===

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the internet and cellphones. ThinThread contained advanced data mining capabilities. It also had a 'privacy mechanism'; surveillance was stored encrypted; decryption required a warrant. The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems. ThinThread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer, which did not include ThinThread's privacy system.[tpl]cite news|first=Siobhan|last=Gorman|title=NSA killed system that sifted phone data legally|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18,1,5386811.story?ctrack=1&cset=true|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company (Chicago, IL)|date=May 17, 2006|accessdate=March 7, 2008|quote=The privacy protections offered by ThinThread were also abandoned in the post–September 11 push by the president for a faster response to terrorism.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193047/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18,1,5386811.story?ctrack=1&cset=true|archivedate=September 27, 2007[/tpl]
Trailblazer Project ramped up in 2002. SAIC, Boeing, CSC, IBM, and Litton worked on it. Some NSA whistleblowers complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer. This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD Inspectors General. The project was cancelled in early 2004; it was late, over budget, and didn't do what it was supposed to do. The Baltimore Sun ran articles about this in 2006–07. The government then raided the whistleblowers' houses. One of them, Thomas Drake, was charged with violating [tpl]uscsub|18|793|e[/tpl] in 2010 in an unusual use of espionage law. He and his defenders claim that he was actually being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. In 2011, all 10 original charges against Drake were dropped.See refs of Thomas Andrews Drake articleBamford, Shadow Factory, pp. 325–340.
Turbulence started in 2005. It was developed in small, inexpensive 'test' pieces rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer. It also included offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, like injecting malware into remote computers. Congress criticized Turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer. It was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace.

===Global surveillance disclosures===

The massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic, was revealed to the public in a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents beginning in June 2013. Most of the disclosures were leaked by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden.

====Scope of surveillance====

====Legal accountability====

Despite President Obama's claims that these programs have congressional oversight, members of Congress were unaware of the existence of these NSA programs or the secret interpretation of the Patriot Act, and have consistently been denied access to basic information about them.Greenwald, Glen, "Members of Congress denied access to basic information about NSA", The Guardian, August 4, 2013. Retrieved September 23, 2013. Obama has also claimed that there are legal checks in place to prevent inappropriate access of data and that there have been no examples of abuse; however, the secret FISC court charged with regulating the NSA's activities is, according to its chief judge, incapable of investigating or verifying how often the NSA breaks even its own secret rules.Loennig, C., "Court: Ability to police U.S. spying program limited", Washington Post, August 16, 2013. Retrieved September 23, 2013.
It has since been reported that the NSA violated its own rules on data access thousands of times a year, many of these violations involving large-scale data interceptions;Gellman, B.

Retrieved September 23, 2013. The NSA has "generally disregarded the special rules for disseminating United States person information" by illegally sharing its intercepts with other law enforcement agencies.Spencer Ackerman, November 19, 2013, "Fisa court documents reveal extent of NSA disregard for privacy restrictions", The Guardian. Retrieved November 21, 2013. A March 2009 opinion of the FISC court, released by court order, states that protocols restricting data queries had been "so frequently and systemically violated that it can be fairly said that this critical element of the overall ... regime has never functioned effectively."John D Bates (3 October 2011).

Retrieved September 14, 2013. In 2011 the same court noted that the "volume and nature" of the NSA's bulk foreign internet intercepts was "fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe". Email contact lists (including those of US citizens) are collected at numerous foreign locations to work around the illegality of doing so on US soil.
Legal opinions on the NSA's bulk collection program have differed. In mid-December, 2013, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled that the "almost-Orwellian" program likely violates the Constitution, and wrote, "I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval. Surely, such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution, James Madison, who cautioned us to beware 'the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power,' would be aghast."Richard Leon, December 16, 2013, Memorandum Opinion, Klayman vs. Obama.

Later that month, U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled that the NSA’s collection of telephone records is legal and valuable in the fight against terrorism. In his opinion, he wrote, "a bulk telephony metadata collection program is a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data" and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 9/11 might have prevented the attack.[tpl]cite web|last=Bazzle|first=Steph|title=Judge Says NSA’s Data Collection Is Legal|url=http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/|publisher=Indyposted|accessdate=December 28, 2013|date=27 December 2013[/tpl]

====Official responses====

Numerous conflicting stories have been put forward by the Obama administration in response to new revelations in the media.Eddlem, T. The NSA Domestic Surveillance Lie, September 22, 2013. Retrieved September 23, 2013.
On March 20, 2013 the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral James Clapper testified before Congress that the NSA doesn't wittingly collect any kind of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans, but he retracted this in June after details of the PRISM program were published, and stated instead that meta-data of phone and internet traffic are collected, but no actual message contents.Kessler, Glen, James Clapper's 'least untruthful' statement to the Senate, June 12, 2013. Retrieved September 23, 2013. This was corroborated by NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, before it was revealed that the XKeyscore program collects the contents of millions of emails from US citizens without warrant, as well as "nearly everything a user does on the Internet". Alexander later admitted that "content" is collected, but stated that it is simply stored and never analyzed or searched unless there is "a nexus to al-Qaida or other terrorist groups".
Regarding the necessity of these NSA programs, Gen. Alexander stated on June 27 that the NSA's bulk phone and Internet intercepts had been instrumental in preventing 54 terrorist "events", including 13 in the US, and in all but one of these cases had provided the initial tip to "unravel the threat stream".Kube, C., June 27, 2013, "NSA chief says surveillance programs helped foil 54 plots", US News on nbcnews.com. Retrieved September 27, 2013. On July 31 NSA Deputy Director John Inglis conceded to the Senate that these intercepts had not been vital in stopping any terrorist attacks, but were "close" to vital in identifying and convicting four San Diego men for sending US$8,930 to Al-Shabaab, a militia that conducts terrorism in Somalia."NSA Confirms Dragnet Phone Records Collection, But Admits It Was Key in Stopping Just 1 Terror Plot", Democracy Now August 1, 2013.

==Organizational structure==

The NSA is led by the Director of the National Security Agency (DIRNSA), who also serves as Chief of the Central Security Service (CHCSS) and Commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and is the highest-ranking military official of these organizations. He is assisted by a Deputy Director, who is the highest-ranking civilian within the NSA/CSS.
NSA also has an Inspector General, head of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a General Counsel, head of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and a Director of Compliance, who is head of the Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC).These offices are for example mentioned in a FISA court order from 2011.
Unlike other intelligence organizations such as CIA or DIA, NSA has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure.
As of the mid-1990s, the National Security Agency was organized into five Directorates:
Each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements, designated by a letter. There were for example the A Group, which was responsible for all SIGINT operations against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and G Group, which was responsible for SIGINT related to all non-communist countries. These groups were divided in units designated by an additional number, like unit A5 for breaking Soviet codes, and G6, being the office for the Middle East, North Africa, Cuba, Central and South America.Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, p. 130, 138, 156-158.See also the information about the historical structure of NSA that is archived at FAS.org

===Current structure===

Currently, NSA has about a dozen directorates, which are designated by a letter, although not all of them are publicly known. The directorates are divided in divisions and units, which have a designation which starts with the letter of the parent directorate, followed by a number for the division, the sub-unit or a sub-sub-unit. New information about NSA units was revealed in top secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden since June 2013.
The main elements of the current organizational structure of the NSA are:TheWeek.com: The NSA's secret org chart, September 15, 2013
In the year 2000, a leadership team was formed, consisting of the Director, the Deputy Director and the Directors of the Signals Intelligence (SID), the Information Assurance (IAD) and the Technical Directorate (TD). The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team.National Security Agency - 60 Years of Defending Our Nation, Anniversary booklet, 2012, p. 96.
After president George W. Bush initiated the President's Surveillance Program (PSP) in 2001, the NSA created a 24-hour Metadata Analysis Center (MAC), followed in 2004 by the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD), which had to analyze content, internet metadata and  telephone metadata. Both units were part of the Signals Intelligence Directorate.Marc Ambinder, 3008 Selectors, June 27, 2013.
There's also an office of Information Sharing Services (ISS), lead by a chief and a deputy chief.This is mentioned in a FISA court order from 2011.

===Watch centers===

The NSA maintains at least two watch centers:

===Employees===

The number of NSA employees is officially classified"Introverted? Then NSA wants you." FCW. April 2012. Retrieved July 1, 2013. but there are several sources providing estimates.
In 1961, NSA had 59,000 military and civilian employees, which grew to 93,067 in 1969, of which 19,300 worked at the headquarters at Fort Meade. In the early 1980s NSA had roughly 50,000 military and civilian personnel. By 1989 this number had grown again to 75,000, of which 25,000 worked at the NSA headquarters. Between 1990 and 1995 the NSA's budget and workforce were cut by one third, which led to a substantial loss of experience.Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, pp. 128, 148, 190 and 198.
In 2012, the NSA said more than 30,000 employees work at Ft. Meade and other facilities. In 2012, John C. Inglis, the deputy director, said that the total number of NSA employees is "somewhere between 37,000 and one billion" as a joke, and stated that the agency is "probably the biggest employer of introverts." In 2013 Der Spiegel stated that the NSA had 40,000 employees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/prism-leak-inside-the-controversial-us-data-surveillance-program-a-904761.html |title=Prism Exposed: Data Surveillance with Global Implications |page=2 |publisher=Spiegel Online International |date=June 10, 2013[/tpl] "How can an intelligence agency, even one as large and well-staffed as the NSA with its 40,000 employees, work meaningfully with such a flood of information?" More widely, it has been described as the world's largest single employer of mathematicians.[tpl]cite speech |title=Statement for the Record |author=Harvey A.

As of 2013 about 1,000 system administrators work for the NSA.

====Security issues====

The NSA received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the Soviet Union. Investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee and a special subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations, prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices.David Kahn, The Codebreakers, Scribner Press, 1967, chapter 19, pp. 672–733. Nonetheless, security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of Izvestia of July 23, 1963, a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets. 
The very same day, an NSA clerk-messenger committed suicide as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis. The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write "If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured, demoted, or fired." David Kahn criticized the NSA's tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress' blind faith in the agency's right-doing as shortsighted, and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power.
Edward Snowden's leaking of PRISM in 2013 caused the NSA to institute a "two-man rule" where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information.[tpl]cite news|author=Drew, Christopher and Somini Sengupta|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/technology/nsa-leak-puts-focus-on-system-administrators.html|title=N.S.A.

=====Polygraphing=====

The NSA conducts polygraph tests of employees. For new employees, the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the NSA and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&pg=PA359|author=Bauer, Craig P.|title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466561861|year=2013|page=359[/tpl] As part of the latter, historically EPQs or "embarrassing personal questions" about sexual behavior had been included in the NSA polygraph. The NSA also conducts five-year periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees, focusing on counterintelligence programs. In addition the NSA conducts aperiodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers; those who refuse to take them may receive "termination of employment", according to a 1982 memorandum from the director of the NSA.[tpl]cite book|author=Bamford|title=Body of Secrets|page=538[/tpl]
There are also "special access examination" polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas, and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior. NSA's brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours.[tpl]cite web|title=Your Polygraph Examination: An Important Appointment to Keep|url=http://www.nsa.gov/careers/_files/poly_brochure_final2.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 17, 2013[/tpl] A 1983 report of the Office of Technology Assessment stated that "It appears that the NSA Security Agency (and possibly CIA) use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se, but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions."[tpl]cite web|author=McCarthy, Susan|title=The truth about the polygraph|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/03/02/polygraph/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=July 5, 2013[/tpl] Sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder, rape, and selling of illegal drugs. Between 1974 and 1979, of the 20,511 job applicants who took polygraph tests, 695 (3.4%) confessed to previous felony crimes; almost all of those crimes had been undetected.
In 2010 the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process.[tpl]cite news|author=Nagesh, Gautham|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/102963-nsa-video-comes-clean-on-polygraph-use|title=NSA video tries to dispel fear about polygraph use during job interviews|work=The Hill|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=June 15, 2013[/tpl] The video, ten minutes long, is titled "The Truth About the Polygraph" and was posted to the website of the Defense Security Service. Jeff Stein of The Washington Post said that the video portrays "various applicants, or actors playing them -- it’s not clear -- describing everything bad they had heard about the test, the implication being that none of it is true."Stein, Jeff. "NSA lie detectors no sweat, video says." Washington Post. June 14, 2010. Retrieved July 5, 2013. AntiPolygraph.org argues that the NSA-produced video omits some information about the polygraph process; it produced a video responding to the NSA video. George Maschke, the founder of the website, accused the NSA polygraph video of being "Orwellian".
After Edward Snowden revealed his identity in 2013, the NSA began requiring polygraphing of employees once per quarter.Drezner, Daniel. "Tone-Deaf at the Listening Post." Foreign Policy. December 16, 2013. Retrieved March 1, 2014. "Snowden has also changed the way the NSA is doing business. Analysts have gone from being polygraphed once every five years to once every quarter."

====Arbitrary firing====

The number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized. When in 1964 the Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee, the Washington Post wrote: "This is the very definition of arbitrariness. It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself." Yet, the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority.

===Insignia and memorials===

The heraldic insignia of NSA consists of an eagle inside a circle, grasping a key in its talons. The eagle represents the agency's national mission. Its breast features a shield with bands of red and white, taken from the Great Seal of the United States and representing Congress. The key is taken from the emblem of Saint Peter and represents security.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/faqs/about_nsa.shtml#about9|title=Frequently Asked Questions About NSA: 9.

The NSA's flag consists of the agency's seal on a light blue background.
Crews associated with NSA missions have been involved in a number of dangerous and deadly situations.

The main NSA headquarters and operations building is what James Bamford, author of Body of Secrets, describes as "a modern boxy structure" that appears similar to "any stylish office building."Bamford, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, p. 488. "At the heart of the invisible city is NSA's massive Headquarters/Operations Building. With more than sixty-eight acres of floor space,..." and "Entrance is first made through the two-story Visitor Control Center, one..." The building is covered with one-way dark glass, which is lined with copper shielding in order to prevent espionage by trapping in signals and sounds. It contains [tpl]convert|3000000|sqft|sqm[/tpl], or more than [tpl]convert|68|acre|ha[/tpl], of floor space; Bamford said that the U.S. Capitol "could easily fit inside it four times over."
The facility has over 100 watchposts,Bamford, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, p. 488-489. "...one of more than 100 fixed watch posts within the secret city manned by the armed NSA police. It is here that clearances are checked and visitor badges are issued." one of them being the visitor control center, a two-story area that serves as the entrance. At the entrance, a white pentagonal structure,Bamford, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, p. 490. "And then there is the red badge—...and is normally worn by people working in the "Red Corridor"—the drugstore and other concession areas...Those with a red badge are forbidden to go anywhere near classified information and are restricted to a few corridors and administrative areas—the bank, the barbershop, the cafeteria, the credit union, the airline and entertainment ticket counters." and "Once inside the white, pentagonal Visitor Control Center, employees are greeted by a six-foot painting of the NSA seal..." visitor badges are issued to visitors and security clearances of employees are checked.Bamford, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, p. 489. "It is here that clearances are checked and visitor badges are issued." The visitor center includes a painting of the NSA seal. 
The OPS2A building, the tallest building in the NSA complex and the location of much of the agency's operations directorate, is accessible from the visitor center. Bamford described it as a "dark glass Rubik's Cube".Bamford, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, p. 491. "From the Visitor Control Center one enters the eleven-story,  million OPS2A, the tallest building in the City. Shaped like a dark glass Rubik's Cube, the building houses much of NSA's Operations Directorate, which is responsible for processing the ocean of intercepts and prying open the complex cipher systems." The facility's "red corridor" houses non-security operations such as concessions and the drug store. The name refers to the "red badge" which is worn by someone without a security clearance. The NSA headquarters includes a cafeteria, a credit union, ticket counters for airlines and entertainment, a barbershop, and a bank.

====Power consumption====

Following a major power outage in 2000, in 2003 and in follow-ups through 2007, The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at Fort Meade to support the amount of equipment being installed. This problem was apparently recognized in the 1990s but not made a priority, and "now the agency's ability to keep its operations going is threatened."[tpl]cite news|author=Sabar, Ariel|title=NSA still subject to electronic failure|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-01-02/news/0301020300_1_outages-electrical-and-computer-agency|date=January 2, 2003[/tpl] and "Agency officials anticipated the problem nearly a decade ago as they looked ahead at the technology needs of the agency, sources said, but it was never made a priority, and now the agency's ability to keep its operations going is threatened." and "The NSA is Baltimore Gas & Electric's largest customer, using as much electricity as the city of Annapolis, according to James Bamford...." in [tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-08-06/news/0608060158_1_agency-power-surges-nsa|date=August 6, 2006|author=Gorman, Siobhan|title=NSA risking electrical overload[/tpl] and [tpl]cite news|author=Gorman, Siobhan|title=NSA electricity crisis gets Senate scrutiny|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-01-26/news/0701260231_1_electricity-rockefeller-senate-intelligence-committee|date=January 26, 2007[/tpl] and [tpl]cite news|author=Gorman, Siobhan|title=Power supply still a vexation for the NSA|date=June 24, 2007|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-06-24/news/0706240110_1_national-security-agency-classified-electricity|work=The Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl]

====History of headquarters====

When the agency was established, its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the Naval Security Station in Washington, D.C.. The COMINT functions were located in Arlington Hall in Northern Virginia, which served as the headquarters of the U.S. Army's cryptographic operations.[tpl]cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|format=PDF|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|accessdate=July 6, 2013|page=15[/tpl] Because the Soviet Union had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded, the federal government wanted to move several agencies, including the AFSA/NSA. A planning committee considered Fort Knox, but Fort Meade, Maryland, was ultimately chosen as NSA headquarters because it was far enough away from Washington, D.C. in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families.
Construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at Ft. Meade in the late 1950s, which they soon outgrew.[tpl]cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|format=PDF|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|accessdate=July 6, 2013|page=10[/tpl] In 1963 the new headquarters building, nine stories tall, opened.

==Operations==

===Mission===

NSA's eavesdropping mission includes radio broadcasting, both from various organizations and individuals, the Internet, telephone calls, and other intercepted forms of communication. Its secure communications mission includes military, diplomatic, and all other sensitive, confidential or secret government communications.[tpl]cite news|author=Bamford, James|title=The Agency That Could Be Big Brother|date=December 25, 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25bamford.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 11, 2005[/tpl]
According to the Washington Post, "every day, collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, phone calls and other types of communications. The NSA sorts a fraction of those into 70 separate databases."Priest, Dana and Arkin, William, A hidden world, growing beyond control, Washington Post
Because of its listening task, NSA/CSS has been heavily involved in cryptanalytic research, continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II codes and ciphers (see, for instance, Purple, Venona project, and JN-25).
In 2004, NSA Central Security Service and the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agreed to expand NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program.[tpl]cite press release|title=National Security Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Form New Partnership to Increase National Focus on Cyber Security Education|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2004/nsa_dhs_new_partnership.shtml|publisher=NSA Public and Media Affairs|accessdate=July 4, 2008| date=April 22, 2004[/tpl]

===Echelon===

Echelon was created in the incubator of the Cold War.Hager 1996, p. 55 Today it is a legacy system, and several NSA stations are closing.
NSA/CSS, in combination with the equivalent agencies in the United Kingdom (Government Communications Headquarters), Canada (Communications Security Establishment), Australia (Defence Signals Directorate), and New Zealand (Government Communications Security Bureau), otherwise known as the UKUSA group,Richelson, Jeffrey T.; Ball, Desmond (1985). The Ties That Bind: Intelligence Cooperation Between the UKUSA Countries. London: Allen & Unwin. ISBN 0-04-327092-1 was reported to be in command of the operation of the so-called Echelon system. Its capabilities were suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world's transmitted civilian telephone, fax and data traffic.Patrick S. Poole, Echelon: America's Secret Global Surveillance Network (Washington, D.C.: Free Congress Foundation, October 1998)
During the early 1970s, the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at Menwith Hill.Echelon", 60 Minutes, February 27, 2000 Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell reported in 1988 on the Echelon surveillance program, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence SIGINT, and detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked.  In November 3, 1999 the BBC reported that they had confirmation from the Australian Government of the existence of a powerful "global spying network" code-named Echelon, that could "eavesdrop on every single phone call, fax or e-mail, anywhere on the planet" with Britain and the United States as the chief protagonists. They confirmed that Menwith Hill was "linked directly to the headquarters of the US National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade in Maryland".[tpl]cite news|first=Andrew|last=Bomford|date=November 3, 1999|title=Echelon spy network revealed|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/503224.stm|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl]

===Encryption===

In 2013, reporters uncovered a secret memo that claims the NSA created and pushed for the adoption of encryption standards that contained built-in vulnerabilities in 2006 to the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the International Organization for Standardization (aka ISO).

==Domestic activity==

NSA's mission, as set forth in Executive Order 12333, is to collect information that constitutes "foreign intelligence or counterintelligence" while not "acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons". NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the USA, while confining its own activities within the USA to the embassies and missions of foreign nations.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
NSA's domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for example held in October 2011, citing multiple Supreme Court precedents, that the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because "a person's private communications are akin to personal papers."[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/fisc_opinion_-_unconstitutional_surveillance_0.pdf|pages=73–74|date=3 October 2011|author=John D Bates|title=redacted[/tpl] However, these protections do not apply to non-U.S. persons located outside of U.S. borders, so the NSA's foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U.S. law.David Alan Jordan. Decrypting the Fourth Amendment: Warrantless NSA Surveillance and the Enhanced Expectation of Privacy Provided by Encrypted Voice over Internet Protocol. Boston College Law Review. May 2006. Last access date January 23, 2007  The specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), which does not extend protection to non-U.S. citizens located outside of U.S. territory.
These activities, especially the publicly acknowledged domestic telephone tapping and call database programs, have prompted questions about the extent of the NSA's activities and concerns about threats to privacy and the rule of law.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===George W. Bush administration===

====Warrantless wiretaps====

On December 16, 2005, The New York Times reported that, under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W. Bush, the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).James Risen & Eric Lichtblau (December 16, 2005), Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts, New York Times
One such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion. Conversations of citizens of the U.S. were intercepted, along with those of other nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/index2.html#doc7 |title=Gwu.edu |publisher=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has executive authority to order such action, arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President's Constitutional powers. In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the Authorization for Use of Military Force, although the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ACLU v. NSA, U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor concluded that NSA's warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional. On July 6, 2007 the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/nsa/aclunsa70607opn.pdf |title=6th Circuit Court of Appeals Decision |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
On January 17, 2006, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit, CCR v. Bush, against the George W. Bush Presidency.

====Data mining====

NSA was reported in 2008 to use its computing capability to analyze "transactional" data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies, which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities. As part of this effort, NSA now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic email data, web addresses from Internet searches, bank transfers, credit-card transactions, travel records, and telephone data, according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The sender, recipient, and subject line of emails can be included, but the content of the messages or of phone calls are not.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120511973377523845.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124141023/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120511973377523845.html |archivedate=2009-01-24 |title=NSA's Domestic Spying Grows As Agency Sweeps Up Data |first=Siobahn|last=Gorman|publisher=The Wall Street Journal Online|date=March 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014[/tpl]

====Illegally obtained evidence====

In August 2013 it was revealed that a 2005 IRS training document showed that NSA intelligence intercepts and wiretaps, both foreign and domestic, were being supplied to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of US citizens. Law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by re-obtaining the same evidence by other means.John Shiffman and Kristina Cooke (August 5, 2013) Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans.

==Role in scientific research and development==

NSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman's directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the export of cryptography in the United States. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.
Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications hardware and software, production of dedicated semiconductors (at the Ft. Meade chip fabrication plant), and advanced cryptography research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.[tpl]cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013[/tpl]

===Data Encryption Standard===

NSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public block cipher algorithm used by the U.S. government and banking community. During the development of DES by IBM in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component—the so-called S-boxes—had been altered to insert a "backdoor" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis, a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s, but which was known to the IBM DES team. 
The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed NSA's involvement, and concluded that while the agency had provided some assistance, it had not tampered with the design.[tpl]cite book|first1=D.W.|last1=Davies|author2=W.L. Price|title=Security for computer networks, 2nd ed.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1989[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Robert Sugarman (editor)|title=On foiling computer crime|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=July 1979|publisher=IEEE[/tpl] In late 2009 NSA declassified information stating that "NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key."[tpl]cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/0001/nsa-meyer.htm|title=American Cryptology during the Cold War, 1945–1989.Book III: Retrenchment and Reform, 1972–1980, page 232|author=Thomas R.

===Clipper chip===

Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps, NSA proposed the concept of key escrow in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials.[tpl]cite journal|author=Baker, Stewart A.|title= Don't Worry Be Happy |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.06/nsa.clipper_pr.html|publisher=Condé Nast|journal=Wired|issue=2.06|accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl] The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere.[tpl]cite web|title=Key Escrow, Key Recovery, Trusted Third Parties & Govt.

===SHA===

The widely used SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash functions were designed by NSA. SHA-1 is a slight modification of the weaker SHA-0 algorithm, also designed by NSA in 1993. This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later, with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security. An attack for SHA-0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers. Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA-1, NIST deprecates its use for digital signatures, and approves only the newer SHA-2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on.Draft NIST SP 800-131, June 2010.
A new hash standard, SHA-3, has recently been selected through the competition concluded October 2, 2012 with the selection of Keccak as the algorithm. The process to select SHA-3 was similar to the one held in choosing the AES, but some doubts have been cast over it,[tpl]cite web|last=Lorenzo |first=Joseph |url=https://www.cdt.org/blogs/joseph-lorenzo-hall/2409-nist-sha-3 |title=What the heck is going on with NIST’s cryptographic standard, SHA-3? | Center for Democracy & Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marshray/status/380800393367674880 |title=Twitter / marshray: Believe it or not, NIST is |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] since fundamental modifications have been made to Keccac in order to turn it into a standard.[tpl]cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzRYQSHuuMYOQXdHWkRiZXlURVE/ |title=kelsey-invited-ches-0820.pdf - Google Drive |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] These changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm.

===Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator===

NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called Dual_EC_DRBG in the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2007 guidelines. This led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that pseudo random number generator.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115 |title=Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard? |first=Bruce |last=Schneier|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|publisher=Wired News|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=July 4, 2008[/tpl]

===Academic research===

NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix MDA904, resulting in over 3,000 papers (as of 2007-10-11). NSA/CSS has, at times, attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography; for example, the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so. In response to a FOIA lawsuit, in 2013 the NSA released the 643-page research paper titled, "Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf |title=Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research |author=Robyn Winder and Charlie Speight |work=National Security Agency Public Information |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] " written and compiled by NSA employees to assist other NSA workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public Internet.

===Patents===

NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office under gag order. Unlike normal patents, these are not revealed to the public and do not expire. However, if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party, they will reveal NSA's patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date.[tpl]cite book|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography, Second Edition|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1996|pages=609–610|isbn=0-471-11709-9[/tpl]
