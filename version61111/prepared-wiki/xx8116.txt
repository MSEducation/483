However, there are prior references to various similar cocktail recipes called "Manhattan" and served in the Manhattan area.  By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |title=The Manhattan project: A bartender spills his secrets on the king of cocktails |first=Gary |last=Regan |date=September 21, 2007|accessdate=2007-09-21|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/21/WI1ORSF9C.DTL[/tpl]
An early record of the cocktail can be found in William Schmidt's "The Flowing Bowl", published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (gomme syrup), 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, 2/3 portion of whiskey and 1/3 portion of vermouth.
The same cocktail appears listed as a "Tennessee Cocktail" in Shake 'em Up! by V. Elliott and P. Strong, copyright 1930 (p. 39): "Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously."

==Traditions==

On the small North Frisian island of Föhr, the Manhattan cocktail is a standard drink at almost every cafe restaurant, and "get together" of locals.Essen und Trinken from Föhr-Digital.de The story goes, that many of the people of Föhr immigrated to Manhattan during deep sea fishing trips, took a liking to the drink, and brought it back to Föhr with them. The drink is usually mixed 1 part (the 'perfect' is said to be half white/half red) vermouth to 2 parts whiskey, with a dash of bitters, served ice cold, in an ice cold glass, or with ice and a cherry garnish.
There is a mistaken belief that Manhattans are always stirred and never shaken. Traditions for both preparations go back to the late 1800s.[ref]

==Variations==

Traditional views insist that a Manhattan be made with American rye whiskey. However, more often than not, it is made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. The Manhattan is subject to considerable variation and innovation, and is often a way for the best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth on the surface of the drink.  Angostura are the classic bitters, but orange bitters, Peychaud's Bitters, may be used, or the Manhattan can be made without any bitters at all;  using Fernet-Branca yields what is called a [tpl]visible anchor|Fanciulli[/tpl] cocktail. Some make their own bitters and syrups, substitute comparable digestifs in place of vermouth, specialize in local or rare whiskeys, or use other exotic ingredients. A lemon peel may be used as garnish.  Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color.
Originally, bitters were considered an integral part of any cocktail, as the ingredient that differentiated a cocktail from a sling.[tpl]cite news |title=The Origin of Cocktails |first=Steve |last=Levin |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06132/689498-294.stm |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] Over time, those definitions of cocktail and sling have become archaic, as sling has fallen out of general use (other than in certain drink names), and cocktail can mean any drink that resembles a martini, or simply any mixed drink.
The following are other variations on the classic Manhattan:
