He made more than 300 appearances in the Football League playing for Chelsea, Southend United, Aston Villa and Sheffield United,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/chicohamilton.html |title=Chico Hamilton |work=UK A–Z Transfers |publisher=Neil Brown |accessdate=8 October 2009[/tpl] and more than 100 in the North American Soccer League for Minnesota Kicks and San Jose Earthquakes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/H/Hamilton.Ian.htm |title=Ian "Chico" Hamilton |work=NASL Jerseys |publisher=Dave Morrison |accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl] He was nicknamed "Chico" after the jazz drummer.
Hamilton joined Chelsea as a junior and became the Stamford Bridge club's youngest ever player and goalscorer at 16 years, 138 days when he scored against Tottenham Hotspur on his debut, on 18 March 1967, a feat which earned comparisons with another famous Chelsea striker who also scored on his debut against Spurs – Jimmy Greaves.[tpl]cite news |title=Master And Pupil Find Scoring Touch |newspaper=The Times |date=20 March 1967 |page=9[/tpl] Thereafter he played only four more first-team games for Chelsea, spending the 1968–69 season with Southend United before moving to Aston Villa in 1968.
At Villa he carved out a long career as a midfielder, helping the club win the Third Division title in 1972, and playing in two League Cup finals – they lost in 1971 and won in 1975.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engleagcuphistfinal.html |title=England – League Cup Finals 1961–2001 |publisher=RSSSF |date=25 February 2001 |first=Didier |last=Fort |accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl] After two seasons with Sheffield United, Hamilton became one of many British footballers who ended their careers in the North American Soccer League, where he played for Minnesota Kicks and San Jose Earthquakes.
After he finished his professional career, he spent 17 years as boys' soccer coach at Thomas Worthington High School, in Worthington, Ohio,[tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CPDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F803506C6EE2B1A&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Worthington Halts Walsh's Bid To Repeat As State Champ |newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer |publisher=NewsBank |format=reprint |date=10 November 1991 |first=Mike |last=Peticca |accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10DD4041CADD95F0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Warriors End Worthington's 43-Game Streak – Boys Soccer |newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch |publisher=NewsBank |format=reprint |date=7 November 1999 |first=Packy |last=Moran |accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl] returning after a seven-year gap to coach girls' soccer.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thisweeknews.com/live/contentbe/EPIC_shim.php?story=thisweeknews/082406/Worthington/Sports/082406-Sports-213255.html |title=Thomas girls have veteran midfield |newspaper=ThisWeek Community Newspapers |first=Paul |last=Batterson |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2009[/tpl]
