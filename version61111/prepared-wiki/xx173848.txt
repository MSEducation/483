==Development==

Originally developed by G & A Aircraft with the co-operation of the United States Army Air Forces' Air Technical Service Command, the G & A Model 45B (designated XR-9 Rotocycle by the Army)"Short Hop Helicopter".  Popular Science, April 1946. was a design for a single-seat helicopter of pod-and-boom configuration.Andrade 1979,  p. 171. It had a fixed tri-cycle landing gear and three-bladed main and tail rotors. Power would have been supplied by a 126 hp (94 kW) Avco Lycoming XO-290-5 engine. The Model 45C (XR-9A) was the same helicopter with a two-bladed rotor. Neither of the two helicopters were built.  G & A Aircraft was purchased by Firestone in 1943,Merriam 2002, p. 64
and was renamed the Firestone Aircraft Company in 1946.Lambermont 1958
A revised two-seat design the revised Model 45C (or XR-9B) was built with a three-bladed main rotor and two-seat in tandem. The first aircraft procured by the Army Air Forces in 1946, it was powered by an Avco Lycoming O-290-7 engine and first flew in March of that year. 
A civil version, the Model 45D was also built and flown, in anticipation of a postwar boom in aircraft sales. This differed in having the two occupants side-by-side instead of Tandem as in the 45C, and was equipped with a [tpl]convert|150|hp[/tpl] Lycoming engine. The prototype was demonstrated at the 1946 Cleveland National Air Races.
