Duke University Medical Center Patient Rapid Transit or  Personnel Rapid Transit (PRT) was an automated people mover system located at the Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hr.duke.edu/jobs/descr_campus/select.php?ID=352|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hr.duke.edu/jobs/descr_campus/select.php?ID=352|title=PRT Supervisor, Senior|work=Duke University Job Description|publisher=Duke University Human Resources|date=2007-12-01|accessdate=2009-10-17|archivedate=2007-07-09|quote=... Personnel Rapid Transit system utilized to transport patients, employees, visitors and supplies between Duke Hospital North, Duke Hospital South and Parking Garage II.[/tpl]  The system was in operation from 1979 to 2009, and service is now discontinued.  The PRT was notable for having cars propelled by a linear induction motor and suspended on a bed of compressed air[tpl]cite journal|work=Popular Science|date=December 1978|page=64|volume= 213|number=No. 6|issn=0161-7370|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|title=Air-cusion people mover|first=Laura|last=Wessner|quote=three 22-passenger ... no rotating parts ... a linear-induction motor propels the cars ... ice, rain and snow don't limit performance ... the cars can move sideways[/tpl] similar to a hovercraft.  Uniquely, the cars could move sidewards, as well as backwards and forwards.
The proclaimed "horizontal elevator" system was designed by Otis Elevator Company during the 1970s, installed beginning in 1977 and opened on December 8, 1979.  The people mover was provided with three driverless Otis Hovair vehicles[tpl]cite book|title=Horizontal elevators and peoplemovers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S7KQ-SOB8_4C&pg=PA130|work=Future transport in cities|first=Brian|last=Richards|page=130|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-26142-5|accessdate=2009-10-17|quote=developed by Otis ... their first vehicle was called Hovair[/tpl] which have a hinged-window at each end for emergency exit.[tpl]cite journal|last=Peacock|first=Richard D.|title=Fire Safety Guidelines for Vehicles in a Downtown People Mover System|date=Jan 1979|issue=NBSIR 78-1586|publisher=Center for Fire Research, National Engineering Laboratory, National Bureau of Standards|location=Washington[/tpl]
The concrete guideway was built as double track, connecting the three stations at Duke South, Duke North and Parking Garage II via a tunnel under Erwin Road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://urology.surgery.duke.edu/modules/div_urol_pc/index.php?id=3|title=Clinic Parking Information|work=Pediatric Urologic Care|publisher=Duke University Division of Urology|accessdate=2009-10-17|quote=a walkway and monorail beneath Erwin Road from the garage to Duke Hospital[/tpl]  

==Decommissioning==

The 0.25-mile (The remaining section connecting Duke Parking Garage II with Duke North Hospital was closed between late 2008 and early 2009.  The doorway for the station at Parking Garage II was permanently boarded up and turned into a wall.  The leftover tracks and infrastructure have since been largely removed to make way for new construction.

==Technology==

The Hovair technology has been installed around the world. Later variants have used the same air-cushion technology, but propelled the vehicles by wire cable, such as at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.
