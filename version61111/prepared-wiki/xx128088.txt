Antun Sorkočević (also Antonio Sorgo) (December 25, 1775 – February 14, 1841), was a diplomat, writer, composer and member of Ragusan nobility (chevalier des odres de Saint Maurice et de Saint Lazare demeurant a Paris). He was Medo Pucić's cousin, and a good friend of Marko Bruerović.
Sorkočević was born in Dubrovnik.  His father was Luka Sorkočević. Like his father he was also composer. Antun studied in Rome, and after 1806 led the Republic of Ragusa's diplomatic representation in Paris where he was the last ambassador of the Republic in France, where he spent 35 years of his life. In Paris he wrote Postanak i propast Republike Dubrovačke (The Rise and Fall of the Republic of Dubrovnik) in which he proposed that Dubrovnik should join Boka Kotorska, Montenegro and Serbia to make it one nation. The pamphlet was banned in Austria. He also put forth the idea of creating a separate region comprising the Republic and Boka Kotorska under the Austrian Empire after French occupation of these lands (Illyrian provinces).
Author of numerous publications, he became a member of Académie Celtique in 1806 and the Société des Antiquaries in 1828. Among other books he published such as Mémoire sur la langue et les moeurs des peuples slaves, Fragments sur l'histoire et la littérature de la République de Raguse et sur la langue slave, Fragmenti o političkoj i književnoj povijesti stare Dubrovačke republike i o slavenskom jeziku. In 1838 he translated Ivan Gundulić's Osman into French and became the author of the earliest  piano sonatas. He died in Paris.
His collection also contains abundant information relevant to the research of the two composers' (Luka and Antun Sorkočević) life and work. Antun wrote four symphonies and numerous pieces for chamber music.
