CATEGORIES: American variety radio programs, 1940s American radio programs

The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air, broadcast on CBS Radio during the 1930s, attempted to bring the success of Florenz Ziegfeld's stage shows to the new medium of radio.
Eddie Dowling hosted the musical variety format. Sponsored by Chrysler Motors, the half-hour series aired Sunday evenings from April 3 to June 26, 1932, moving April 24 from 8:30pm ET to 10:30pm ET. 
With Al Goodman leading the orchestra, the line-up of guests included Fanny Brice, Helen Morgan, Jack Pearl, Will Rogers, and Ziegfeld himself. Pearl introduced his "Baron Munchausen" character.
Ziegfeld died on July 22, 1932, but the series returned from February 22 to June 6, 1936, serving as a tribute to the showman. Goodman returned as orchestra leader, and Brice appeared in the sketch series that eventually expanded into The Baby Snooks Show. Other guests included Patty Chapin, James Melton, and Benny Fields.
