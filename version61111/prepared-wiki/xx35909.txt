Other features of the park are Beaver Lake, a small man-made lake; a short ski slope; cross-country skiing trails; a sculpture garden; and Smith House, an interpretive centre. At the foot of the hill, overlooking Park Avenue, the park features George-Étienne Cartier Monument, home to the Tam Tams, and a gazebo which has been recently named in honour of Mordecai Richler.[tpl]cite news|last=Peritz|first=Ingrid|title=Mordecai Richler to be honoured with gazebo on Mount Royal|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec/mordecai-richler-to-be-honoured-with-gazebo-on-mount-royal/article2073645/|accessdate=25 December 2011|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=24 June 2011[/tpl] 
The lush forest was badly damaged both by mayor Drapeau’s morality cuts (to remove any opportunity for people to have sex in the bushes) of the mid-1950s and by the Ice Storm of 1998, but has since largely recovered. The forest is a green jewel rising above downtown Montreal, and is known for its beautiful autumn foliage as well as extensive hiking and cross-country ski trails. Biking is restricted to the main gravel roads.
From 1885 to 1920, the Mount Royal Funicular Railway brought sightseers to its peak.[tpl]cite news |first=Christopher |last=DeWolf |title=Riding the Rails Up Mount Royal |url=http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/2008/01/15/riding-the-rails-up-mount-royal/ |work=URBANPHOTO |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/VIEW-3024&section=196?Lang=1&accessnumber=VIEW-3024&section=196 |title=Mount Royal Funicular Railway, Montreal, QC, about 1900 |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Wm.

The park, cemeteries, and several adjacent parks and institutions have been combined in the Arrondissement historique et naturel du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Natural and Historical District) by the government of Québec, in order to legally protect the rich cultural and natural heritage of this region. It is the only place in Québec to have the combined status of an arrondissement naturel and arrondissement historique.

===Wintertime===

Mount Royal Park currently hosts a tubing and toboganning run on one of the former alpine ski slopes,Community Walk, "Parc du Mont Royal" (accessed 31 March 2010) as well as 7 groomed cross-country ski and snowshoe trails which total 18 km; equipment rental is available onsite.Canada Trails, "Cross Country Skiing in Quebec"(accessed 31 March 2010)Bonjour Quebec,"Mount Royal Park" (accessed 31 March 2010)
The former alpine ski slope, currently used for toboganning, featured a T-bar and a 100-foot drop. Mechanical lift devices were first installed in Mount Royal Park in 1945.The Gazette (Montreal),"Mount Royal May Have Ski Tows; Heavy Snows Herald Early Season", Bill Weintraub, 29 December 1944 (accessed 31 MArch 2010)  In the 1940s, there were two and a half miles of ski slopes available.New York Times, "Ski Slopes and Trails",Frank Elkins, 7 December 1948 A ski shop was first installed in the park in 1938.The Gazette (Montreal),"Mount Royal Ski", Stan Helleur, 19 January 1940 (accessed 31 March 2010) Prior to that, in the 1920s, one of the best ski jumps in Canada was the one on Mount Royal, near Cote des Neiges.The Daily Times, "Ski Jumper Leaving Take Off For Long Flight Down Mount Royal", 15 January 1920 (accessed 31 March 2010) 
Founded in 1840, the now-defunct Montreal Snow Shoe Club, with members drawn from some of Montréal's  prominent businessmen, would meet each week during the winter at nightfall on Sherbrooke Street near McGill College Avenue, to snowshoe through Mont Royal Park, lit by torchlight. Around 1870, club members began wearing blue tuques on their outings. Recently, the tradition has been revived as the Tuques Bleues Celebration by the Les amis de la montagne, a charitable organization that works to protect and preserve the park.[tpl]cite web|title=A Short History of the Tuques Bleues|url=http://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/news-and-events/tuques-bleues-celebration.sn|work=Les amis de la montagne|accessdate=8 January 2012[/tpl]

===Tam-Tams===

In the summer time, Mount Royal hosts a popular activity known as the "Tam Tam Jam", whereby a number of Montrealers and visitors play hand drums ("tam-tams" in French) such as djembes on the east slope of the mountain, at the George-Étienne Cartier Monument. The Sunday gatherings attract people of various backgrounds, and often dozens of tam-tam players perform their art at the same time, encouraging others to dance. In addition, many children and adults participate in a continuous  battle with foam-padded weapons.[tpl]cite news |first=Christopher |last=DeWolf|title=Joining the medieval battle on Mount Royal |url=http://spacingmontreal.ca/?p=77 |work=Spacing Montreal |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2008 [/tpl]
The Tam-tams began in the late '70s with a workshop on African drumming at a jazz bar on Ontario Street.[tpl]cite news|first=Susan |last=Krashinsky |title=Turning the beat around |url=http://montrealmagazine.ca/MM/content/view/132/18/|work=Montréal Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2008 [/tpl] It is not organized by the municipal authorities. Despite initial resistance by participants, the city now intervenes in the event, restricting commercial activity to registered members in designated areas and assigning police and first aid technicians to ensure the safety of those present. Although initially controversial in light of the event's communal and countercultural vibe (and permissive attitude towards marijuana use) the police presence has not led to conflict.

===Jeanne Mance Park===

Facing the mountain across Parc Avenue is Jeanne-Mance Park (Parc Jeanne-Mance), formerly known as Fletcher's Field.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bootsnall.com/namericatravelguides/montreal/feb02wonder.shtml |title=Montreal's Eighth Wonder of the World |accessdate=19 February 2008 |last=Goldman |first=Norman |publisher=BootsnAll:The Ultimate Source for the Independent Traveller[/tpl] A popular recreational area, Jeanne Mance Park features an artificially surfaced field for soccer and football, tennis courts, two baseball diamonds, a kiddie pool, beach volleyball courts and a community composting facility. In the spring of 2009, a children's playground was abruptly demolished by city workers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/story_print.html?id=1555860|title=The curious case of the disappearing playground|last=Freed|first=Josh|date=2 May 2009|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The park had been the home of the transplanted Crystal Palace from 1878 to 1896, until it was destroyed by fire.

==Transmission tower==

The park is also home to the CBC's Mount Royal transmitter facility, which comprises two large buildings (one used primarily by the CBC and one used by the private television stations) and a very short (about [tpl]Convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) candelabra tower, from which nearly all of Montreal's television and FM radio stations  broadcast.  Because of the proximity of this tower to public areas of the park, in recent years significant concerns have been raised about radio-frequency radiation exposure; at several points formerly accessible to park users near the tower, radiation was found to be significantly higher than that permitted for the general public.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007|abbr=on[/tpl]

==Cemeteries==

There are two cemeteries in the area: Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery (Catholic), Mount Royal Cemetery (non-denominational but primarily Protestant, and including several small Jewish cemeteries) — all of which are now running out of space.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Johnston |title=Montreal's Mount Royal losing dead space |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=54f55347-2231-4368-8e14-c957dfef1baf&k=57292 |work=Montreal Gazette |publisher=Canwest |date=14 November 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2008 [/tpl] In 2008, the refusal of the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery to cede land that it uses as a depot blocked a planned expansion of the park.[tpl]cite news |first=Sara |last=Champagne |title=Le projet de grand parc bat de l'aile |curly=|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/regional/montreal/200812/18/01-811460-le-projet-de-grand-parc-bat-de-laile.php|work=La Presse|date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=25 December 2008|language=French[/tpl]

==Adjacent landmarks==

Outside the park, Mount Royal's slopes are also home to such Montréal landmarks as St. Joseph's Oratory, Canada's largest church; McGill University and its teaching hospitals, including the Royal Victoria Hospital and Montreal General Hospital; McGill's Molson Stadium, home to the CFL's Montreal Alouettes; the McTavish reservoir; Université de Montréal; the École Polytechnique de Montréal; the Îlot-Trafalgar-Gleneagles historic block;[tpl]cite web|title=L'Îlot-Trafalgar-Gleneagles|url=http://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/RPCQ/detailBien.do?methode=consulter&bienId=93402|work=Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=11 January 2012|language=French[/tpl] and some well-off residential neighbourhoods such as Upper Westmount and Upper Outremont.
