Cubillán played in Japan for the Hanshin Tigers of the Central League, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) from 2005 until 2007. He played using his first name "Darwin", because his last name Cubillán sounds like "Kubi yan" (クビやん) meaning "He is fired, isn't he?" in Japanese Kansai dialect, and "Darwin" has the same spelling as the last name of an English naturalist, Charles Darwin. In 2008, he signed with the SK Wyverns in South Korea, but was released during the season.
