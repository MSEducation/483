Safrole, also known as shikimol, is a phenylpropene. It is a colorless or slightly yellow oily liquid typically extracted from the root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil (although commercially available culinary sassafras oil is usually devoid of safrole due to a rule passed by the FDA in 1960), or is synthesized from catechol[tpl]cite journal|last=Perkin, William Henry; and Trikojus, Victor Martin|title=CCXII.—A synthesis of safrole and o-safrole|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1927|pages=1663-1666|doi=10.1039/JR9270001663|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1927/jr/jr9270001663#!divAbstract|accessdate=28 December 2013[/tpl] or other related methylenedioxy compounds.  It is the principal component of brown camphor oil, and is found in small amounts in a wide variety of plants, where it functions as a natural pesticide.

It has a characteristic "sweet-shop" aroma.
It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the fragrance piperonal via isosafrole, and the empathogenic/entactogenic drug MDMA.

==Carcinogenicity==

Safrole is regarded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  to be a weak carcinogen in rats.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00055-1 |title=Safrole-induced Oxidative Damage in the Liver of Sprague–Dawley Rats |year=1999 |last1=Liu |first1=T.Y |last2=Chen |first2=C.C |last3=Chen |first3=C.L |last4=Chi |first4=C.W |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=697–702 |pmid=10496370[/tpl] However, according to a 1977 study of the metabolites of safrole in both rats and humans, two carcinogenic metabolites of safrole found in the urine of rats, 1'-hydroxysafrole and 3'-hydroxyisosafrole, were not found in human urine.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0300-483X(77)90039-7 |title=Absorption, metabolism and excretion of safrole in the rat and man |year=1977 |last1=Benedetti |first1=M |last2=Malnoe |first2=A |last3=Broillet |first3=A |journal=Toxicology |volume=7 |pages=69–83 |pmid=14422 |issue=1[/tpl] The European Commission on Health and consumer protection assumes safrole to be genotoxic and carcinogenic.Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the safety of the presence of safrole (1-allyl-3,4- methylene dioxy benzene) in flavourings and other food ingredients with flavouring properties It occurs naturally in a variety of spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper and herbs such as basil. In that role, safrole, like many naturally occurring compounds, may have a small but measurable ability to induce cancer in rodents. Despite this, the effects in humans were estimated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to be similar to risks posed by breathing indoor air or drinking municipally supplied water.[tpl]cite web | title =  Ranking Possible Cancer Hazards on the HERP Index | url = http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cpdb/pdfs/herp.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-22[/tpl] In the United States, it was once widely used as a food additive in root beer, sassafras tea, and other common goods, but was banned by the FDA after its carcinogenicity in rats was discovered. Today, safrole is also banned for use in soap and perfumes by the International Fragrance Association.

==Use in MDMA manufacture==

Safrole is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.International Narcotics Control Board
Due to its role in the manufacture of MDMA, safrole and isosafrole, as well as piperonal, are Category I precursors under regulation No 273/2004 of the European Community.[tpl]cite EU law |type=Regulation (EC) |number=273 |year=2004 |date=18 February 2004 |title=Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on drug precursors |eurlextag=OJ:L:2004:047:0001:0010:EN:PDF[/tpl] In the United States, safrole is currently a List I chemical. 
The root bark of American sassafras contains a low percentage of steam-volatile oil, which is typically 75% safrole.The Merck Index, 13th edition, Merck & Co, Inc, Whitehorse Station, NJ, copyright 2001.  Attempts to refine safrole from sassafras bark are generally not economically viable due to low yield and high effort.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Demand for safrole is causing rapid and illicit harvesting of the Cinnamomum parthenoxylon tree in Southeast Asia, in particular the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia. However, it is not clear what proportion of illicitly harvested safrole is going toward MDMA production, as over 90% of the global safrole supply (about 2000 metric tons per year) is used to manufacture pesticides, fragrances, and other chemicals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15050 |title=Harvesting Trees to Make Ecstasy Drug |first1=Tom |last=Blickman |date=February 3, 2009 |work=The Irrawaddy[/tpl][tpl]cite book |chapterurl=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-479.html |chapter=Piper hispidinervum: A Sustainable Source of Safrole |last1=Rocha |first1=Sérgio F.R. |first2=Lin Chau |last2=Ming |year=1999 |editor1-first=Jules |editor1-last=Janick |title=Perspectives on new crops and new uses |publisher=ASHS Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia |pages=479–81 |isbn=978-0-9615027-0-6[/tpl] Sustainable harvesting of safrole is possible from leaves and stems of certain plants.
