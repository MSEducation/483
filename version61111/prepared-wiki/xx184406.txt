"They may call themselves folk musicians, but it is the strains of jazz, foreign scales and other unlikely influences that set The Unthanks apart from the rest of the Neo-folk movement."[/ref]

====Cruel Sister====

Originally an all-female band, Rachel Unthank and the Winterset made their debut performance at Towersey Village Festival in August 2004 and, on 11 May 2005, launched their debut album Cruel Sister at Holmfirth Folk Festival.Cruel Sister received support from a number of DJs on BBC Radio 2 and was subsequently awarded Folk Album of the Year by MOJO magazine.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2008/04/the_mojo_club_rachel_unthank_t.html|title=The MOJO Club: Rachel Unthank & The Winterset! |author=Ross Bennett |publisher= MOJO magazine|date= 3 April 2008|accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl]     
====The Bairns==== 
Their follow-up album, The Bairns, released on 28 August 2007,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/p39x|title= Folk song is all about connection and communication – gifts that are second nature... |author= Mel Ledgard |work= BBC Music, BBC website |date= 30 July 2008 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl] was nominated for the Best Album award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2008 and also nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize.

Reviewing The Bairns for BBC Music, Mel Ledgard described it as "an album with a cinematic quality, huge in dramatic atmosphere".

===The Unthanks===

====Here's the Tender Coming==== 
In 2009 the band became The Unthanks, and their manager Adrian McNally and his childhood friend Chris Price joined the group. Their third album (the first under The Unthanks moniker), Here's the Tender Coming, released on 14 September 2009, was Folk Album of the Year for The Guardian and also for MOJO magazine. Sid Smith, of BBC Music, described it as an "astonishing record", "beautiful”, “haunting”, and “beguiling".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fb9p|title= Here’s the Tender Coming raises the group’s standard higher still|author= Sid Smith |publisher= BBC Music, BBC website |date= 2 October 2009 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl] For The Guardian, Colin Irwin said: "This album may not be quite as bleak as The Bairns, and the sound is more sophisticated, but they still sound like nobody else... Tracks build slowly and mysteriously, but all are in service of the song. Their arrangement of the title track − a traditional song about the emotional devastation wrought by press gangs − brilliantly encapsulates the story's fraught desperation. Their version of Nobody Knew She Was There, one of Ewan MacColl's lesser-known songs about his mother, painstakingly paints a similarly dramatic backdrop with more atmospheric brass, and they put their own stamp on the Nic Jones classic, Annachie Gordon."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/sep/06/unthanks-here-s-the-tender-coming|title= The Unthanks: Here’s the Tender Coming|author= Colin Irwin |work= BBC Music, BBC website |date= 6 September 2009 |accessdate= 28 April 2011 |location=London[/tpl]
====Last==== 
Their fourth album, Last, was released on 14 March 2011, reaching number 40 in the UK albums chart, and was well received by the critics. Sid Smith, for BBC Music, said that "Proving once again that sad songs are very often the best, their fourth album is brimming with material that is as haunting as it is beautiful."[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fphf|title=Brimming with material that is as haunting as it is beautiful|author=Sid Smith  |work= BBC Music, BBC website |date= 3 March 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl] Robin Denselow, for The Guardian, described it as "a bold and highly original set".[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/10/the-unthanks-last-review|title= The Unthanks: Last - Review |author= Robin Denselow |work= The Guardian|location= London|date=10 March 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl] Thomas H Green of The Daily Telegraph said it was "string-laden and luscious but also delicate, wistful and melancholy".[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/8377086/The-Unthanks-Last-CD-review.html|title= 'Last' by The Unthanks' is luscious and delicate|author= Thomas H Green |work= The Daily Telegraph|location= London |date= 11 March 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl]
Writing in NME, Anthony Thornton said that the album "proves the mix of Rachel and Becky’s voices to be one of the true wonders of 21st-century music".[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-unthanks/11913 |title= The turning cogs below the surface of English folk|author= Anthony Thornton |work= NME |date= 16 March 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011 |authorlink= Anthony Thornton (writer)[/tpl] As well as traditional material, the album included a song written by band member Adrian McNally ("Last"), and versions of songs by Jon Redfern ("Give Away Your Heart"), Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan ("No One Knows I'm Gone"), King Crimson ("Starless")[tpl]cite web|url =http://www.themoodindicator.com/2011/04/unthanks-last-2011.html|title= The Unthanks – Last (2011)|publisher=The Mood Indicator |date=27 April 2011|accessdate= 29 May 2011[/tpl]"Perhaps the most surprising version on here is a cover of King Crimson's "Starless" from their 1974 album "Red" which is one of their greatest tracks but transformed on here from a song which in the primary version ends with a blistering sax jazz rock workout into in a slow ballad now based around trumpet and strings and half its original size. Rachel and Becky remain true to Robert Fripp's latent melody but infuse it with a vocal depth, which is astonishing." and Alex Glasgow ("Close the Coalhouse Door").
====The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & The Johnsons==== 
In a departure from their usual practice of showcasing material from their studio albums, the Unthanks performed two concerts at London's Union Chapel on 8 and 9 December 2010 consisting entirely of material written by Robert Wyatt and by Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons.[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-unthanks-play-robert-wyatt-and-antony-and-the-johnsons-union-chapel-islington-2158540.html|title= Ways to stay warm under the covers|author= Andy Gill |work= The Independent|location=London |date= 13 December 2010 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl] The concerts were recorded, and The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & The Johnsons, a live album based on these recordings, was released on 28 November 2011 to coincide with a UK tour. In a four-starred review, The Observer called the album "A triumphant excursion".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/20/unthanks-robert-wyatt-antony-johnsons?INTCMP=SRCH|title=The Unthanks: The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & the Johnsons – review|author=Neil Spencer |work=The Observer|location=London|date=20 November 2011|accessdate= 30 November 2011[/tpl]"...the Unthanks' intertwining voices – cadent, mournful, tender – never falter and the between-songs banter ("There will be clog dancing!") grounds an ethereal atmosphere."

====The Unthanks with Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band====

In July 2011, starting with concerts at Durham Cathedral and at London's Barbican Hall, they began a UK tour with the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band, performing new brass arrangements of songs from all four Unthanks albums, as well as new material.[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/08/the-unthanks-brass-band?INTCMP=SRCH|title=The Unthanks get tender with brass|author=Adrian McNally |work=The Guardian|location=London|date=8 September 2011|accessdate= 28 September 2011[/tpl] A live album, based on these concerts, was released in July 2012. In a four-starred review, Robin Denselow of The Guardian described the album as The Unthanks' boldest experiment yet.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/26/unthanks-brighouse-rastrick-brass-diversions-review|title=The Unthanks with Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band: Diversions Vol 2 – review|author=Robin Denselow |work= The Guardian|location=London|date=26 July 2012 |accessdate= 31 July 2012[/tpl] Martin Townsend in the Daily Express said it was "easily the band’s best and most mature album to date".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/335904/CD-Review-The-Unthanks-Diversions-Vol-2|title=CD Review: The Unthanks, Diversions Vol 2|author=Martin Townsend |work= Daily Express |location=London|date=26 July 2012 |accessdate= 15 August 2012[/tpl] The album is designated Vol. 2 in The Unthanks' Diversions series and follows on from Vol. 1 (The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & The Johnsons).

====Songs from the Shipyards====

Songs from the Shipyards, Vol. 3 in The Unthanks' Diversions series, was released in November 2012. This is a studio-recorded album of songs from a soundtrack, compiled by The Unthanks, which was first performed live in February 2011 at Newcastle upon Tyne’s Tyneside Cinema to accompany the showing of a documentary film by Richard Fenwick about the history of shipbuilding on the Tyne, Wear and Tees.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.journallive.co.uk/culture-newcastle/music-in-newcastle/2011/02/24/unthanks-soundtrack-brings-life-to-shipyards-film-61634-28224400/#ixzz1KpAcM2cP|title= Unthanks soundtrack brings life to shipyards film |author= Tamsin Lewis |publisher= The Journal |location= Newcastle-upon-Tyne|date= 24 February 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/27/unthanks-folk-northumberland-interview|title= The Unthanks: 'We're miserable buggers and not afraid of it'|author= Tim Adams |work= The Observer |location= London|date= 27 February 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/front_page/newsid_9405000/9405412.stm |title= The Unthanks celebrate Tyneside shipbuilding heritage|author= Jeff Brown |publisher= BBC website |date= 23 February 2011 |accessdate= 20 May 2011[/tpl] The album includes Elvis Costello's "Shipbuilding" and songs by Graeme Miles, Alex Glasgow, Archie Fisher, John Tams, Peter Bellamy and Jez Lowe, plus a centrepiece track, "The Romantic Tees", written by Adrian McNally. The Observer's Neil Spencer described it as "a stark creation, using little more than piano, violin and voices" but said that its minimalism "lends poignancy to songs and poetry narrating the glory and grime of a vanished era".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/28/the-unthanks-songs-from-shipyards-review | title=The Unthanks: Songs from the Shipyards – review | work=The Observer | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=10 November 2012 | author=Neil Spencer | location=London[/tpl]
