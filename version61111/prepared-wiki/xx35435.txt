Hattah-Kulkyne is a national park in Victoria, Australia, 417Â km northwest of Melbourne.  The nearest regional centre is Mildura.  It is a popular destination for bushwalkers and school camping trips.

==Description==

The park is in the Murray Mallee region, famous for its red dirt and semi-arid shrub-like vegetation, mainly eucalypts.  The park is also on the north by the Murray River.  There are several lakes in the area, the largest of which is Lake Hattah.  During the dry season most of the lakes and their streams dry out completely.   Although there are limited road and tracks, there are several major high tension power and telegraph lines that run through or near the park, around which large areas are cleared.

==Important Bird Area==

Over 200 bird species have been recorded in the park, which forms part of the Murray-Sunset, Hattah and Annuello Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because it contains mallee habitat supporting a suite of threatened mallee bird, including the Malleefowl, Black-eared Miner and Mallee Emu-wren.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Murray-Sunset, Hattah and Annuello |accessdate=2011-08-25 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
