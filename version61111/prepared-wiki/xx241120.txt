[[South Atlantic Gyre]]

CATEGORIES: Atlantic Ocean, Physical oceanography, Oceanic gyres

The South Atlantic Gyre is the subtropical gyre in the south Atlantic Ocean. In the southern portion of the gyre, northwesterly (or southeastward-flowing) winds drive eastward-flowing currents that are difficult to distinguish from the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.Guhin, Scott, et al. "The South Atlantic Current." Ocean Surface Currents. NOPP; CIMAS; RSMAS; HYCOM consortium, 2003. Web. 21 Oct. 2009.  Like other oceanic gyres, it collects vast amounts of floating debris.[tpl]cite web|last=National Geographic Endeavour|title=At Sea, South Atlantic Gyre (March 18, 2004)|url=http://www.expeditions.com/daily-expedition-reports/140300/ocean-voyages/|work=Daily Expedition Report|publisher=Lindblad Expeditions - National Geographic|accessdate=5 April 2014[/tpl]  

==Southern boundary==

South of this gyre is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This current flows from West to East around Antarctica. Another name for this current is the West Wind Drift. This current allows Antarctica to maintain its huge ice sheet by keeping warm ocean waters away. At approximately 125Sv, this current is the largest ocean current.Smith, Ryan, et al. "The Antarctic CP Current." Ocean Surface Currents. NOPP; CIMAS; RSMAS; HYCOM consortium, n.d. Web. 21 Oct. 2009. 

==Western boundary==

It flows south along the Brazilian coast to the Rio de la Plata.  The current is considerably weaker than its North Atlantic counterpart, the Gulf Stream.Bischof, Barbie, et al. "The Brazil Current."
