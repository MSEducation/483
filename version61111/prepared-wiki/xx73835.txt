Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis. It is commonly abbreviated as "EtBr", which is also an abbreviation for bromoethane.  When exposed to ultraviolet light, it will fluoresce with an orange colour, intensifying almost 20-fold after binding to DNA. Under the name homidium, it has been commonly used since the 1950s in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle, a disease caused by trypanosomes.[tpl]cite journal | author=Stevenson P, Sones KR, Gicheru MM, Mwangi EK. | title=Comparison of isometamidium chloride and homidium bromide as prophylactic drugs for trypanosomiasis in cattle at Nguruman, Kenya.  | journal= Acta Trop. | year=1995 | pages=257–258 | volume=59 | issue=2 | pmid=7676909 | doi=10.1016/0001-706X(94)00080-K[/tpl]  The high incidence of antibiotic resistance makes this treatment impractical in some areas, where the related isometamidium chloride is used instead.  Ethidium bromide may be a mutagen, a carcinogen, or a teratogen, although this depends on the organism exposed and the circumstances of exposure.

==Structure, chemistry, fluorescence==

As with most fluorescent compounds, ethidium bromide is aromatic. Its core heterocyclic moiety is generically known as a phenanthridine, an isomer of which is the fluorescent dye acridine. Absorption maxima of EtBr in aqueous solution are at 210 nm and 285 nm, which correspond to ultraviolet light. As a result of this excitation, EtBr emits orange light with wavelength 605 nm.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Sabnis | first1 = R. W.

The reason for ethidium bromide's intense fluorescence after binding with DNA is probably not due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl moiety, because the phenyl ring has been shown to project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the phenyl group is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will impinge upon the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescent quencher, the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.

==Applications==

Ethidium bromide is commonly used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a UV lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, gels stained with ethidium bromide are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer's eyes and exposed skin should be protected.  In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit a higher degree of resolution, and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.
Ethidium bromide has also been used extensively to reduce mitochondrial DNA copy number in proliferating cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Diaz F, Bayona-Bafaluy MP, Rana M, Mora M, Hao H, Moraes CT. |title=Human mitochondrial DNA with large deletions repopulates organelles faster than full-length genomes under relaxed copy number control. |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=30 |issue=21|pages=4626–33 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12409452 |pmc=135822 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkf602 [/tpl] Effect of EtBr on mitochondrial DNA is used in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomosis in cattle, as EtBr binds molecules of kinetoplastid DNA and changes their conformation to Z-DNA form. This form inhibits replication of kinetoplastid DNA which is for trypanosomas lethal.[tpl]cite journal|last=Roy Chowdhury|first=Arnab|coauthors=Bakshi, Rahul; Wang, Jianyang; Yildirir, Gokben; Liu, Beiyu; Pappas-Brown, Valeria; Tolun, Gökhan; Griffith, Jack D.; Shapiro, Theresa A.; Jensen, Robert E.; Englund, Paul T.; Ullu, Elisabetta|title=The Killing of African Trypanosomes by Ethidium Bromide|journal=PLoS Pathogens|date=16 December 2010|volume=6|issue=12|pages=e1001226|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001226[/tpl]

===Alternatives===

There are alternatives to ethidium bromide which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance.[tpl]cite journal |author=Huang Q, Fu WL |title=Comparative analysis of the DNA staining efficiencies of different fluorescent dyes in preparative agarose gel electrophoresis |journal=Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=841–2 |year=2005 |pmid=16201894 |doi=10.1515/CCLM.2005.141 |url= [/tpl]Dean Madden, Safer stains for DNA. accessed 2009-12-08. For example, several SYBR-based dyes are used by some researchers and there are other emerging stains such as Novel Juice.  SYBR dyes are less mutagenic than EtBr by the Ames test with liver extract.[tpl]cite journal |author=Singer VL, Lawlor TE, Yue S. |title=Comparison of SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain mutagenicity and ethidium bromide mutagenicity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome reverse mutation assay (Ames test). |journal=Mutat Res. |volume=439 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |year=1999 |pmid=10029672 |doi=10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00172-7[/tpl] However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye).[tpl]cite journal |author=Ohta T, Tokishita S, Yamagata H. |title=Ethidium bromide and SYBR Green I enhance the genotoxicity of UV-irradiation and chemical mutagens in E. coli. |journal=Mutat Res. |volume=492 |issue=1-2 |pages=91–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11377248 |doi=10.1016/S1383-5718(01)00155-3[/tpl] This may be the case for other "safer" dyes, but whilst mutagenic and toxicity details are available Novel Juice testing report these have not been published in peer reviewed journals.  MSDS for SYBR Safe reports a LD50 for rats of >5 g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5g/kg), but both are many orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations used in molecular biology.  Also, many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own including increased skin absorption of organic compounds. Despite the performance advantage of using SYBR dyes instead of EtBr for staining purposes, many researchers still prefer EtBr since it is considerably less expensive.

==Health risks==

Ethidium bromide is thought to act as a mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA.[tpl]cite journal | author=M.J. Waring | title=Complex formation between ethidium bromide and nucleic acids. | journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | year=1965 | pages=269–282  | volume=13 | issue=1 | pmid=5859041 | doi= 10.1016/S0022-2836(65)80096-1 [/tpl] This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription.  Ethidium bromide has been shown to be mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.72.12.5135 | author=J McCann and B N Ames | title=Detection of carcinogens as mutagens in the Salmonella/microsome test: assay of 300 chemicals  | journal=PNAS | year=1975 | pages=5135–5139 | volume=72 | issue=12 | pmid=1061098 | pmc=388891 [/tpl] The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are.  The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown.  The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice.[tpl]Cite web | author = National Toxicology Program | title = Ethidium Bromide: Genetic Toxicity. | date = August 15, 2005 | url = http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=BDAF3AE4-123F-7908-7BE09D1BEA25B435 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | postscript =  [/tpl] These results are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice conducted at the university of Düsseldorf where also no mutagenic effects could be detected.[tpl]Cite web | author = Marossek V | title = Identifizierung und Charakterisierung molekularbiologischer Veränderungen am Beispiel des Tumorsuppressors p53 in der Tamoxifen- bzw.

Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent.[tpl]cite journal | author=M.J. Kramer, E. Grunberg. | title=Effect of Ethidium Bromide against Transplantable Tumors in Mice and Rats.  | journal= Experimental Chemotherapy | year=1973 | pages=254–258 | volume=19 | issue=4 | doi= 10.1159/000221462 [/tpl] Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria.[tpl]cite journal | author=von Wurmb-Schwark N, Cavelier L, Cortopassi GA. | title=A low dose of ethidium bromide leads to an increase of total mitochondrial DNA while higher concentrations induce the mtDNA 4997 deletion in a human neuronal cell line.  | journal= Mutat Res. | year=2006 | pages=57–63 | volume=596 | issue=1-2 | pmid= 16488450 | doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.12.003[/tpl] A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans.[tpl]cite journal | author=Gentry AC, Juul S, Veigaard C, Knudsen BR, Osheroff N. | title=The geometry of DNA supercoils modulates the DNA cleavage activity of human topoisomerase I.  | journal= NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH | year=2011 | pages=1014–1022 | volume=39 | issue=3 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkq822[/tpl]  The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.
Most use of ethidium bromide in the laboratory (0.25–1 microgram/ml) is below the level required for toxicity, and is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the therapeutic dosages used in cattle.[tpl]Cite web | author = Nick Oswald | title = Ethidium Bromide: A Reality Check | date = September 26, 2007 | url = http://bitesizebio.com/95/ethidium-bromide-a-reality-check/ | accessdate = May 1, 2014 | postscript =  [/tpl]  The level is high enough that exposure may interfere with replication of mitochondrial DNA in some human cell lines, although the implications of that are not clear.  Testing in humans and longer studies in any mammalian system would be required to fully understand the potential risk ethidium bromide poses to lab workers.[tpl]Cite web | author = National Toxicology Program | title = Executive Summary Ethidium Bromide: Evidence for Possible Carcinogenic Activity | date = August 15, 2005 | url = http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=6F5F63F6-F1F6-975E-79965F7EE68AE7C0 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | postscript =  [/tpl]

==Handling and disposal==

Ethidium bromide is not regulated as hazardous waste at low concentrations,[tpl]Cite web | author = National Toxicology Program | title = Executive Summary Ethidium Bromide: Table of Contents. | date = August 15, 2005 | url = http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=6F5EA06A-F1F6-975E-73079A5FE34F7E88 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | postscript =  [/tpl] but is treated as hazardous waste by many organizations.  Material should be handled according to the material safety data sheet (MSDS).  Wastes should always be treated in accordance with federal, state and local guidelines.
The disposal of laboratory ethidium bromide remains a controversial subject.[tpl]cite journal | author=HENGEN P. N. | title=Methods and Reagents: Disposal of Ethidium Bromide  | journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences | year=1994 | pages=257–258 | volume=19 | issue=6 | pmid=8073504 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(94)90152-X  [/tpl]  Ethidium bromide can be degraded chemically, or collected and incinerated.  It is common for ethidium bromide waste below a mandated concentration to be disposed of normally (e.g., pouring it down a drain).  A common practice is to treat ethidium bromide with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) before disposal.[tpl]cite book |title=Hazardous laboratory chemicals disposal guide |author=Margaret-Ann Armour |year=2003 |publisher= CRC; 3 edition (February 27, 2003) |isbn= 1-56670-567-3 |pages=222–223[/tpl]  According to Lunn and Sansone, chemical degradation using bleach yields compounds which are mutagenic by the Ames test.  Data are lacking on the mutagenic effects of degradation products.  Lunn and Sansone describe more effective methods for degradation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lunn G, Sansone EB |title=Ethidium bromide: destruction and decontamination of solutions |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=162 |pages=453–8 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90419-2[/tpl] However, ethidium bromide removal from solutions with activated charcoal or amberlite ion exchange resin is recommended.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bensaude O |title=Ethidium bromide: destruction and decontamination of solutions |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=4 |pages=89–90 |year=1988[/tpl]  Various commercial products are available for this use.Ethidium Bromide Disposal
