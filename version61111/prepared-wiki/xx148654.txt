Fearing their manga being dropped out of publication and tired of the harsh treatment, they left Square Enix to help create Mag Garden, where they would also continue serializing their series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mundo-anime-cartoon-peru.blogspot.com/2007/07/production-ig-adquiere-la-editorial-mag.html|title=Production I.G adquiere la editorial Mag Garden|trans_title=Production I.G to Acquires the Publisher Mag Garden|date=2007-07-06|accessdate=2010-01-15|language=Spanish[/tpl] The establishment of Mag Garden and the former manga artists' departure from Square Enix prompted legal disputes over copyright issues between the two companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animefirkx.blogspot.com/search?q=Mag+Garden|title=Production I.G y Mag Garden se fusionan|trans_title=Production I.G and Mag Garden Merge|date=2007-07-09|accessdate=2010-01-17|language=Spanish[/tpl] The legal battle was concluded on March 2003 and Square Enix agreed to contribute 50% of Mag Garden's capital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-09-22/mag-garden-on-stock-exchange|title=Mag Garden on Stock Exchange|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl] Manga that was once published under Enix from the former authors had to continue serialization under new titles. On September 22, 2003, Mag Garden became a separate, independent company and was admitted in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's "Mothers" market after Square Enix sold all of its remaining shares.
On July 4, 2007, the company announced a merger with Production I.G to form a new company called IG Port.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-07-05/production-i.g-announces-mag-garden-merger|title=Production I.G Announces Mag Garden Merger|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://animaxis.com/en/zine/newsletter/view.asp?id=N001846|title=Production I.G Becomes Holding Company, With MAG Garden and XEBEC as Subsidiaries|publisher=Animaxis|date=2007-07-06|accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl] Mag Garden has a steady relationship with Production I.G as they have both collaborated on such cross-media anime/manga projects like Ghost Hound and Sisters of Wellber. Previously, Production I.G was Mag Garden's #2 shareholder as they owned 15% of their stock. The merger was completed on December 1, 2007 in which Mag Garden has officially became a subsidiary of IG Port.
