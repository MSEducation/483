This Time is the fifth album by American country music artist Dwight Yoakam. Three of its tracks barely missed the top spot on the Billboard Hot Country Singles charts, each peaking at No. 2: "Ain't That Lonely Yet," "A Thousand Miles from Nowhere," and "Fast as You." Two other tracks also rose into the charts: "Try Not to Look So Pretty" at No. 14 and "Pocket of a Clown" at No. 22. The album itself peaked at No. 4 on the Top Country Albums chart. Dwight Yoakam wrote or co-wrote all except for one of the tracks on this album.
"A Thousand Miles from Nowhere" was featured as the closing credits music for the film Red Rock West, in which Dwight Yoakam also made his film acting debut. "Wild Ride" was later covered by Kenny Chesney as a duet with Joe Walsh on Chesney's 2007 album Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates.
