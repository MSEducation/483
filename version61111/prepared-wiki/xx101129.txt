Macewen's sign or Macewen sign ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|juː|ɨ|n[/tpl]) the is a sign used to help to diagnose hydrocephalushttp://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/16/1/13 (accumulation of excess cerebrospinal fluid) and brain abscesses. Tapping (percussion) the skull near the junction of the frontal, temporal and parietal bones will produce a stronger resonant sound when either hydrocephalus or a brain abscess are present. 
The sign was discovered and described by Sir William Macewen (1848-1924), a surgeon and professor of the University of Glasgow, Scotland who also described Macewen's operation for inguinal hernia.
