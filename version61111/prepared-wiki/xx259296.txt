The word arcanepunk refers to a fantasy world where both magic and science exist. It applies to a genre or a design.
The magic and science are advanced enough that most people have access. Not everyone is a scientist or wizard, but most people know how to use technologic and magic items. Scientific knowledge is comparable to the late 19th century or more advanced. This genre is often old fashioned, either by borrowing in fantasy or steampunk.
In most cases, magic and science have evolved in parallel. People use technomagic devices based on magic and science. Coal, oil and electricity are often replaced by crystals, mana or glyphs.
The most popular creature of the genre is the wargolem, something between golem and robot.  It appears in 1998 in Battle Chasers comic books. It is known as warforged in the Eberron campaign setting.
