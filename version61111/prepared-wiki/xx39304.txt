Equity (formerly known as the British Actors' Equity Association) is the trade union for actors, stage managers and models in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1930 by a group of West End performers.
Equity was one of the last of the closed shop unions in the UK.  This was criticised in 1981 by the European Court of Human Rights[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0037988.html |title=Closed Shop |year=2013 |publisher=TalkTalk |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] and made illegal in 1988, with the result that it is no longer a requirement that a professional actor be a member of Equity.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2010/sep/15/malcolm-sinclair-equity |location=London |work=The Guardian |agency=Theatre Blog |first=Laura |last=Barnett |title=Equity boss Malcolm Sinclair answers your questions |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/nerve2/equity.htm |title=Equity in the 21st Century |date=Summer 2003 |journal=Nerve |issue=2 |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/980967.stm |title=More union trouble for Hurley |date=20 October 2000 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Like many other British trade unions, Equity operated a closed shop policyâ€”it was not possible for someone to join unless they had had sufficient paid work, and most jobs were reserved for Equity card holders.  In order to allow new members to join, there were a limited number of non-card holding jobs on regional productions.  Whilst working on these productions, actors held a provisional membership card, and, on completing the requisite number of weeks, could apply for full membership, and thereafter work in the West End, or on film and television.
In 1976, Equity introduced a policy of refusing to sell programming to the South African Broadcasting Corporation, an action that led to a virtual blackout of British television in apartheid South Africa.
As a result of reforms of trade unions in the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, and the introduction of European legislation, closed shop unions became illegal in the UK, and Equity discontinued this policy.  However, in order to join, evidence must be provided of sufficient paid professional work.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.equity.org.uk/about-us/join-us/how-can-i-join/ |title=How can I join? |publisher=Equity |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]
