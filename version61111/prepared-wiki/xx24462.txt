Dolores Claiborne is a 1992 psychological thriller novel by Stephen King. The novel is narrated by the title character. Atypically for a King novel, it has no chapters, double-spacing between paragraphs, or other section breaks; thus the text is a single continuous narrative which reads like the transcription of a spoken monologue. It was the best selling novel of 1992 in the United States.[ref]Albert Rolls, Stephen King: A Biography, page 109 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009). ISBN 978-0-313-34572-2

==Plot summary==

While being interrogated, Dolores Claiborne wants to make clear to the police that she did not kill her wealthy employer, an elderly woman named Vera Donovan whom she has looked after for years. She does, however, confess to the murder of her husband, Joe St. George, almost 30 years before, after finding out that he sexually molested their fourteen-year-old daughter, Selena. Dolores's "confession" develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer.

==Style==

Unlike many other works by King, there is little focus on the supernatural;Gina Wisker, Horror Fiction: An Introduction, page 120 (The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc., 2005). ISBN 0-8264-1561-X the only such event in the book are two telepathic visions, which, along with the solar eclipse backdrop, form a link to King's novel Gerald's Game.Heidi Strengell, Dissecting Stephen King: From the Gothic to Literary Naturalism, page 48 (The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005). ISBN 0-299-20970-9 However, reviewer Sean Piccoli observed the novel otherwise contains "vintage bone-yard King: the tiny town, the secret lives. Murder and mayhem lurk reliably behind the tranquil veneer."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
