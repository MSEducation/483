In the mid-1980s with the gradual opening of Soviet society, the ACTR board established The American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study (ACCELS). ACCELS undertook the administration of U.S. government-funded exchanges for a variety of audiences, including high school and undergraduate students, teachers, professionals, and academics.
In 1998, ACTR and ACCELS united to one organization. Now ACTR and ACCELS continue as divisions of American Councils for International Education.  ACTR is the professional association and the focus of educational, training, and research programs for U.S. citizens; ACCELS administers exchange, training, and technical assistance programs with the countries of eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.
ACTR is also a member organization of the International Association of Teachers of Russian Language and Literature (MAPRYAL).MAPRYAL.
