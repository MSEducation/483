After getting interviewed by TVB staff members, she made the top 40. She was in the acting group for Eric Tsang. Tsang chose her to be in the top 20 of the pageant. After 3 months of training and filming in Thailand and Sri Lanka, she competed on 20 August for the crown. At first she wasn't a favorite for the crown. However she had an excellent performance during the final night. Her top 10 interview was also interesting. Eventually she made the top 5 and won 1st runner up.
