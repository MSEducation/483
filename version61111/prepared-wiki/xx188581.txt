Early in her time as county prosecutor Worthy was criticized for giving too many plea deals to people involved in gun crimes.Detroit News, August 16th, 2004[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Worthy has also at times had her prosecutions hampered by the ineptitude of the Detroit Police Crime Lab.http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/shared-gen/ap/National/Gun_Tests_Suspended.html?cxntlid=inform_sr[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
In 2010 she appealed to the decision of providing Jean Paul Orlewicz a new trial. Orlewicz, 18 was convicted of first degree murder, after the Wayne county prosecutor had previously established an agreement with murderer, Alex Letkemann, in order to have a stronger case against Orlewicz.
Presently, Worthy is working on resolving a massive backlog of unprocessed rape test kits in Detroit.  In 2009, one of her assistants discovered a massive number of kits sitting in a warehouse that the Detroit Police Department had used as an overflow storage facility for evidence.  Eventually, over 11,000 rape test kits--some of which had been sitting unprocessed for a decade or more--were discovered in the warehouse.  In one case, a 2002 rape was linked to a man who was incarcerated for three murders he committed in the seven years after the rape.  Worthy took the discovery very personally, in part because she was sexually assaulted herself while at Notre Dame (though it was unreported).Prosecutor leads effort to test long-abandoned rape kits, brings justice to victims.
