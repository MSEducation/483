The paper's most prominent columnists include writer and arts commentator Fintan O'Toole and the satirist Miriam Lord. Former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald was also a columnist. Senior international figures, including Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, have written for its op-ed page. Its most prominent columns have included Drapier (an anonymous piece produced weekly by a politician, giving the 'insider' view of politics), Rite and Reason (a weekly religious column, edited by Patsy McGarry, the 'religious affairs' editor) and the long-running An Irishman's Diary. An Irishman's Diary was penned by Patrick Campbell in the forties (under the pseudonym 'Quidnunc'), by Seamus Kelly from 1949-1979 (also writing as  'Quidnunc'), and more recently[tpl]when|date=January 2013[/tpl] by Kevin Myers.

==History==

===Origins===

The first appearance of a newspaper using the name The Irish Times occurred in 1823 but it closed in 1825. The title was revived as a thrice weekly publication by Major Lawrence E. Knox, with the first edition being published on 29 March 1859. It was originally founded as a moderate Protestant Nationalist newspaper, reflecting the politics of Knox, who stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for Isaac Butt's Home Rule League. Its headquarters were at 4 Lower Abbey Street in Dublin. In its early days, its main competitor was the Dublin Daily Express.

===The Arnotts===

After Knox's death in 1873 the paper was sold to the widow of Sir John Arnott, MP, a former Lord Mayor of Cork and owner of Arnotts, one of Dublin's major Department stores. The sale, for £35000, led to two major changes. Its headquarters was shifted to 31 Westmoreland Street, remaining in buildings on or near that site until 2005. Its politics also shifted dramatically, becoming predominantly Protestant and Unionist. The paper, along with the Irish Independent and various regional papers, called for the execution of the leaders of the failed 1916 Easter Rising.
Though the paper became a publicly listed company in 1900, the family continued to hold a majority shareholding until the 1960s (even after the family lost control, the great-grandson of the original purchaser was the paper's London editor). The last member of the Arnott family to sit on the paper's board was Sir Lauriston Arnott, who died in 1958. 
The editor during the 1930s, R. M. Smyllie, had strong anti-fascist views: he angered the Irish Catholic hierarchy by opposing General Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Later, The Irish Times, like other national newspapers, had problems with Irish Government censorship during World War II. The Times was largely pro-Allied and was opposed to the Éamon de Valera government's policy of neutrality.[tpl]cite book | title = Irish Media: A Critical History Since 1922 | first = John | last = Horgan | authorlink = John Horgan (academic) | publisher =  Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 38–45[/tpl]

===The Irish Times Trust===

In 1974, ownership was transferred to a charitable trust, The Irish Times Trust. The former owner, Major Thomas McDowell, was made "president for life" of the trust which runs the paper and  was paid a large dividend.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/times-exowner-leaves-836413m-2029316.html | title = 'Times' ex-owner leaves €13m | work = Irish Independent | first = Liam | last = Collins | date = 24 January 2010[/tpl] However several years later the articles of the Trust were adjusted, giving Major McDowell 10 preference shares and one more vote than the combined votes of all the other directors should any move be made to remove him.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mcdowell-had-pound30000-tax-liability-512202.html | title = McDowell had £30,000 tax liability | work = Irish Independent | first = Liam | last = Collins | date = 23 December 2001[/tpl] Major McDowell died in 2009.
The Trust was set up in 1974 as “a company limited by guarantee” to purchase The Irish Times Limited and to ensure that The Irish Times would be published as an independent newspaper with specific editorial objectives. (See below).
The Trust is regulated by a legal document, the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and controlled by a body of people (the Governors) under company law. It is not a charity and does not have charitable status. It has no beneficial shareholders and it cannot pay dividends. Any profits made by The Irish Times cannot be distributed to the Trust but must be used to strengthen the newspaper, directly or indirectly.
The Trust is composed of a maximum of 11 Governors. The Trust appoints Governors who are required to be “representative broadly of the community throughout the whole of Ireland”.

===Recent history===

In 1969, the longest-serving editor of The Irish Times, Douglas Gageby, was allegedly called a "white nigger" by the company chairman (a former British army officer), because of the newspaper's coverage of Northern Ireland at the outset of the Troubles, which was upsetting the British government.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-times-major--mcdowell-called-his-editor--a-white-nigger-488144.html | title = Irish Times' Major McDowell called his editor a 'white nigger' | work = Irish Independent | first = Charlie | last = Mallon | date = 26 January 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/white-nigger-denial-poses-a-real-dilemma-488276.html | title = 'White nigger' denial poses a real dilemma | work = Irish Independent | first = Ronan | last = Fanning | date = 2 February 2003[/tpl]
The paper established its first bureau in Asia when foreign correspondent Conor O'Clery moved to Beijing in 1996.China the Emerging Power: Prospects for Sino-Irish Relations Conor O'Clery lecture, Centre for Asian Studies, University College Dublin, 2000. "...I first arrived Beijing to establish the first Irish Times bureau in Asia in 1996."
The paper suffered considerable financial difficulty in 2002 when a drop in advertising revenue coincided with a decision by the company to invest its reserves in the building of a new printing plant. None of the journalists were laid off, but many took a voluntary redundancy package when the paper was greatly restructured. Some foreign bureaux were closed and it also stopped publishing 'colour' pages devoted to local Irish regions, with regional coverage now merged with news. The paper's problems stemmed partly from internal strife which led to Major McDowells's daughter, Karen Erwin, not being made Chief Executive. The reorganisation had the desired effect; after posting losses of almost €3 million in 2002, the paper returned to profit in 2003.
John Waters, the only columnist to speak out about the perceived vast salaries of the editor, managing director and deputy editor, was sacked and re-hired a week later, in November 2003.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-real-story-behind-the-times-rich-list-497097.html | title = The real story behind the Times Rich List | work = Irish Independent | first1 = Liam | last1 = Collins | first2 = Jody | last2 = Corcoran | date = 30 November 2003[/tpl] Former editor Geraldine Kennedy was paid more than the editor of the UK's top non-tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph, which has a circulation of about nine times that of The Irish Times. Later, columnist Fintan O'Toole told the Sunday Independent: "We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms. Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double-standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-times-staff-revolt-at-editor-and-directors-indefensible-salaries-471014.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Irish Times staff revolt at editor and directors' 'indefensible' salaries | date=7 August 2005[/tpl]http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=287121
In January 2005, the paper was due to run a front-page story on the Provisional IRA's denial of involvement in the Northern Bank robbery, one of Europe's largest ever, and a column by Kevin Myers, which said that the Provisional IRA were responsible.[tpl]clarify|post-text=What?|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/bank-heist-is-snooze-to-the-irish-times-462931.html | title = Bank heist is snooze to the 'Irish Times' | work = Irish Independent | first = Jim | last = Cusack | date = 9 January 2005[/tpl] Myers asked for clarification of the decision from the editor, and later left the paper.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/myers-shocked-at-spiking-of-column-on-ira-by-irish-times-462776.html | title = Myers shocked at spiking of column on IRA by 'Irish Times' | work = Irish Independent | first = Jim | last = Cusack | date = 2 January 2005[/tpl] 
The following May, the paper launched a new international edition, which is available in London and southeast England at the same time as other daily newspapers (previously, copies of the Irish edition were flown from Dublin to major cities in Britain on passenger flights, arriving around lunchtime). It is printed at the Newsfax plant in Hackney, and uses the Financial Times distribution network.
The Central Bank of Ireland fined The Irish Times in 2008 after it admitted breaking market abuse rules.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0411/financial-business.html | title = Financial Regulator fines Irish Times | work = RTÉ Business | date = 11 April 2008[/tpl]
In 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the paper to pay €600,000 in costs despite winning its case about the importance of protecting journalistic sources, and called its destruction of evidence "reprehensible conduct".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1127/1224259547062.html | title = 'Irish Times' ordered to pay legal costs in full | work = The Irish Times | date = 27 November 2009 | first = Mary | last = Carolan[/tpl] 
The newspaper has been criticized for its perceived support of the British Army. An article in The Phoenix magazine examined an article in The Irish Times published in August 2010 on Irish nationals serving in the British Army.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0731/1224275874706.html | work=The Irish Times | title=The fighting Irish | date=7 July 2010[/tpl] According to The Phoenix, the article romanticized the war in Afghanistan and was little more than a recruitment advertisement for the British Army.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-28/issue-16/contents.pdf | title = Irish Times for Queen and Country | work = The Phoenix | date = 13 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] The magazine accused the editor Geraldine Kennedy and the Irish Times board of violating the Defense Act which prohibits any kind of advertising for recruitment for a foreign army and article 15.6.1 of the Constitution of Ireland which states “The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas".
On 9 September 2011, the paper published a pseudonymous article by Kate Fitzgerald.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0909/1224303758047.html |title=Employers failing people with mental health issues|publisher=Irish Times|date=9 September 2011[/tpl] Unknown to the paper, she had committed suicide the previous August 22. The revelation sparked a nationwide debate on suicide with her parents appearing on television to discuss suicide and depression.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/1202/thesaturdaynightshow.html |title=X Factor star for Saturday Night Show|work=RTÉ Ten|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl] The article criticised the reaction to her illness by her employer, The Communications Clinic, although it was only after she was identified as the author that her employer became known. The article was later removed from the paper's website,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2011/0909/Pg016.html#Ar01601:03C8AE0708BB17C47D1AF48B1785671AC57510859E13C5AC1087A913C7B60002CF14F3100507A90897B60006960656A3 |title=Legal Redaction|publisher=Irish Times|date=9 September 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Paywall[/tpl]  causing controversy online.

Kate's parents complained to the Office of the Press Ombudsman about an apology made to The Communications Clinic, their complaint was upheld.

====Diversification====

The company has diversified from its original Irish Times title as a source of revenue. Irish Times Limited has taken a majority share for €5m in the Gazette Group Newspapers, a group publishing three local newspapers in West Dublin, and has acquired a property website, MyHome.ie, the second-largest property internet website in Ireland, for €50m, seen as insurance against the loss of revenue from traditional classified property advertising.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.irishexaminerusa.com/mt/2006/08/02/irish_web_site_bought_for_50_m.html | title=Irish Web Site Bought For 50 Million Euro | work=The Irish Examiner | date=2 August 2006 | accessdate=October 18, 2012 | last=Heatley |first= Colm[/tpl] In June 2009, journalists called on the board and trust to review "the flawed investment and diversification strategy of the company" and passed a motion saying that "ongoing investment in loss-making projects poses a serious threat to employment" at the newspaper.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=IRELAND-qqqm=news-qqqid=42757-qqqx=1.asp | title = Times staffers want a review of paper's direction | work = The Sunday Business Post | first = Niamh | last = Connolly | date = 28 June 2009[/tpl] Four months later, the company announced a loss of €37 million and that 90 staff would be made redundant.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1003/1224255776825.html | title = Irish Times registers €37.8m loss for 2008 | work = The Irish Times | first = Ciarán | last = Hancock | date = 3 October 2009[/tpl] The director, Maeve Donovan, who instigated the "investment and diversification" strategy, subsequently retired. She dismissed suggestions that she would receive a significant "golden handshake", saying that her package would be "nothing out of the ordinary at all". She was given a €1m "ex-gratia" payment by the newspaper "relating to a commutation of pension rights agreed with her".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/irish-times-ceo-got-euro1m-payoff-as-losses-mount-2391589.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Peter | last=Flanagan | title=Irish Times CEO got €1m payoff as losses mount | date=23 October 2010[/tpl]
