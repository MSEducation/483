[[Greater Vision]]

CATEGORIES: Southern Gospel performers

Greater Vision is a Southern Gospel trio founded in 1990 by Gerald Wolfe, Mark Trammell, and Chris Allman, and often accompanied by pianist Stan Whitmire (though he was never an official member of the group). Over the last several years, this trio has consistently been named Southern Gospel's favorite trio of the year in the Singing News Fan Awards. With numerous top-10 and #1 Southern Gospel hit songs, and several songs named "Song of the Year" in the Singing News Fan Awards, this trio has established a solid presence in the Southern Gospel industry.
In an industry where lineup changes are constant, and lack of personnel stability are prevalent, Greater Vision has seen few lineup changes over the twenty-year span.  In 1993, Mark Trammell departed for Gold City and was replaced by Dixie Melody Boys baritone Rodney Griffin.  Chris Allman left in 1995 to pursue other avenues of ministry and was replaced by Jason Waldroup.  This lineup of Wolfe, Griffin, and Waldroup stayed intact for 13 years. In 2008, Jason Waldroup decided to leave to pursue a seminary education. In May, Jacob Kitson was announced as the new tenor, beginning in August.  In 2010, Kitson formed the Statement of Faith Trio with his brother Joe and friend Jon Epley. Chris Allman returned after an almost fifteen-year absence, thus coming back full circle to the almost original blend and sound that helped pave the way.
