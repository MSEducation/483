Lajos Kisfaludy (Gemer, Slovakia, 30 August 1924 − Budapest, Hungary, 30 October 1988) was a Hungarian chemical engineer, a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He is renowned for his research in the field of peptide synthesis and medicinal chemistry.
As from 1943 he studied at the Budapest University of Technology, and graduated in 1948 as a chemical engineer. Until 1956 he taught at the Department of Organic Chemistry of the university. In 1956 he started to work for the Kőbánya Pharmaceutical Factory in Budapest, where he was engaged as director and research professor of the synthesis laboratory, a position what he held from 1958 until his death.
His main research was in the field of medicinal chemistry, he introduced new methods and protecting groups into the process of peptide synthesis. He was contributing to the chemical synthesis of human hormones like oxytocin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, etc. As a result of his experiments, nearly 80 medicines were synthetized and introduced to the market (including Cavinton, Seduxen, Suprastin).
He was a corresponding (1982) member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
