[[Fascia (phone)]]

CATEGORIES: Mobile phones

A fascia is the name given to the removable housing of a mobile telephone. It is most often used to refer to a new housing bought as a fashion accessory to improve the appearance of a mobile phone.
Not all mobile phones support the removal of the external housing and therefore fascias are not normally produced for them by the manufacturer.
Although manufacturers sometimes produce a small number of "official" fascias for their own phones, most commercially available fascias are produced by third parties and are therefore classed as "unofficial accessories".
