[[Qualitative marketing research]]

CATEGORIES: Market research, Business intelligence, Qualitative research

Qualitative marketing research is a set of research techniques, used in marketing research and the social sciences, in which data is obtained from a relatively small group of respondents, and not analyzed with statistical inferences (inferential statistics). 
This differentiates it from quantitative marketing research, which is analyzed for statistical significance for marketing purposes.
