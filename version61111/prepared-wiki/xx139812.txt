[[Global Family Day]]

CATEGORIES: Winter holidays, United Nations observances

Global Family Day, One Day of Peace and Sharing, is celebrated every January 1 in the United States as a global day of peace and sharing. Global Family Day grew out of the United Nations Millennium celebration, "One Day In Peace".

==History==

Originally supported in the United States by Linda Grover, the source of the idea itself is difficult to pin down because many grassroots efforts around the world had independently targeted this date as a day for peace and had worked separately to prevail on local governments and the U.N. to establish such a day.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] These efforts included a 1996 children's book One Day In Peace, January 1, 2000 by Steve Diamond and Robert Alan Silverstein, which was translated into 22 languages, and a utopian novel Tree Island by Glover herself.[tpl]cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|title=Linda Grover; worked to note Global Family Day; at 76|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/02/27/linda_grover_worked_to_note_global_family_day_at_76/|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=27 February 2010[/tpl]
