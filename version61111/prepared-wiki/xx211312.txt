==Music career==

===Chiodos===

[tpl]Main|Chiodos[/tpl] Davison, Michigan, Owens joined in 2001 with Bradley Bell, Pat McManaman, Jason Hale, Matt Goddard and Derrick Frost to form a band. Originally named "Chiodos Bros." in tribute to special effects trio The Chiodo Brothers, the band recorded its first demo in June 2002.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chiodos-mn0000382630 | title = Chiodos | publisher = Allmusic | first = Corey | last = Apar | accessdate = 12 August 2012[/tpl] Following several years of national touring and independent recording, they were signed by Equal Vision Records in 2004 and, under the name Chiodos, released their first full-length album, All's Well That Ends Well in 2005. They continued thereafter, recording and touring.
While Chiodos and Cinematic Sunrise (see below) were recording and touring, Owens was struggling with personal issues. On July 24, 2008, four days after an overdose on Xanax in his Michigan home, he revealed in his Myspace blog that he had been suffering from bipolar disorder and anxiety attacks for years.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.myspace.com/craigeryowens/blog/417856083 | title = To My Fans and Friends | first = Craig | last = Owens | date = July 24, 2008 | accessdate = 12 August 2012[/tpl] He also announced that he took no lasting harm from the attempted overdose and would not be canceling any of his appearances with Chiodos.
Even after his separation from his first band, Owens continued to have an interest in working with them and, after being asked by his management about what project he most wanted to pursue, he made overtures about a possible return to Chiodos. On April 26, 2012, Owens announced his return to Chiodos. Subsequently, on April 27, the remaining members of D.R.U.G.S. revealed their intention to disband.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/04/27/destroy-rebuild-until-god-shows-break-up/ | title = Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows Break Up After Singer Returns to Chiodos | date = April 27, 2012 | first= Carlos | last = Ramirez | accessdate = 12 August 2012 | publisher = noisecreep.com[/tpl] Chiodos' first live appearance after their reunion took place on August 9, 2012 in a sold-out performance at Flint Local 432 in Michigan.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/flint/index.ssf/2012/08/chiodos_to_make_first_appearan.html | title= Chiodos to make first appearance since reunion at Flint Local 432 | date = August 8, 2012 | first= Christina | last = Fuoco Karasinski | accessdate = 12 August 2012 | publisher = MLive[/tpl] As of that date, the members had tentative plans for a new album, on which they have been working separately but not yet begun to coordinate.
