==History==

In the middle of the 1926 season, the “Iron Men” came into being when the same 11 players played against Yale for 60 minutes and a 7-0 win. The next week the same 11 players played without substitution against Dartmouth and won 10-0. Two weeks later the Iron Men played 58 minutes against Harvard, but in the last two minutes the substitutes came in to earn their letters. Brown won all its games that year until the Thanksgiving game against Colgate ended in a 10-10 tie. The famed “Iron Men” were Thurston Towle ’28, Paul Hodge ’28, Orland Smith ’27, Charles Considine ’28, Lou Farber ’29, Ed Kevorkian ’29, Hal Broda ’27, Al Cornsweet ’29, Dave Mishel ’27, Ed Lawrence ’28, and Roy Randall ’28.
Brown players elected to the College Football Hall of Fame are John W. Heisman 1891, DeOrmond McLaughry, Frederick D. Pollard ’19, Edward North Robinson 1896, and Wallace Wade ’17.

In 2008, Brown beat Harvard for the first time in nearly a decade, 24-22, in Providence. The two teams would end up sharing the Ivy League title with matching 6-1 records.
