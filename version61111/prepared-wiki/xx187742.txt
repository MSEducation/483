Madras War Cemetery is a war cemetery and a memorial created to receive Second World War graves from many civil and cantonment cemeteries in the south and east of India where their permanent maintenance could not be assured. The cemetery contains 856 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War.

It is located in Nandambakkam, Chennai. It is currently maintained by the CWGC in partnership with Government of India.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/17/stories/2007071759050300.htm |title=The Hindu : Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Are all memorials really throbbing with life? |work= |accessdate=2008-05-01 |location=Chennai, India |date=2007-07-17[/tpl]
