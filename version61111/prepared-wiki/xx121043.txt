==History==

South Salem High School is not the first school to be built on the current site. Leslie Middle School was built in 1927, and the high school was connected to it when the high school was constructed in 1954. The schools shared common facilities, including the cafeteria and auditorium. When the middle school was moved in 1997, the old building became home to Howard Street Charter School.[ref]
