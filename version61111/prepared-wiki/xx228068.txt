[[Out of position (crash testing)]]

CATEGORIES: Transport safety

Out of position (OOP), in crash testing and car accident medical literature, indicates a passenger position which is not the normal, upright and forward position.[tpl]cite book|author1=Stephen M.

==Risk of injury==

Out of position occupants are at increased risk of injury. Even low speed impacts can cause disc herniation and lumbar fracture on OOP passengers. Airbags can prove fatal on OOP passengers:[tpl]cite book|author1=Michael Griebel|author2=Marc A.
