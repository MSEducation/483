==Storyline==

Matt Braddock is a civil engineer during World War II who has new ideas for shipbuilding. Braddock tries to establish yards for building prefabricated ships on the West Coast, but he is hindered by the former superintendent of the shipyard, Joel Kennedy.
A disappointed lover fails to deliver an important message on welds and it leads to the collapse of a new ship's superstructure and the death of a boy.Bernard F. Dick, The star-spangled screen: the American World War II film (1996), p. 108
The subject of the film shows some degree of wartime propaganda.  The lead character is said to be based on the real-life Henry J. Kaiser, and the film is set in the Kaiser Shipyards.  Like the later Betrayal from the East (1945), Man from Frisco included actual radio reports of the negotiations with the Japanese before their attack on Pearl Harbour of 7 December 1941.
