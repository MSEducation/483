Rose Mooney (born 1740) was an itinerant Irish harpist during a time when the itinerant tradition was dying out.

==Early life==

Rose Mooney came from a poor background in County Meath. Like many harpists of the time, she was blind. Mooney learned how to play from Thady Elliott. With her maid Mary for a companion, she traveled Ireland for different harpist competitions.[tpl]cite book|last=Fox|first=Charlotte Milligan|title=Annals of the Irish harpers|year=1913|publisher=E.

==Harp festivals==

===Granard Harp Festival===

The memoirs of harpist Arthur O'Neill contain records of Mooney's experience at the Granard Festivals. She was the only woman to compete in the Granard festival of 1781. Third place and five guineas went to Mooney for her rendering of "Planxty Burke".[tpl]cite book|last=Flood|first=William H. Grattan|title=A History of Irish Music|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XXVII.php|publisher=Browne and Nolan|year=1905|chapter=Harp Festivals and Harp Societies|oclc=3557419[/tpl] She continued to participate and won third place in the 2nd and 3rd Granard festivals of 1782 and 1783. This time her reward was lowered to four guineas.[tpl]cite book|last=Fox|first=Charlotte Milligan|title=Annals of the Irish harpers|year=1913|publisher=E. P.

It seems that starting from the second festival she was not the only woman competing, as Catherine Martin joined her ranks.

===Belfast Harp Festival===

In 1792 a Harpers Assembly in Belfast was called upon by founding members of the Belfast Reading Society Henry Joy McCracken and Dr. James McDonnel in order to revive the Ancient tradition of the harp. The festival ran from 11 July to 14 July 1792.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lanier|first=S.C.|title='It is New-Strung and Shan't be Heard': Nationalism and Memory in the Irish Harp Tradition|journal=British Journal of Ethnomusicology|year=1999|volume=8|pages=1â€“26|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3060850|doi=10.2307/3060850[/tpl] Mooney, then 52, participated. She rehearsed with the rest of the harpers in public until the final show in the assembly rooms. 15 judges presided upon the competition. Edward Bunting was present for the festival in order to transcribe the harp music played into a manuscript. This was done in order to aid the preservation of the music. The result of Mooney's participation in the festival is unknown as it seems that only a first and second place was awarded during the event and information about the rest of the participants does not seem to be available.[tpl]cite book|publisher=The Regan Printing House|year=1913|title=Irish Minstrels and Musicians|last=O'Neill|first=Francis|chapter=Harpers at the Granard and Belfast Meetings|url=http://billhaneman.ie/IMM/IMM-VIII.html|oclc=4836421[/tpl]
According to Arthur O'Neill, Mooney "pledged her harp, petticoat, and cloak." His statement was made in order to expose Rose's maid, Mary, who seems to have taken advantage of her mistress' blindness by pawning off her items in order to buy herself alcohol.[tpl]cite book|last=Fox|first=Charlotte Milligan|title=Annals of the Irish harpers|year=1913|publisher=E. P. Dutton & co.|location=New York|page=188|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005067072|oclc=3581446[/tpl] Mary led Mooney into seedy establishments, which were "inseparable for poor blind harpers."

==Death==

The date and circumstances of Mooney's death are unclear. According to O'Neill, she died during the French invasion of Killala in 1798 as a victim of drink.[tpl]cite book|last=Fox|first=Charlotte Milligan|title=Annals of the Irish harpers|year=1913|publisher=E.
