Latvia regained independence in 1991 after fall of the Soviet Union. Subsequently the death penalty in civilian cases was reserved for murder and the only method of executions, as during Soviet times, was shooting with a single bullet to the back of the head. The last executions took place in January 1996.Apžēlošanas dienests Latvijas Valsts prezidenta mājas lapa [tpl]lv icon[/tpl]

The law on ratification of Protocol 13 was adopted on 13 October 2011 and the protocol was ratified on 26 January 2012.
