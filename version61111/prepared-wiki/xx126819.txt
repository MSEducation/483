In [tpl]By|1966[/tpl], Green improved, hitting .250, slapping in 127 hits in 140 games, and also knocked in 62 runs. However, Green struggled the following season. With 69 hits in 122 games, Green coupled his .198 batting average with 5 home runs and 37 RBIs.

Green tied a World Series record in game three by starting three double plays in one game.[tpl]cite book|title=Baseball's Last Dynasty: Charlie Finley's Oakland A's|author=Markusen, B.|pages=334â€“340|year=1998|publisher=Masters Press|isbn=978-1-57028-188-4[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pppYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gPgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3136,925613|title=Green is Hopeful of Quick Series|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|agency=Associated Press|page=37|date=October 17, 1974|accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl]  He started the first two by catching line drives, and the third was a ground ball double play to end the game.  In game four, Green also started a game ending double play.  In the eighth inning of the clinching game five, Green made a perfect relay throw to get Bill Buckner, representing the tying run, out at third base.
