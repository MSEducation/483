Mincome was an experimental Canadian basic income project that was held in Dauphin, Manitoba during the 1970s.  The project, funded jointly by the Manitoba provincial government and the Canadian federal government, began with a news release on February 22, 1974, and was closed down in 1979.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a guaranteed, unconditional annual income caused disincentive to work for the recipients, and how great such a disincentive would be.
It allowed every family unit to receive a minimum cash benefit. The results showed a modest impact on labor markets, with working hours dropping one percent for men, three percent for wives, and five percent for unmarried women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.irpp.org/po/archive/jan01/hum.pdf |title=A Guaranteed Annual Income?

Mothers spent more time rearing newborns, and the educational impacts are regarded as a success. Students in these families showed higher test scores and lower dropout rates. There was also an increase in adults continuing education.Salkind, N.J. & Haskins, R. (1982). Negative income tax: The impact on children from low-income families.

A final report was never issued, but Dr. Evelyn Forget (4-gayt) conducted an analysis of the program in 2009 which was published in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20%282%29.pdf |title=The Town with No Poverty—Using Health Administration Data to Revisit Outcomes of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |author=Evelyn L.

Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren't under as much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating. In addition, those who continued to work were given more opportunities to choose what type of work they did. Forget found that in the period that Mincome was administered, hospital visits dropped 8.5 percent, with fewer incidences of work-related injuries, and fewer emergency room visits from car accidents and domestic abuse.[tpl]cite web|last=Belik|first=Vivian|title=A Town Without Poverty?
