The mayor, Gene Armstrong, recently made headlines following the passage of Alabama H.B. 56 when he stated, "We managed in the past without illegal immigrants to pick the tomatoes here, and I haven't heard anyone say that if we sent them all home nobody would be left to do that work. When you have 9 percent unemployment, I think that some people who might not have wanted those jobs previously might reconsider."[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
