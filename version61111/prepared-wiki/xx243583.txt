A few months later the title was acquired by Jazz Fashion Publishing Ltd. Richard Holland took charge as editor for the new launch of Paranormal Magazine in August 2008.,http://www.uncannyuk.com/2008/07/19/revamping-paranormal-magazine/, accessed 6 November 2010 and the magazine was published first that month. This new incarnation moved away from the previous emphasis on spiritualism and its reliance on celebrity mediums and writers associated with TV ghost-hunting programs such as Most Haunted.
