==Controversy==

On 25 March 2011, the deputy spokesman of the coalition, Saleh Kebzabo, announced that: "The coalition of political parties have decided to suspend their participation in the electoral commission." Fifteen opposition party-affiliated members of the election commission resigned thus posing a threat to the credibility of the election. The three main opposition candidates (Kebzabo, Kamougu√© and Yorongar) had said a few days prior to the withdrawal that they intended to boycott the election amidst their doubts that it would not be credible.
According to Chad's electoral code, the electoral commission must have at least two-thirds of its 31 members to constitute a quorum.http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/chad-opposition-quits-election-body-1.1047499[/ref]

===Boycott===

The major opposition politicians Saleh Kebzabo, Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue, and Ngarlejy Yorongar announced that they would boycott the "election circus" and urged voters to do so too. That followed demands of such electoral reforms as the issuance of new voter identification cards. They also claimed unfair conditions led to a loss in the February 2011 parliamentary election and that the presidential election would be a "historic fraud."http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/04/201142542956989898.htmlhttp://www.africasia.com/services/news_africa/article.php?ID=CNG.f9dc8540002b694b3f07a574f74a6ed3.e11
