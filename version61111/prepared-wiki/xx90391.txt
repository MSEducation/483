==Playing career==

Boulton was drafted in the ninth round, 234th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut playing for the Buffalo Sabres, where he played for four seasons. During the 2004 NHL Lockout, he played for the Columbia Inferno of the East Coast Hockey League. After the Lockout ended, Boulton landed in Atlanta.
In October 2005, Boulton was suspended for 6 games after he elbowed Tampa Bay Lightning rookie Paul Ranger causing a hairline fracture of the jaw and a concussion.[tpl]cite web| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2202658 | title = NHL suspends Boulton six games for Elbow hit | publisher =ESPN | date= October 25, 2005 | accessdate = May 23, 2011[/tpl] The incident occurred at the end of a 6–0 rout of the Thrashers on October 20, 2005.  NHL vice-president Colin Campbell said, "It is clear Mr. Boulton's actions were careless and caused injury. There is no circumstance that can justify this type of action." Only a week earlier Boulton had made a similar move in a game against Toronto, almost injuring Eric Lindros. Both Tampa Bay coach John Tortorella and Toronto coach Pat Quinn have made angry comments about Boulton's style of play. Tortorella said "no one wants to see him on the ice."
Boulton was re-signed by Atlanta in 2008 to a two-year deal. He recorded his first career hat trick on December 18, 2010, against the New Jersey Devils. He then signed as an unrestricted free agent with the New Jersey Devils to a 2-year contract worth $575,000 US in the first year and $750,000 in the second,[tpl]cite web| url = http://capgeek.com/players/display.php?id=352 | title = Eric Boulton's official annual salary | publisher =CapGeek | date= July 15, 2011 | accessdate = June 19, 2012[/tpl] joining former Atlanta Thrashers teammates Ilya Kovalchuk and Johan Hedberg.[tpl]cite news|first=Mike|last=Vorkunov|title=Adam Larsson, Devils' top pick, finally inks deal with team|url=http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2011/07/adam_larsson_devils_top_pick_f.html|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2011[/tpl] On June 30, 2012 the Devils bought out the remainder of Boulton's contract and the next day, Boulton proceeded to sign a one-year deal with the New York Islanders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=671145|title=Eric Boulton re-signs with New York Islanders for one year|date=May 17, 2013|work=National Hockey League|accessdate=January 8, 2014[/tpl] He re-signed with the Islanders for the following season as well.
