[[Monophyly]]

CATEGORIES: Phylogenetics

In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies).
Monophyly is contrasted with the terms paraphyly and polyphyly, which are most easily understood from the second diagram in this article. In current usage, a paraphyletic group consists of all of the descendants of a common ancestor minus one or more monophyletic groups. A paraphyletic group is thus 'nearly' monophyletic (consistent with the meaning of the prefix 'para', namely 'near' or 'alongside'.) A polyphyletic group is characterized by convergent features or habits (e. g., night-active primates, trees, aquatic insects); the features by which the group is differentiated from others are not inherited from a common ancestor.
These definitions have taken some time to be accepted. When the cladistic school of thought became mainstream in the 1960s, several alternative definitions were in use.  Indeed, taxonomists sometimes used terms without defining them, leading to confusion in the early literature,[tpl]cite book | last=Hennig|first=Willi|first2=D. (Translator)|last2=Davis|first3=R.

[/ref]  However, this broader definition encompasses both monophyletic and paraphyletic groups as defined above. Therefore, most scientists today restrict the term "monophyletic" to refer to groups consisting of all the descendants of one (hypothetical) common ancestor. However, when considering taxonomic groups such as genera and species, the most appropriate nature of their common ancestor is unclear.  Assuming that it would be one individual or mating pair is unrealistic for sexually reproducing species, which are by definition interbreeding populations.[tpl]cite book | last = Simpson | first = George | title = Principles of Animal Taxonomy | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 1961 | isbn = 0-231-02427-4 [/tpl]
