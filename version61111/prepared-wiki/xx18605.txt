==Energy (caloric) content==

Sucralose has no caloric content, and Splenda products have a lower caloric content than sugar. The actual caloric content of a single-serving (1-gram packet) of Splenda is 3.36 calories, 31% of the calories of a single-serving (2.8-gram packet) of granulated sugar (10.8 calories). In the United States, it is legally labelled "zero calories";USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory Database United States Department of Agriculture U.S. FDA regulations allow this "if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving".Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 2, Pg. 95 – 101.60 U.S. Food and Drug Administration Further, Splenda contains a relatively small amount of sucralose, little of which is metabolized; virtually all of Splenda's caloric content derives from the dextrose or highly fluffed maltodextrin "bulking agents" that give Splenda its volume. Like other carbohydrates, dextrose and maltodextrin have 3.75 calories per gram.  

==Cooking==

Unlike other artificial sweeteners, sucralose is heat stable up to [tpl]convert|450|F|C[/tpl] so Splenda can be used  as a replacement for table sugar in cooking and baking,[tpl]Cite book | title = Cooking Healthy with Splenda | author = JoAnna M. Lund  and Barbara Alpert | publisher = Perigee Trade | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-399-53025-8[/tpl] and there are Splenda products packaged specifically for this purpose.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.splenda.com/cooking-baking | title = Cooking and Baking Tips | publisher = Splenda.com[/tpl]  In product testing by Cook's Illustrated, the major drawback to cooking with Splenda was found to be that it does not produce the browning or caramelization the way table sugar does.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=10034  | title = Splenda | date = January 1, 2004 | publisher = Cook's Illustrated[/tpl]  However, "Cook's Illustrated" also found that desserts baked with Splenda were without "the artificial flavors that just about every other sugar substitute brings with it".

==Health and safety regulation==

Splenda usually contains 95% dextrose (D-glucose) and maltodextrin which the body readily metabolizes, combined with a small amount of mostly indigestible sucralose.  Sucralose is made by replacing three select hydrogen-oxygen groups on sucrose  (table sugar) molecules with three chlorine atoms. The tightly bound chlorine atoms create a molecular structure that is remarkably stable.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.foodinsight.org/Resources/Detail.aspx?topic=Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_Sucralose |title=Everything You Need to Know About Sucralose | publisher=International Food Information Council | accessdate=2010-03-17[/tpl]  Sucralose itself is recognized as safe to ingest as a diabetic sugar substitute,[tpl]cite journal | author=Grotz, V Lee; Henry, Robert R; McGill, Janet B; Prince, Melvin J; Shamoon, Harry; Trout, J Richard; Pi-Sunyer, F Xavier | title=Lack of effect of sucralose on glucose homeostasis in subjects with type 2 diabetes | url=http://www.adajournal.org/article/S0002-8223%2803%2901364-6/abstract| journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association  |year=2003  |volume=103 | issue=12 | pages=1607–12| doi=10.1016/j.jada.2003.09.021 | pmid=14647086[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title=Sucralose and diabetes | author=Roberts, Ashley | journal=Foods & Food Ingredients Journal of Japan | year=1999 | volume=182 | pages=49–55[/tpl] but some Splenda products may contain sugars or other carbohydrates that should be evaluated individually.  Research as of 2003 suggested that the amount of sucralose that can be consumed on a daily basis over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 15 mg/kg/day,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.diabetes.ca/cpg2003/chapters.aspx?table1acceptabledailyintakeofsweeteners.htm |title=2003 Clinical Practice Guidelines - Acceptable daily intake of sweeteners |work=Diabetes.ca |publisher=Canadian Diabetes Association |year=2003 |accessdate=2010-07-22[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] or about 1 g for a 70 kg (150 lb) person. This was revised downward in 2008 to 9 mg/kg/day, or about 0.6 g.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.diabetes.ca/for-professionals/resources/2008-cpg/ |title=2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines - Acceptable daily intake of sweeteners |format=PDF |work=Diabetes.ca |publisher=Canadian Diabetes Association |year=2008 |page=S41 |accessdate=2010-07-22[/tpl]
A repeated dose study of sucralose in human subjects concluded that "there is no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long-term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake".[tpl]cite journal|title=Repeated dose study of sucralose tolerance in human subjects|author=Baird, I.

Other studies have determined that sucralose is not a biologically inert compound, having possible toxic effects, including creation of dioxin-like compounds when sucralose is heated.

==Marketing controversy==

In 2006, Merisant, the maker of Equal, filed suit against McNeil Nutritionals in U.S. District Court, Philadelphia, alleging that Splenda's tagline "Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar" is misleading.  McNeil argued during the trial that it had never deceived consumers or set out to deceive them, since the product is in fact made from sugar.  Merisant asked that McNeil be ordered to surrender profits and modify its advertising.  The case ended with an agreement reached outside of court, with undisclosed settlement conditions.Browning, Lynnley (May 12, 2007) Artificial Sweetener Makers Reach Settlement on Slogan, New York Times  The lawsuit was the latest move in a long-simmering dispute.  In 2004, Merisant filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau regarding McNeil's advertising. McNeil alleged that Merisant's complaint was in retaliation for a ruling in federal court in Puerto Rico, which forced Merisant to stop packaging Equal in packages resembling Splenda's. McNeil filed suit in Puerto Rico seeking a ruling which would declare its advertising to not be misleading.  Following Merisant's lawsuit in Philadelphia, McNeil agreed to a jury trial and to the dismissal of its lawsuit in Puerto Rico.  However, on May 11, 2007, the parties reached a settlement on the case, the terms of which were not disclosed.  Currently, Splenda is advertised with the slogan, "It starts with sugar.  It tastes like sugar.  But it's not sugar."Splenda.com
In 2007, Merisant France prevailed in the Commercial Court of Paris against subsidiaries of McNeil Nutritionals LLC. The court awarded Merisant $54,000 in damages and ordered the defendants to cease advertising claims found to violate French consumer protection laws, including the slogans "Because it comes from sugar, sucralose tastes like sugar" and "With sucralose: Comes from sugar and tastes like sugar".Heller, Lorraine (May 14, 2007) Splenda ad slogans banned in France, Food Navigator
A Sugar Association complaint to the Federal Trade Commission stated that "Splenda is not a natural product. It is not cultivated or grown and it does not occur in nature."Splenda Ads Condemned as Misleading to Consumers by International Advertising Boards, Sugar Farmers and Processors, Sugar Association Press Release, November 2, 2006  McNeil Nutritionals, the manufacturer of Splenda, has responded that its "advertising represents the products in an accurate and informative manner and complies with applicable advertising rules in the countries where Splenda brand products are marketed."Sugar industry files complaint over Splenda, Reuters (MSNBC.com), Nov. 2, 2006  The U.S. Sugar Association created a web site to criticise  sucralose which cites an association-sponsored study."The Truth About Splenda" website by the Sugar Association
