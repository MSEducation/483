[[Gavialidae]]

CATEGORIES: Crocodilians

Gavialidae is a family of reptiles within the order Crocodilia.  Gavialidae has conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), which is native to India. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been thought to be a member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. However, numerous molecular studies have consistently shown that the two species are very closely related, supporting the view that they are in fact in the same family.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2007.02.005[/tpl]
Gavialids are large semiaquatic reptiles, resembling crocodiles, but with a much thinner snout. The thin snout is used to catch fish, as gavialids lack the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size.[tpl]cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G. & Zweifel, R.G.|author= Magnusson, William E.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 229–230|isbn= 0-12-178560-2[/tpl]

Family Gavialidae
In addition, molecular evidence indicates the tomistomines belong to this group, although morphological evidence has been cited to place them in Crocodylidae:
