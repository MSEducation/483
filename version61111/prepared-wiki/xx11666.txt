The ''Virginia''-class, also known as the SSN-774-class, is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (hull classification symbol SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. They were conceived as a less expensive alternative to the Seawolf-class attack submarines, designed during the Cold War era, and they are planned to replace the older of the Los Angeles-class submarines, twenty of which have already been decommissioned (from a total of 62 built). The class was developed under the codename Centurion, renamed to NSSN (New SSN) later on. The "Centurion Study" was initiated in February 1991. Virginia-class submarines will be acquired through 2043, and are expected to remain in service past 2060.Navy Considers Future After Virginia-Class Subs - Defensetech.org, 12 February 2014

==Innovations==

The Virginia class incorporates several innovations not previously incorporated into other submarine classes.[tpl]cite book |title=Combat Fleets of the World, 1998–1999 |last= Baker|first=A. D. III |year=1998 |location= USA|isbn= 1-55750-111-4|page=1005 |url= [/tpl]

===Photonics masts===

Instead  of a traditional periscope, the class utilizes a pair of AN/BVS-1 telescoping photonics masts located outside the pressure hull. Each mast contains high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through fiber optic data lines through signal processors to the control center. Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on LCD interfaces in the command center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/winter99/virginia_class.htm |title=Virginia Class |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl]

===Propulsor===

In contrast to a traditional bladed propellor, the Virginia class uses pump-jet propulsors (built by BAE Systems),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_049643/bae-systems-delivers-first-us-navy-submarine-propulsor-from-louisville-facility-receives-additional-243-million-contract |title=Newsroom |publisher=BAE Systems |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl] originally developed for the Royal Navy's Swiftsure class submarines. The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of cavitation, and allows quieter operation.

===Improved sonar systems===

Virginia class submarines are equipped with a bow-mounted spherical active/passive sonar array, a wide aperture lightweight fiber optic sonar array (three flat panels mounted low along either side of the hull), as well as two high frequency active sonars mounted in the sail and keel (under the bow). The submarines are also equipped with a low frequency towed sonar array and a high frequency towed sonar array.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tech.military.com/equipment/view/138675/ssn774-virginia-class-fast-attack-submarine.html |title=SSN774 Virginia-class Fast Attack Submarine |publisher=Tech.military.com |accessdate=2012-09-30[/tpl] The chin-mounted (below the bow) high frequency sonar supplements the (spherical/LAB) main sonar array enabling safer operations in coastal waters as well as improving ASW performance.
The [tpl]USS|California|SSN-781|6[/tpl] was the first Virginia-class submarine with the advanced electromagnetic signature reduction system built into it, but this system is being retrofitted into the other submarines of the class.

==History==

Virginia class submarines were the first US Navy warships designed with the help of computer-aided design (CAD) and visualization technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.submarinesuppliers.org/programs/index.php |title=Submarine Industrial Base Council |publisher=Submarinesuppliers.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl]
Around 9 million work hours are required for the completion of a single Virginia class submarine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/default.aspx |title=Naval Submarine League |publisher=Navalsubleague.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl]http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/documents/Submarine%20Road%20Show%20NSL%2017%20Aug%202011%20NSL.ppsx Over 4,000 suppliers are involved in the construction of the Virginia class.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/double_vision.html|title=Double Vision: Planning to Increase Virginia-Class Production|first=Jim|last=Roberts|year=2011|work=Undersea Warfare|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] Each submarine is projected to make 14-15 deployments during its 33-year service life.[tpl]cite web|last=Admiral |first=Rear |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-06/sweet-smell-acquisition-success |title=The Sweet Smell of Acquisition Success | U.S. Naval Institute |publisher=Usni.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15[/tpl]
The Virginia-class was intended, in part, as a cheaper ($1.8 billion vs $2.8 billion) alternative to the Seawolf-class submarines, whose production run was stopped after just three boats had been completed. To reduce costs, the Virginia-class submarines use many "commercial off-the-shelf" (or COTS) components, especially in their computers and data networks. In practice, they actually cost less than $1.8 billion (in fiscal year 2009 dollars) each, due to improvements in shipbuilding technology.
In hearings before both House of Representatives and Senate committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and expert witnesses testified that the current procurement plans of the Virginia-class – one per year at present, accelerating to two per year beginning in 2012 – would result in high unit costs and (according to some of the witnesses and to some of the committee chairmen) an insufficient number of attack submarines. In a 10 March 2005 statement to the House Armed Services Committee, Ronald O'Rourke of the CRS testified that, assuming the production rate remains as planned, "production economies of scale for submarines would continue to remain limited or poor."
In 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Company built a quarter-scale version of a Virginia class submarine dubbed Large Scale Vehicle II (LSV II) Cutthroat. The vehicle was designed as an affordable test platform for new technologies.
The Virginia-class is built through an industrial arrangement designed to keep both GD Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (the only two U.S. shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered vessels) in the submarine-building business. Under the present arrangement, the Newport News facility builds the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room and control room. The facilities alternate work on the reactor plant as well as the final assembly, test, outfit and delivery.
O’Rourke wrote in 2004 that, "Compared to a one-yard strategy, approaches involving two yards may be more expensive but offer potential offsetting benefits." Among the claims of "offsetting benefits" that O'Rourke attributes to supporters of a two-facility construction arrangement is that it "would permit the United States to continue building submarines at one yard even if the other yard is rendered incapable of building submarines permanently or for a sustained period of time by a catastrophic event of some kind", including an enemy attack.
In order to get the submarine's price down to $2 billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400 million in costs off each submarine's price tag. The project was dubbed "2 for 4 in 12," referring to the Navy's desire to buy two boats for $4 billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats a year earlier, in FY-11, meaning that officials would not be able to get the $2 billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008, that the program was only $30 million away from achieving the $2 billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.http://insidedefense.com/secure/defense_docnum.asp?f=defense_2002.ask&docnum=NAVY-21-12-4 [tpl]dead link |date=September 2010[/tpl]
The Virginia Class Program Office received the David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award in 1996, 1998, 2008, "for excelling in four specific award criteria: reducing life-cycle costs; making the acquisition system more efficient, responsive, and timely; integrating defense with the commercial base and practices; and promoting continuous improvement of the acquisition process".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=40781 |title=Navy's Virginia Class Program Recognized for Acquisition Excellence |publisher=Navy.mil |date= 8 November 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl]
In December 2008, the Navy signed a $14 billion contract with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman to supply eight submarines. The contractors will deliver one submarine in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010, and two submarines on each of fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2013.[ref]

[tpl]dead link |date=September 2010[/tpl][/ref] This contract will bring the Navy's Virginia-class fleet to 18 submarines. And in December 2010, the United States Congress passed a defense authorization bill that expanded production to two subs per year.  Two submarine-per-year production resumed on 2 September 2011 with commencement of SSN-787 construction.
On 21 June 2008, the Navy christened [tpl]USS|New Hampshire|SSN-778|3[/tpl], the first Block II submarine. This boat was delivered eight months ahead of schedule and $54 million under budget. Block II boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300 million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2 billion per boat and the construction of two new boats per year.  Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this class will include a software system that can monitor and reduce their electromagnetic signatures when needed.[tpl]cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-774-spiral-1.htm |title=SSN-774 Virginia-class NSSN New Attack Submarine |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2012-09-30[/tpl]

Professor Ross Babbage of the Australian National University has called on Australia to buy or lease a dozen Virginia class submarines from the United States, rather than locally build 12 replacements for its Collins class submarines.
In 2013, just as two per year sub construction was supposed to get started, Congress failed to resolve the United States fiscal cliff, forcing the Navy to attempt to "de-obligate" construction funds.[tpl]cite web|author=Mar 04, 2013 @ 21:38 |url=http://blogs.defensenews.com/intercepts/2013/03/u-s-navy-sets-budget-cutting-plans-in-motion/ |title=U.S. Navy Sets Budget-cutting Plans in Motion. |publisher=Blogs.defensenews.com |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl]

===Technology barriers===

Because of the low rate of Virginia production, the Navy entered into a program with DARPA to overcome technology barriers to lower the cost of attack submarines so that more could be built, to maintain the size of the fleet.
These include:

===Virginia Payload Module===

The Block III submarines have two multipurpose Virginia Payload Tubes(VPT) replacing the dozen single purpose cruise missile launch tubes.[tpl]cite news |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/navy-sub-program-stumbles-ssn-north-dakota-delayed-by-launch-tube-troubles/ |title=Navy Sub Program Stumbles: SSN North Dakota Delayed By Launch Tube Troubles |last1=Freedberg Jr. |first1=Sydney J. |date=16 April 2014 |website=breakingdefense.com |publisher=Breaking Media, Inc. |accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl]
The Block V submarines built from 2019 onward will have an additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section, increasing their overall length. The VPM will add four more VPTs of the same diameter and greater height, located on the centerline, carrying up to seven Tomahawk missiles apiece, that would replace some of the capabilities lost when the SSGN conversion [tpl]sclass-|Ohio|submarine|1[/tpl]s are retired from the fleet.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/issues/archives/issue_47/virginia.html |title=The Virginia Payload Module |last1=Hasslinger |first1=Karl |last2=Pavlos |first2=John |date=Winter 2012 |website=www.public.navy.mil |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] Initially eight payload tubes/silos were planned[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/issues/archives/issue_47/virginia.html|title=The Virginia Payload Module: A Revolutionary Concept for Attack Submarines |first1=Karl |last1=Hasslinger |first2=John| last2=Pavlos |year=2012|work=Undersea Warfare|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] but this was later rejected in favour of 4 tubes installed in a 70 foot long module between the operations compartment and the propulsion spaces.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2013/11/04/navy-selects-virginia-payload-module-design-concept |title=Navy Selects Virginia Payload Module Design Concept | USNI News |publisher=News.usni.org |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2013-11-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.usni.org/2013/10/24/document-peo-subs-overview-u-s-navy-undersea-programs#more-5177 |title=Document: PEO Subs Overview of U.S. Navy Undersea Programs | USNI News |publisher=News.usni.org |date=2013-10-24 |accessdate=2013-11-17[/tpl]http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/issues/archives/issue_47/virginia_2.html
The VPM could potentially carry (non-nuclear) medium-range ballistic missiles.

===Block I===

Modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction.[tpl]cite web|last=Patani |first=Arif |url=http://navylive.dodlive.mil/2012/09/24/next-generation-ohio-class/ |title=Next Generation Ohio-Class |publisher=Navylive.dodlive.mil |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl] Earlier submarines (e.g. Los Angeles class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which when joined with other modules forms a Virginia class submarine.http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - VA Class ASNE Paper FINAL_FIG-4-text change.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl] 

[/ref]

===Block II===

Block II boats were built in four sections rather than ten sections, saving about $300 million per boat. Block II boats (excluding SSN-778) were also built under a multi-year procurement agreement as opposed to a block-buy contract in Block I, enabling savings in the range of $400 million ($80 million per boat).[tpl]cite web|last=Butler |first=John|url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-06/sweet-smell-acquisition-success |title=The Sweet Smell of Acquisition Success | U.S. Naval Institute |publisher=Usni.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32418.pdf|title=Navy Virginia (SSN-774) Class Attack Submarine Procurement: Background and Issues for Congress|first=Ronald|last=O'Rourke|date=September 27, 2013|work=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] As a result of improvements in the construction process, New Hampshire (SSN-778) was 500 million USD cheaper, required 3.7 million fewer labor hours to build (25% less) thus shortening the construction period by 15 months (20% less) compared to USS Virginia (SSN-774).

===Block III===

[tpl]USS|North Dakota|SSN-784|1[/tpl] through approximately SSN-791 are planned to make up the Third Block or "Flight" and began construction in 2009. Block III subs will feature a revised bow with a Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array, as well as technology from Ohio-class SSGNs (2 VLS tubes each containing 6 missiles).

===Block IV===

The most costly shipbuilding contract in history was awarded on 28 April 2014 as prime contractor General Dynamic Electric Boat took on a $17.6 billion contract for ten Block IV Virginia-class attack submarines. The main improvement over the Block III is the reduction of major maintenance periods from four to three, increasing each ship's total lifetime deployments by one.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/04/28/u-s-navy-awards-largest-shipbuilding-contract-service-history |title=U.S. Navy Awards ‘Largest Shipbuilding Contract’ in Service History |last1=LaGrone |first1=Sam |date=28 April 2014 |website=usni.org |publisher=U.S. NAVAL INSTITUTE |accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl]

===Block V===

Block V subs may incorporate the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which would give guided-missile capability when the SSGNs are retired from service.

===Future acquisitions===

The Navy plans to acquire at least 30 Virginia class submarines, however, more recent data provided by the Naval Submarine League (in 2011) and the Congressional Budget Office (in 2012) seems to imply that more than 30 may eventually be built. The Naval Submarine League believes that up to 10 Block V boats will be built.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/default.aspx |title=Naval Submarine League |publisher=Navalsubleague.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-25[/tpl]
The same source also states that 10 additional submarines could be built after Block V submarines, with 5 in the so-called Block VI and 5 in Block VII, largely due to the delays experienced with the "Improved Virginia". These 20 submarines (10 Block V, 5 Block VI, 5 Block VII) would carry VPM bringing the total number of Virginia class submarines to 48 (including the 28 submarines in Blocks I, II, III and IV). The CBO in its 2012 report states that 33 Virginia class submarines will be procured in the 2013-2032 timeframe,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/07-25-12-NavyShipbuilding_0.pdf|title=An Analysis of the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2013 Shipbuilding Plan |first=Eric |last=Labs |date=July 2012|work=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] resulting in 49 submarines in total since 16 were already procured by the end of 2012. Such a long production run seems unlikely but it should be noted that another naval program, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, is still ongoing even though the first vessel was procured in 1985.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32109.pdf|title=Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs: Background and Issues for Congress|first=Ronald|last=O'Rourke|date=October 22, 2013|work=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Admiral |first=Vice |url=http://www.usni.org/print/25780 |title=Now Hear This - The Right Destroyer at the Right Time |publisher=Usni.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17[/tpl] However, other sources believe that production will end with Block V.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-774.htm |title=SSN-774 Virginia-class NSSN New Attack Submarine |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-25[/tpl] In addition, data provided in CBO reports tends to vary considerably compared to earlier editions.[ref]

===Improved Virginia===

Initially dubbed Future Attack Submarine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/navy/submarines/fas.html |title=Federation of American Scientists :: Future Attack Submarine |publisher= Fas.org |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-02-25[/tpl] Improved Virginia-class submarines will be an evolved version of the Virginia-class. It was planned that the first "Improved" Virginia-class submarine would be procured in 2025. However, according to some reports their introduction has been pushed back by eight years, to 2033.
