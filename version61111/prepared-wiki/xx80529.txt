The Cunene River (Portuguese spelling) or Kunene River (Namibian spelling) is a river in Southern Africa. It flows from the Angola highlands south to the border with Namibia. It then flows west along the border until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the few perennial rivers in the region. It is about [tpl]convert|1050|km|mi|0[/tpl] long, with a drainage basin [tpl]convert|106560|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] in area. Its mean annual discharge is 174 m³/s (6,145 cfs) at its mouth.[ref]

The Epupa Falls lie on the river. Olushandja Dam dams the river.

==Proposed hydroelectric dam==

The Namibian government  proposed in the late 90's to build the Epupa Dam, a controversial hydroelectric dam on the Cunene.  2012 the Government if Namibia and Angola announced plans to jointly build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains. The dam threatens the local ecosystem and therefore the economic basis of the local Himba ethnic group. February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued a Declaration to the African Union and to the OHCHR of the United Nations, titled "Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains" outlines the fierce objections against the dam from the traditional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River.
September 2012, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples visited the Himba, and heard their concerns.
November 23, 2012, hundreds of Himba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia’s plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2910=eng|title=Namibia: Indigenous semi-nomadic Himba and Zemba march in protest against dam, mining and human rights violations|publisher=EarthPeople.org|accessdate=2012-Nov 24-12[/tpl]

==Attraction==

Tourists frequent campsites or lodges in Epupa which offer water sports on the river including rafting and canoeing.http://www.kaoko-namibia.com/epupa_falls.html There are ancient baobob trees alongside the gorge, and there is an attractive and well-kept viewpoint high above the village and falls, but both the latter are spoiled by broken bottles and abundant garbage.
