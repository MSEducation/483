The Independence Dike Swarm is a major Late Jurassic dike swarm extending over [tpl]convert|373|mi[/tpl] from the eastern Transverse Ranges northward to the east-central Sierra Nevada in southeastern California, United States. 
The swarm consists of hundreds of dikes, filled with mafic to felsic rocks and are individually about [tpl]convert|10|ft|0[/tpl] in width. These dikes may be the roots of linear-fissure-array supervolcanoes.Geological Society of America Field Guidebook
