[[Maecenas Foundation]]

CATEGORIES: Foundations based in Switzerland, Gnostic apocrypha, Basel

The Maecenas Foundation is a Swiss foundation whose sole officer is Mario Roberty, a Swiss attorney. Centered in the city of Basel, it came to notice in 2005 when Swiss art dealer Frieda Nussberger-Tchacos, the owner of the Codex Tchacos, which contains the Gospel of Judas, informed the press that the manuscript would be donated to Maecenas for conservation and publication. The foundation reached a commercial agreement with National Geographic, and sold the copyright of the Coptic text to the magazine. Roberty was previously best known as Nussberger-Tchacos' lawyer.
The creation of a foundation to contain the Gospel of Judas was proposed earlier on by the various people who owned it between 2000â€“2005. Papers online at Michel van Rijn's site indicate that such shell foundations were part of the process of marketing the text by the art dealers.michelvanrijn.nl. Retrieved March 5, 2007.
