The al-Dawayima massacre describes the killing of civilians by the Israeli army (IDF) that took place in the Palestinian Arab town of al-Dawayima on October 28, 1948 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The incident occurred after the town was captured by the IDF's 89th Commando Battalion during Operation Yoav. The battalion, whose first commander was Moshe Dayan, was composed of former Irgun and Lehi forces. They encountered only "light resistance" from the villagers, whose core clan, the Ahdibs, traced their ancestry to the conquest of Palestine by Umar ibn Khattab in the 7th century.Morris, 2004, p. 469. Dawayima was situated a few kilometres west of Hebron. At the time, it had a population of 6,000 since some 4,000 Palestinian Arab refugees had taken refuge in the village prior to the massacre.UN Doc. Com Tech/W.3 United Nation Conciliation Commission for Palestine Technical committee Report Submitted by the Arab Refugee Congress Dated 14 June 1949 The Haganah intelligence service (HIS) considered the village to be 'very friendly'.Benny Morris, (2004) p. 469 Fatality estimates range from 80 to 200 men, women and children.

Benny Morris has estimated "hundreds" of people were killed,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/survival-of-the-fittest-1.61345 | work=Haaretz | title=Survival of the fittest | date=08.01.04[/tpl] he also reports on the IDF investigation, which concluded around 100 villagers had been killed, and cites an account by a Mapam member, based on an interview with an Israeli soldier, who reported 80 to 100 men, women and children killed.Benny Morris (2004), The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p. 469.Benny Morris (2008), 1948: An History the First Arab-Israeli War, p. 333.

==Eyewitness accounts==

Benny Morris writes:

Also according to Benny Morris, the occupying forces held the villagers responsible for taking part in the Kfar Etzion massacre on the grounds that the 'Loot of the Etzion Block' was in the village, and therefore took revenge. A trooper, Avraham Vered, added another motive for revenge, the fact that the village was in the Hebron hills, some of whose villagers had been responsible for the 1929 Hebron Massacre.Morris, 2004 p. 494 note 40

==The UN inspection team==

Yigal Allon cabled General Yitzhak Sadeh to check "the 'rumours' that the 89th Battilion had 'killed many tens of prisoners on the day of the conquest of al-Dawayima', and to respond".Morris, 2004. p. 470 On the 5 November probably worried about a UN investigation Allon then ordered Sadeh to instruct the unit:
Although unbeknownst to Allon, the 89th had cleaned up the site of the massacre on 1 November 1948.Morris, 2004, p. 495. endnote 49
On 7 November, UN inspectors visited the scene of the village to investigate accusations of a massacre, the accusation being made by the Egyptians and refugees from the village. The team found "several demolished buildings and one corpse but no other physical evidence of a massacre".Morris, (2004), p. 471. The UN team did however take a witness statement from the village mukhtar
Isser Be'eri, the commander of the IDF intelligence service, who conducted an independent investigation, concluded that 80 people had been killed during the occupation of Al-Dawayima and that 22 had been captured and executed subsequently. Be'eri recommended prosecution of the platoon OC, who had confessed to the massacre, but notwithstanding his recommendations no one was put on trial or punished.Morris, (2004), pp. 470–1
On 14 November the Israeli cabinet instructed Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to also launch an investigation. Its findings remain secret.

==Reactions==

The American consul in Jerusalem, William Burdett, who had received news about the massacre reported on November 16 to Washington "Investigation by UN indicates massacre occurred but observers are unable to determine number of persons involved."
News of the massacre reached village communities in the western Hebron and Judean foothills "possibly precipitating further flight".Morris, 2004, p. 471.
