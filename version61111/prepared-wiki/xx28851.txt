[tpl]nihongo|Space Invaders|スペースインベーダー|Supēsu Inbēdā[/tpl] is an arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.
It was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry (see golden age of video arcade games). When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.
The game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often used as a synecdoche representing video games as a whole.

==Gameplay==

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.[tpl]cite book| editor= Craig Glenday| title= Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008| series= Guinness World Records| date= March 11, 2008| publisher= Guinness| isbn= 978-1-904994-21-3| page= 237| chapter= Top 100 Arcade Games: Top 5[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|date=September 2007| title= The Definitive Space Invaders| journal= Retro Gamer| publisher= Imagine Publishing|issue= 41| pages= 24–33[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89612882| title = Replay: the Evolution of Video Game Music| publisher = National Public Radio| work = All Things Considered| author = Seabrook, Andrea| date = April 12, 2008| accessdate =May 12, 2008| authorlink = Andrea Seabrook[/tpl]
The aliens attempt to destroy the cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed. The laser cannon is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers—the number varies by version—that are gradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens and player.

==Development==

Space Invaders was created by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it.[tpl]Cite journal|date=January 2008| title= Classic GI: Space Invaders| journal= Game Informer| author = Staff| publisher= Game Stop|issue= 177| pages= 108–109[/tpl] The game's inspiration is reported to have come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens.[tpl]cite web| url = http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=223| title = Arcade Fantastic – Part 1| publisher = GameSpy| author = Williams, Kevin| accessdate =September 19, 2008| deadurl=yes | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109205047/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=223| archivedate = November 9, 2007[/tpl] However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics.[tpl]cite journal| title = Nishikado-San Speaks| journal = Retro Gamer| publisher = Live Publishing| author = Staff| issue = 3| page = 35[/tpl] Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout, but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3900/the_history_of_pong_avoid_missing_.php| title = The History of Pong: Avoid Missing Game to Start Industry| first = Bill| last = Loguidice| coauthors = Matt Barton| publisher = Gamasutra| date = January 9, 2009| accessdate =January 10, 2009[/tpl]
Early enemy designs included tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was not satisfied with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying.[tpl]Cite journal|date=October 2005| title = The Creation of Space Invaders| journal= Edge| publisher= Future plc| issue= 154| url = http://www.next-gen.biz/news/creation-space-invaders| accessdate =May 5, 2008| author= Kiphshidze, N; Zubiashvili, T; Chagunava, K| pages= 7–13| issn= 1512-0112| pmid= 18323584[/tpl] Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168373| title = Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Space Invaders| publisher = 1UP.com| author = Edwards, Benj| accessdate =July 11, 2008[/tpl] After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.

===Hardware===

Because microcomputers in Japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, and features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9662| title = Space Invaders Videogame by Bally Midway (1978)| publisher = Killer List of Videogames| accessdate =May 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite book| title = The Art of Game Worlds| first = Dave| last = Morris| page = 166| publisher = HarperCollins| isbn = 0-06-072430-7| year = 2004[/tpl] Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware the most difficult part of the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[tpl]cite book| title = Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition| editor1-first= Craig| editor1-last= Glenday| year= 2009| publisher= Guinness World Records| chapter = Record-Breaking Games/Space Games| isbn= 978-1-904994-45-9|page= 98[/tpl]
Space Invaders was first released in a cocktail-table format with black and white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a space background. Later Japanese releases also used colored cellophane. The cabinet artwork features large, humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.

==Music==

Despite its simplicity, the music to Space Invaders was revolutionary in the gaming industry. Videogame scholar Andrew Schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that would have a significant impact on the development of game music:

==Impact and legacy==

After the first few months following its release in Japan, the game became very popular. Specialty arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets, and by the end of 1978, Taito had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over $600 million in Japan alone.[tpl]cite journal|title=Can Asteroids Conquer Space Invaders?|journal=Electronic Games|date=Winter 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=30–33 31|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_winter81.pdf|accessdate=February 1, 2012[/tpl] Within two years by 1980,[tpl]citation|title=Genesis II, creation and recreation with computers|author=Dale Peterson|publisher=Reston Publishing|year=1983|isbn=0-8359-2434-3|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL1YAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=May 1, 2011|page=175|quote=By 1980, some 300,000 Space Invader video arcade games were in use in Japan, and an additional 60,000 in the United States.[/tpl] Taito had sold over 300,000 Space Invaders arcade machines in Japan,[tpl]citation|title=Asia Pacific perspectives, Japan|volume=1|author=Jiji Gaho Sha, inc.|year=2003|publisher=University of Virginia|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CTRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=April 9, 2011|page=57|quote=At that time, a game for use in entertainment arcades was considered a hit if it sold 1000 units; sales of Space Invaders topped 300,000 units in Japan and 60,000 units overseas.[/tpl] in addition to 60,000 machines in the United States,[tpl]cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| chapter = Arcade Classics| page = 345| publisher = Random House| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004[/tpl] where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine,[tpl]citation|title=Video arcades rival Broadway theatre and girlie shows in NY|work=InfoWorld|date=April 12, 1982|volume=4|issue=14|issn=0199-6649|page=15|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YjAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15|accessdate=May 1, 2011[/tpl] within one year.

Taito released it for the NES in 1985 (Japan only).

An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins—and subsequent production increase—in Japan attributed to the game,[tpl]cite book| editor= Craig Glenday| title= Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008| series= Guinness World Records| date= March 11, 2008| publisher= Guinness| isbn= 978-1-904994-21-3| pages= 106–107| chapter= Record Breaking Games: Shooting Games Roundup[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2005/jul/24/games.shopping| title=A life through video games| publisher=Guardian Media Group|work=The Observer  |location=UK| author=Richards, Giles |date=July 24, 2005| accessdate=May 22, 2008[/tpl] although in actuality, 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years.[tpl]cite journal| last=Fox | first=Mark | year=2012| title=Space Invaders targets coins |journal= World Coin News |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=35–37 |publisher=Krause Publications |url=http://www.academia.edu/2568838/Space_Invaders_targets_coins |accessdate=11 March 2013[/tpl] The claim also doesn't hold up to logical scrutiny; arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation. Reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate "nothing out of the ordinary ... during the height of the Space Invaders invasion."
Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1645158,00.html|work=Time| title=10 Questions for Shigeru Miyamoto| date=July 19, 2007| author=Sayre, Carolyn| accessdate=September 4, 2007[/tpl] Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games.[tpl]cite web|last=Snyder|first=Daniel D.|title=How Hideo Kojima Became a Legendary Video-Game Designer|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/the-things-that-made-the-man-who-made-metal-gear/254831/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=March 22, 2012|date=March 21, 2012[/tpl] Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.next-gen.biz/features/30-defining-moments-gaming| title = The 30 Defining Moments in Gaming| publisher = Future plc| work = Edge| author= Edge Staff| date = August 13, 2007| accessdate =September 18, 2008[/tpl] Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.
Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cyberspace Handbook|first=Jason|last=Whittaker|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122[/tpl] According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP.com stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television.

===Remakes and sequels===

Space Invaders has been remade on numerous platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated versions of the original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay options—for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay. Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay.[tpl]cite web| url = http://psp.ign.com/articles/863/863894p1.html| title = Space Invaders Extreme Set for US| publisher = IGN| author = Hatfield, Daemon| date = April 2, 2008| accessdate =June 7, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|date=May 2008| journal = Official Nintendo Magazine| title = Space Invaders| issue= 29| page= 46[/tpl] A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon.[tpl]cite web| url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/882/882265p1.html| title = Space Invaders Set for WiiWare| publisher = IGN| author = IGN Staff| date = June 17, 2008| accessdate =August 19, 2008[/tpl]
In 1980, Bally Midway released a pinball version of the game. However, few elements from the original game are included, and the aliens instead resemble the xenomorphs from the film Alien; Bally Midway was later sued over the game's resemblance to designs by H. R. Giger.[tpl]Cite journal| date= January 2008| title= A Whole Different Ball Game| journal= Retro Gamer| publisher= Imagine Publishing|issue= 45| page= 47[/tpl] Different ports have been met with mixed receptions; the Atari 2600 version was very successful while the Nintendo Entertainment System version was poorly received.
Taito has released several arcade sequels that built upon the basic design of the original. The first was Space Invaders Part II in 1979;[tpl]cite web|title=Space Invaders Part II|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=1036|work=The Arcade Flyer Archive|publisher=Killer List of Videogames|accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Davies|first=Jonti|title=Space Invaders Pocket|url=http://uk.psp.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/space-invaders-pocket/614422p1.html|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=September 27, 2011|date=May 16, 2005[/tpl] it featured color graphics, an attract mode, and new gameplay elements, and added an intermission between gameplay.  According to the Killer List of Video Games, this was the first video game to include an intermission.Space Invaders Deluxe, klov.com.  Accessed on line March 28, 2011. The game also allowed the player with the top score to sign their name on the high score table.[tpl]cite web|title=The Definitive Space Invaders|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/894697/the_definitive_space_invaders_part_1.html|work=NowGamer|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=January 19, 2009[/tpl] This version was released in the United States as Deluxe Space Invaders (also known as Space Invaders Deluxe), but featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city background. Another arcade sequel, titled Space Invaders II, was released exclusively in the United States. It was in a cocktail-table format with very fast alien firing and a competitive two-player mode. During the summer of 1985, Return of the Invaders was released with updated color graphics, and more complex movements and attack patterns for the aliens. Subsequent arcade sequels included Super Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders DX, and Space Invaders [tpl]'[/tpl]95. Each game introduced minor gameplay additions to the original design. Like the original game, several of the arcade sequels have become collector's items, though some are considered rarer. In 2002, Taito released Space Raiders, a third-person shooter reminiscent of Space Invaders.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/spaceraiders/similar.html?mode=versions| title=Space Raiders: Release Summary| publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=April 30, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite book| editor = ed.

===In popular culture===

Many publications and websites use the pixelated alien graphic as an icon for video games in general, including video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, technology website Ars Technica, and concert event Video Games Live. There have also been Space Invaders themed merchandising, including necklaces and puzzles.[tpl]cite journal|last=Paige|first=Earl|title=Children's Video Promotions Help Boost Volume|journal=Billboard (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Billboard|date=September 25, 1982|volume=94|issue=38|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT19&dq=Space+Invaders|accessdate=March 4, 2012|page=19|issn=0006-2510[/tpl]
The game—and references to it—has appeared in numerous facets of popular culture. Soon after the game's release, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium popularized by Space Invaders aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first electronic sports event and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby. The Arcade Awards ceremony was created that same year to honour the best video games, with Space Invaders winning the first Game of the Year award.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Arcade Awards|journal=Electronic Games|date=Winter 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=38–9|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_winter81.pdf|accessdate=February 1, 2012[/tpl] The impact of Space Invaders on the video game industry has been compared to that of The Beatles in the pop music industry.[tpl]cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Jeremy|title=Technology: Mortal Apathy?|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/08/technology/08MIDW.html|accessdate=March 4, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2002[/tpl] Considered "the first blockbuster video game," Space Invaders became synonymous with video games worldwide for some time.[tpl]citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|page=18|publisher=BradyGames|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|accessdate=March 27, 2011[/tpl]
