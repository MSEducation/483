While fasting from dawn until sunset, Muslims refrain from consuming food, drinking liquids, smoking, and engaging in sexual relations; in some interpretations they also refrain from swearing. Food and drink is served daily, before sunrise and after sunset.Islam, Andrew Egan - 2002 - page 24Dubai - Page 189, Andrea Schulte-Peevers - 2010 According to Islam, the thawab (rewards) of fasting are many, but in this month they are believed to be multiplied.[tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl] Fasting for Muslims during Ramadan typically includes the increased offering of salat (prayers) and recitation of the Quran.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/006-sat.php |title=  Sunan Abu-Dawud - (The Book of Prayer) - Detailed Injunctions about Ramadan, Hadith 1370 |first= Sulayman |last= Abu Dawud-Ibn-Ash'ath-AsSijisstani |work= Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement of The University of Southern California |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2391-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-199.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 199. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl]

==In the Quran==

Chapter 2, Revelation 185 of the Quran states:
 The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be thankful.[tpl]cite quran|2|185[/tpl] 
Thus, according to the Quran, Muhammad first received revelations in the lunar month of Ramadan. Therefore, the month of Ramadan is considered to be the most sacred month of the Islamic calendar, the recording of which began with the Hijra.

==Important dates==

The beginning and end of Ramadan are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar.

===Beginning===

Hilāl (the crescent) is typically a day (or more) after the astronomical new moon. Since the new moon marks the beginning of the new month, Muslims can usually safely estimate the beginning of Ramadan.Hilal Sighting & Islamic Dates: Issues and Solution Insha'Allaah. Hilal Sighting Committee of North America (website). Retrieved 19 August 2009. However, to many Muslims, this is not in accordance with authenticated Hadiths stating that visual confirmation per region is recommended. The consistent variations of a day have existed since the time of Muhammad.[tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2466-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-124.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 124 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl]

===Night of Power===

Laylat al-Qadr, which in Arabic means "the night of power" or "the night of decree," is considered the most holy night of the year.[tpl]Cite book | last = Robinson | first = Neal | title = Islam: A Concise Introduction | publisher = Georgetown University Press | year = 1999 | location = Washington | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-87840-224-1[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012[/tpl] This is the night in which Muslims believe the first revelation of the Quran was sent down to Muhammad stating that this night was "better than one thousand months proper worship, as stated in Chapter 97:3 of the Qu'ran.
Also, generally, Laylat al-Qadr is believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last 10 days of Ramadan, i.e., the night of the 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th. The Dawoodi Bohra Community believe that 23rd night is laylat al Qadr.[tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/65-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2032.%20Praying%20at%20Night%20In%20Ramadhan%20(Taraweeh)/2479-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-032-hadith-number-238.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 032 (Praying at Night In Ramadhan), Hadith 238|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012[/tpl]

===End===

The holiday of Eid al-Fitr الفطر),(Bengali: ঈদুল ফিত্‌র), "festivity of breaking the fast" marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month, Shawwal. This first day of the following month is declared after another crescent new moon has been sighted or the completion of 30 days of fasting if no visual sighting is possible due to weather conditions. This first day of Shawwal is called Eid al-Fitr.  Eid al-Fitr may also be a reference towards the festive nature of having endured the month of fasting successfully and returning to the more natural disposition (fitra) of being able to eat, drink and resume intimacy with spouses during the day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Practices during Ramadan==

The predominant practice in Ramadan is fasting from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhoor, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the iftar. Considering the high diversity of the global Muslim population, it is impossible to describe typical suhoor or iftar meals.
Muslims also engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan.

===Fasting===

Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations and generally sinful speech and behavior. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control,Why Ramadan brings us together; BBC, 01 September 2008 sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate; thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat).Help for the Heavy at Ramadan, Washington Post, 27 September 2008
It becomes compulsory for Muslims to start fasting when they reach puberty, so long as they are healthy and sane, and have no disabilities or illnesses. Many children endeavour to complete as many fasts as possible as practice for later life.
Exemptions to fasting are travel, menstruation, severe illness, pregnancy, and breast-feeding. However, many Muslims with medical conditions insist on fasting to satisfy their spiritual needs, although it is not recommended by the hadith. Professionals should closely monitor individuals who decide to persist with fasting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=25 July 2012[/tpl] Those who were unable to fast still must make up the days missed later.[tpl]cite quran|2|184|s=nosup[/tpl]

====Suhoor====

Each day before dawn, many Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called suhoor. After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day, Fajr.[tpl]cite web |url=  http://www.hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/134-Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2006.%20Fasting/10921-sahih-muslim-book-006-hadith-number-2415.html |title=  Sahih Muslim - Book 006 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 2415 |first= Abul-Hussain |last= Muslim-Ibn-Habaj | work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2446-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-144.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 144 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012[/tpl] At sunset, families hasten for the fast-breaking meal known as iftar.

====Iftar====

In the evening, dates are usually the first food to break the fast; according to tradition, Muhammad broke fast with three dates. Following that, Muslims generally adjourn for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of the five daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.
Social gatherings, many times in a buffet style, at iftar are frequent, and traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, especially those made only during Ramadan. Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also consumed. Soft drinks and caffeinated beverages are consumed to a lesser extent.
In the Middle East, the iftar meal consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers, one or more entrees, and various kinds of desserts. Usually, the dessert is the most important part during iftar. Typical entrees are lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, or roast chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. A rich dessert such as luqaimat, baklava or kunafeh (a buttery, syrup-sweetened kadaifi noodle pastry filled with cheese) concludes the meal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-ramadan-20120721,0,1433650.story |title=Ramadan's high note is often a dip |first1=Faye |last1=Levy |first2=Yakir |last2=Levy |work=Los Angeles Times |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2012[/tpl]
Over time, iftar has grown into banquet festivals. This is a time of fellowship with families, friends and surrounding communities, but may also occupy larger spaces at masjid or banquet halls for 100 or more diners.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-08-08/news/fl-ramadan-food-20100808_1_iftar-fasting-muslims-hail |title=Ramadan: Muslims feast and fast during holy month |first=James D. |last=Davis |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2012|work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel[/tpl]

===Charity===

Charity is very important in Islam, and even more so during Ramadan. Zakāt, often translated as "the poor-rate," is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam; a fixed percentage of the person's savings is required to be given to the poor. Sadaqah is voluntary charity in giving above and beyond what is required from the obligation of zakāt. In Islam all good deeds are more handsomely rewarded in Ramadan than in any other month of the year. Consequently, many will choose this time to give a larger portion, if not all, of the zakāt which they are obligated to give. In addition, many will also use this time to give a larger portion of sadaqah in order to maximize the reward that will await them at the Last Judgment.
In many Muslim countries, it is a common sight to see people giving more food to the poor and the homeless, and even to see large public areas for the poor to come and break their fast. It is said that if a person helps a fasting person to break their fast, then they receive a reward for that fast, without diminishing the reward that the fasting person got for their fast.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Nightly prayers===

===Recitation of the Quran===

In addition to fasting, Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran. Some Muslims perform the recitation of the entire Quran by means of special prayers, called Tarawih.  These voluntary prayers are held in the mosques every night of the month, during which a whole section of the Quran (juz', which is 1/30 of the Quran) is recited. Therefore, the entire Quran would be completed at the end of the month. Although it is not required to read the whole Quran in the Tarawih prayers, it is common.

==Cultural aspects==

In some Muslim countries today lights are strung up in public squares, and across city streets, to add to the festivities of the month. Lanterns have become symbolic decorations welcoming the month of Ramadan. In a growing number of countries, they are hung on city streets.[tpl]cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/slideshow/muslims-begin-fasting-start-ramadan-holy-month-16822614 |title= Muslims begin fasting for Ramadan|first= |last= |work= ABC News |date= July 18, 2012 |accessdate= 6 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/the-spirit-of-ramadan-is-here-but-why-is-it-still-so-dark |title=The spirit of Ramadan is here, but why is it still so dark? |author= Taryam Al Subaihi |date= July 29, 2012 |work= The National|accessdate= July 30, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://shine.yahoo.com/decorate-ramadan-175400368.html |title= How to decorate for Ramadan |first= Sylvia |last= Cochran |work= Yahoo-Shine|date= August 8, 2011 |accessdate= 6 August 2012[/tpl] The tradition of lanterns as a decoration becoming associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the Fatimid Caliphate primarily centered in Egypt, where Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah was greeted by people holding lanterns to celebrate his ruling. From that time lanterns were used to light mosques and houses throughout the capital city of Cairo. Shopping malls, places of business, and people's homes can be seen with stars and crescents and various lighting effects, as well.

==Penalties of eating in public during Ramadan daytime==

In some Muslim countries, failing to fast or the open flouting of such behavior during Ramadan is considered a crime and is prosecuted as such. For instance, in Algeria, in October 2008 the court of Biskra condemned six people to four years in prison and heavy fines.AFP-Arabia.net, 7 October 2008; visited 9 December 2008.
In Kuwait, according to law number 44 of 1968 the penalty is a fine of no more than 100 Kuwaiti dinars, or jail for no more than one month, or both penalties, for those seen eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan daytime.Press release by Kuwait Ministry Of Interior[ref][tpl]Cite news | last = | first = | title = KD 100 fine, one month prison for public eating, drinking | newspaper = Friday Times | location = | language =  | publisher = Kuwait Times Newspaper | date = 21 August 2009  | url = http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MTE3NDM5MzY5NA | accessdate = 17 November 2009[/tpl]

==Other laws concerning Ramadan==

Some countries have laws that amend work schedules in Ramadan. Under U.A.E labor law, the maximum working hours are to be 6 hours per day and 36 hours per week. Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait have similar laws.Employment Issues During Ramadan – The Gulf Region, DLA Piper Middle East.

==Origins==

===Origin of the word Ramadan===

Ramadan, as a name for the month, is of Muslim origin. However, prior to Islam's exclusion of intercalary days from its calendar, the name of this month was Nātiq and, due to the intercalary days added, always occurred in the warm season.Quran, Short Commentary
It is believed that the first revelation to Muhammad was sent down during the month of Ramadan.Quran Chapter 2, Revelation 185 Furthermore, God proclaimed to Muhammad that fasting for His sake was not a new innovation in monotheism, but rather an obligation practiced by those truly devoted to the oneness of God.Quran Chapter 2, Revelation 183

===Pre-Islamic observation of fasting===

During the Jahiliyyah (i.e. pre-Islamic period), the Quraysh tribe and the Jews used to fast on the day of Ashura.[tpl]cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2368-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-222.html|title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 222. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2367-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-223.html|title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 223. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2370-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-220.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 220. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012[/tpl] It marks two important events: the day Noah left the Ark and the day that Moses was saved from the Egyptians by God.http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/ashura.shtml Ashura may or may not be referring to the Jewish practice of fasting on Yom Kippur.Sunan al-Tirmidhi I.145.[tpl]Cite book | last = Goyṭayn | first = Šelomo D. | title = Studies in Islamic history and institutions | publisher = E.
