Richard Georg Spiller von Hauenschild, better known by his pseudonym Max Waldau (10 March 1825 – 20 January 1855), was a German poet and novelist.

==Life==

Born in Breslau (Wrocław), Prussian Silesia, Waldau lost his father early on in life, was educated in several boarding schools, and started studying law at Breslau University. Later, he took up philosophy, philology, and history at Heidelberg University, where he received a doctorate. Waldau traveled for an extended period of time in Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and Italy, though, after the failed German revolution of 1848-49, he retired to his estate of Tscheidt, near Bauerwitz (Baborów), Upper Silesia.cf. Schumacher 1925. 
Waldau started publishing poetry and prose in 1847; his compositions, while well written, lacked emotion and excitement. But, his friendship with Leopold Schefer, an older and more prestigious poet, resulted in Schefer releasing two series of beautiful poems, written in his youth, anonymously to the public; Waldau edited these collections, Hafis in Hellas and Koran der Liebe, in Hamburg 1853 resp. 1855.cf. Bettina Clausen: Leopold Schefer Bibliographie, Bangert & Metzler, Frankfurt on Main 1985, ISBN 3-924147-10-8.
Unexpectedly, Waldau died at the age of 30 at Tscheidt.
