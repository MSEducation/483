==Radiohead==

Before Radiohead became successful, Selway studied Literature, Life and Thought (English and History) at Liverpool Polytechnic's CF Mott Campus near Prescot (prior to it being renamed Liverpool John Moores University). Before that he had studied maths and worked for various touring musicians and worked as an English teacher as well. In the very early '90s, Selway left Radiohead's early line-up (then called Shindig or On a Friday) to move to Ireland, and only returned to the band when a relationship fell apart.
His timing and varied drumming helps to give the band its sound. Whereas his technique on earlier albums such as Pablo Honey and The Bends corresponded to the classic rock feel of the band's original style, the more experimental and atmospheric feel of their more recent work has been complemented by Selway's transition to a more solid, repetitive technique, often featuring a motorik sound.
Apart from his regular band duties, Selway also occasionally sings backing vocals during live performances, especially notable on "There There", "2+2=5", "I Will"  and "Go to Sleep".[tpl]cite web| title = Shure WCM 15 Vocal Headset | publisher = Idioteque.it  | year = 2003| url = http://www.idioteque.it/strumenti/wcm15/| accessdate = 26 April 2009[/tpl] Since the album Kid A, he has also contributed drum machine programming.
Selway has studied drums in London at Drumtech under the tutelage of Francis Seriau along with fellow Radiohead member Ed O'Brien.

==Work outside of Radiohead==

Selway has been associated with emotional support group Samaritans as a listening volunteer since 1991. He performed with the band Dive Dive in March 2005 and appeared in the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as a member of the band "The Weird Sisters" along with Radiohead bandmate Jonny Greenwood and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker.
Selway has also toured and recorded with Neil Finn as part of the 7 Worlds Collide project. He drummed on their eponymous 2001 live album, and provides drums, guitar and occasional lead vocals on their 2009 studio album, The Sun Came Out, where he also penned two tracks.
He appears on two tracks – "Rest on the Rock" and "Out of Light" – on the album, Before the Ruin, by Roddy Woomble, Kris Drever and John McCusker.[tpl]cite news | title = Navigator Records| publisher = Navigator Records| url = http://www.navigatorrecords.co.uk| accessdate = 20 February 2009[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Selway was born in Abingdon, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire, England). He and his wife Cait have three children: Leo, Jamie, and Patrick (to whom Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail to the Thief were dedicated, respectively).
His mother Thea died during a Radiohead tour in May 2006. The band cancelled one of their dates in Amsterdam, so that Selway could carry out his family duties:[tpl]cite web| last = Selway| first = Phil| title = Dead Air Space – My mum| date = 11 May 2006| url = http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/index.php?a=144 | accessdate = 20 February 2009[/tpl]
 Just wanted to say sorry to the people who were due to come to our show in Amsterdam last night, particularly those who made wasted journeys. My mum died suddenly in the early hours of yesterday morning and so I just wanted to be at home with my family. Mum was a big Radiohead fan, and was very proud of all we've done as a band. I love and miss her very much. 
The band later returned to Amsterdam in August to play the missed show. The discbox and CD release of In Rainbows mentions a dedication to Thea Selway.
