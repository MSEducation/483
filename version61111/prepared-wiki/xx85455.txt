==History==

Mahalaxmi Temple is one of the most famous temples of Mumbai. Built around 1785, the history of this temple is supposedly connected with the building of the Hornby Vellard (see Mumbai History). Apparently after portions of the sea-wall of the Vellard collapsed twice, the chief engineer, a Pathare Prabhu, dreamt of a Lakshmi statue in the sea near Worli. A search recovered it and he built a temple for it. After this, the work on the vellard could be completed without a hitch. Later the Mahalaxmi Racecourse was also built at Mahalaxmi.
