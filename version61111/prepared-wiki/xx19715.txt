==Definition==

Two versions of the definition of a divisor are commonplace:
In the remainder of this article, which definition is applied is indicated where this is significant.

==General==

Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although sometimes the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned. 
1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself.This statement either requires 0|0 or needs to be restricted to nonzero integers. Every integer is a divisor of 0.This statement either requires 0|0 or needs to be restricted to nonzero integers. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd.
1, −1, n and −n are known as the trivial divisors of n. A divisor of n that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor. A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.
There are divisibility rules which allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.
The generalization can be said to be the concept of divisibility in any integral domain.

There are some elementary rules: 
and each of the divisors has the form

One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer n has an expected
