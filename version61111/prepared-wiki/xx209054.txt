Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory that a subset of these organisms evolved to live inside mammalian cells as mitochondria to provide cellular energy to the cells in return for protection and sustenance.  ATP production in the rickettsia is biochemically identical to that in mammalian mitochondria.
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis is known to spread through tick infection primarily in the southern, southcentral and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Barker, R. W. (2000). Naturally occurring ehrlichia chafeensis infection in coyotes from oklahoma. ‘’Emerging Infectious Diseases’’, 6(5), 477. In recent years the lone star tick has expanded its range up the East Coast to New England, putting more humans at risk for tick-borne infections.Little, S. E. (2007, January). New developments in managing vector-borne diseases. Retrieved from http://www.iknowledgenow.com/tocnavc2007smallanimal.cfm
It is named for Fort Chaffee where the bacteria was first discovered in blood samples of infected patients.

==Transmission Cycle==

E. chafeensis is maintained in nature through a complex zoonotic relationship. The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is known to be the main competent reservoir for E. chafeensis  and the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) is the principal vector for human transmission. There is some evidence that other organisms may serve as reservoirs for the bacteria such as domestic goats, domestic dogs, racoons, and coyotes.
E. chafeensis can be transmitted to non-infected tick larvae when feeding on the blood from an infected host.Long, S. W. (2003). Evaluation of transovarial transmission and transmissibility of Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) in Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae).Journal of Medical Entomology, 40(6), 1000-1004. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585-40.6.100 The infection is then maintained and can be transmitted to a reservoir organism or humans at the nymphal stage. Adult ticks can maintain the infection or be infected from feeding on the blood of an infected reservoir organism and may also pass E. chafeensis to humans or other non-infected reservoir organisms. Transovarial transmission is not known to occur so eggs and unfed larvae are not believed to be infected.

==Pathogenesis==

E. chafeensis causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis and is known to infect monocytes. It has also been known to infect other cell types such as lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, myelocytes, and neutrophils, but monocytes appear to best harbor the infection.
E. chafeensis has also been shown to infect canines both naturally  and articifially.Baneth, G. (2010). Ehrlichia and anaplasma infections. Paper presented at World small veterinary congress. Retrieved from http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/wsava/2010/d12.pdf Symptoms in canine infections are hard to differentiate between E. chafeensis infection and Ehrlichia canis, which is the species of Ehrlichia that most commonly affects canines.

==Signs and Symptoms==

Patients display early symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks after tick infection1. Early symptoms include fever, headache,Baddour, L. M. (2011). Newly discovered ehrlichia species implicated in human infection. Journal Watch Infectious Diseases malaise, low-back pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Some patients may also have myalgias, arthralgias, and an estimated 10-40% of patients may develop coughing, pharyngitis, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and changes in mental status.

==Diagnosis or Detection==

A variety of procedures have been used to detect E. chafeensis in humans and reservoir organisms. Most commonly serologic testing and PCR amplification are used.

==Treatment==

E. chafeensis is susceptible to tetracyclines. Doxycycline treatment is suggested for any patients presenting symptoms of an Ehrlichia infection during the appropriate season and potential tick exposure.
