In 2008 he was a radio presenter on Radio Donna on Saturdays between 15h-20h. When radio Donna stopped he started on radio MNM with his show De Cock Late Night.  During the summer he presented for a while during the morning on MNM.
Now and then he does pre-show warm-up on shows like Steracteur Sterartiest, Peter Live, Eurosong and Zo is er maar één.
De Cock, who is homosexual and married to his parter Maarten, has caused a commotion when he admitted to lying on his Red Cross medical questionnaire of whether he sleeps with other men. This, he finds, is a "foolish, homophobic rule."[tpl]cite news|last=Dehandschutter|first=Wim|title=Radiopresenter Tom De Cock Liegt Over Geaardheid Om Donor Te Zijn|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GNS3FC6EG|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=Het Nieuwsblad|date=12 September 2011[/tpl]
