Cacti is an open-source, web-based network monitoring and graphing tool designed as a front-end application for the open-source, industry-standard data logging tool RRDtool. Cacti allows a user to poll services at predetermined intervals and graph the resulting data. It is generally used to graph time-series data of metrics such as CPU load and network bandwidth utilization.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/what_is_cacti.php |title=Cacti - What is Cacti? |publisher=The Cacti Group, Inc |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] A common usage is to monitor network traffic by polling a network switch or router interface via simple network management protocol (SNMP).
The front end can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is sometimes used by web hosting providers[tpl]cite web |url=http://3dpixel.net/managed-hosting-features/cacti-bandwidth-graphs |title=Cacti Bandwidth Graphing |publisher=3DPixel Ltd. |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] (especially dedicated server,[tpl]cite web |url=http://simonmorley.co.uk/2011/01/21/cacti-server-monitoring/ |title=Cacti Server Monitoring |author=Morley, Simon |publisher=Simon Morley |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] virtual private server, and collocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself, allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of RRDtool.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vnluck.com/2012/01/redhat-centos-install-and-configure-cacti-network-graphing-tool/ |title=RedHat / CentOS Install and Configure Cacti Network Graphing Tool |publisher=Linux Magazine |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] Cacti can be extended to monitor any source via shell scripts and executables.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/features.php |title=Cacti - Features |publisher=The Cacti Group, Inc |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl]
Cacti can use one of two back ends: "cmd.php," a PHP script suitable for smaller installations, or "Spine" (formerly Cactid), a C-based poller which can scale to thousands of hosts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://alinux.web.id/2009/05/31/how-to-install-poller-cactid-or-spine-on-linux.html |title=How to install poller cactid or spine on linux |author=Adams, Larry |publisher=alinux.web.id |date=31 May 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/spine_info.php |title=Cacti - Spine Information |publisher=The Cacti Group, Inc |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The Cacti project was first started by Ian Berry on September 2, 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://isp-ceo.net/equipment/2007/cacti.html |title=The network graphing solution Cacti was designed to provide more ease of use than RRDtool and more flexibility than MRTG |author=Goldman, George |publisher=ISP-Planet |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/cacti/ |title=Cacti |publisher=SourceForge.net |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] Berry was inspired to start the project while working for a small ISP while also still in high school, learning PHP and MySQL. His central aim in creating Cacti "was to offer more ease of use than RRDtool and more flexibility than MRTG."
On September 13, 2004, version 0.8.6 was released,[tpl]cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/cacti/files/cacti/cacti-0.8.6/ |title=Cacti - Browse / cacti / cacti-0.8.6 |publisher=SourceForge.net |date=13 September 2004 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] and with it came more developers and, later on, greater program speed and scalability.
Version 0.8.7 was released for use in October 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/cacti/files/cacti/cacti-0.8.7/ |title=Cacti - Browse / cacti / cacti-0.8.7 |publisher=SourceForge.net |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] In June 2012, a roadmap on the website indicates that version 1.0.0 is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2013,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/roadmap.php |title=Cacti - Development Road Map |publisher=The Cacti Group, Inc |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl] but by August 2013 it was replaced by a notice that "This roadmap is out of date. We are reorganizing to improve the development cycle of Cacti.
More information coming before the end of 2013!".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/roadmap.php |title=Cacti - Development Road Map |publisher=The Cacti Group, Inc |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2013[/tpl]
Version 0.8.8b was released in August 2013[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cacti.net/release_notes_0_8_8b.php/ |title=Cacti - Browse / cacti / cacti-0.8.8b |publisher=Cacti.net |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl] with numerous bug and security issues patched.
