Alpes Maritimae (Alpes Maritimæ) was a province of the Roman Empire. It, Alpes Poeninae and Alpes Cottiae were the three provinces straddling the Alps between modern France and Italy.

==History==

Founded in 14 BC by Augustus, Alpes Maritimae initially had its capital at Cemenelum, modern Cimiez, which is now a district within the city of Nice, France.  
In 297, the province was extended to the north and north-west as far as the River Durance and the Montgenèvre Pass.  Its capital was transferred to Civitas Ebrodunensium, which today is known as Embrun.
