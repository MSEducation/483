National Theatre Wales is the English language national theatre company of Wales, founded on a community of theatre makers and practitioners in May 2009, with the launch of an online community social network web site.http://community.nationaltheatrewales.org/
The company proposed a national theatre of Wales with no permanent theatre building, but instead based on an accumulated body of practice, commissioning a series of new works, each initially located within a different site or community.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] 
The company focuses on the production of work in the English language, rooted in Wales, with an international reach, and aims to build strong relationships with theatre makers, creative talents, participants and audiences in and beyond Wales.http://nationaltheatrewales.org/about#aboutnationaltheatrewales
It has a counterpart in Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, the Welsh language national theatre of Wales, founded in 2003.
