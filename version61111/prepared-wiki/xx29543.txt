He started professionally in the medium at the age of 14, and he is most notable for his successful and controversial run as Marvel Comics' ninth editor-in-chief, and his work as editor in chief of Valiant Comics.

==Early life==

Jim Shooter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to parents Ken and Eleanor "Ellie" Shooter,Shooter, Jim. "Bullpen Bulletins", Marvel comics cover-dated August 1982.Shooter, Jim. "Bullpen Bulletins," Marvel comics cover-dated October 1982. who are of Polish descent.Shooter, Jim. "Bullpen Bulletins," Marvel comics cover-dated April 1982. Shooter read comics as a child, though he stopped when he was about eight years old. His interest in the medium was rekindled in 1963, at the age of twelve, through the comics in the children's ward of the hospital where he convalesced after undergoing minor surgery. He found the DC Comics stories to be similar to the DC stories he had previously read, but was impressed with the style of the Marvel Comics, which had only begun publication two years earlier. Thinking that if he learned to write the types of stories that Marvel published, he would be an asset to DC Comics – whose books, Shooter felt, "needed the help" – Shooter spent about a year reading and studying comics from both companies.Irving, Christopher (July 20, 2012). "Jim Shooter's Secret Origin, in his Own Words – Part One". Graphic NYC.

==Career==

===DC Comics===

At age 13, in mid-1965, he wrote and drew stories featuring the Legion of Superheroes, and sent them in to DC Comics. On February 10, 1966, he received a phone call from Mort Weisinger, who wanted to purchase the stories Shooter had sent, and commissioned Shooter to write a Supergirl and Superman stories. Weisinger eventually offered Shooter a regular position on Legion, and wanted Shooter to come to New York to spend a couple of days in his office. Shooter, who was 14 and lived in Pittsburgh, had to wait until school was in recess, after which he went to New York with his mother, spurred in part by the need to support his financially struggling parents.Shooter, Jim (March 11, 2011).

According to Shooter, his father earned very little as a steelworker,[tpl]cite web | last = Shooter | first= Jim | date = December 27, 2011 | url = http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/12/sex-and-drugs-part-2.html | title = Sex and Drugs – Part 2 | publisher=JimShooter.com (official site) | accessdate = December 27, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Shooter | first= Jim | date = March 11, 2011 | url = http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/03/regrets.html | title = Regrets? | publisher=JimShooter.com (official site) | accessdate = December 27, 2012 | quote = Deadlines.  Had to sit there – the left end of the couch was my spot – sketch the pictures and write the words[/tpl] and Shooter saw comic-book writing as a means of helping economically. Shooter reflected in a 2010 interview:
At 14, Shooter began selling stories to DC Comics, writing for both Action Comics and Adventure Comics, beginning with Adventure Comics No. 346 (July 1966),[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 118 |quote = In his first-ever published story, fourteen-year-old Jim Shooter admitted four new members into the Legion of Super-Heroes ... Shooter's long, memorable tenure as one of the Legion's greatest writers was officially underway.[/tpl] and providing pencil breakdowns as well. Shooter created several characters for the Legion of Super-Heroes including Karate Kid, a teenage superhero who predated the martial arts fad of the 1970s; Ferro Lad, a teenage superhero who can transform to living iron; and Princess Projectra, who could cast realistic illusions. He also created the Superman villain the Parasite in Action Comics No. 340 (Aug. 1966).McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 118: "With a story written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Al Plastino, the Parasite entered Superman's life." Shooter and artist Curt Swan devised the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their super-speed powers, in "Superman's Race With the Flash!" in Superman No. 199 (Aug. 1967).McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 124: "Since the dawn of comics' Silver Age, readers have asked 'Who's faster: Superman or the Flash?' Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan tried answering that question when the Man of Steel and the Fastest Man Alive agreed to the U.N.'s request to race each other for charity." Shooter wrote the first issue of Captain Action (Oct.-Nov. 1968), which was DC's first toy tie-in.[tpl]cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America |year=2010| isbn= 978-3-8365-1981-6|page= 420|quote= Captain Action was DC's first toy tie-in title...Editor Mort Weisinger...brought in his young firebrand Jim Shooter to craft an identity and back story for the character.[/tpl]
In 1969 Shooter was accepted into New York University, but after graduating from high school he successfully applied for a job at Marvel Comics. Unable to pursue both his studies and work for Marvel, he decided against going to New York University and quit working for DC as well.[tpl]cite news | last = Vaughn | first= J. C. | date = June 2009 | title = Jim Shooter's First Day at Marvel Comics | work = Back Issue | issue = 34 | pages = 14-19 | publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing[/tpl] While at Marvel he worked as an editor and occasional co-plotter, taking his residence at the YMCA, but after only three weeks his financial situation compelled him to give up the post and return home to Pittsburgh.
After leaving Marvel, Shooter took up work in advertising concepts, writing, and illustration for several years, supporting himself through an assortment of menial jobs during periods when advertising work was unavailable. An interview for a Legion of Super-Heroes fanzine led to his again applying to both Marvel and DC. Though both companies offered him work, Shooter opted to return to DC because they had offered him more prestigious assignments: Superman and a chance to again write Legion of Super-Heroes, now in their own book, Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, his relationships with both Superman editor Julius Schwartz and Legion editor Murray Boltinoff were unpleasant, and Shooter claims that for varying reasons the two editors forced him to do a number of unnecessary rewrites. In December of 1975, Marvel editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman called to offer him an editorial position.

===Marvel Comics===

In the mid-1970s, Marvel Comics was undergoing a series of changes in the position of Editor-in-Chief. After Roy Thomas stepped down from the post to focus on writing, a succession of other editors, including Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, and Archie Goodwin, took the job during a relatively short span of time, only to find the task too daunting as Marvel continued to grow and add new titles and a larger staff to turn out material.Priest, Christopher J. (May 2002). "Chapter Two: Oswald: Why I Never Discuss Spider-Man", Adventures in the Funnybook Game. On January 2, 1976, Shooter joined the Marvel staff as an assistant editor and writer.
With the quick turnover at the top, Shooter rapidly found himself rising in the ranks, and in 1978 he succeeded Archie Goodwin to become Marvel's ninth editor-in-chief.[tpl]cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2008|page = 184|isbn =978-0756641238[/tpl] During this period, publisher Stan Lee relocated to Los Angeles to better oversee Marvel's animation, television and film projects, leaving Shooter largely in charge of the creative decision-making at Marvel's New York City headquarters. Although there were complaints among some that Shooter imposed a dictatorial style on the "Bullpen," he cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, successfully managed to keep the line of books on schedule (ending the widespread practice of missed deadlines), add new titles, and develop new talent.Rozanski, Chuck. "Tales From the Database: Meeting with Jim Shooter in May of 1979," Comics Buyer's Guide (Feb 2004). Accessed April 11, 2009. Marvel enjoyed some of its best successes during Shooter's nine-year tenure as Editor-in-Chief, such as Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the Uncanny X-Men,[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|chapter= The Marvel Universe (1978–1990)|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = Harry N.

Frank Miller's series of Daredevil stories,Daniels "The Marvel Universe (1978–1990)", p. 188: "Few people have had more of an impact on the course that current comic books have taken than Frank Miller, who began drawing Daredevil in 1979, and took on the writing as well in 1981."

In 1981, Shooter brought Marvel into the lucrative comic book specialty shop market with Dazzler #1.DeFalco, Tom "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 200: "Dazzler No. 1 sold 428,000 copies and proved that comic book stores were here to stay." Featuring a disco-themed heroine with ties to the X-Men (based upon an unproduced motion picture set to star Bo Derek),Cronin, Brian (June 26, 2008). "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #161". Comic Book Resources. the first issue of this series was sold only through specialty stores, bypassing the then-standard newsstand/spin rack distribution route altogether, as a recognition by Marvel of the growing comics shop sector. Subsequent issues of Dazzler, however, were sold through newsstand returnable accounts as well. Dazzler was the first direct sales-only ongoing series from a major publisher; other Marvel titles, such as Marvel Fanfare and Ka-Zar, soon followed.DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 195: "Marvel made three of its monthly titles – Moon Knight, Micronauts, and Ka-Zar – 'direct only' and the company was soon creating new titles (for example, Marvel Fanfare...that were reserved exclusively for comic book stores." Later that same year, Shooter wrote Marvel Treasury Edition No. 28 which featured the second Superman and Spider-Man intercompany crossover.Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 194: "In an oversized treasury edition carrying a hefty $2.50 price tag, the Man of Steel paired for the second time with Marvel's iconic web-slinger...The issue came together thanks to the script of writer Jim Shooter, a bit of plotting assistance by Marv Wolfman, the pencils of longtime Marvel luminary John Buscema, and a veritable fleet of inkers." Additionally in 1981, Shooter was recognized as one of six "New Yorkers of the Year" by the New York chapter of the JayCees, for his "contributions toward revitalizing the comics industry and helping Marvel Comics achieve a new pinnacle of success." Shooter also institutionalized creator royalties,[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] starting the Epic imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover events, with Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions and Secret Wars;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 217: "The toy company Mattel produced action figures of Marvel's most popular characters...Mattel just needed Marvel to come up with an editorial concept that would explain why all these characters had gathered together. The response of Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter was to publish the first company-wide crossover in the history of comics." and launched a new, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, line named New Universe, to commemorate Marvel's 25th anniversary, in 1986.DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: "The year 1986 was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Marvel Universe...Shooter embarked on his most ambitious project: he would celebrate the birth of one universe by creating a brand new one."
Despite his success in revitalizing Marvel, Shooter angered and alienated a number of long-time Marvel creators by insisting on strong editorial control and strict adherence to deadlines. Although he instituted an art-return program, and implemented a policy giving creators royalties when their books passed certain sales benchmarks or when characters they worked on were licensed as toys, Shooter occasionally found himself in well-publicized conflicts with some writers and artists.

===Valiant Comics===

Shooter and his investors then founded a new company, Voyager Communications, which published comics under the Valiant Comics banner, entering the market in the 1989 with comics based on Nintendo and WWF licensed characters. Two years later Valiant entered the superhero market with a relaunch of the Gold Key Comics character Magnus, Robot Fighter. Shooter brought many of Marvel's creators to Valiant, including Bob Layton and Barry Windsor-Smith, as well as industry veterans such as Don Perlin. Valiant also established "knob row" — taking in raw talent and teaching them how to make comics Valiant-style – and launched many careers, most notably Joe Quesada's.
Occasionally over the years, Shooter was required to fill in as penciller on various books he wrote and/or oversaw as editor. During his period as Valiant's publisher, money and talent were often at a premium, and Shooter was sporadically forced to pencil a story. To conceal this fact, he drew under the pseudonym of Paul Creddick, which is the name of his brother-in-law.Petrilak, Joe. "THE Jim Shooter Interview"; The Valiant Era Online; July 22, 1998.

Shooter returned to Valiant (now called Acclaim Comics) for a brief stint in 1999 to write Unity 2000 (an attempt to combine and revitalize the older and newer Valiant universes) but Acclaim folded after the completion of only three of the planned six issues.
In 2005 Shooter was approached by former Marvel Comics letterer Denise Wohl to create Seven, a series based on the Kabbalah.McLelland, Ryan. "Shooter & Wohl on Seven", Newsarama, June 8, 2007. Writer Shooter created a team of seven characters, one from each continent, who are brought together in New York because they share a higher consciousness.Soller, Kurt. "Super-fashionable Kabbalah Heroes: Zac Posen’d crusaders," New York magazine (November 5, 2007). The project, which was to be self-published by Wohl, was announced at the 2007 New York Comic Con, to debut in July of that year, and was projected to "evolve into television and film projects, video games, blogs, interactive Q&A, animation, trading cards, apparel, accessories, and school supplies." Wohl was to donate a portion of her proceeds to the "Spirituality for Kids Foundation.""Denise V. Wohl & Jim Shooter Launch 'Seven,' the Greatest Team of Superheroes of All Time".

In September 2007, DC Comics announced that Shooter would be the new writer of the Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 5 series, beginning with issue #37.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11512|title= Back to the Future: Shooter Talks Legion of Superheroe|first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud|date= September 20, 2007|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121105105628/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11512|archivedate= November 5, 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl] Shooter's return to the Legion, a little over 30 years from his previous run, was his first major published comic book work in years. Shooter co-created the new Legionnaire Gazelle with artist Francis Manapul while on the title. His run on the series ended with issue No. 49, one issue before the book was canceled.
Shooter was hired by Valiant Entertainment, a company that bought the Valiant IP in a bankruptcy auction of Acclaim Enterainment, to write from the end of 2008 into the summer of 2009. Johnston.

In July 2009 Dark Horse Comics announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International that Shooter would oversee the publication of new series based on classic Gold Key characters such as Turok, Doctor Solar, and Magnus, Robot Fighter, and write some of them as well. In an interview with CBR News, Shooter, who previously oversaw publication of these characters at Valiant Comics, indicated that Dark Horse's versions of the characters would be both true to the original source material, but also exhibit some variation from the Gold Key and Valiant versions.Manning, Shaun (July 25, 2009). "CCI: Jim Shooter Talks Gold Key at Dark Horse". Comic Book Resources. Valiant sued Shooter over his moving to write the Gold Key characters for Dark Horse as they expected to get the rights and that he interfered with their ability to license the Key characters by indicating that he would write them for Dark Horse. As of January, 2010, Valiant had given up the lawsuit against Shooter. http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/01/14/bill-jemas-is-one-of-the-people-behind-valiant-entertainment-inc/
