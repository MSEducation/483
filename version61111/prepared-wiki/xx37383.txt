==History==

Thomas Green Clemson, the university's founder, came to the foothills of South Carolina in 1838, when he married Anna Maria Calhoun, daughter of John C. Calhoun, a South Carolina statesman and seventh U.S. Vice President.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Clemson University|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history/|work=History of Clemson University|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=3 November 2011[/tpl]  When Clemson died on April 6, 1888, he left most of his estate, which he inherited from his wife, in his will to be used to establish a college that would teach scientific agriculture and the mechanical arts to South Carolinians."Thomas Green Clemson 200 - The Will." Clemson University. Retrieved 17 September 2011. His decision was largely influenced by South Carolina Governor Benjamin Tillman. Tillman lobbied the South Carolina General Assembly to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state and the resolution passed by only one vote.
In his will, Clemson explicitly stated that he wanted the school to be modeled after what is now Mississippi State University: "This institution, I desire, to be under the control and management of a board of trustees, a part of whom are hereinafter appointed, and to be modeled after the Agricultural College of Mississippi as far as practicable."[tpl]cite web|title=The Will of Thomas Green Clemson|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history/tgc-will.html[/tpl]
In November 1889, South Carolina Governor John Peter Richardson III signed the bill, thus establishing the Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina. As a result, federal funds for agricultural education from the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 were transferred from South Carolina College to Clemson.
Clemson Agricultural College formally opened in July 1893 with an initial enrollment of 446. From its beginning, the college was an all-white male military school. The school remained this way until 1955 when it changed to "civilian" status for students and became a coeducational institution.
In 1963, the school admitted its first African-American student, future Charlotte, North Carolina, mayor Harvey Gantt.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.clemson.edu/oir/factBook/Historical%20Enrollment/Integration.htm | title=Harvey Gantt and the Desegregation of Clemson University; an Online version of an exhibit presented by the Library in conjunction with "Integration With Dignity: A Celebration of 40 Years" on January 28, 2003 | accessdate=January 21, 2011[/tpl] In 1964, the college was renamed Clemson University as the state legislature formally recognized the school's expanded academic offerings and research pursuits.[tpl]cite web | title= The History of Clemson University | url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history.html | accessdate=June 20, 2007[/tpl]

==Academics==

===Admissions===

The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies the university as more selective,[tpl]cite web | title= Carnegie Classifications of Clemson University | url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=16150&start=782 |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching| accessdate=June 20, 2007[/tpl] since the university admitted less than fifty-five percent of those who applied to be freshmen in 2006.[tpl]cite web | title= U.S. News Rankings Top National Schools | url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php | accessdate=August 17, 2007 [/tpl]"Clemson Freshman Admissions Data".
Clemson University emphasizes on the rigor of high-school study and standardized test scores, either SAT or ACT. The university also considers class rank, extracurricular activities, and an optional personal statement. The average incoming freshman had a combined SAT score of 1220 and a high-school weighted grade-point average (GPA) of 3.99 in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/FB/factBook/CUfactbook.cgi?conf_file_name=FBFTF_SAT_College&tabbness=2&colapp=1|title=University Fact Book |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] In 2008, admission was the most competitive in university history.
Clemson University had over 15,000 applications for its freshman class of approximately 2,800 students. It was especially competitive for out-of-state students in that it is a state-supported institution. Of those 15,000+ applications, over 10,000 were from outside of South Carolina; however, a little over 1,000 freshmen from other states gained admission.{http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/2008/april/RecordApplications2008.php5}

===Research and rankings===

The university endeavors to become a "Top 20" public institution, undergoing a process of enhancing its graduate programs while continuing to emphasize the quality of the undergraduate experience. It has steadily moved up the rankings for public universities from 34,[tpl]Cite journal | title = U.S. News & World Report | pages = 111–115 | date = August 28, 2005 [/tpl] to 30,[tpl]Cite journal | title = U.S. News & World Report | pages = 80–84 | date = August 29, 2006 [/tpl] to 27,[tpl]Cite journal | title = U.S. News & World Report | date = August 27, 2007[/tpl] to 22[tpl]Cite journal | title = U.S. News & World Report | date = August 22, 2008[/tpl] in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 respectively: according to the U.S. News & World Report. In 2012, U.S. News & World Report ranked Clemson as the 25th top public schools in the US,[tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public |title=Top Public Schools | Rankings | Top National Universities | US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08[/tpl] and in 2013 the ranking improved to 21st.[tpl]Cite journal | title = U.S. News & World Report [/tpl]
However, some have questioned Clemson's efforts to improve its rankings. In 2009, an administrator revealed that "Clemson manipulated class sizes, artificially boosted faculty salary data and gave rival schools low grades in the rankings' peer reputation survey" with the goal of manipulating its U.S. News & World Report ranking.  Since then the administrator retracted some of her statements and the university denied any wrongdoing.[tpl]cite news|last=Pope|first=Justin|title=Clemson official: School manipulated rankings|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-06-04-clemson-rankings_N.htm|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 7, 2009[/tpl]
As part of its push to enhance graduate-level education, several new Ph.D. programs have been created including interdisciplinary doctoral programs in Rhetorics, Communication, and Information Design (RCID), and Planning, Design, and the Built Environment (formerly Environmental Design and Planning). Also noteworthy is a new master's degree in historic preservation, jointly offered in collaboration with the College of Charleston.

==Student life==

===Athletics===

Clemson University teams are known as the Tigers. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 1953-54 season.

===Fraternity and sorority life===

The university's fraternities and sororities system (or Greek system) is somewhat different from other large universities in the southern U.S. in that there are no Greek houses on campus as interfraternity activity did not begin until 1970 following the abolishing of the military cadre requirements at the university. There are residence halls designated for fraternities and sororities, but there are no traditional Greek houses on campus. However, there are a few fraternity houses off campus near the college. The Fraternity Quad on campus (consisting of seven fraternity and sorority halls) is certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. The remaining sororities' on-campus housing is located on the other end of campus, in what is commonly referred to as "the horseshoe," in Smith and Barnett Halls.

The university is home to detachments for U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) as well as a host school for the U.S. Marine Corps PLC program adjacent to the Semper Fi Society.
In addition to students from the university, these organizations also serve students from Anderson University, Southern Wesleyan University, and Tri-County Technical College. The following organizations are present among the military personnel at Clemson:[tpl]cite web | title= List of Student Organizations | url=http://dcit.clemson.edu/resources/student_organizations/all.php | accessdate=June 20, 2007 [/tpl]
The university's AAS squadron was selected to be home of Arnold Air Society's National Headquarters for the 2005–2006 year, and again for the 2006–2007 year. This is the first time in AAS's history that any university has served as national headquarters two years in a row.[tpl]cite web | title= Student Achievements | url=http://business.clemson.edu/news/bragging/news_brag_students.htm | accessdate=June 20, 2007 [/tpl]
The C-4 Pershing Rifles have won the national society's drill meet eight times: 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2011. Company C-4 also performs colorguards, twenty-one-gun salutes, exhibition-drill performances, and POW/MIA ceremonies. Company C-4 performs colorguard performance at the university's home football games. In addition to the C-4 drill company, the university is the former home of the 4th Regimental Headquarters (4RHQ), the National Headquarters for the Junior ROTC level of Pershing Rifles (BlackJacks) and the Co-ed Auxiliary for Pershing Rifles (CAPeRs).
Its Air Force ROTC Detachment 770 "Flyin' Tigers" was selected as the #1 "medium-sized" Air Force ROTC detachment in the nation for 2006 (the "High Flight" and "Right of Line" awards), #1 Detachment in the "Southeast" in 2006 ("medium-sized") and 2007 ("large-sized"), and #1 in the state of South Carolina (out of three — University of South Carolina and The Citadel) three consecutive years (2005, 2006 and 2007).
The university has also developed a group of Marines and Marine Officer Candidates within an organization called the Semper Fi Society. The society is not associated with the ROTC, but can lead to a commission into the U.S. Marine Corps via the Platoon Leaders Course program.

===Student Media===

Clemson University has two student-run newspapers. Founded in 1907, The Tiger is the oldest student-run newspaper in South Carolina. The Tiger publishes local and university related news pieces.

==Traditions==

===Tiger Paw===

The Tiger paw became the official logo for Clemson University in 1970, in place of the previous tiger logo. The change was inspired by President Robert Edwards to “upgrade the image of the university." The company tasked with creating the new logo contacted the Museum of Natural History in Chicago and requested a plaster imprint of a tiger paw.  The paw is now used on all athletic teams and collegiate documents. The tiger paw is also painted on surfaces throughout campus and in footprint patterns on highways leading to the campus.[tpl]cite book|last=Bradley|first=Bob|title=Death Valley Days|year=1991|publisher=Longsteet Press|isbn=1563520060|pages=36–42[/tpl]

===Homecoming and Tigerama===

Every year Clemson students have the opportunity to attend Homecoming and Tigerama. The Clemson Homecoming tradition began in 1914 and has been held annually at Clemson University ever since. During homecoming week, various student organizations design and build Homecoming floats on Bowman Field. The floats are then revealed on the Saturday of the football game and judged by a select panel. Since 1957, Clemson has held "Tigerama" on the Friday night of homecoming week. Tigerama is one of the nation's largest student-run-pep rallies, averaging about 40,000 people. This Clemson event includes the crowning of Miss Homecoming, skits by various academic organizations, as well as a fireworks show.

===Two-dollar bills===

A university tradition has been in place, since September 24, 1977, for the school's fans to spend two-dollar bills on trips to away football games. The tradition began when Clemson played against Georgia Tech "for the last time", as Georgia Tech did not wish to travel to Clemson for future football games. Of the seventeen games played between Georgia Tech and Clemson between 1953 and 1977, only once, in 1974, did the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets come to Memorial Stadium. In Atlanta, Georgia, Clemson fans purchased items with two-dollar bills stamped with "Tiger Paws" to show how they contributed to the local economy, which began the tradition.  The tradition became very popular in the 1980s and 1990s, but has waned since then.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clemsonwiki.com/wiki/1977 |title=1977 |publisher=ClemsonWiki |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=January 2011[/tpl]Blackman, Sam; Bradley, Bob; and Kriese, Chuck (2001).

===Tiger push-ups===

During home football games, after Clemson scores a touchdown, the Clemson tiger mascot performs push-ups equal to the number of points Clemson has scored at the time. The tiger is in full mascot attire and has been rumored to lose 12 pounds in a single game. The Tiger pushup tradition began in 1978 by the Tiger mascot at the time - Zack Mills. The Tiger mascot outfit weighs 45 pounds, with the head itself weighing 20 pounds.[tpl]cite book|last=Blackman|first=Sam|title=Clemson:Where the Tigers play|year=1999|publisher=Sports Publishing|isbn=1583820051|pages=143[/tpl]

===Ring Ball===

The annual Ring Ball, organized by the Clemson Undergraduate Student Government and Student Alumni Council, is a nighttime celebration on the Carillon Gardens for graduating seniors as they receive their Clemson rings. The tradition began in the 1930s but was canceled in 1936 due to a flu epidemic. The tradition was reestablished on April 26, 2013.[tpl]cite web|last=Abrams|first=Matt|title=Ring Ball|url=http://www.clemson.edu/students/cusg/Social%20Media/union_13|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]

===Blood Bowl===

Clemson University and the University of South Carolina host a blood drive competition to determine who can donate the most blood during a week before their annual rivalry football game. Since the tradition began in 1985, more than 90,000 pints of blood have been donated. The blood drive is sponsored by the Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity, and donations at Clemson benefit The Blood Connection and the AnMed Blood Center.[tpl]cite web|title=Clemson students gear up for rivalry game with blood drive, ball run, pep rally|url=http://www.clemson.edu/media-relations/4569|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]

===Memorial Stadium traditions===

===Alma Mater===

The Clemson University alma mater originated in the 1910s after a group of Clemson ROTC cadets in May 1918 was asked to sing the school's song at a gathering of ROTC cadets at Plattsburg, New York; they were unable to do so as Clemson had no song at the time. One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of Charleston, South Carolina, decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater and set them to Annie Lisle, which was the melody of Cornell University's alma mater as well as many others. The words were later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and was first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.[tpl]cite web|title=The Mystery of the Clemson Alma Mater|url=http://www.clemson.edu/tigerband/History_AlmaMater.htm|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=20 January 2013[/tpl]
In 1947 the club "Tiger Brotherhood" decided that, rather than continue borrowing another school's melody, the university should compose its own. As a result, the Tiger Brotherhood sponsored a contest for Clemson students to compose a unique melody. On May 5, 1947, Clemson University's school newspaper "The Tiger" announced Robert E. Farmer of Anderson, South Carolina, as the winner and a member of the glee club at the time. Farmer's melody was slightly altered in 1970, but was restored to its original tune in 2009.
The lyrics to the alma mater:
 
 Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness
Where the Tigers play,
Here the sons of dear old Clemson
Reign supreme alway.
CHORUS
Dear old Clemson we will triumph
And with all our might,
That the Tiger's roar may echo
O'er the mountain height!
