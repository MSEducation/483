Carmelo Cedrún Ochandátegui (born 6 December 1930) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

==Club career==

Born in Amorebieta-Etxano, Cedrún started playing professionally with local giants Athletic Bilbao, making his first-team debut on 15 April 1951 in a 3–0 home win against Sevilla FC and quickly becoming the club's automatic first-choice. In the 1955–56 season, as the Basque won La Liga, he only conceded 31 goals while playing in all 30 matches, and appeared in more than 400 official games during his 14-year spell.
In 1964, having lost his place to another future club legend, José Ángel Iribar, Cedrún joined RCD Español also in the top division, again returning to starting duties.Espanyol archives; Hall of Fame Perico, 30 April 2009 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] He retired at 38 in the United States, with the Baltimore Bays.
Mere months after retiring Cedrún took a hand at coaching, starting in his region with lowly SCD Durango and Barakaldo CF. Most of his career was spent in the lower leagues, his only top flight experience coming in the 1976–77 campaign with Celta de Vigo, with the club ranking second from the bottom.

==International career==

Cedrún appeared 13 times for the Spanish national team, his debut coming on 14 March 1954 as the nation battled with Turkey for a spot at the 1954 FIFA World Cup; Spain won 4–2 on aggregate (rule did not apply at the time) and, after a draw in the third match, lost after a drawing of lots.
Cedrún was then selected for the 1962 World Cup, playing two out of three as the country exited in the group stage.

Cedrún's son, Andoni, was also a footballer – and a goalkeeper. He too represented Athletic but with little success, appearing mostly for Real Zaragoza in another lengthy career.Un hijo de Carmelo quiere suceder a Iríbar (Carmelo's son wants to succeed Iríbar); El País, 8 November 1979 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
