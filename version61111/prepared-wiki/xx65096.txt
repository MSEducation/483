==History==

Archeologists have proved that people live in the area for centuries. There are many archaeological objects from Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman period.
In the 11th century, this area was populated by Hungarians and Serbs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.backapalanka.rs/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=142 |title=Историја |publisher=Backapalanka.rs |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15[/tpl] Bačka Palanka is first mentioned as a settlement in 1486, as a suburb of Ilok called Iločka. Until the 16th century, this area was administered by the Kingdom of Hungary.
In the beginning of the 16th century, village was in property of landowner Laurence of Ilok, a duke of Syrmia. It was destroyed by the Ottomans after The Battle of Mohács in 1526, but was then rebuilt as small Ottoman fortress named Palanka. During the Ottoman administration (16th-17th century), Palanka was mostly populated by ethnic Serbs.Dr Dušan J. Popović, Srbi u Vojvodini, knjiga 1, Novi Sad, 1990, page 113.
In 1687 Palanka was included into Habsburg Monarchy and more Orthodox Serbs settled here. Palanka was then mentioned as a small town with 167 houses, all of them Serb (1720 census data).Ivan Jakšić, iz popisa stanovništva Ugarske početkom XVIII veka, Novi Sad, 1966, pages 300-303. Later, Germans, Slovaks and Hungarians settled here as well.
It was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier from 1702 to 1744. Nova Palanka (New Palanka) was founded between 1765 and 1770, 2 kilometers away from original Palanka (which then became known as Stara Palanka - Old Palanka) and Nemačka Palanka (German Palanka) was founded by Danube Germans in 1783. Those three towns will become one city, Bačka Palanka, in the 20th century.
Palanka's industrial development started in 1765, when brick plant was built. It got its first post office in 1828. In 1875, one of the first libraries in Vojvodina was opened. In 1884 Sintelon company was founded. In 1886, first public school started working. By the year of 1894, railroad was built from Bačka Palanka to Feketić and a first phone call was made with Novi Sad.
In the second half of the 19th century, German population became more numerous than Serbian.Dr Slobodan Ćurčić, Naselja Bačke - geografske karakteristike, Novi Sad, 2007, page 182. According to 1910 census, population of Stara Palanka was mostly Serb, while populations of Nova Palanka and Nemačka Palanka were mostly German.http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3899/vojvodina1910.png
The city was under Habsburg administration until 1918, when it became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). During World War II (from 1941 to 1944), it was under Axis occupation. In 1944, one part of Bačka Palanka citizens of German ethnicity left from the city, together with defeated German army. As a consequence of the war, the site of a post-World War II work camp for the remaining ethnic Germans (Donauschwaben) was formed here under new communist administration.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] After work camps were dissolved (in 1948), the remaining German population left Yugoslavia because of economic reasons. Instead of the Germans, 3,609 (mostly Serb) colonists settled in the town after World War II. Most of them originated from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
During the 1990s, about 5,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia moved to Bačka Palanka because of the Yugoslav wars. During the NATO bombing in 1999, Bačka Palanka was bombed by NATO only twice, on 2 and 27 April. Both times target was the Ilok–Bačka Palanka Bridge. It was only damaged, but not destroyed.
In 2002, 4 tons of fish stew were cooked at Kaloš Čarda at the Bager Lake in Bačka Palanka and it entered Guinness Book of Records.
