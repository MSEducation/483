==Pope==

On 14 March 1605, eleven days after the death of Clement VIII, 62 cardinals entered the conclave. Prominent among the candidates for the papacy were the great historian Baronius and the famous Jesuit controversialist Robert Bellarmine. But Pietro Aldobrandini, the leader of the Italian party among the cardinals, allied with the French cardinals and brought about the election of Alessandro against the express wish of King Philip III of Spain. King Henry IV of France is said to have spent 300,000 écus in the promotion of Alessandro's candidacy.Eamon Duffy, Saints & Sinners: A History of the Popes, (Yale University Press, 2006), 236.
On 1 April 1605, Cardinal Medici was elected pope.  He chose to be called Leo XI in honor of his uncle Pope Leo X.
When he was elected, Leo XI was almost seventy years of age, and he died twenty seven days later.George L. Williams, Papal Genealogy:The Families and Descendants of the Popes, (McFarland & Company, 1998), 75.  His death came as a result of fatigue and cold in the ceremony of taking possession of the Basilica of St John Lateran.  He was called Papa Lampo ("Lightning Pope") because his papacy was so short.
