USS  ''Nausett'' (IXâ€“190) was an auxiliary ship in the United States Navy.
Nausett was a tanker completed in April 1918, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., Alameda, California. She served the Atlantic Refining Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as SS W. M. Irish until acquired in early October 1944 by War Shipping Administration for U.S. Navy use as a mobile floating storage unit.

==Acquired by the U.S. Navy==

Renamed Nausett on 29 October 1944, she was accepted by the Navy on a bareboat charter and commissioned at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1945. On further inspection, necessary alterations were deemed too expensive to warrant the expenditure.

==Decommissioning==

In June, Nausett was placed in reduced commission pending her return to WSA on the West Coast. On 23 September 1945, she arrived at San Francisco, California, where she decommissioned and was delivered to WSA, on 12 October 1945. Twelve days later she was struck from the Navy Register.
