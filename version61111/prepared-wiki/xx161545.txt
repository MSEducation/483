[[Huber's equation]]

CATEGORIES: Physical quantities, Structural analysis

Huber's equation, first derived by a Polish engineer Tytus Maksymilian Huber, is a basic formula in elastic material tension calculations, an equivalent of the equation of state, but applying to solids. In most simple expression and commonly in use it looks like this:
Very useful in calculating the span width of the bridges like Golden Gate Bridge or Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, their beam cross-sections, etc.
