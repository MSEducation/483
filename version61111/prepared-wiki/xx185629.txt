Antonio Afonso Moreno, aka Tonono (25 August 1943 – 9 June 1975), was a Spanish footballer who played as a sweeper.

==Club career==

Born in Arucas, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Tonono made his professional debuts with hometown's UD Las Palmas, his first official appearance coming on 18 February 1962 at Real Murcia. His La Liga debuts were made in the 1964–65 season, appearing in 29 games as the Canary Islands side finished in ninth position; he would only play for one club in his entire career, being part of the squads in the late 60's/early 70's that achieved three top-five finishes in the top flight – namely the second place in 1969.
Tonono amassed first division totals of 312 matches and two goals. On 31 May 1975 he appeared in his last match for Las Palmas, a Copa del Rey contest against CD Málaga, contracting a viral infection shortly after and dying on 9 June at only 31 years of age in Las Palmas.

==International career==

Tonono made his debut for Spain on 1 October 1967, in an UEFA Euro 1968 qualifier against Czechoslovakia, a 0–1 loss in Prague. He did not appear, however, in any major international tournament, as the national team did not qualify for any during his international spell.
In his 22nd and final cap, on 19 October 1972, Tonono captained Spain in a 2–2 draw against Yugoslavia for the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, in a game played in Las Palmas; he was the first player ever from the region to be selected for the national team.
