CATEGORIES: Districts of Taipei

Datong District ([tpl]zh|t=大同區|hp=Dàtóng Qū|w=Ta-t'ung Chü|l=Great Harmony District|poj=Tāi-tông-khu[/tpl]) is a district of Taipei City, Taiwan. It is located between the Taipei Metro Red Line and eastern shore of the Tamsui River, and between Civic Boulevard and the Sun Yat-sen Freeway. The southern part of this area was previously the site of Dadaocheng, one of the first settlements in what is now Taipei and for a time the area's commercial center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1104394&ctNode=27831&mp=100002|title=About Datong District|publisher=Taipei City Government|date=2010-01-11|accessdate=2010-07-18[/tpl] 

==Overview==

Taipei's commercial center has since shifted south east to Zhongzheng, Daan and Xinyi, and Datong is far less important economically. One of the last vestiges of Dadaocheng's commercial importance disappeared with the closing of the Jiancheng Circle market in 2006.  The north was the site of the village of Dalongdong.

==History==

During the Qing Dynasty, the district was initially named Balanbong, which was renamed to Dalongtong in 1844. Following the Second Opium War, a port was opened in Dadaocheng for international trade. Foreign trade resulted in the economic development of the district. In 1946, the name was changed again to the current Datong. In 1990, the district merged with neighboring Jiancheng and Yanping Districts to create today's Datong District. The district is named after the Confucian notion of utopia.

==Tourism==

It is most notable for its Japanese colonial era and Qing dynasty architecture, especially along Dihua Street (迪化街). It is also famous for the Dihua (Tihua) Street Market during the Lunar New Year holidays.  The market sells dried fruits, nuts, dried meats, dried seafood, snacks, and health drinks.
Other attractions in Datong include Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei, Lin Liu-hsin Puppet Theatre Museum, Taipei Confucius Temple and Bao-an Temple in the Dalongdong area, and the Xiahai City God Temple near Dihua Street. Datong also contains the Yongle Market (also on Dihua Street), Ningxia Night Market, Yansan Night Market and Dalong Night Market.
