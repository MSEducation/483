[[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students]]

CATEGORIES: Students' associations in Canada, Organizations based in Ottawa

The Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) (Fédération canadienne des étudiants en génie in French) is the national association of undergraduate engineering student societies in Canada and exists to organize activities, provide services and interact with professional and other bodies at the national and international level for the benefit of Canadian engineering students. The organization is a bilingual non-profit corporation based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, managed by a volunteer team of engineering students and recent graduates from across Canada.

==Activities==

===CFES Congress===

The flagship event of the CFES, Congress serves as both the Annual General Meeting of the Federation, as well as a leadership development forum for engineering students from across Canada. Congress is typically held in the first week or January, spanning a full week of leadership development sessions, informational presentations, guest speakers from industry, a career fair and culminating in plenary, the decision making body of the CFES. At congress, the CFES National Executive and other officer positions are elected, and bids are made to host other CFES activities.

===Project Magazine (ProMag)===

The CFES Project Magazine, also known as Promag, is a magazine published by the CFES and distributed to member schools. Promag accepts submissions from engineering students in a number of topics, from academic to social issues surrounding engineering. As well, important information on the activities and opportunities in the CFES are included in every issue of Promag.

===Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC)===

The Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC) (Compétition canadienne d'ingénierie in French) is an annual competition involving more than 150 of the best and brightest engineering students from across Canada.
All competitors at the CEC qualify for the competition through one of four regional competitions:

====Competition categories====

The CEC includes competitions in a variety of topics. Individual competitors can be entered in any one of the following competition categories:

====Host schools====

As the CEC has a national scope, engineering schools wishing to host the competition must win a competitive bid process through the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students. Schools that have hosted the competition since its inception in 1985 include:

===Complementary Education Courses (CE Courses)===

Complementary Education, or CE Courses, provide an opportunity for engineering students to extend their education beyond the basic engineering curriculum. CE Courses focus on a specific academic or development topic, such as Biomaterials, Nanotechnology and Professional Development. In addition to the academic component, CE Courses offer a number of social activities, and are a great way to explore a new city.

===National Conference on Women in Engineering (NCWIE)===

The National Conference on Women in Engineering (NCWIE) is a national student-run conference held annually through the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students. The conference is two days in November and involves guest speakers, breakout sessions and networking opportunities. It is open to all undergraduate engineering students in Canada, both male and female.http://cfes.ca/events-and-services/ncwie/
NCWIE began in 1990 as a local conference at Queen’s University and in 2003 it became a national event. Other Canadian universities were invited to host it after the 2007 conference. The University of Western Ontario was the first school after Queen's University to host the event in 2008.http://www.eng.uwo.ca/news/newsletter/nov08/ncwie.htm Shortly thereafter, NCWIE was made a service of the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students.http://ncwie.skule.ca/

==Structure==

===Members===

The membership of the organization consists of engineering student societies, rather than individual engineering students. Eligibility for membership is limited to those societies located at a Canadian university that has at least one engineering program accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board and represents engineering student concerns to the school's administration and engineering faculty.
The member societies are divided into four geographic regions for the purposes of representation on the Federation's board of directors:

===Board of Directors===

As a corporation, the Federation has a board of directors that is responsible for managing the business and property of the organization. The board consists of 11 members elected at the annual meeting:
