4-NEMD is a potent sedative drug which acts as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It is closely related to dexmedetomidine but is several times more potent.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = SS | last2 = Romstedt | first2 = KJ | last3 = Feller | first3 = DR | last4 = Hsu | first4 = FL | last5 = Cupps | first5 = TL | last6 = Lyon | first6 = RA | last7 = Miller | first7 = DD | title = A structure-activity relationship study of benzylic modifications of 4-1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl-1H-imidazoles on alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors | journal = Journal of Medical Chemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 15 | pages = 2328–33 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7914537 | doi=10.1021/jm00041a011[/tpl] Like other alpha-2 agonists, it produces sedative and muscle relaxant effects but without producing respiratory depression. It is not currently used in medicine but has been researched as the basis for a potential new generation of alpha-2 agonist drugs,[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = X | last2 = Yao | first2 = XT | last3 = Dalton | first3 = JT | last4 = Shams | first4 = G | last5 = Lei | first5 = L | last6 = Patil | first6 = PN | last7 = Feller | first7 = DR | last8 = Hsu | first8 = FL | last9 = George | first9 = C | last10 = Miller | first10 = DD | title = Medetomidine analogs as alpha 2-adrenergic ligands. 2.
