[[Business Development Company]]

CATEGORIES: Private equity, Venture capital

A Business Development Company ("BDC'') is a form of publicly registered company in the United States that invests in small and mid-sized businesses. This form of company was created by Congress in 1980 as amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Publicly filing firms may elect regulation as BDCs if they meet certain requirements of the Investment Company Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoAct/sec54.html|title=Election to Be Regulated as Business Development Company[/tpl]

==Regulation and tax structure==

Election means the BDC must subject itself to all relevant provisions of the Investment Company Act, which (a) limits how much debt a BDC may incur, (b) prohibits most affiliated transactions, (c) requires a code of ethics and a comprehensive compliance program, and (d) requires regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and subject to regular examination, like all mutual funds and closed-end funds. BDCs are also required to file quarterly reports, annual reports, and proxy statements with the SEC.  Some BDCs are publicly traded, and others are not.  
BDCs are usually taxed as regulated investment companies (RIC) under the Internal Revenue Code. Like real estate investment trusts (REITs), as long as the RIC meets certain income, diversity, and distribution requirements, the company pays little or no corporate income tax. As a pass-through tax structure, RICs must distribute at least 90 percent of taxable income as dividends to investors.  Most BDCs distribute 98 percent of their taxable income to avoid all corporate taxation.  (RICs fall under section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code; REITS fall under section 856.).  At least two BDCs have stated that they intend to be taxed as a REIT.

Because income is not taxed at the corporate level, distributions to investors are generally taxable for investors based on the type of income earned by the BDC. For example, ordinary income to the BDC is taxable for investors at ordinary income rates, while capital gains income to the BDC is generally taxable for investors at capital gains rates.
Historically, BDCs are listed on a national stock exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ.  Recently, as is common for REITs, some BDCs have declined listing on an exchange.  Unlisted BDCs are required to follow the same regulatory structure as listed BDCs.

==Uniqueness of BDCs==

BDCs are similar to venture capital (VC) or private equity (PE) funds since they provide investors with a way to invest in small companies and participate in the sale of those investments. However, VC and PE funds are often closed to all but wealthy investors. BDCs, on the other hand, allow anyone who purchases a share to participate in the open market. This feature often attracts money to newly public BDCs, thereby giving them a faster way to raise capital for investments than VC funds, which are generally closed end funds created by wealthy investors.http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/businesses-corporations/business-development-company-bdc-925
