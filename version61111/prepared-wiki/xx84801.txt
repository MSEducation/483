===Radio and television===

Punt and Dennis' first appeared on television in Jasper Carrott's shows during the late 1980s. They came to public attention as one half of The Mary Whitehouse Experience, a comedy show on BBC Radio 1 which then transferred to television. While the other two stars of the series, Rob Newman and David Baddiel became major celebrities - playing to sell out audiences at Wembley Arena Blast from the past 29 October 2007 Retrieved 16 March 2010 - Punt and Dennis never attained the same level of prominence as a double act. Their own TV series, The Imaginatively Titled Punt and Dennis Show, did not meet the same success as The Mary Whitehouse Experience had though it won larger audiences and was given a higher profile than the other pairing's spin-off project Newman and Baddiel in Pieces.
The duo continued to collaborate despite each having forged their own separate careers - Dennis as a panellist and presenter and Punt as a screenwriter. Their more prominent works include long-running radio shows It's Been a Bad Week (BBC Radio 2) and BBC Radio 4 shows The Party Line and the currently running The Now Show.[tpl]cite news|title=Punt & Denis, and comedic double acts|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/may/02/comedy.williamcook|publisher=guardian.co.uk|date=2 May 2003[/tpl] They also contribute to the satirical hit panel game Mock the Week. Punt is a programme associate while Dennis is a regular panellist alongside Frankie Boyle and later Chris Addison.

The Milky Milky tour was filmed live on stage at Bristol's Hippodrome Theatre in 1992 and released on VHS Video.
In 2007 they performed a UK tour of their comedy called Stuff and Nonsense.
