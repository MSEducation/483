==History==

Inaugurated in 1901, the Tooting Bec Trophy was originally a 36-hole stroke play tournament, originally at the Tooting Bec (or Furzedown) Golf Club in south west London. In 1910 it was a qualifying tournament for the News of the World Match Play, and in 1911 was the southern section qualifying tournament for the Sphere & Tatler foursomes. Since 1924, it has not been a standalone tournament, and the trophy has been awarded to the PGA member born in, or with a parent or parents born in, the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland who records the lowest single-round score in the Open.
