CATEGORIES: 16th-century architecture, Churches in Siena

San Giuseppe is a church in Siena, Tuscany, Italy. 
The church was commissioned by the contrada dell'Onda and begun in 1521. Construction continued for the whole century.
The fa√ßade, finished in 1653, is mostly in brickwork, with two superimposed orders divided by pilaster strips. The interior is on the Greek Cross plan, surmounted by an octagonal dome with a lantern. Decoration is attributed to the Nasini family. The crypt, a suggestive 16th century hall, contains the contrada's museum.
