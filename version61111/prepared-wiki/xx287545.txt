Bowyer-Trollinger Farm is a historic home and farm located at Childress, Montgomery County, Virginia.  The farmhouse was built in four sections beginning in about 1825 and ending in about 1910.  It started as a three-bay, two-story, apparently rectangular, single-pen log dwelling. Also on the property are the contributing farm office, mid-19th-century washhouse, spring house, barn, and corn crib, and an early 20th-century apple house/carbide gas lighting outbuilding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Montgomery/060-0084_Bowyer-Trollinger_Farm_1991_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Bowyer-Trollinger Farm|author=Gibson Worsham| date=June 1988|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl] and Accompanying photo
