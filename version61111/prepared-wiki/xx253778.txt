Mallu Magalhães is the debut studio album by the Brazilian folk singer Mallu Magalhães, released on November 15, 2008, through the Agência de Musica.
The album was also released only with the standard version. After his release, the album received favorable reviews in most of the songs. It produced four singles.

==Background and concept==

In July 2008, Mallu entered a studio booked in Brazil to start recording the songs for the album. In the recording used analog equipment and even a mixer of the legendary studio Abbey Road to have a sound more similar to artists such as Beatles and Bob Dylan. Mario Caldato Jr, who worked with Beck, Beastie Boys and Marcelo D2, was responsible for production.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.new.divirta-se.uai.com.br/html/sessao_19/2008/10/17/ficha_musica/id_sessao=19&id_noticia=4004/ficha_musica.shtml |title=Divirta-se Notícia - Mallu Magalhães lança seu primeiro disco independente |publisher=New.divirta-se.uai.com.br |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2012-03-01[/tpl]
For the recording disc, she had the same band that recorded the demos MySpace: Kadu Abecassis (guitar), Jorge Moreira (drums), Thiago Consorti (bass) and Rodrigo de Alencar (piano).

==Cover==

The cover image of a simple lion that resembles the image on top of some brands of Brazilian cookies refers subtly to Caetano Veloso, who Magalhães heard as a child, and the symbols of folk and American country music, which are influences of Mallu's musical style.[tpl]cn|date=February 2013[/tpl]
