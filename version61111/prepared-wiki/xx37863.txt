==Name==

The PricewaterhouseCoopers name was formed by the combination of the names of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, following their merger in 1998. On 20 September 2010, PricewaterhouseCoopers rebranded as PwC, although the legal name of the firm remained PricewaterhouseCoopers.

==History==

The firm was created in 1998 when Coopers & Lybrand merged with Price Waterhouse. The two firms each had histories dating back to the 19th century.

===Coopers & Lybrand===

In 1854 William Cooper founded an accountancy practice in London, which became Cooper Brothers seven years later when his three brothers joined.
In 1898, Robert H. Montgomery, William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr. and his brother T. Edward Ross formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery in the United States.
In 1957 Cooper Brothers; Lybrand, Ross Bros & Montgomery and a Canadian firm McDonald, Currie and Co, agreed to adopt the name Coopers & Lybrand in international practice. In 1973 the three member firms in the UK, US and Canada changed their names to Coopers & Lybrand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/Library/subjects/accounting%20history/family%20trees/family-tree-coopers-lybrand |title=ICAEW: Firms family trees [/tpl] Then in 1980 Coopers & Lybrand expanded its expertise in insolvency substantially by acquiring Cork Gully, a leading firm in that field in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/411874/UK-Profile---Michael-Jordan-Cork-Gully/ |title=Profile – Michael Jordan of Cork Gully |publisher=Management Today |date= 1 Jan 1993 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |archivedate=3 August 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69dryczMo [/tpl] In 1990 in certain countries including the UK, Coopers & Lybrand merged with Deloitte Haskins & Sells to become Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, in 1992 renamed Coopers & Lybrand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/155667/icaew_ga/en/Home/About_us/History_of_accounting/Coopers__Lybrand |title=ICAEW family trees |publisher=Icaew.com [/tpl]

===Price Waterhouse===

Samuel Lowell Price, an accountant, founded an accountancy practice in London in 1849.[tpl]cite book | title = Accounting for Success: a History of Price Waterhouse in America 1890–1990 | publisher = Harvard Business School Press | isbn = 978-0-87584-328-5 | editor =  | url = [/tpl] In 1865 Price went into partnership with William Hopkins Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse. Holyland left shortly after to work alone in accountancy and the firm was known from 1874 as Price, Waterhouse & Co. (The comma was dropped from the name much later.) The original partnership agreement, signed by Price, Holyland and Waterhouse could be found in Southwark Towers, one of PwC's important legacy offices (now demolished).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=164843|title=Price Waterhouse (Biographical details)|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl]
By the late 19th century, Price Waterhouse had gained significant recognition as an accounting firm. As a result of growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm itself soon expanded rapidly. The original British firm opened an office in Liverpool in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was therefore a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically rather than being the result of an international merger.
In a further effort to take advantage of economies of scale, PW and Arthur Andersen discussed a merger in 1989[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/companies/account.html |title=University of Washington: Accounting firms and organisations |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu [/tpl] but the negotiations failed mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with IBM and PW's audit of IBM as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms.  It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl]

===1998 to present===

In 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase 'w').Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997
After the merger the firm had a large professional consulting branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated ERP systems for multi-national companies.
PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, Ernst & Young was the first of the Big Four to sell its consulting services, to Capgemini.Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini Cnet News, 29 February 2000
The fallout from the Enron, Worldcom and other financial auditing scandals that led to the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act severely limited the interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services.  PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC therefore planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to Hewlett Packard (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid BBC News, 13 November 2000

PwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm. An outside consultancy, Wolff Olins, was hired to create a brand image for the new entity, called "Monday".Monday:[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] The firm's CEO, Greg Brenneman described the unusual name as "a real word, concise, recognizable, global and the right fit for a company that works hard to deliver results."Monday name change for PwC, BBC News, 10 June 2002. These plans were soon revised, however. In October 2002, PwC sold the entire consultancy business to IBM for approximately $3.9 billion in cash and stock.

===Consulting===

PwC has developed several broader consulting initiatives in the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, including a global effort to assist corporations with outsourcing, as well as a global political risk assessment with the political risk advisory firm Eurasia Group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/extweb/pwcpublications.nsf/docid/6c7fe77bcc684d01852571620083bd9a |title=How managing political risk improves global financial performance |publisher=PWC [/tpl]
Advisory services offered by PwC also include two actuarial consultancy departments; Actuarial and Insurance Management Solutions (AIMS) and a sub branch of "Human Resource Services" (HRS).

==Controversies==

===Willie Nelson===

In 1990, the US Internal Revenue Service seized most of the assets of Willie Nelson, claiming he owed $32 million in back taxes, including penalties and interest. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put him into tax shelters that were later disallowed by the IRS.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD7113FF931A3575AC0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |quote=$32 million bill for delinquent taxes ... pay for the $45 million lawsuit Mr. Nelson filed last year against his former accountants at Price Waterhouse, who he contends put him into ill-advised tax shelters.

===American International Group Inc.===

BusinessWeek said that PwC was American International Group Inc.'s auditor through years of "questionable dealings." AIG on 30 March 2005 said that deals with a Barbados-based insurance company, for instance, may have been incorrectly accounted for over the past 14 years, because an AIG-affiliated company may have been secretly covering that insurer's losses.Tough Questions For AIG's Auditors – Regulators are probing if PwC let the financial shenanigans slip through Businessweek, Joseph Weber, Mike McNamee, Marcia Vickers and Diane Brady, 11 APRIL 2005
BusinessWeek said that PwC appears to have "dropped the ball" on the deals between AIG and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s General Re Corp. General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG. BusinessWeek asked: "Did the auditor do its job by verifying that AIG was assuming risk on claims beyond the $500 million, thus allowing AIG to account for the deal as insurance? That's Accounting 101 in any reinsurance transaction."

===ChuoAoyama Suspension===

From 2000 to 2006, PwC's affiliate of assurance service in Japan was [tpl]Nihongo|ChuoAoyama Audit Corporation|中央青山監査法人|Chūō-Aoyama Kansa Hōjin[/tpl]. In May 2006, the Financial Services Agency of Japan suspended ChuoAoyama from provision of some statutory auditing services for two months following the collapse of cosmetics company Kanebo, of which three of the partners were found assisting with accounting fraud for boosting earnings by the company of about $1.9 billion over the course of five years. The accountants got suspended prison terms up to eighteen months from the Tokyo District Court after the judge deemed them to have played a "passive role" in the crime.CPAs in Kanebo fraud avoid prison, The Japan Times (registration required), 10 August 2006. The suspension was the first ever imposed on a major accounting firm in the country. Many of the firm's largest clients were forced to find replacement auditors before the suspension began that July.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1194088,00.html#ixzz1IokjSHHm |title=Japan's Regulators Get Tough |date=15 May 2006 |author=Jim Frederick |work=Time[/tpl]
Shortly after the suspension of ChuoAoyama, PwC acted quickly to stem any possible client attrition as a result of the scandal. It set up the PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, and some of ChuoAoyama's accountants (but most of the international divisions) moved to the new firm. ChuoAoyama resumed operations on 1 September under the Misuzu name. However, by this point the two firms combined had 30% fewer clients than did ChuoAoyama prior to its suspension.Rocky road for new accounting firm, The Daily Yomiuri, 2 September 2006.[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] Misuzu was dissolved in July 2007.New Japanese Internal Controls Framework Fraud Magazine, November/December 2007

===Yukos prosecutions===

In November 2010, The New York Times reported that PwC had been assisting the Russian Government with prosecutions in relation to alleged tax evasion at Yukos stating "...Then, in 2007, with the prospect of parole on the horizon, the same prosecutors — with what appears to be the complicity of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Yukos's longtime accounting firm — indicted the two men (Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev), again, bringing a new round of Kafkaesque charges."New York Times issue of 6 November 2010, business columnist Joe Nocera
A cable from the US embassy in Moscow stated that the trial was politically motivated and that a deposition in a US court by PricewaterhouseCoopers may show that PwC was pressured by the Russian government to withdraw its prior Yukos audits.

===JP Morgan Securities audit===

In 2012, the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board (AADB) of the UK fined PwC a record £1.4m for wrongly reporting to the Financial Services Authority that JP Morgan Securities had complied with client money rules which protects client funds. The accountants neglected to check whether JP Morgan had the correct systems in place, and failed to gather sufficient evidence to form opinions on the issue, and as a result, failed to report that JP Morgan failed to hold client money separate from JP Morgan's money. It is the greatest penalty administered to a professional accountancy firm in the UK.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8995981/PwC-fined-record-1.4m-over-JP-Morgan-audit.html |title=PwC fined record £1.4m over JP Morgan audit |date=5 January 2012 |author=Anna White |work=The Daily Telegraph [/tpl]

===World Bank Favouring for Water Privatization in Delhi===

PricewaterhouseCoopers was found to be unethically favored by the World Bank in a bid to privatize the water distribution system of Delhi, India, an effort that was alleged as corrupt by investigators.RTI expose of how World Bank had arm-twisted Delhi Jal Board for water privatisation. Money Life. January 1, 2012. When bidding took place, PwC repeatedly failed in each round, and the World Bank in each case pressured PwC to be pushed to the next round and eventually win the bid. The effort at privatization fell through when an investigation was conducted by Arvind Kejriwal and the non-governmental organization (NGO) Parivartan in 2005. After submitting a Right to Information (RTI) request, Parivartan received 9000 pages of correspondence and consultation with the World Bank, where it was revealed that the privatization of Delhi's water supply would provide salaries of $25,000 a month to four administrators of each of the 21 water zones, which amounted to over $25 million per year, increasing the budget by over 60% and water taxes 9 times.Delhi Water Privatisation Plan.

The Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which administers the water system of Delhi, was first approached by Parivartan in November 2004, following a report by the newspaper The Asian Age, where the scheme was revealed to the public for the first time. The DJB denied the existence of the project, but after an appeal, the RTI request was granted. The documents revealed that the project began in 1998, in complete secrecy within the DJB administration. The DJB approached the World Bank for a loan to improve the water system, which it approved, and the effort began with a $2.5 million consultation loan. The Delhi government could have easily provided the money, and the interest rate of 12% that was to be loaned by the World Bank could have been raised on capital markets for 6%. Following the consultation, 35 multi-national companies bid, of which six were to be short listed. When PwC was in 10th place, the World Bank said that at least one company should be from a developing country, and since PwC made the bid from its Kolkata office, it was dubbed an "Indian" company, and its rank was dropped to 6th. When PwC failed in the second round, the World Bank pressured the DJB to start over with a fresh round of bidding. Only one company succeeded in the new round that was not PwC, and the World Bank had the lowest marks from an evaluator thrown out. The contract was awarded to PwC in 2001.RTI Spurs Debate on World Bank Involvement in Delhi Water Deal. Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. Following the investigation by Parivartan, a campaign was waged by Kejriwal, Aruna Roy, and other activists across Delhi, and the DJB withdrew the loan application to the World Bank.
