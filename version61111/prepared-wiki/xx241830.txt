[[Hybrid taxi]]

CATEGORIES: Environmentally-friendly taxis, Taxicabs, Hybrid electric vehicles

Hybrid taxi or hybrid electric taxi is a taxicab service provided with a hybrid electric car (HEV), which combines a conventional internal combustion engine propulsion system with an electric propulsion system.
In 2000 North America's first hybrid taxi was put into service in Vancouver, British Columbia, operating a 2001 Toyota Prius which traveled over [tpl]convert|332000|km|mi|-3[/tpl] before being retired.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hybridexperience.ca/Toyota_Prius.htm|title=North America's Highest Mileage Hybrid Taxis|publisher=The Hybrid Experience Report|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8839690/|title=Taxi driver makes career out of hybrids|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-08-05|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] Several major cities in the world are adding hybrid taxis to their taxicab fleets, led by San Francisco where hybrid represent almost 50% of its taxicab fleet by March 2010, and New York City where hybrids taxis represent 45% of the city's total fleet by September 2012. Unlike conventional gasoline cars, hybrids get better fuel economy, do well at slow speeds or idling, and have cleaner emissions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gearlog.com/2009/04/hybrid_taxis_doing_well_in_san.php|title=Hybrid Taxis Doing Well in San Francisco|publisher=GearLog|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]

===San Francisco===

San Francisco became in 2005 one of the first cities to introduce hybrids for taxi service, with a fleet of 15 Ford Escape Hybrids, and by 2009 the original Escape Hybrids were retired after [tpl]convert|300000|mi|sp=us[/tpl] per vehicle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/fords-us-hybrid-sales-up-73-for-first-9-months-of-2009-total-us-hybrid-sales-down-14-for-same-period.html|title=Ford’s US Hybrid Sales Up 73% for First 9 Months of 2009; Total US Hybrid Sales Down 14% for Same Period|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2009-10-14|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] In 2007 the city approved the Clean Air Taxi Grant Program in order to encourage cab companies to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, by providing incentives of USD2,000 per new alternative fuel vehicle on a first-come, first-served basis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfmayor.org/press-room/press-releases/press-release-half-of-sf-taxi-fleet-is-alternative-vehicles/|title=Mayor Newsom Announces That More Than Half of San Francisco’s Taxi Fleet is Alternative Vehicles|publisher=San Francisco's Office of the Mayor (Press release)|date=2010-03-22|accessdate=2010-04-12[/tpl]
Out of a total of 1,378 taxis eligible for the incentive (96 wheelchair accessible taxi-vans are excluded) 788 are alternative fuel vehicles, representing 57% of the San Francisco's taxicab fleet by March 2010. Gasoline-electric hybrids accounted for 657 green taxis and compressed natural gas vehicles for the remaining 131.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/news/halfway-green-taxi-fleet-san-francisco-27576.html|title=Halfway to a Green Taxi Fleet in San Francisco |publisher=HybridCars.com |date=2010-03-22|accessdate=2010-04-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-23/bay-area/18843369_1_affordable-housing-mayor-bloomberg-taxicab|title=More than half of taxis now green, Newsom says|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2010-03-23|accessdate=2010-04-12 | first1=Rachel | last1=Gordon | first2=Heather | last2=Knight[/tpl]

===New York City===

The City Council passed a bill in 2003 requiring the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission to set aside a proportion of new taxi medallions to be granted to vehicles that use cleaner fuels. The Commission cleared the first six hybrid models to be used as taxicabs by mid-2005 as there were concerns about which hybrids on the market had enough leg room.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/27/nyregion/27hybrid.html?scp=6&sq=hybrid%20taxis%20new%20york%20city%20-harlem&st=cse|title=City Taxi Agency Approves Use of Six Hybrid Models|publisher=New York Times|author=Sewell Chan|date=2005-07-25|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] The models authorized were the Ford Escape Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Lexus RX 400h, Toyota Prius, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda Civic Hybrid. The first 27 hybrid taxis entered service in November 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21TAXI.html?scp=8&sq=hybrid%20taxis%20new%20york%20city%20-harlem&st=cse|title=Is That a Tinge of Green on New York's Yellow Cabs?|publisher=New York Times|author=Austin Considine|date=2006-05-21|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] As an incentive for fleet owners to buy hybrids, the Commission auctioned in 2004 the first taxi medallions for hybrids at discounted price of around US$170,000 less than the regular medallion price of US$400,000. In 2006 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that 254 of the 308 medallions to be auctioned by mid-2006 would be designated for hybrid and alternative-fuel cabs. The remaining 54 were for handicapped-accessible taxis.
As integral part of the 2007 PlaNYC, Mayor Bloomberg set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. For this purpose, its component GreeNYC plan established that all new taxi vehicles entering the fleet beginning in October 2008 should have a fuel economy of [tpl]convert|25|mpgus|sp=us[/tpl], rising to [tpl]convert|30|mpgus|sp=us[/tpl] for cars entering the fleet in October 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21TAXI.html?scp=8&sq=hybrid%20taxis%20new%20york%20city%20-harlem&st=cse|title=Mayor Plans an All-Hybrid Taxi Fleet|publisher=New York Times|author=Ray Rivera|date=2007-05-23|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] Since hybrid cars were at that time the only vehicles that could meet those fuel standards, it was expected that most of New York's 13,000 taxis would be hybrids by 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/automobiles/27TAXI.html?ei=5124&en=bf63718c21ba02f7&ex=1366948800&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink&pagewanted=all|title=The Greening of the Yellow Fleet|publisher=New York Times|author=Ken Belson|date=2008-04-27|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl]
In September 2008 a group of taxi operators sued the city under the allegation that hybrids are not suitable for city taxis and partly based on a report that claimed that "hybrids could not handle 24-hour operation and that air bags might not deploy in taxis that have safety partitions between the driver and passengers."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-09-09-1482138991_x.htm|title=Lawsuit: Hybrid taxis couldn't handle NYC streets|publisher=USA Today|author=Larry Neumeister|date=2008-09-09|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] In October 2008 a federal judge blocked New York City from implementing the fuel economy requirement. The ruling established that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their key legal argument, "that the new regulations were pre-empted under federal law, which reserve regulation of fuel economy and emissions standards to federal agencies."[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/judge-blocks-hybrid-taxi-requirement/#more-4613|title=Judge Blocks Hybrid Taxi Requirement|publisher=New York Times|author=Sewell Chan|date=2008-10-31|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] At the time of the ruling NYC already had nearly 1,500 hybrids as a result of voluntary efforts, and only a fraction as a result of the medallion incentives.
In March 2009 the Bloomberg administration attempted a different policy for replacing the taxicab fleet with hybrid or other low-emission vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission enacted a set of incentives to allow taxi fleet owners to charge drivers more to drive hybrid or clean diesel cabs, and penalize fleet owners by lowering the amount they could charge to lease cabs that use more fuel and pollute more. The city argued that drivers would not be hurt by the higher hybrid leasing fees because those cars use less gasoline.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/nyregion/27taxis.html?scp=14&sq=hybrid%20taxis%20new%20york%20city%20-harlem&st=cse|title=Panel Enacts Incentives for Hybrids in Cab Fleets|publisher=New York Times|author=William Newman |date=2009-03-29|accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] This approach was also blocked after some taxi groups sued and obtained a preliminary court injunction.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/judge-blocks-hybrid-taxi-requirement/#more-4613|title=Judge Blocks Hybrid Taxi Requirement|publisher=New York Times|author=Sewell Chan|date=2008-10-31|accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/federal-bill-would-clear-way-for-green-taxi-fleet/?scp=1&sq=Green%20Taxi%20Act&st=cse|title=Federal Bill Would Clear Way for Green Taxi Fleet|publisher=New York Times|author=Michael M.

The court upheld the initial ruling on the grounds that "the city's rules amounted to an effort to mandate fuel economy and emissions standards, something that only the federal government is allowed to do."[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/appeals-court-rejects-effort-to-create-hybrid-taxi-fleet/?emc=eta1|title=Appeals Court Rejects Effort to Create Hybrid Taxi Fleet|publisher=New York Times|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2010-07-31 | first=Andy | last=Newman[/tpl] On February 28, 2011, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the city.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/nyregion/01taxi.html?_r=1&ref=automobiles|title=City’s Lengthy Push for Hybrid-Engine Taxicabs Hits a Legal Dead End|publisher=New York Times|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-03-01|first=Michael M. | last=Grynbaum[/tpl] 
As of mid-2009 New York City had reached 2,019 hybrid taxis and 12 clean diesel vehicles, representing 15% of New York's  13,237 taxis in service, the most in any city in North America, and by this time owners began retiring its original hybrid fleet after [tpl]convert|300000|and|350000|mi|sp=us[/tpl] per vehicle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infotaxi.org/article_142.htm|title=Hybrid taxis slowly catching on in the west|publisher=Infotaxi|author=Fred Gober|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] The Taxi and Limousine Commission's list of 12 vehicle models that can be used as yellow taxis includes nine models are hybrids.

The deployment of the city's Taxi of Tomorrow, scheduled to begin in 2013, would result in almost all the existing fleet to be replaced within 3 years with the non hybrid Nissan NV200 passenger van. Only about 1,000 taxis will not be phase out and exempted for various reasons, such as 273 taxis whose medallions require that they be high-mileage vehicles. However, in early 2013 the Greater New York Taxi Association filed suit against the city arguing that the Taxi of Tomorrow plan violates a section of the city’s administrative code because the  Nissan NV200 is not a hybrid.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/nyregion/a-new-obstacle-to-the-taxi-of-tomorrow.html?_r=0|title=Doubting if Tomorrow Will Ever Come for Taxi|author=Matt Flegenheimer|work=The New York Times|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl] In May 2013 a State Supreme Court judge blocked the Bloomberg administration’s plan for introducing the Taxi of Tomorrow, ruling that it violated a New York City provision requiring a hybrid option for taxi operators.

===Boston===

The city of Boston launched the CleanAir Cabs program in April 2007. The program promotes replacing older fuel-inefficient cabs with hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles as the existing fleet ages out.  The main benefit of the CleanAir Cabs program for cab drivers is the operating savings, as hybrid taxi cabs can get up to three times as many miles per gallon of fuel as the old Crown Victoria cabs. In addition, hybrid taxi drivers get two "front of the line" passes per shift at Logan Airport, allowing them to make two extra trips daily. Hybrid taxi owners who lease vehicles to drivers are allowed to charge drivers [tpl]USD|15[/tpl] more per shift to lease a taxi, enabling medallion owners to earn more than [tpl]USD|5,000[/tpl] annually. By early 2009 this voluntary program had translated into about 50 hybrid operating on Boston’s streets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bphc.org/programs/cib/environmentalhealth/environmentalhazards/climatechange/cleanaircabs/Pages/Home.aspx|title=Clean Air Cabs|publisher=Boston Public Health Commission|accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/45148.pdf|title=Hybrid Taxis Give Fuel Economy a Lift|author=Clean Cities|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|date=April 2009|accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl]
In August 2008 Boston mandated that all its 1,825 taxi fleet must be converted to hybrids by 2015.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/08/bostons_taxi_fl.html|title=Boston's taxi fleet to go hybrid by 2015 |publisher=The Boston Globe|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] As of March 2009 about 10% of the taxicab fleet were already hybrids as owner voluntarily began introducing HEVs since 2002, mainly Toyota Camry Hybrids plus those introduced by the incentives of the CleanAir Cabs.
However, in March 2009 a group of taxi drivers and medallion owners sued in federal court the City of Boston to block the requirement and requested the city to delay the changeover for two or three years. They also complaint that the new rule is unreasonable because it forbids taxi owners from buying used hybrids.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/31/cabbies_suit_says_hybrid_rule_threatens_work/|title=Cabbies' suit says hybrid rule threaten work|publisher=The Boston Globe|author=Jonathan Saltzman |date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] In July 2009 a federal judge granted the request for a temporary injunction and ordered the city to stop enforcing the rule requiring medallion owners to buy new hybrid cars by 2015.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/07/24/judge_blocks_hubs_rule_on_hybrid_cab_fleet/|title=Judge blocks Hub’s rule on hybrid cab fleet|publisher=The Boston Globe|author= Noah Bierman|date=2009-07-24|accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] Among others, the taxi owners argued that the requirements infringe on federal authority to set fuel-economy and emissions standards, an argument successfully used by New York cab owners to block a similar requirement. 
In April 2012, the City of Boston awarded the Boston Cab Association with the 2012 Green Business Award for its fleet conversion to hybrid vehicles. Boston Cab has more than 400 hybrid taxis out of its 500 vehicle fleet, and has plans to convert the entire fleet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120420005614/en/Boston-Cab-Association-Wins-2012-Green-Business|title=Boston Cab Association Wins 2012 Green Business Award|author= |publisher=Business Wire |date=2012-04-20|accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]

===Paris===

The taxi company Verture began operations in Paris in September 2007 with a hybrid only fleet made of Toyota Prius. The company Taxis G7 introduced in October 2007 its first hybrid taxis in Paris, and by early 2012 G7 had 500 hybrid taxis in operation in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxisverts.be/blog/vert/des-taxis-verts-a-paris/|title=Des Taxis Verts à Paris|language=French|trans_title=Green Taxis in Paris|publisher=Taxis Verts Bruxelles|date=April 2010|accessdate=2012-05-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enerzine.com/1036/13634+taxis-g7-a-accueilli-son-500eme-taxi-hybride-greencab+.html|title=TAXIS G7 a accueilli son 500ème taxi hybride (GreenCab)|language=French|trans_title= Taxis G7 welcomed its 500th hybrid taxi(GreenCab) |publisher=Enerzine.com|date=2012-03-13|accessdate=2012-05-05[/tpl] Taxis Bleus introduced 30 hybrid taxis in September 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greenhotelparis.com/ecotourism/eco-taxis-in-paris/|title=Eco-taxis in Paris|publisher=Hotel Gavarni|date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2012-05-05[/tpl]

===San Antonio===

Through an ordinance, the city of San Antonio, Texas introduced a voluntary program in 2007 that allows taxi owners to swap the permit of one non-hybrid car for two permits valid only for hybrid electric vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/publications/pd/020/08-02/airinitiativesyieldresults.html|title=Air Initiatives Yield Results: Plans are Homegrown|publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality|year=2008|accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl] To prevent one fleet from obtaining all the permits, the largest company is allowed to replace only 1% of its fleet each year (six vehicles), while smaller companies can replace up to two vehicles. The statewide Texas Green & Go Clean Taxi Partnership was built based on the San Antonio program’s success. As of July 2010, more than 100 of the city’s 843 taxis were hybrids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/progs/ddown_exp.php/TAXI/227|title=San Antonio is Switching to Hybrid Taxis|author=Alternative Fuels and Advance Vehicles Data Center|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|date=2010-07-28|accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl]

===Arlington===

The Arlington County Board authorized in September 2007 a new taxi company, EnviroCAB, to operate with an all-hybrid fleet of 50 vehicles. In addition, the Board authorized existing companies permission to add 35 hybrid taxis. The introduction of green taxis is part of a county campaign known as Fresh AIRE, or Arlington Initiative to Reduce Emissions. AIRE aims to cut production of greenhouse gases from county buildings and vehicles by 10% by 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/19/AR2007091902438.html|title=Arlinton County: Board Gives Go-Ahead to Eco-Friendly Taxicabs|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2009-10-17|first=Kirstin|last=Downey[/tpl]
The hybrid taxis began operating in February 2008, allowing EnviroCAB to become the first all-hybrid taxicab fleet in the United States. EnviroCAB fleet consist of Toyota Prii, Toyota Camry Hybrids, Toyota Highlander Hybrids, and Ford Escape Hybrids.
The company claims to be the first carbon-negative taxicab company in the world, as it will completely offset its own emissions by purchasing "clean-source" offset credits. Also, EnviroCAB expects to offset the emissions of 100 of the approximately 685 non-hybrid taxis operating in Arlington by March 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.envirotaxicab.com/pr05.html|title=EnviroCAB Launches in Greater Washington, D.C.

===Cambridge===

In April 2008, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in partnership with Whole Foods Market, began its Clear Air Cab program to promote the introduction of hybrid taxis with the objective  to reduce the environmental impact of the city’s taxicabs by encouraging a switch to hybrid vehicles.
Whole Foods made a [tpl]USD|30,000[/tpl] gift to sponsor the purchase of first six new Toyota Camry Hybrid taxis. In exchange, the company obtained exclusive three-year rights to display advertisements on these taxis.  The city of Cambridge provided an additional [tpl]USD|10,000[/tpl] grant per vehicle, using funds from the auction of two taxi medallions. As of March 2009, the program resulted in 15 hybrid taxis operating in the city. Whole Foods is no longer providing grants but the city continues to do so. The taxis participating in the Clean Air Cab program display a distinctive green stripe [tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/deptann.cfm?story_id=1655&pv=Yes|title=License Commission Announces New Hybrid Cabs|publisher=City of Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=2008-04-08|accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl]
According to the Cambridge License Commission (CLC), and based on a study conducted by John Moore, along with Boston Cab and the Boston Public Health Commission, the average Cambridge cab driver travels about [tpl]Convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] per shift.   Assuming a gasoline price of [tpl]USD|3[/tpl] per gallon ($0.79 per liter), the cab drivers would save an average of $18 to $21 per shift. During an average shift a Cambridge hybrid taxi will use between three to four gallons of gasoline as opposed to 10 gallons or more burnt by an outdated Crown Victoria taxicab.

===Hamburg===

In November 2008 Hamburg became the first city in Germany to deploy a fleet of 130 environmentally friendly taxis that run on a hybrid electric or natural gas motor. Under the program, taxicabs that meet the low-emissions standards are allowed to be branded with an "Eco Taxis" logo.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/11/08/germanys_first_eco_friendly_taxis_in_hamburg/|title=Germany's first eco-friendly taxis in Hamburg|author=Associated Press|work=Boston Globe|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2011-07-13[/tpl]

===Phoenix===

In October 2009, a fleet of 26 Toyota Prius began operating in Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the country's second all-hybrid taxicab fleet after Arlington, Virginia. The new company, Clean Air Cab, plans to expand its fleet to more than 200 hybrids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/10/20/all-hybrid-taxi-fleet-debuts-sunny-phoenix|title=All-Hybrid Taxi Fleet Debuts in Sunny Phoenix|publisher=GreenBiz|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl]
Clean Air Cab claims to be a carbon-neutral taxi service. In addition to lowering emissions with its hybrid fleet, the company purchases carbon offsets and supports global reforestation by subsidizing the planting of 10 Brazilian rainforest trees monthly for each cab in service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleanaircab.com/about/carbon_offsets.php|title=Clean Air Cab: Carbon Offsets|publisher=Clean Air Cab|accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl]

===Chicago===

Chicago has a fleet of 6,700 to 6,800 active taxicabs on any given day. In 2011, green taxis were added to
