Through 2003, the U-17s went undefeated in international matches, defeating youth teams from Canada and Germany, and repeated that feat in 2004. In 2005, however, the U-17s suffered defeats in matches against the Canadian and Mexican youth teams.
In 2006, the U-17s competed against various youth teams from Argentina and Germany, including a loss to the senior Argentina women's national team.About the Team, US Soccer.
