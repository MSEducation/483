==Biography==

John Edward Berry was born on September 14, 1959 in Aiken, South Carolina, to James and Marie Berry, and raised in the Atlanta, Georgia area. He was exposed to a variety of music, as his father preferred Van Cliburn, his mother had a strong taste for gospel.  Berry grew up listening to an AM station from Atlanta; "It was on in dad's garage constantly, WQXI 79 AM," Berry says. "They played a pretty eclectic selection, country and Top 40 in the 1970s."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theentertainmentnexus.com/interviews/ten/berryJohn2006Dec.htm |title=T.E.N. - John Berry Interview |publisher=Theentertainmentnexus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/511265.html?nav=5094 |title=Country singer John Berry headlines benefit concert - journal-news.net | News, sports, jobs, community information for Martinsburg - The Journal |publisher=journal-news.net |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2010-08-13[/tpl]
Berry began learning the guitar in 1972 (at the age of 12), he has named influences such as James Taylor, Harry Chapin, and, his favourite, John Denver.  In a 2006 interview he said: "prior to playing guitar, I really loved the “Philly Soul Sound” like The Chi-Lites and The Stylistics." Berry moved to soul, gospel and country music and began recording his own albums at home in 1979.Country singer John Berry headlines benefit concert - journal-news.net | News, sports, jobs, community information for Martinsburg - The Journal
In 1981, at age 19, while riding his motorcycle, Berry was hit by a car, breaking both of his legs and his left hip. He had just lost his mother earlier that year. Doctors were afraid that he may not walk again. He spent several months in physical therapy, working to regain the use of his legs. Berry said of the incident "The coolest thing in the world that came out of it...all I could do is sit on my stool and play guitar. That’s all I’ve done ever since."  
Two years later, Berry started performing solo acoustic shows in northeast Georgia, then expanded around the southeast, building a strong name and following. He eventually made six self-produced albums, with the last one selling over 10,000 copies. He was finally signed to Liberty Records in 1992.
Berry received high praise from former President George H.W. Bush and wife Barbara when she invited him to sing for Mr. Bush's birthday party.The Myles Reif Center Performing Arts Center - Grand Rapids MinnesotaJohn Berry - A Country Christmas at Reif Center (Tuesday December 2, 2008) - UpcomingJohn Berry I Give My Heart CD Now AvailableJohn Berry - Biography[tpl]cite web|url=http://magazine.angrycountry.com/article.php?story=20070729180038153&mode=print |title=John Berry |publisher=Magazine.angrycountry.com |date=2007-07-29 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]
Early In 1994, Berry began to have terrible headaches, lost his appetite and finally blacked out during a concert. He was rushed to the hospital on May 9, 1994 in  Atlanta, where a cyst was found in the third ventricle of his brain. He stated: They went in with a fiber optic camera and laser, and removed  it. I still suffer a little from short-term memory loss. This is a rebirth of sorts and I am into that.  He uses humor when he occasionally forgets the words to a song and his wife, Robin, uses sign language to assist him. The same day he underwent brain surgery, he celebrated his first No. 1 single, "Your Love Amazes Me", from his hospital bed in Atlanta.
In 1997, a year before recording his Wildest Dreams album (released in 1999), Berry again had surgery,  for nodes on his vocal cords.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r431301|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Wildest Dreams review|last=Dillon|first=Charlotte|work=Allmusic|accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl]

===1992—1998: Liberty/Patriot Records and Capitol Records===

Berry released his self-titled major-label debut 1993 on Liberty Records. This album produced five chart singles for Berry. First was "A Mind of Her Own" at No. 55 on the Billboard country charts, followed by the No. 22 "Kiss Me in the Car".[tpl]cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=49|isbn=0-89820-177-2[/tpl] With his first major album in the stores, Berry went on the road with a major concert tour opening for the likes of Reba McEntire, Aaron Tippin, and The Mavericks. After this came "Your Love Amazes Me", which in 1994 became his only Number One hit on the Billboard charts.  Following it were the No. 5 "What's in It for Me" (originally the b-side to "Your Love Amazes Me") and No. 4 "You and Only You", the latter of which was also a Number One on the RPM country charts in Canada. John Berry was certified platinum by both the Recording Industry Association of America and Canadian Recording Industry Association.
By 1994, he was moved to Liberty's sister label, Patriot Records. That same year, Patriot re-issued two of Berry's independent albums, Saddle the Wind and Things Are Not the Same.  His 1994 hit, "Your Love Amazes Me,"  received a Grammy nomination.  In addition to the Grammy nomination, he also received several Country Music Association CMA nominations that  same year, winning the "Horizon Award", for the best new artist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/john-berry/news/john-berry-exits-capitol--12049399 |title=John Berry News - Yahoo!

In 1995, he released Standing on the Edge for Patriot. Its lead-off single, "Standing on the Edge of Goodbye," was a No. 2 hit for him that year, and was followed by the No. 4 "I Think About It All the Time." The other two singles — "If I Had Any Pride Left at All" and "Every Time My Heart Calls Your Name" — did not reach Top 20 in the US, but did in Canada. This album was certified gold in both countries.  A Christmas album entitled O Holy Night was also released in 1995, also on Patriot.   In a memorable performance at the 1995 Country Music Awards,  John sang "If I Had Any Pride Left At All"  with nothing but his acoustic guitar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blsongsandstoriesrev.htm |title=CD Review: Songs and Stories - John Berry - By Matt Bjorke |publisher=Countrymusic.about.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-08-13[/tpl]

Lead-off single "Change My Mind" peaked at No. 10 in 1996. Following it was his final Top Ten hit in the US, the No. 2 "She's Taken a Shine," and finally his last US Top 40 hit, "I Will, If You Will." The album was his final album to receive a gold certification from the RIAA.
