==History==

===Capital Radio, GWR and GCap Media===

Throughout the 1990s, Capital became one of the UK's major radio groups by acquiring a number of additional local radio stations including Red Dragon FM, BRMB and Wyvern FM. Rival GWR Group also acquired a number of local radio stations in the 1990s, including Leicester Sound, Ram FM, GWR FM, Chiltern FM, Hereward FM, Marcher Sound  and Trent FM, which operated as part of the 33 station Mix network.
Capital Radio and GWR Group's merger in 2005 resulted in the stations being amalgamated into One which existed until June 2009 when most of the stations, now in the ownership of Global Radio, who purchased GCap in 2008, were rebranded as part of The Heart Network. This left Leicester Sound, Ram FM, Red Dragon FM and Trent FM which formed Hit Music with network content produced in Nottingham. In January 2011 these stations were rebranded as part of Capital.

===Galaxy===

The first Galaxy radio station, Galaxy 97.2, was launched in 1990 in South West England initially broadcasting solely from Bristol and operated under the Chiltern Radio Group. In 1994 the station won the first regional FM licence and moved frequency to 101.0 MHz, rebranded as Galaxy 101 and expanded coverage to include South Wales. At the same time a second studio was opened in Cardiff to provide some programming alongside the existing Bristol studio. Chrysalis Radio purchased the station in 1996 and a year later, expanded the network by buying Faze FM's stations - Kiss 102 in Manchester and Kiss 105 in Yorkshire. In 1998, black community station Choice FM was acquired in Birmingham. Chrysalis Radio won the North East regional licence in 1999 and sold the original station, Galaxy 101, to the GWR Group in 2002 (now Kiss 101).
In 2007, Chrysalis Radio was sold to Global Radio and following their subsequent acquisition of GCap in 2008, XFM Scotland and Power FM were rebranded under the Galaxy moniker in November 2008. Another rebrand followed in January 2011 when all Galaxy stations were rebranded as Capital.
