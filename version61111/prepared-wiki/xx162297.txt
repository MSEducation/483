[[Cidariini]]

CATEGORIES: Larentiinae, Cidariini

The Cidariini are the largest tribe of geometer moths in the subfamily Larentiinae (possibly a distinct familyYoung (2008)). The Cidariini include many of the species known as "carpets" or, ambiguously, "carpet moths" (most other "carpets" are in the Xanthorhoini), and are among the few geometer moths that have been subject to fairly comprehensive cladistic study of their phylogeny.

==Genera==

As several larentiine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe, the genus list is still preliminary; for example the genus Almeria may well belong in the Cidariini.See references in Savela (2007) Several well-known species are also listed:
