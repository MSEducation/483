Murder 4 Hire is the fourth album by US thrash metal band Body Count. Released on August 1, 2006, this was the first album from Body Count in nine years. Work on the album had come to a pause after rhythm guitarist D-Roc the Executioner was found dead in his apartment due to his lymphoma cancer in 2004. Once the band acquired Bendrix as their new rhythm guitarist, work on the album resumed and the album was released two years later.
