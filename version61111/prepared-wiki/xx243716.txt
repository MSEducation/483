</ref> The Magic Mouse is the first consumer mouse to have [[multi-touch]] capabilities.<ref name = "Magic Mouse" /> Taking after the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[iPod Touch]], and multi-touch [[trackpad]]s, the Magic Mouse allows the use of [[gesture recognition|gestures]] such as swiping and scrolling across the top surface of the mouse to interact with desktop computers. It connects via [[Bluetooth]] and runs on two [[AA batteries]]. Apple includes two non-rechargeable batteries in the box.
The mouse requires at least Mac OS X 10.5.8. It can be configured as a two-buttoned left-handed or right-handed mouse, but the default is a single button. It uses laser tracking for increased pointer accuracy over previous generation Apple mice.[ref]
