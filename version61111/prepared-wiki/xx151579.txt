He finished the season with one reception for six yards and four special teams tackles.
In 2008, Hill came on strong in the second half of the season when Shaun Hill replaced J.T. O'Sullivan as the 49ers starting quarterback.  He finished the season with 30 catches for 317 yards and two touchdowns. Hill again played sparingly in 2009, being inactive for most of the first half of the season.  His best game was in Week 10 against the Tennessee Titans, when he caught 4 passes for 50 yards and two touchdowns. He finished the season with 9 catches for 90 yards and two touchdowns. After the 2010 preseason Hill was one of the players to be cut during final cuts. On September 14, Hill was re-signed by the 49ers due to injured Ted Ginn, Jr..
