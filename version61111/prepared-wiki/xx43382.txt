Kaunas ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aʊ|n|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-lt|ˈkɐʊˑn̪ɐs̪|Lithuanian:|Kaunas.ogg[/tpl]; also see Kaunas' other names) is the second-largest city in Lithuania and has historically been a leading centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, and cultural life. Kaunas was  the biggest city and the centre of a powiat in Trakai Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1413. During Russian Empire occupation it was the capital of the Kovno Governorate from 1843 to 1915. It became the only temporary capital city in Europe during the Interwar period. Now it is the capital of Kaunas County, the seat of the Kaunas city municipality and the Kaunas district municipality. It is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas. Kaunas is located at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the Nemunas and the Neris, and near the Kaunas Reservoir, the largest body of water entirely in Lithuania.

==Etymology==

The city's name is of Lithuanian origins and most likely derives from a personal name.[tpl]cite book | last = Zinkevičius | first = Zigmas | authorlink = Zigmas Zinkevičius | coauthors = | title = Senosios Lietuvos valstybės vardynas | publisher = Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas | year = 2007 | location = Vilnius | page = 42 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 5-420-01606-0 [/tpl]
Before Lithuania regained independence, the city was generally known in English as Kovno, the traditional Slavicized form of its name; the Polish name is Kowno; the Belarusian name is Koўнa, Kowna. An earlier Russian name was Ковно Kovno, although Каунас Kaunas has been used since 1940. The Yiddish name is Kovne (קאָװנע), while its names in German include Kaunas and Kauen. The city and its elderates also have names in other languages (see Names of Kaunas in other languages and names of Kaunas elderates in other languages).

==Folk history==

An old legend claims that Kaunas was established by the Romans in ancient times. These Romans were supposedly led by a patrician named Palemon, who had three sons: Barcus, Kunas and Sperus.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija | title=Palemonas |first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis |authorlink=Zenonas Ivinskis| location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1953–1966 |volume=21 |pages=400–401 |id=[tpl]LCC|55020366[/tpl] [/tpl] Palemon fled from Rome because he feared the mad Emperor Nero. Palemon, his sons and other relatives travelled all the way to Lithuania. After Palemon's death, his sons divided his land. Kunas got the land where Kaunas now stands. He built a fortress near the confluence of the Nemunas and Neris rivers, and the city that grew up there was named after him. There is also a suburban region in the vicinity named "Palemonas".[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://palemonas.info/palemonas/kauno-mikrorajonas-palemonas/|title=Palemonas.info; Kauno mikrorajonas – Palemonas |accessdate=13 April 2011[/tpl]

==Coat of arms==

On 30 June 1993, the historical coat of arms of Kaunas city was established by a special presidential decree. The coat of arms features a white aurochs with a golden cross between his horns, set against a deep red background. The aurochs is the original heraldic symbol of the city since 1400. The heraldic seal of Kaunas, introduced in the early 15th century during the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas, is the oldest city heraldic seal known in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The current emblem was the result of much study and discussion on the part of the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission, and realized by the artist Raimondas Miknevičius. An aurochs has replaced a wisent, depicted in the Soviet era emblem, used since 1969.
Blazon: Gules, an aurochs passant guardant argent ensigned with a cross Or between his horns.
Kaunas also has greater coat of arms, which is mainly used for Kaunas city representation purposes. Sailer, three golden balls and Latin text “Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram" (English: Love righteousness land lords) in the greater coat of arms is a reference to merchants and seafarers patron Saint Nicholas, who was regarded as a heavenly guardian of Kaunas by Queen Bona Sforza.Tūkstantmečio metų palydose bus pristatytas didysis Kauno herbas [tpl]lt icon[/tpl]Kauno miesto savivaldybė - Kauno miesto herbas [tpl]lt icon[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

According to the archeological excavations, the most affluent collections of ceramics and other artifacts found at the confluence of the Nemunas and the Neris rivers are from the second and first millennium BC. During that time people settled in some territories of the present Kaunas: the confluence of the two longest rivers of Lithuania area, Eiguliai, Lampėdžiai, Linkuva, Kaniūkai, Marvelė, Pajiesys, Romainiai, Petrašiūnai, Sargėnai, and Veršvai sites.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===

A settlement had been established on the site of the current Kaunas old town at the confluence of two large rivers, at least by the 10th century AD. It is believed the town was founded in 1030, but it is first mentioned in written sources in 1361. In the 13th century, a stone wall was built as protection from constant raids by the Teutonic Knights. In 1362, the town was captured by the Teutonic Knights, who destroyed the Kaunas Castle. The commander of the Kaunas castle garrison Vaidotas with 36 men tried to break through, but was taken prisoner. It was one of the largest and important military victories of the Teutonic Knights in the 14th century against Lithuania.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Lituanica | title=Vaidotas | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=VI | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id=[tpl]LCC | 74-114275[/tpl] | page=21[/tpl] The Kaunas castle was rebuilt at the beginning of the 15th century.http://www.kaunas.lt/index.php?1137823477 Kaunas City Municipality.

In 1408 the town was granted Magdeburg Rights by Vytautas the Great and became a centre of Kaunas Powiat in Trakai Voivodeship in 1413.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web| first=Rimvydas |last=Laužikas | publisher=Lithuanian Institute of History |work=Aruodai| date=15 October 2004 | url=http://www.aruodai.lt/paieska/terminas.php?TeId=1756 |title=Trakų vaivadija |accessdate=22 April 2011[/tpl] Vytautas ceded Kaunas the right to own the scales used for weighing the goods brought to the city or packed on site, wax processing, and woolen cloth trimming facilities. The power of the self-governing Kaunas was shared by three interrelated major institutions: vaitas (the Mayor), the Magistrate (12 lay judges and 4 burgomasters) and the so-called Benchers' Court (12 persons). Kaunas then began to gain prominence, since it was at an intersection of trade routes and a river port. In 1441 Kaunas joined the Hanseatic League, and Hansa merchant office Kontor was opened – the only one in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[tpl]cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Mills |title=The Hanseatic League in the Eastern Baltic |url=http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/hansa.html |work=Encyclopedia of Baltic History (group research project)   |publisher=University of Washington |date=May 1998[/tpl] By the 16th century, Kaunas also had a public school and a hospital and was one of the best-formed towns in the whole country.http://datos.kvb.lt/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=81 Kaunas: Dates and Facts.

In 1665, the Russian army attacked the city several times, and in 1701 the city was occupied by the Swedish army. The Black Death struck the area in 1657 and 1708, and fires destroyed parts of the city in 1731 and 1732.Kaunas History. Retrieved on 12 April 2011.

===Russian Empire===

After the final partition of the Polish–Lithuanian state in 1795, the city was taken over by the Russian Empire and became a part of Vilna Governorate. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Grand Army of Napoleon passed through Kaunas twice, devastating the city both times.
After the Partitions, Kaunas was one of the centres of the November Uprising (1830–1831) and the January Uprising (1863–1864). To suppress the local population, the Russian authorities subsequently established the Kaunas Prison and placed a huge military garrison in the town. The Russian military fortifications from that time still survive throughout the town.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]citation |title=Kauno tvirtovės istorija |publisher=Gintaras Česonis |url=http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/|year=2004|accessdate=20 March 2011[/tpl]
Kovno Governorate with a centre in Kovno (Kaunas) was formed in 1843. In 1862 a railway connecting the Russian Empire and Imperial Germany was built, making Kaunas a significant railway hub with one of the first railway tunnels in the Empire, completed in 1861. In 1898 the first power plant in Lithuania started operating.http://www.lpc.lt/en/main/about/short/development AB Lietuvos Energija. Development of Lithuanian Energy Sector.

According to the Russian census of 1897, Jews numbered 25,500, 35.3% of the total of 73,500.The population was also 25.8% Russian, 22.7% Polish, 6.6% Lithuanian.Robert Blobaum, Feliks Dzierzynski and the SDKPIL a study of the origins of Polish Communism, page 42

===Inter-war Lithuania===

After Vilnius was occupied by the Russian Bolsheviks in 1919, the government of the Republic of Lithuania established its main base here. Later, when the capital Vilnius was forcibly annexed by Poland, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania,[tpl]cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas | coauthors=Vytautas Žalys, Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

It passed some important laws, particularly on land reform, on the national currency, and adopted a new constitution. The military coup d'état took place in Kaunas on 17 December 1926. It was largely organized by the military and resulted in the replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona.[tpl]cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |coauthors=Judith B.

During it, the ultimatum presented by the Soviet Union, was debated.
Between the World Wars industry prospered in Kaunas; it was then the largest city in Lithuania. Under direction of the mayor Jonas Vileišis (1921–1931) Kaunas grew rapidly and was extensively modernised. A water and waste water system, costing more than 15 million Lithuanian litas, was put in place, the city expanded from [tpl]convert|18|to|40|km2|abbr=out[/tpl], more than 2,500 buildings were built, plus three modern bridges over the Neris and Nemunas rivers. All the city's streets were paved, horse-drawn transportation was replaced with modern bus lines, new suburbs were planned and built (Žaliakalnis neighbourhood in particular), and new parks and squares were established. The foundations for a social security system were laid, three new schools were built, and new public libraries, including the Vincas Kudirka library, were established. J. Vileišis maintained many contacts in other European cities, and as a result Kaunas was an active participant in European urban life.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |title=Klojęs Lietuvos valstybės pamatus |journal=XXI amžius (newspaper)| first=Kazimieras |last=Dobkevičius|issue=10 (1017)|date=6 February 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2011| url=http://www.xxiamzius.lt/archyvas/xxiamzius/20020206/atmi_02.html[/tpl]
During the inter-war period Kaunas had a Jewish population of 35,000–40,000, about one quarter of the city's total population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005174 |title=Kovno |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=5 May 2009[/tpl] Jews made up much of the city's commercial, artisan, and professional sectors. Kaunas was a centre of Jewish learning, and the yeshiva in Slobodka (Vilijampolė) was one of Europe's most prestigious institutes of higher Jewish learning. Kaunas had a rich and varied Jewish culture. There were almost 100 Jewish organizations, 40 synagogues, many Yiddish schools, 4 Hebrew high schools, a Jewish hospital, and scores of Jewish-owned businesses. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] It was also an important Zionist centre.

===Nazi occupation===

After the outbreak of German invasion into USSR on 22 June, the June Uprising against the retreating Red Army began in Kaunas and a short-lived period of independence was proclaimed in Kaunas on 23 June 1941.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book| last=Bubnys |first=Arūnas |authorlink=Arūnas Bubnys |title=Vokiečių okupuota Lietuva (1941–1944) |location=Vilnius |publisher=Lietuvos tautinis kultūros fondas |year=1998| isbn=9986-757-12-6|page=35[/tpl] During the battles with the Red Army, Lithuanian rebels secured government offices, police stations, shops, warehouses, and attempted to re-establish order in the city. On 25 June the main German forces marched into the city without opposition and almost in parade fashion. The Nazi Germans did not recognize the new provisional government, but they did not take any actions to dissolve it until the establishment of a German civil administration on 17 July.

===Jewish community of Kaunas===

Jews began settling in Kaunas in the second half of the 17th century. They were not allowed to live in the city, so most of them stayed in the Vilijampolė settlement on the right bank of the Neris river. Jewish life in Kaunas was first disrupted when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940. The occupation was accompanied by arrests, confiscations, and the elimination of all free institutions. Jewish community organizations disappeared almost overnight. Soviet authorities confiscated the property of many Jews, while hundreds were exiled to Siberia. Meanwhile, the Lithuanian Activist Front, founded by Lithuanian nationalist émigrés in Berlin, disseminated anti-semitic literature in Lithuania.
Following Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Soviet forces fled from Kaunas. Both before and after the German occupation on 25 June, the anti-Communists began to attack Jews, blaming them for the Soviet repressions, especially along Jurbarko and Kriščiukaičio streets. The Lithuanian provisional government established a concentration camp at the Seventh Fortress, one of the city's ten historic forts, and 4,000 Jews were rounded up and murdered there. Prior to the construction of a museum on the site, archaeologists unearthed a mass grave and personal belongings of the Jewish victims.Trove of everyday items reveals Lithuania's dark Holocaust secret, Haaretz

===Soviet re-occupation===

Beginning in 1944, the Red Army began offensives that eventually took back all three of the Baltic states.
Kaunas again became the major centre of resistance against the Soviet regime. From the very start of the Lithuanian partisans war, the most important partisan districts were based around Kaunas. Although guerrilla warfare ended at the time of 1953, Lithuanian opposition to Soviet rule did not. In 1956 people in the Kaunas region supported the uprising in Hungary by rioting.  On All Souls' Day in 1956, the first public anti-Soviet protest rally took place in Kaunas: citizens burned candles in the Kaunas military cemetery and sang national songs, resulting in clashes with the Militsiya.
On 14 May 1972, 19 year old Romas Kalanta, having exclaimed "Freedom for Lithuania!", immolated himself in the garden of the Musical Theatre, after making a speech denouncing the Soviet suppression of national and religious rights. The event broke into a politically charged riot, which was forcibly dispersed by the KGB and Militsiya. It led to new forms of resistance: passive resistance all around Lithuania. The continuous oppression of the Catholic Church and its resistance caused the appearance of The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania. In strict conspiracy catholic priest Sigitas Tamkevičius (now the Archbishop Metropolitan of Kaunas) implemented this idea and its first issue was published in the Alytus district on 19 March 1972. The Kronika started a new phase of resistance in the life of Lithuania's Catholic Church and of all Lithuania fighting against the occupation by making known to the world the violation of the human rights and freedoms in Lithuania for almost two decades. On 1 November 1987, a non-sanctioned rally took place near the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica, where people gathered to mark famous Lithuanian poet Maironis' 125th birthday anniversary. On 10 June 1988, the initiating group of the Kaunas movement of Sąjūdis was formed. On 9 October 1988, the Flag of Lithuania was raised above the tower of the Military Museum. Kaunas, along with Vilnius, became the scene of nearly constant demonstrations as the Lithuanians, embarked on a process of self-discovery. The bodies of Lithuanians who died in Siberian exile were brought back to their homeland for reburial, and the anniversaries of deportations as well as the important dates in Lithuanian history began to be noted with speeches and demonstrations. On 16 February 1989 Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevičius, for the first time, called for the independence of Lithuania in his sermon at the Kaunas Cathedral. After the services, 200,000 persons gathered in the centre of Kaunas to participate in the dedication of a new monument to freedom to replace the monument that had been torn down by the Soviet authorities after World War II.

===Restored independence===

After World War II Kaunas became the main industrial city of Lithuania – it produced about a quarter of Lithuania's industrial output.
After the proclamation of Lithuanian independence in 1990, Soviet attempts to suppress the rebellion focused on the Sitkūnai Radio Station.  They were defended by the citizenry of Kaunas.http://www.toptravel.lt/lithuania/kaunas-facts-history/ Kaunas. Facts&History. Pope John Paul II made the Holy Mass for the faithful of the Archdiocese of Kaunas at the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica and held the meeting with the young people of Lithuania at S. Darius and S. Girėnas Stadium, during his visit to Lithuania in 1993. Kaunas natives Vytautas Landsbergis and Valdas Adamkus became the Head of state in 1990, and, respectively, in 1998 and 2004. Since the restoration of independence, improving substantially air and land transport links with Western Europe have made Kaunas easily accessible to foreign tourists. Kaunas is famous for its legendary basketball club Žalgiris, which was founded in 1944 and was one of the most popular nonviolent resistance ways during its struggle with the CSKA Moscow. In 2011, the largest indoor arena in the Baltic States was built and was named Žalgiris Arena. Kaunas hosted finals of the widely appreciated EuroBasket 2011.
