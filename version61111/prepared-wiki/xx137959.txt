===Football===

In football, the Cloverbelt Conference used to be separated into two divisions, the Large Division, and Small Division until the end of the 2007-08 athletic season when the area underwent major conference realignments. The Cloverbelt was then split into a modified Cloverbelt Conference, the newly formed Cloverwood Conference, and some of the schools moved to The Marawood Conference.  Before this realignment, the Cloverbelt Conference was considered a powerhouse amongst Wisconsin's small school conference for decades, often sending at least one team to the state finals each year.
