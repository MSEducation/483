"Herbie" was an American elm tree located in  Yarmouth, Maine, USA.

At 110 feet in height, it was, between 1997 and the date of its felling,According to the plaque on its trunk. the oldestImages of America: Yarmouth, Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002) and largest"Yarmouth braces for Herbie's demise" - Portland Press Herald, August 10 2009 of its kind in New England.The National Register of Big Trees: 2000-01 The tree, which partially stood in the front yard of a private residence, also had a 20-foot circumference and (until mid-2008) a 93-foot crown spread.

A plaque on its trunk stated:

On May 1 1834, the town gave Herbie some company by planting rows of elm trees along East Elm Street. From 1957 onward, however, most of them succumbed to Dutch elm disease. As of 2003, only twenty of Yarmouth's original 739 elms had survived."Champion of Trees" - American Profile
After battling fifteen bouts of Dutch elm disease, in 2007 stripes appeared under the tree's bark, indicating a worsening condition. In August 2009 it was revealed that Herbie would be cut down on January 18 and 19 2010,"The Herbie Project" - Town of Yarmouth's website at a cost of $20,000."When this tree falls, he will feel it" - Boston.com, December 27 2009 In October 2009, the plaque was removed from its trunk and replaced with a laminated version, and before the end of the year, "The Herbie Project" fund-raising campaign was set up to raise money to care for and plant other trees in the town. After the tree's demise, local woodworkers used its wood to make products which will be auctioned off to raise money for the trust.
A snowstorm during the night of January 17 and 18 2010 postponed the removal. The tree was removed on January 19, just before noon. A preliminary count of the tree's rings, done on site, revealed its age to be at least 212 years."Farewell to Herbie and a 'beautiful relationship'" - Portland Press Herald, January 19 2010 On February 4, however, the official count showed it to be 217. 
The stump itself was removed over the weekend of May 29 and 30. A section of the trunk's base was on show at the 2010 Yarmouth Clam Festival. It is now on permanent display outside Yarmouth's town hall, on Cleaves Street, a project of the local Eagle Scouts.
Frank Knight, the town's former "tree warden", died at the age of 103 on May 14 2012. Knight's casket was made, in secret, out of Herbie's wood.[tpl]cite news|title=Frank Knight Dead: 'Herbie' The Elm Tree Caretaker Dies At 103|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/14/frank-knight-dead-age-103_n_1515496.html?ref=topbar|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=May 14, 2012[/tpl] Succeeded by Deb Hopkins in 2006, Knight cared for the tree for half of his life, having accepted the role in 1956.
