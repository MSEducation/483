The Damon Runyon Stakes is an American Thoroughbred turf race for two-year-old horses run at Aqueduct Race Track in December each year.
In its 36th running in 2014, this race is essentially restricted to New York-breds, and is set at one and one-sixteenth miles and offers a purse of $65,000.  It was run at seven furlongs from 1979 to 1982, and in 1987 and 1988, at one mile from 1983 to 1986, and from 1989 to 1993.  It was run at Belmont Park in 1979, 1983, and 1984.
The race is named for Damon Runyon, a famous sports reporter and short story writer who created a Broadway all his own during the Twenties and Thirties.  From these stories came the musical Guys and Dolls.  Runyon loved horse racing and campaigned a small string of his own horses.
