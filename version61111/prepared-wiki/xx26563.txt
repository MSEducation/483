After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the PCHA in 1914, the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for the best team in the world. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final.[tpl]sfn |Diamond |1992 |p=46[/tpl] In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1916-17 | title=Stanley Cup Winners: Seattle Metropolitans 1916–17 | publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=July 11, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930080630/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&year=1916-17 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.
In 1919, the Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series, marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=51[/tpl] The series was tied at 2–2–1, but the final game was never played because Montreal Manager George Kennedy and players Joe Hall, Billy Coutu, Jack McDonald, and Newsy Lalonde were hospitalized with influenza.

===NHL takes over===

The WHL folded in 1926, leaving the NHL as the only league left competing for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs occasionally issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P.D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the Cup to the NHL, allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup., p. 40[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=153935&hubname= | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071216083200/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=153935&hubname= | archivedate=December 16, 2007 | title=Court:Non-NHL teams could vie for Cup|publisher=TSN | date=February 7, 2006 | accessdate=July 15, 2006[/tpl]
 
 
This agreement was amended on November 22, 1961, substituting the Governors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario with the Committee of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario as the group that would name the two Canadian trustees, if need be. In the 1970s, the World Hockey Association sought to challenge for the Cup - the Trustees denied them the opportunity to do so. However, notwithstanding the aforementioned legal obligation, the NHL quietly discontinued calling its champions the "world champions" during this time, likely in order to avoid incurring at least a moral obligation to play the WHA champion.
The Cup was awarded every year until 2005, when a labour dispute between the NHL's owners and the NHL Players Association (the union that represents the players) led to the cancellation of the 2004–05 season. As a result, no Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in 1919. The lockout was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original Challenge Cup format.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=115156&hubname= | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929162525/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=115156&hubname= | archivedate=September 29, 2007 | title=Lockout Reminds Lowe of Gretzky Deal | publisher=TSN | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=July 15, 2006[/tpl] Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season. This idea was so unpopular that the Clarkson Cup was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the "Wednesday Nighters", filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy regardless of the lockout.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2036537|title=Amateurs taking NHL to court to play for Cup|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 13, 2007|date=April 13, 2005[/tpl]
On February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season. The dispute lasted so long that, by the time it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season. Furthermore, when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the Trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup in the event of a lost season, and that they were likely to reject any non-NHL challenges for the Cup in the event the 2012-13 season were cancelled, which it was not.

===Trustees===

The regulations set down by Lord Stanley call for two Trustees, who had the sole, joint right to govern the Cup and the conditions of its awarding until 1947, when they ceded control to the NHL. While the original regulations allow for a Trustee to resign, to date, all Cup Trustees have served until their deaths. In the event of a vacancy, the remaining trustee names the replacement for the deceased or resigned Trustee.
To date, nine men have served as Trustees of the Stanley Cup:

==Engraving==

Like the Grey Cup, awarded to the winner of the Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is engraved with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=3[/tpl] Initially, there was only one base ring, which was attached to the bottom of the original bowl by the Montreal AAAs. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form "TEAM NAME" "YEAR WON", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no more room to engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=12[/tpl]
In 1908, for reasons unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record their names on the Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators did not put their names on the Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team to engrave players' names, this time inside the bowl along its sides.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=12[/tpl]
The 1918 Millionaires eventually filled the band added by the 1909 Senators.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=12[/tpl] The 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland Rosebuds, and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved their names on the trophy even though they did not officially win it under the new PCHA-NHA system. They had only won the title of the previous champion's league and would have been crowned as Cup champions under the old challenge rules. The winners in 1918, 1920 to 1923 did not put their winning team name on it., p. 8.
No further engraving occurred until 1924, when the Canadiens added a new band to the Cup.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=12[/tpl] Since then, engraving the team and its players has been an unbroken annual tradition. Originally, a new band was added each year, causing the trophy to grow in size. The "Stovepipe Cup", as it was nicknamed because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe of a stove, became unwieldy, so it was redesigned in 1948 as a two-piece cigar-shaped trophy with a removable bowl and collar. This Cup also properly honoured those teams that did not engrave their names on the Cup. Also included was 1918–19 No Decision Montreal Canadiens Seattle Metropolitans.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=13[/tpl]
Since 1958, the Cup has undergone several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design was introduced in 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=9[/tpl] Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, the names of the 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=14[/tpl] When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=14[/tpl]
Another new band was scheduled to be added to the bottom of the cup following the 2004–05 season, but was not added because of the labour dispute. After the 2005–06 champion Carolina Hurricanes were crowned, and the new bottom ring was finally added, the cancelled season was acknowledged with the words "2004–05 Season Not Played".[tpl]cite web |title=Strike Up The Bands: The Stanley Cup is Stripped of a Ring; Cancelled 2004–05 Season Recognized |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/newsSCbands.shtml |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=February 19, 2007[/tpl] Currently, the Cup stands at 89.5 centimeters (35¼ inches) tall and weighs 15½ kilograms (34½ lb).

===Name inscriptions===

Prior to 1977 only players who had completed the Stanley Cup playoffs were eligible to have their name inscribed on the Stanley Cup.What is the criteria for a player to get his name on the Stanley Cup? Currently, a player must have played at least half of the regular season games (usually 41 in current league format) for the championship team (provided the player remains with the team when they win the Cup) or played in at least one game of the Stanley Cup Finals. However, since 1994 teams have been permitted to petition the NHL Commissioner, to be considered on a case-by-case basis, to engrave a player's name on the cup if the player was unavailable to play due to "extenuating circumstances".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/cup/fun_facts.html |title=NHL.com— Stanley Cup Fun Facts |publisher=NHL |accessdate=June 21, 2011[/tpl] For example, the Detroit Red Wings received special permission from the NHL to inscribe the name of Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career ended after a car accident on June 13, 1997, on the Stanley Cup after Detroit defended their title in 1998.
With the Montreal Canadiens having won by far the most Cup championships of any team, the list of the players who have been engraved on the Cup the most often is dominated by Montreal players.  Henri Richard of the Canadiens, with his name engraved eleven times, played on more Stanley Cup champions than any other player.  He is followed by Jean Beliveau and Yvan Cournoyer of the Canadiens with ten championships, Claude Provost of the Canadiens with nine, and three players tied with eight: Red Kelly (four with the Red Wings, four with the Leafs, the most for any player who was not a member of the Canadiens) and Canadiens players Jacques Lemaire, Maurice Richard. Beliveau's name appears on the Cup more than any other individual, ten times as a player and seven times as management for a total of seventeen times.[tpl]sfn|Conner|2002|p=113-114[/tpl]
Twelve women have had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup. The first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup is Marguerite Norris, who won the Cup as the President of the Detroit Red Wings in 1954 and 1955. The only Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup is Sonia Scurfield (born in Hafford, Saskatchewan) who won the Cup as a co-owner of the Calgary Flames in 1989.
The Senior Director of Hockey Administration Charlotte Grahame's name was added in 2001 when the Colorado Avalanche won. Charlotte's son John later had his name engraved as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Engraving errors===

There are several misspellings and illegitimate names on the Cup. Many of them have never been corrected. Examples include:[tpl]cite web | title = Europe no place for a small-town hockey player in 1938 | url=http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1031780&auth=Jonathon+Jackson | accessdate =May 18, 2008 | author=Jonathon Jackson | date = May 16, 2008 | publisher=Owen Sound Sun-Times[/tpl]

==Traditions and anecdotes==

There are many traditions associated with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=8[/tpl] The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to the captain of the winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=8[/tpl] Ted Lindsay of the 1950 Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=8[/tpl]
The tradition of the captain first hoisting the Cup has been "breached" a few times. In 1993 after the Montreal Canadiens defeated Los Angeles Kings, Guy Carbonneau handed the Cup to Denis Savard, as Savard had been the player that many fans had urged the Canadiens to draft back in 1980. Another notable exception was in 1998, after the Detroit Red Wings had defeated the Washington Capitals, when Steve Yzerman immediately passed the Cup to Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career with the Red Wings ended due to serious injuries in a limo accident the previous year and had to be wheeled on the ice. The third was involving Joe Sakic and Ray Bourque when the Colorado Avalanche won the Cup in 2001, as the seventh and deciding game of the Finals would be the last of Bourque's 22-year NHL career, having never been on a Cup-winning team until that time (Bourque had, until being traded to the Avalanche on March 6, 2000, only ever played for the Boston Bruins). When Sakic received the trophy, he did not hoist it, but instead immediately handed it to Bourque; Sakic then became the second player on the team to hoist the trophy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/2001/playoffs/news/2001/06/09/bourque_cup_ap/ | title=Ray, meet Stanley: Finally!

The Stanley Cup championship team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors and a day or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite web|author=Kendra Stanley-Mills |url=http://www.mlive.com/sports/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/08/pritchard_stanley_cup_have_spa.html |title=Pritchard, Stanley Cup have spanned the globe |publisher=MLive.com |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl] Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Two players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies and the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=90991&page=1|title=Strange Misadventures of the Stanley Cup|accessdate=April 16, 2007|publisher=ABC|year=2002|author=Wolf, Buck[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_06.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journal|accessdate=June 23, 2007|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|year=2007|author=Shea, Kevin[/tpl]

===Original, authenticated, and replica versions===

There are technically three versions of the "Stanley Cup": the original 1892 bowl or Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the 1963 authenticated "Presentation Cup", and the 1993 "Replica Cup" at the Hall of Fame. 
The original 1892 Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, purchased and donated by Lord Stanley, was physically awarded to the Champions until 1970,[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2003|p=33[/tpl] and is now displayed in the Vault Room at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2003|p=33[/tpl]
The authenticated version or "Presentation Cup" was created in 1963 by Montreal silversmith Carl Petersen. NHL president Clarence Campbell felt that the original bowl was becoming too thin and fragile, and thus requested a duplicate trophy as a replacement. The Presentation Cup is authenticated by the seal of the Hockey Hall of Fame on the bottom, which can be seen when winning players lift the Cup over their heads, and it is the one currently awarded to the champions of the playoffs and used for promotions.[tpl]sfn|Podnieks|2004|p=9[/tpl] This version was made in secret, and its production was only revealed three years later.
The replica trophy, called the "Replica Cup", was created in 1993 by Montreal silversmith Louise St. Jacques to be used as a stand-in at the Hockey Hall of Fame whenever the Presentation Cup is not available for display.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/sports/story.html?id=34d66bfd-d845-4812-aba5-ce11a26b517a&k=61761&p=1|title=Stanley's secret leaks out 43 years later |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=July 1, 2006 |author=Adami, Hugh|accessdate=November 3, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014224240/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/sports/story.html?id=34d66bfd-d845-4812-aba5-ce11a26b517a&k=61761&p=1| archivedate = October 14, 2007[/tpl] There are very few differences between the authenticated version and the replica version. The surest way to identify one version from the other is to check the engraving for the 1984 Stanley Cup winning Edmonton Oilers. The authenticated version has x's engraved over Basil Pocklington's name whereas his name is completely missing from the replica version.

===As morale booster===

The Stanley Cup has served as a valuable morale booster for Canadian troops and their NATO allies. In 2004, the Cup was displayed at MacDill Air Force Base, located near Tampa, Florida. The visit gave both American troops and a visiting Canadian unit the thrill of seeing the trophy at close hand. The event was later touted by officials at MacDill as "a huge morale booster for our troops".[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_23_228/ai_n6129938/pg_1|title=Seeing is believing |work=The Sporting News |date=June 7, 2004 |author=Yorio, Kara|accessdate=March 19, 2008[/tpl] In 2006, the Cup toured Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where wounded Marines were given the opportunity to view and be photographed with the Cup.
In 2007, the Stanley Cup made its first trip into a combat zone. During the trip to Kandahar, Afghanistan from May 2 to May 6, organized by the NHL, the Hockey Hall of Fame, the NHL Alumni and the Canadian Department of National Defence, the Cup was put on display for Canadian and other NATO troops. It briefly endured a rocket attack on May 3, but emerged unscathed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hhof.com/HTML/exSCJ07_02.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journal, 2007 |publisher=The Hockey Hall of Fame |year=2007 |author=Shea, Kevin |accessdate=March 19, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/05/02/hillier-afghanistan.html |title=Hillier takes Stanley Cup, former NHLers to Afghanistan |publisher=CBC |date=May 2, 2007 |author=CBC News |accessdate=March 19, 2008[/tpl]
