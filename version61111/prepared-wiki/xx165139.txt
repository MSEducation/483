[[Lambert II, Count of Louvain]]

CATEGORIES: House of Reginar, Counts of Louvain, 1054 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Lambert II (died Tournai, June 19, 1054) was count of Louvain between 1033 and 1054. Lambert was the son of Lambert I of Louvain (d. 1015).
According the Vita Gudilae (recorded between 1048â€“1051) he followed his brother Henry I of Louvain. 
Lambert scorned both temporal and spiritual authorities and in 1054 even took up arms against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. He was defeated and lost his life at Tournai. 
During his reign Brussels began its growth. Lambert arranged to transfer the remains of Saint Gudule to the St. Michael church. This church, thereafter known as Saints-Michel-et-Gudule, developed to become St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral. Lambert also constructed a fortress on the Coudenberg hill.
Since Lambert II died in 1054, an imperial charter of September 1062 connecting a certain Lambert to the county Brussels, is probably referring to another person.
