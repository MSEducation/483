[[All Bar One]]

CATEGORIES: Pub chains

All Bar One is a chain of just under 50 bars in the United Kingdom, owned and operated by Mitchells and Butlers plc which was part of the Six Continents group (previously Bass) until 2003.
The concept was designed by Bass as a 'female friendly' bar at a time when most pubs and bars were intimidating places for single women to go and drink or eat, hence the huge glass frontage, the open plan space and the bright airy interiors. The new venue followed the lead of other female friendly concept bars that already existed, such as Pitcher & Piano and Slug and Lettuce.
The first bar was opened in 1994 in Sutton town centre (in the London Borough of Sutton).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mbplc.com/ourbrands/allbarone/ |title=Mitchells & Butlers - Our brands - All Bar One |publisher=Mbplc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23[/tpl] In 2012, there are 47 outlets in the UK, mostly based in Central London with one site in Cologne, Germany.
A recent multi-million pound investment program has updated the bars with a more modern feel but still retaining the characteristic wooden floors, bright open spaces and glass frontage.
All Bar One attracts a mature guest base due to its strict 21+ policy.
