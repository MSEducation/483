[[Allumwandlung]]

CATEGORIES: Chess problems

Allumwandlung (German for "complete promotion", sometimes abbreviated AUW) is a chess problem where, at some stage in the solution, a pawn (or sometimes pawns) is promoted variously to a queen, rook, bishop, and knight. Allumwandlung's main requirement is promotion, either a white pawn or a black pawn. A Babson task may appear if both pawns are spotted in an individual problem, corresponding one another.[tpl]cite web|last=Hornecker|first=Siegfried|title=Allmunwadlung by Siegfried Hornecker|url=http://chessproblem.net/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=228|work=chessproblem.net|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl]

==Example==

The diagram shows a chess problem with Allumwandlung composed by Niels HÃ¸eg and first published in 1905. White to move and mate in three. The key move (White's first move) is 1.f7, and depending on how Black defends, White promotes to either a queen, a rook, a bishop or a knight on move two. The lines are:
The importance of White's underpromotions can be understood by considering what happens if he promotes to a queen no matter what Black plays: after 1...exf4 or 1...exd4 2.f8=Q is stalemate, while following 1...Kf6 2.f8=Q+ Kxg6 there is no mate.
