MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and fourth-generation programming language. Developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, Java, and Fortran.
Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing capabilities. An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain simulation and Model-Based Design for dynamic and embedded systems.
In 2004, MATLAB had around one million users across industry and academia.Richard Goering, "Matlab edges closer to electronic design automation world," EE Times, 10/04/2004 MATLAB users come from various backgrounds of engineering, science, and economics. MATLAB is widely used in academic and research institutions as well as industrial enterprises.

==History==

Cleve Moler, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico, started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html | title = The Origins of MATLAB| author = Cleve Moler | accessdate = April 15, 2007 |date=December 2004 [/tpl] He designed it to give his students access to LINPACK and EISPACK without them having to learn Fortran. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the applied mathematics community. Jack Little, an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to Stanford University in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in C and founded MathWorks in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|title=MATLAB Programming Language|publisher=Altius Directory|accessdate=2010-12-17[/tpl] In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, LAPACK.[tpl]cite web|title=MATLAB Incorporates LAPACK|url=http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=December 20, 2008|author=Cleve Moler|date=January 2000[/tpl]
MATLAB was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in control engineering, Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of linear algebra and numerical analysis, and is popular amongst scientists involved in image processing.

==Syntax==

The MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB language, and most use of MATLAB involves typing MATLAB code into the Command Window (as an interactive mathematical shell), or executing text files containing MATLAB code, including scripts and/or functions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html|title=MATLAB Documentation |publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]

===Variables===

Variables are defined using the assignment operator, =. MATLAB is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted.[tpl]cite web|title=Comparing MATLAB with Other OO Languages|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/matlab-vs-other-oo-languages.html|work=MATLAB|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]  It is a dynamically typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,[tpl]cite web|title=Create Symbolic Variables and Expressions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/creating-symbolic-variables-and-expressions.html|work=Symbolic Math Toolbox|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] and that their type can change. Values can come from constants, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:

===Vectors/matrices===

A simple array is defined using the colon syntax: init:increment:terminator. For instance:
defines a variable named array (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name array) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the init value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the increment value), and stops once it reaches (or to avoid exceeding) 9 (the terminator value).
the increment value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.
assigns to the variable named ari an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the incrementer.
Indexing is one-based,[tpl]cite web|title=Matrix Indexing|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] which is the usual convention for matrices in mathematics, although not for some programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.
Matrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets: . Parentheses: () are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).
Sets of indices can be specified by expressions such as "2:4", which evaluates to 3, 4.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:
A square identity matrix of size n can be generated using the function eye, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions zeros and ones, respectively.
Most MATLAB functions can accept matrices and will apply themselves to each element. For example, mod(2*J,n) will multiply every element in "J" by 2, and then reduce each element modulo "n". MATLAB does include standard "for" and "while" loops, but (as in other similar applications such as R), using the vectorized notation often produces code that is faster to execute. This code, excerpted from the function magic.m, creates a magic square M for odd values of n (MATLAB function meshgrid is used here to generate square matrices I and J containing 1:n).

===Structures===

MATLAB has structure data types.[tpl]cite web|title=Structures|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is "structure array", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names[tpl]cite web|title=Generate Field Names from Variables|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/generate-field-names-from-variables.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.). Unfortunately, MATLAB JIT does not support MATLAB structures, therefore just a simple bundling of various variables into a structure will come at a cost.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Function handles===

MATLAB supports elements of lambda calculus by introducing function handles,[tpl]cite web|title=Function Handles|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/function-handles.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] or function references, which are implemented either in .m files or anonymous[tpl]cite web|title=Anonymous Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]/nested functions.[tpl]cite web|title=Nested Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks[/tpl]

===Classes===

Although MATLAB has classes, the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages.
MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has handle as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).[tpl]cite web|title=Comparing Handle and Value Classes|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html|publisher=MathWorks[/tpl]
Method call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method
can alter any member of object only if object is an instance of a reference class.

==Graphics and graphical user interface programming==

MATLAB supports developing applications with graphical user interface features. MATLAB includes GUIDE[tpl]cite web|title=Introduction to GUIDE|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/introduction-to-guide.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] (GUI development environment) for graphically designing GUIs.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/matlab-gui.html | title=MATLAB GUI | publisher=MathWorks | date=2011-04-30 | accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]
It also has tightly integrated graph-plotting features. For example the function plot can be used to produce a graph from two vectors x and y. The code:
produces the following figure of the sine function:
A MATLAB program can produce three-dimensional graphics using the functions surf, plot3 or mesh.
In MATLAB, graphical user interfaces can be programmed with the GUI design environment (GUIDE) tool.[tpl]cite book | title=Matlab: Advanced GUI Development | publisher=Dog Ear Publishing | author=Smith, S. T. | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-59858-181-2[/tpl]

==Object-oriented programming==

MATLAB's support for object-oriented programming includes classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, packages, pass-by-value semantics, and pass-by-reference semantics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/object-oriented-programming.html |title=Object-Oriented Programming|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]
When put into a file named hello.m, this can be executed with the following commands:

==Interfacing with other languages==

MATLAB can call functions and subroutines written in the C programming language or Fortran.[tpl]cite web|title=Application Programming Interfaces to MATLAB|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/programming-interfaces-for-c-c-fortran-com.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] A wrapper function is created allowing MATLAB data types to be passed and returned. The dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions are termed "MEX-files" (for MATLAB executable).[tpl]cite web|title=Create MEX-Files|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/create-mex-files.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Connecting C and Matlab | last=Spielman | first=Dan | publisher=Yale University, Computer Science Department | date=2004-02-10 | url=http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/ECC/cMatlab.html | accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]
Libraries written in Perl, Java, ActiveX or .NET can be directly called from MATLAB,[tpl]cite web|title=External Programming Language Interfaces|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/external-interfaces.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Call Perl script using appropriate operating system executable|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/perl.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl] and many MATLAB libraries (for example XML or SQL support) are implemented as wrappers around Java or ActiveX libraries. Calling MATLAB from Java is more complicated, but can be done with a MATLAB toolbox[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/javabuilder/ |title=MATLAB Builder JA |publisher=MathWorks |accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl] which is sold separately by MathWorks, or using an undocumented mechanism called JMI (Java-to-MATLAB  Interface),[tpl]cite web|url=http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/jmi-java-to-matlab-interface/|author=Yair Altman |title=Java-to-Matlab Interface |publisher=Undocumented Matlab |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=matlabcontrol JMI|url=https://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/wiki/JMI|author=Joshua Kaplan[/tpl] (which should not be confused with the unrelated Java Metadata Interface that is also called JMI).
As alternatives to the MuPAD based Symbolic Math Toolbox available from MathWorks, MATLAB can be connected to Maple or Mathematica.[tpl]cite web|title=MaMa: Calling MATLAB from Mathematica with MathLink|url=http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/618/|publisher=Wolfram Library Archive|author=Roger Germundsson from Wolfram Research |date=1998-09-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=MATLink:   Communicate with MATLAB from Mathematica|url=http://matlink.org/|accessdate=14 August 2013|author=rsmenon, szhorvat|year=2013[/tpl]
Libraries also exist to import and export MathML.[tpl]cite web|author=Michael Weitzel |url=http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7709-mathml-importexport |title=MathML import/export |publisher=MathWorks - File Exchange |date=2006-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]

==License==

MATLAB is a proprietary product of MathWorks, so users are subject to vendor lock-in.[tpl]cite web|title=The Wrong Choice: Locked in by license restrictions|url=http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/news/902076/The-Wrong-Choice-Locked-in-by-license-restrictions|publisher=SearchOpenSource.com|accessdate=14 August 2013|author=Jan Stafford|date=21 May 2003[/tpl]  Although MATLAB Builder product can deploy MATLAB functions as library files which can be used with .NET[tpl]cite web|title=MATLAB Builder NE|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/netbuilder/|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] or Java[tpl]cite web|title=MATLAB Builder JA|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/javabuilder/|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] application building environment, future development will still be tied to the MATLAB language.
Each toolbox is purchased separately. If an evaluation license is requested, the MathWorks sales department requires detailed information about the project for which MATLAB is to be evaluated. Overall the process of acquiring a license is expensive in terms of money and time.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] If granted (which it often is), the evaluation license is valid for two to four weeks. A student version of MATLAB is also available.
It has been reported that EU competition regulators are investigating whether MathWorks refused to sell licenses to a competitor.[tpl]cite web|title=MathWorks Software Licenses Probed by EU Antitrust Regulators|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-01/mathworks-software-licenses-probed-by-eu-antitrust-regulators.html|publisher=Bloomberg news|date=2012-03-01[/tpl]

==Alternatives==

MATLAB has a number of competitors.[tpl]cite web|title=Comparison of mathematical programs for data analysis|url=http://www.scientificweb.de/ncrunch/|author=Stefan Steinhaus|date=February 24, 2008[/tpl] Commercial competitors include Mathematica, Maple, and IDL. There are also free open source alternatives to MATLAB, in particular GNU Octave, Scilab, FreeMat, Julia, and Sage which are intended to be mostly compatible with the MATLAB language. Among other languages that treat arrays as basic entities (array programming languages) are APL, Fortran 90 and higher, S-Lang, as well as the statistical languages R and S. There are also libraries to add similar functionality to existing languages, such as IT++ for C++, Perl Data Language for Perl, ILNumerics for .NET, NumPy/SciPy for Python, and Numeric.js for JavaScript.
GNU Octave stands out as it treats incompatibility with MATLAB as a bug (see GNU Octave#Matlab), therefore it aims to provide a software clone.

==Release history==

The number (or Release number) is the version reported by Concurrent License Manager program FLEXlm.

==Easter eggs==

Several easter eggs exist in MATLAB.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/2001-what-matlab-easter-eggs-do-you-know |title=What MATLAB Easter eggs do you know? |publisher=MathWorks - MATLAB Answers |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] These include hidden pictures,[tpl]cite web|title=The Story Behind the MATLAB Default Image|url=http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2006/10/17/the-story-behind-the-matlab-default-image/|accessdate=14 August 2013|author=Steve Eddins|date=2006-10-17[/tpl] and random inside jokes. For example, typing in "spy" will generate a picture of the spies from Spy vs Spy.  "Spy" was changed to an image of a dog in recent releases (R2011B). Typing in "why" randomly outputs a philosophical answer. Other commands include "penny", "toilet", "image", and "life".  Not every Easter egg appears in every version of MATLAB – some appear and some disappear.
