==Plot==

Set in a near-future earth, the West and the East have been at war for more than a decade, and resources are running thin.  The West is stealing oil from the East with specialized nuclear submarines ("subtugs") that sneak into the underwater oil fields of the East to secretly pump out the oil and bring it back.  Each manned by a crew of four, these submarines undertake the most hazardous, stressful mission conceivable, and of late, the missions have been failing, with the last twenty submarines simply disappearing.
The East has been very successful in planting sleepers in the West's military and command structures, and the suspicion is that sleepers are sabotaging the subs or revealing their positions once at sea.  John Ramsey, a young psychologist from the Bureau of Psychology (BuPsych), is trained as an electronics operator and sent on the next mission, replacing the previous officer who went insane.  His secret mission is to find the sleeper, or figure out why the crews are going insane.

==Major themes==

Typically for Herbert, psychology and religion (the title comes from  a quote from the Book of Revelation) play a large role in the narrative, as John Ramsey comes to understand the nature of the subtug crews and how they carry out their missions.
The technology of the submarines towing large bags filled with the surreptitiously pumped oil described in the books may have been an inspiration for the invention called the Dracone[tpl]cite book |title=Frank Herbert |last=O'Reilly |first=Timothy |authorlink=Tim O'Reilly |year=1981 |publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., Inc |chapter=Chapter 2: Under Pressure|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch02.html |accessdate=2009-05-09 |quote=name was an overt acknowledgment of the source of the idea[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=The Papers of Sir William Hawthorne | url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FHATN%204 | work=Janus | accessdate=2009-05-09 |quote=christined Dracone it was the nearest word in Greek for a mythical monster such as a sea serpent[/tpl] for which development started in the year following Herbert's serial.
