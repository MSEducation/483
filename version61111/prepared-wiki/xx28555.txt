[[Windham]]

CATEGORIES: Place name disambiguation pages

Windham is an English surname, derived from the name of Wymondham, Norfolk.
The pronunciation of that toponym had become indistinguishable from Windham in Late Middle English, and the ruling family of Wymondham began to write its name in this way from the time of Edward IV.
