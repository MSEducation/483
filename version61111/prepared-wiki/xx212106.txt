Southroads Mall is an enclosed shopping mall at 1001 Fort Crook Road in Bellevue, Nebraska.  Fort Crook Road was U.S. Route 75 until the early 1990s, replaced by the Kennedy Freeway.

==History==

Developed by the Brandeis Investment Corp., Southroads opened in 1966 with an Omaha based department store, Brandeis, and J.C. Penney as anchors. The mall has [tpl]convert|500000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of retail space, which was modeled after the success of Omaha's Crossroads Mall, which was also developed by Brandeis. Southroads was developed within the Southroads Complex near a Sears, which had been open since 1964.http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2226341/ "Shoppers will miss Sears in Belleview".

Originally, Southroads Mall was only a one level mall in the beginning but later on, the bottom level of the mall came to be. The remodel would also include a food court, a movie theater, an expansion of both anchors, an elevator, 2 escalators and stairs built on both ends in the mall. It also received a heavy makeover on the inside and outside with a new mall area being built connected outwards. This lead us out of the 60's look of Southroads into a newer 80's look for the mall.
Brandeis was purchased by Younkers in 1987, and converted to the Younkers name, but the store was closed in 1996. It remained a popular mall into the early 1990s; on most Saturdays, the food court would be packed. After the painful economic loss of Younkers, the J.C. Penney anchor was converted to a clearance center in 1999 "Malls at a crossroads J.C. Penney's impending exit from Southroads is seen as part of a national shift in consumers' preferences toward easier-access strip mall," Omaha World-Herald, August 9, 2003. and was closed in 2003.

==Conversion to Office Complex==

As retail outlets closed, retail space was converted to office space. TD Ameritrade, headquartered out of Omaha, began leasing space at the mall in 1998, eventually taking over the former Brandeis/Younkers space. PayPal leased space in the former JCPenney, along with CoSentry. TD Ameritrade began shifting employee from Southroads in 2011 and consolidate their offices in West Omaha.

==Reverting to Mall Format==

Southroads is in the process of reverting and returning to its original Mall format. Within Southroads is a board open to the people confirming a renovation project titled Southroads "Mall" Renovation. The project is currently being done by Julie Hockney. No one has heard when this will be completed. New storefronts have been being fixed up as well as a new store coming to Southroads also.
