The Guiana Space Centre or, more commonly, Centre spatial guyanais (CSG) is a French and European spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport as it fulfills the two major geographical requirements of such a site: 
The European Space Agency, the French space agency CNES (National Centre for Space Studies), and the commercial Arianespace company conduct launches from Kourou.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/CNES_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=CNES at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/ESA_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=ESA at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/Arianespace_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=Arianespace at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA[/tpl] This is the spaceport used by the ESA to send supplies to the International Space Station using the Automated Transfer Vehicle.
The location was selected in 1964 to become the spaceport of France.
When the European Space Agency (ESA) was founded in 1975, France offered to share Kourou with ESA."Installation of the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana". Guiana Space Centre official website"Europe's Spaceport". European Space Agency official website Commercial launches are bought also by non-European companies. ESA pays two thirds of the spaceport's annual budget and has also financed the upgrades made during the development of the Ariane launchers.

==Facilities==

Kourou is located approximately [tpl]convert|500|km[/tpl] north of the equator, at a latitude of 5°10'. At this latitude, the Earth's rotation gives a velocity of approximately [tpl]convert|460|m/s|mph km/h[/tpl] when the launch trajectory heads eastward.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/SatelliteProgrammesOverview/SP_20100427133512861?l=en|title=Satellite Programmes Overview - Launching Satellites|publisher=EUMETSAT|accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl] The proximity to the equator also makes maneuvering satellites for geosynchronous orbits simpler and less costly.
The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude.  For example, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about [tpl]convert|1035|mph|m/s||abbr=in|disp=flip[/tpl] at the Guiana Space Centre versus about [tpl]convert|908|mph|m/s||abbr=in|disp=flip[/tpl] at the United States east coast Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center spaceports which are at 28°27′N latitude in Florida.[ref]

===ELV (CECLES/ELA-1)===

Originally built in the 1960s under the name of CECLES ([tpl]lang-fr|Conférence Européenne de Construction de Lanceurs et d'Engins Spatiaux[/tpl], [tpl]lang-en|European conference on construction of launchers and spacecraft[/tpl]), the ELV pad ([tpl]lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Vega[/tpl]) located at [tpl]coord|5.236|N|52.775|W[/tpl] was designed for the Europa-II rocket. One Europa-II was launched from the site, before the programme was cancelled.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The pad was demolished, and subsequently rebuilt as the first launch complex for Ariane rockets. Renamed ELA (later redesignated ELA 1), it was used for Ariane 1 and Ariane 2 and 3 launches until being retired in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/launchreport/padsites.html|title=Pad List - World Launch Sites|publisher=Space Launch Report|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/launchreport/padsites.html&date=2009-10-26+01:41:21|archivedate=2009-10-26[/tpl]
It was then again refurbished for the Vega (rocket) with the first launch performed on 13 February 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Vega3/Vega_liftoff |title=Vega liftoff / Vega / Launch vehicles / Launchers / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl]

===ELA 2===

The ELA 2 pad ([tpl]lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 2[/tpl]), located at [tpl]coord|5.232|N|52.776|W[/tpl] had been used for Ariane 4 launches until 2003.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===ELA 3===

As of 2008, ELA 3 ([tpl]lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3[/tpl]), located at [tpl]coord|5.239|N|52.768|W[/tpl], is currently active for Ariane 5 launches. These facilities cover an area of [tpl]convert|21|km2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Europe's spaceport|url= http://www.esa.int/esaCP/GGGMGNF3KCC_Expanding_0.html|publisher=ESA[/tpl]

===ELS / Soyuz at CSG===

ESA has built ELS ([tpl]lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz[/tpl]) at [tpl]coord |5.305|N|52.834|W| [/tpl] for launching Russian-built Soyuz-2 rockets. The first Soyuz launch from ELS was postponed several times, but launched on October 21, 2011.SpaceflightNow's VS01 flight status page
ELS is located on the territory of Sinnamary commune, [tpl]convert|27|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Kourou harbor.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1UKE2fVQV4EC&lpg=PA138&ots=luqCQaf6u9&dq=Sinamary%20spaceport&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q=Sinamary%20spaceport&f=false |title=Space Exploration 2007 |page=138 |publisher=Springer |author=Harvey, Brian[/tpl] It is [tpl]convert|10|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the site used for the Ariane 5 launches. Under the terms of the Russo-European joint venture, ESA will augment its own launch vehicle fleet with Soyuz rockets—using them to launch ESA or commercial payloads—and the Russians will get access to the Kourou spaceport for launching their own payloads with Soyuz rockets. Russia will use the Guiana Space Centre in addition to Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Guiana location has the significant benefit of greatly increased payload capability, owing to the near equatorial position. A Soyuz rocket with a 1.7 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) performance from Baikonur, will increase its payload potential to 2.8 tonnes from the Guiana launch site.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Le Port Spatial de l'Europe (CNES)
The rocket assembly procedures will differ from ones used at Baikonur. Traditionally, the Soyuz gets fully assembled in horizontal position, then transported to a launch pad and erected for launch. In ELS the rocket solely is assembled in horizontal position, then transported and erected. A spacecraft is then transported to the pad separately and attached to the rocket. To protect from dust and wind, the launch pad will have a closed gantry. The gantry will be able to move away from the pad for launch.Soyuz User's Manual
The ELS project is being co-funded by Arianespace, ESA, and the European Union, with CNES being the prime contractor. The project has a projected cost of approximately €320 million, where €120 million are allocated for modernizing the Soyuz vehicle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Europe_To_Pay_Russia_To_Build_Soyuz_Pad_At_Kourou_Russia.html|title=Europe To Pay Russia To Build Soyuz Pad At Kourou: Russia|publisher=SpaceDaily[/tpl] The official opening of the launch site construction occurred on 27 February 2007. Excavation work however, had previously begun several months beforehand. As of May 2008, groundworks were still continuing but the flame pit was substantially complete, along with the shell of the Soyuz assembly building. Equipment manufactured in Russia had arrived in French Guiana by July 2008, with Russian technicians performing the equipment installation at ELS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega-2008/2008_07_28_Soyuz-launch-site-hardware-arrives-French-Guiana.asp|title=Soyuz launch site hardware arrives in French Guiana |date=28 July 2008|publisher=Arianespace[/tpl]

===Final assembly building===

Astrium assembles each Ariane 5 launcher in the Launcher Integration Building. The vehicle is then delivered to the Final Assembly Building for payload integration by Arianespace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/mission-up-524.html|title= Arianespace receives its fifth Ariane 5 of 2008|date=28 July 2008|publisher=Arianespace[/tpl] The Final Assembly Building is located [tpl]convert|2.8|km[/tpl] from the ELA-3 launch zone. The mobile launch table completes the trip with an Ariane 5 in about one hour. It is then secured in place over the launch pad's flame ducts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/mission_up_438.html |title=Ariane 5 rolls out for Arianespace's fifth launch of 2007 |publisher=Arianespace |date=8 November 2007[/tpl]

==Launch safety==

Fire safety is ensured by a detachment of the Paris Fire Brigade. Security around the base is ensured by French Gendarmerie forces, assisted by the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Before and during launch windows, CSG facility security is significantly enhanced by anti-personnel and anti-aircraft measures, the exact configurations of which are classified by the French military. All entrants to the launch complex are also subject to checks for proof of permission to enter the facility.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The Guiana Space Centre (as per CNES) also holds the Îles du Salut, a former penal colony including the infamous Devil's Island. Now a tourist site, the islands are under the launching trajectory for geosynchronous orbit and have to be evacuated during launches.
