CATEGORIES: Hamlets in Kent

Frogholt is a hamlet near Folkestone in Kent, England, on the banks of the Seabrook stream. There are eight houses in Frogholt. The hamlet is part of a conservation area and lies very close to the larger villages of Newington and Peene.
One of the houses, now called Old Kent Cottage, was probably built in the 15th century.[tpl]cite web | url=http://oldkentcottage.com/2011112_4927%20Old%20Kent%20Cottage%20REPORT.pdf | title=An Archaeological Interpretative Survey of Old Kent Cottage, Frogholt, Kent | publisher=Centre for Applied Archaeology, University College London | date=1 June 2011[/tpl] Claims have been made that it is as much as one thousand years old,[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4806072.stm | title=Cottage inhabited for 1,000 years | publisher=BBC News  | date= 14 March 2006 | accessdate=25 March 2011[/tpl] but since it is constructed as a medieval hall house with Parlour and solar, this is unlikely to be the case. It is reputed to be the oldest thatched cottage in Kent and is said to have been a safe haven for Archbishop Thomas Becket during his feud with King Henry II, although that claim is impossible to verify.
