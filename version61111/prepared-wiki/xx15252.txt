[[Intranet]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networks, Internet privacy

An intranet is a  computer network that uses Internet Protocol technology to share information, operational systems, or computing services within an organization. This term is used in contrast to extranet, a network between organizations, and instead refers to a network within an organization.  Sometimes, the term refers only to the organization's internal website, but may be a more extensive part of the organization's information technology infrastructure, and may be composed of multiple local area networks. The objective is to organize each individual's desktop with minimal cost, time and effort to be more productive, cost efficient, timely, and competitive.
An intranet may host multiple private websites and constitute an important component and focal point of internal communication and collaboration. Any of the well known Internet protocols may be found in an intranet, such as HTTP (web services), SMTP (e-mail), and FTP (file transfer protocol). Internet technologies are often deployed to provide modern interfaces to legacy information systems hosting corporate data.
An intranet can be understood as a private analog of the Internet, or as a private extension of the Internet confined to an organization. The first intranet websites and home pages were published in 1991,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=160857|journal=IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, 1991|title=Fujikama goes Unix|last=Luk|first=A.|volume=2|pages=783–786|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|date=9 May 1991|isbn=0879426381|doi=10.1109/PACRIM.1991.160857|accessdate=2013-03-04|quote=The internet and intranet Unix network provide a functioning email facility around the world.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=177138|journal=Digital Avionics Systems Conference, 1991.

Intranets are sometimes contrasted to extranets. While intranets are generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties.[tpl]cite book|last=Callaghan, J|title=Inside Intranets & Extranets: Knowledge Management AND the Struggle for Power|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=0-333-98743-8[/tpl] Extranets extend a private network onto the Internet with special provisions for authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA protocol).
In many organizations, intranets are protected from unauthorized external access by means of a network gateway and firewall. For smaller companies, intranets may be created simply by using private IP address ranges. In these cases, the intranet can only be directly accessed from a computer in the local network; however, companies may provide access to off-site employees by using a virtual private network, or by other access methods, requiring user authentication and encryption.

==Uses==

Increasingly, intranets are being used to deliver tools, e.g. collaboration (to facilitate working in groups and teleconferencing) or sophisticated corporate directories, sales and customer relationship management tools, project management etc., to advance productivity.
Intranets are also being used as corporate culture-change platforms. For example, large numbers of employees discussing key issues in an intranet forum application could lead to new ideas in management, productivity, quality, and other corporate issues.
In large intranets, website traffic is often similar to public website traffic and can be better understood by using web metrics software to track overall activity. User surveys also improve intranet website effectiveness. Larger businesses allow users within their intranet to access public internet through firewall servers. They have the ability to screen messages coming and going keeping security intact.
When part of an intranet is made accessible to customers and others outside the business, that part becomes part of an extranet. Businesses can send private messages through the public network, using special encryption/decryption and other security safeguards to connect one part of their intranet to another.
Intranet user-experience, editorial, and technology teams work together to produce in-house sites. Most commonly, intranets are managed by the communications, HR or CIO departments of large organizations, or some combination of these.
Because of the scope and variety of content and the number of system interfaces, intranets of many organizations are much more complex than their respective public websites. Intranets and their use are growing rapidly. According to the Intranet design annual 2007 from Nielsen Norman Group, the number of pages on participants' intranets averaged 200,000 over the years 2001 to 2003 and has grown to an average of 6 million pages over 2005–2007.Pernice Coyne, Kara; Schwartz, Mathew; Nielsen, Jakob (2007), "Intranet Design Annual 2007", Nielsen Norman Group

==Planning and creation==

Most organizations devote considerable resources into the planning and implementation of their intranet as it is of strategic importance to the organization's success. Some of the planning would include topics such as:
These are in addition to the hardware and software decisions (like content management systems), participation issues (like good taste, harassment, confidentiality), and features to be supported.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libsci.sc.edu/bob/class/clis724/SpecialLibrariesHandbook/Int&SpecLib.html |title=Intranets and Special Libraries: Making the most of inhouse communications|last=LaMee|first=James A.|date=2002-04-30|publisher=University of South Carolina|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]
Intranets are often static sites. Essentially they are a shared drive, serving up centrally stored documents alongside internal articles or communications (often one-way communication). However organisations are now starting to think of how their intranets can become a 'communication hub' for their team by using companies specialising in 'socialising' intranets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contentformula.com/articles/2010/bringing-the-internet-indoors-socialising-your-intranet/|title=Bringing the internet indoors - socialising your intranet|last=Scaplehorn|first=geoff|date=2010-03-01|publisher=IntranetBlog|accessdate=2010-03-03[/tpl]
The actual implementation would include steps such as:
Another useful component in an intranet structure might be key personnel committed to maintaining the Intranet and keeping content current. For feedback on the intranet, social networking can be done through a forum for users to indicate what they want and what they do not like.

==Intranet software==

Microsoft SharePoint is the dominant software used for creating intranets. Estimates indicate that around 50% of all intranets are developed using SharePoint,[tpl]cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=On what technologies do companies use to develop their intranets|url=http://cibasolutions.typepad.com/wic/2012/07/poll-results-what-technologies-do-companies-use-to-develop-their-intranets.html|accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] however there are many alternatives.[tpl]cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=What alternatives are there to SharePoint for an intranet?|url=http://www.worldwideintranetchallenge.com/2011/06/what-alternatives-are-there-to-sharepoint-for-an-intranet.html|accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl] Other intranet software includes:
