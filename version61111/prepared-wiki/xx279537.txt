==History==

The Round Mott community was significant enough for a post office to be opened there in 1888, but it closed two years later. By 1905, the settlement had its own school with one teacher and 13 students. Enrollment rose to 50 white and seven black pupils with two instructors in 1926. A map from 1936 showed a school, a church, several homes and two other structures in Round Mott. The school remained open until 1951 when it was absorbed by the El Campo Independent School District.[tpl]cite web|last=Kleiner |first=Diana J. |title=Handbook of Texas Online: ROUND MOTT, TX |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrrgt  |accessdate=August 8, 2013 [/tpl] A 1965 map showed only the church and a few structures. Round Mott was still marked on 1989 state highway maps, but the church and a few homes were all that were left.
