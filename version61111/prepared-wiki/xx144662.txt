Hans Christian is a brand of heavily built cruising sailboats.

==History==

Most designs are credited to Robert H. Perry, Harwood Ives, Scott Sprague and Tommy Chen. Boat production began in the early 1970s.
In the mid 1980s Hans Christian Yachts commissioned the designing of a new series of boats based on a more modern hull design with the goal of the "ultimate cruising sailboat."  The end result was the Christina series with the 52 and 48 models designed by Doug Peterson[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent-sailing.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=80 |title=Doug Peterson 52 Feet |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 January 2013[/tpl] and Scott Sprague designing 40 and 43[tpl]cite web |url=http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=5044 |publisher=Sailboat Data |title=HANS CHRISTIAN CHRISTINA 43 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 January 2013[/tpl] versions.
