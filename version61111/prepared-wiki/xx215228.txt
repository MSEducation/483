Concierge Medicine is the first book written about concierge medicine (or direct care), a system that emphasizes the relationship between a patient and a primary care physician in which the patient pays an annual fee or retainer. Knope is a pioneer and an outspoken proponent of concierge medicine, having opened one of the first concierge practices in the United States in 2000. He received national media attention for his work as a patient advocate and opponent of the HMO industry, having been quoted regarding such topics by the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Arizona Daily Star, and Money magazine.
His first book, The Body/Mind Connection, examines the power of physical strength and the positive impact a strong body can have on our overall health and psychological well being.
Knope completed his premedical studies at Columbia University and graduated with honors in internal medicine from Cornell University Medical College in 1988. He completed his residency training at UCLA, where he was awarded the first Sherman Melinkoff Teacher of the Year Award. He has served as Chief of Medicine, Chairman of the Department of Medicine, and Director of the ICU in the Carondelet system in Tucson, Arizona. 
Knope has served as the official internist for the Colorado Rockies baseball team during their spring training in Tucson and has been a member of the editorial board of The American College of Sports Medicineâ€™s Health & Fitness Journal. He is a national speaker on the subjects of obesity, fitness and exercise.
