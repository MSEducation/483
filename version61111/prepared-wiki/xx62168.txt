==History==

Keijō Imperial University was founded in 1924 as the sixth Imperial University of Japan during the period of Japanese rule, followed by Nagoya University and Osaka University in 1931 and 1939 respectively.  While the other Imperial Universities located in Japan were run by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Keijō Imperial University was run by the Governor-General of Korea.
After the end of World War II Keijō Imperial University was renamed to "Kyŏngsŏng University" ([tpl]Ko-hhrm|hangul=경성대학|hanja=京城大學||mr=Kyŏngsŏng Taehak|rr=Gyeongseong Daehak[/tpl]).
USAMGIK closed Kyŏngsŏng University on August 22, 1946 with US Military Ordinance No. 102. It was later merged with 9 other colleges into Seoul National University.
