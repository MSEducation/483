==Analysis==

The mood of the piece is unclear, showing great sadness at times but also hinting at happiness and hope. The first theme of the piece uses a simple but effective melody, conveying a sad portrait, with decorative ornaments used throughout. The second theme is more interesting and lively, although it still has a certain sadness. About halfway through the piece, there is a modulation into A major, featuring a happy and joyful melody. The piece concludes with the main theme, followed by a short coda.Chopin's Waltzes – A historical research, Piano Society
With a tempo marking of Allegretto, the piece is set out in an A–B–A–C–A form, with a short coda. The A-section is the main melancholic A minor theme, which is based around a simple waltz accompaniment in the left hand, with a solemn quaver melody played in the right. The B-section is based around E major, which is highly decorated with mordents, and large sweeping arpeggio's. There is then a brief return to the A-theme, which unexpectedly modulates to B major. The C-theme abruptly modulates to A major (the parallel major of A minor). This theme is very similar to the B-section, the left hand continues with the waltz accompaniment whilst the right hand plays a highly decorated melody. There is another brief return to the A-theme, before a short coda which concludes the piece with an authentic cadence in A minor. The waltz is 58 bars long and a performance takes about two minutes.
