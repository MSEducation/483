The Ambassador of the Kingdom of England to Denmark was the foremost diplomatic representative of the historic Kingdom of England in Denmark, also referred to as the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, before the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.
The position was not always a continuous or permanent one, and there was sometimes no diplomatic representation between the two countries.
