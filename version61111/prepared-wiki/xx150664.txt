===Singer===

Edelmann shot to fame as a singer in 1991 with his song "Pienestä kii". The same year, his song, "Peggy", was a candidate for the Eurovision Song Contest; the song, however, did not become the Finnish entry that year. He sang a duet with Sani from Aikakone in 1995 called "Tuhat yötä", which was one of the most successful songs that year. Edelmann has also sung duets with Mikko Kuustonen, Laura Närhi, Cata Mansikka-aho, Mari Rantasila and Irina Björklund. Some of Edelmann's other songs include "(Sinä olet) Aurinko", which is commonly known as Ihana valo, "Kaikki tahtoo" and "Karavaanari".
Edelmann has also published an album by the name of Vaiheet, which has songs that his father, Toni Edelmann, has composed for texts by Hesse, Goethe, Shakespeare and Denisov.
Edelmann has been awarded three Emma awards: New Male Artist of the Year and two Artist of the Year awards. His three platinum and three gold albums make him one of Finland's best-selling male artists.
