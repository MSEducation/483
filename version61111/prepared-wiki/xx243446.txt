CATEGORIES: Dominican Republic cuisine, Stews, Legume dishes

Chapea is a bean stew: a very popular dish from the countryside of the Dominican Republic. Cooked red beans or white beans with longaniza (Dominican sausage), rice, and green plantain are the basic ingredients, with cooked and mashed squash used as a thickener. The flavor is distinguished by the herb, cilantro, and a dash of sour orange juice (naranja agria). Variations include different kinds of meat and vegetables with cooked beans served in a thick broth made from auyama, a Dominican squash.
