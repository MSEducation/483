The EMD GP15-1 is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between June 1976 and March 1982. Intended to provide an alternative to the rebuilding programs that many railroads were applying to their early road switchers, it is generally employed as a yard switcher or light road switcher. This locomotive is powered by a 12-cylinder  EMD 645E engine, which generates [tpl]convert|1,500|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The GP15-1 uses a [tpl]convert|50|ft|9|in|m|adj=on[/tpl] frame, has a wheelbase of [tpl]convert|29|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and has a length over couplers of [tpl]convert|54|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. A total of 310 units were built for American railroads. A number of GP15-1s remain in service today for yard work and light road duty.  The radiator section is similar to those found on the EMD SD40T-2 and EMD SD45T-2 "tunnel motors," leading some observers to incorrectly identify the units as such or as GP15Ts, and giving them the nickname "baby tunnel motors".

The Missouri Pacific Railroad purchased more units than the other three buyers combined. For spotting purposes, the MP models have a number of visually distinguishing features, though not all were applied consistently to the MP units:
