==Function==

The protein encoded by this gene is a Kruppel-like transcription factor which functions depending on the gene and promoter context as an activator or repressor of gene transcription. GLIS2 plays a role in kidney development and neurogenesis.
Glis2 knockout mice display decreased size and weight.  The kidneys in these mice show progressive kidney atrophy and display symptoms similar to human nephronophthisis. Glis2 plays an essential role in the maintenance of renal tissue through prevention of apoptosis and fibrosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = AAttanasio M, Uhlenhaut NH, Sousa VH, O'Toole JF, Otto E, Anlag K, Klugmann C, Treier AC, Helou J, Sayer JA, Seelow D, Nürnberg G, Becker C, Chudley AE, Nürnberg P, Hildebrandt F, Treier M | title = Loss of GLIS2 causes nephronophthisis in humans and mice by increased apoptosis and fibrosis | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 39 | issue = 8 | pages = 1018–24 |date=August 2007 | pmid = 17618285 | doi = 10.1038/ng2072 | url = | issn = [/tpl]

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in the GLIS2 gene are associated with nephronophthisis.
