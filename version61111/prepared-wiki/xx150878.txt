CATEGORIES: Gordon Gano albums, 2002 debut albums

Hitting the Ground is Violent Femmes member Gordon Gano's first solo album. It was produced by Warren Bruleigh and released in 2002. Gano wrote the songs for a film of the same name.
Each song was performed by a different artist. Gano says that the songs were written with no particular performer in mind, but he is very happy that each performer made his or her song his or her own. Lou Reed rewrote some of the lyrics, and was given partial writing credit for "Catch 'Em In the Act." Gordon's sister Cynthia Gayneau sang "Merry Christmas Brother" after Joan Baez turned it down. They Might Be Giants performed and produced their song, "Darlin' Allison," by themselves. John Cale recorded "Don't Pretend," solo on piano and vocals.
