[[Diethyl sulfide]]

CATEGORIES: Thioethers

Diethyl sulfide is a clear flammable chemical compound with a pungent garlic-like odor. It has the chemical formula [tpl]chem|C|4|H|10|S[/tpl], though it can also be written [tpl]chem|([tpl]chem|C|2|H|5[/tpl])|2|S[/tpl] or [tpl]chem|Et|2|S[/tpl] to make its chemical structure more clear. It is prepared by treating ethanol with concentrated sulfuric acid, partially neutralizing the new solution with sodium carbonate, then distilling the resulting sodium ethyl sulfate in a solution containing potassium sulfide.Merck index of Chemicals and Drugs, 9th ed., monograph 3801 
Diethyl sulfide is a by-product of the commercial production of ethanethiol, which is prepared by the reaction of ethylene with hydrogen sulfide over an alumina-based catalyst.  The amount of diethyl sulfide produced can be controlled by varying the ratio of hydrogen sulfide to ethylene.
