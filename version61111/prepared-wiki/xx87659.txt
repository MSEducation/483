==History==

The Melbourne & Murray River Railway (now named the Bendigo line) originating from Spencer Street station was built in the late 1850s from Footscray station to Sunbury and Bendigo, however no station was built at that time on the current site; the closest station was Albion & Darlington on the site of the current Albion station.Brimbank City Council - Travelling: Roads, Railways and Bridges
In 1885 the Serviceton line from Melbourne to Ballarat via Bacchus Marsh was built, branching off from the Bendigo line, and a station at the junction of the two lines was built. The station opened on 7 September 1885, as Braybrook Junction, named such as it was at the junction of the two lines and lay in the Shire of Braybrook.
In 1887 the Sunshine - Newport line, connecting the new station at Braybrook Junction to Newport and Williamstown, Victoria's major cargo port at the time, was opened.
In 1907 Braybrook Junction station was renamed Sunshine when H. V. McKay moved his Sunshine Harvester Works adjacent to the station. On 20 April 1908 Sunshine was the scene of the worst train crash in Victorian railway history, the  Sunshine train disaster.
The Albion-Jacana line opened in 1929 connecting Sunshine station with the North East line allowing freight trains to avoid the steeper grades and suburban traffic on the suburban line between North Melbourne, Essendon and Broadmeadows.
The road level crossing at Sunshine was removed when grade separation was carried out in 1961.[tpl]cite book|author=SE Dornan & RG Henderson|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|page=68|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1[/tpl] Boom barriers were provided at the Anderson Road level crossing with the Bendigo line in the same year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vrhistory.com/Locations/T1994B.PDF|title=VR History by Andrew Waugh - Bendigo Line|publisher=vrhistory.com|author=Andrew Waugh|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl]
