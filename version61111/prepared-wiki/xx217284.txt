</ref> Most if not all so-called proprietary [[UNIX]] distributions are mixed source software, bundling open source components like [[BIND]], [[Sendmail]], [[X Window System]], [[DHCP]], and others along with a purely proprietary [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and system utilities.<ref>

Some free software packages are also simultaneously available under proprietary terms.  Examples include MySQL, Sendmail and ssh. Some trial version can be also described like this (for instance, Handy Backup - a tool for MySQL and Microsoft Exchange backup with 30-days trial). The original copyright holders for a work of free software, even copyleft free software, can use dual-licensing to allow themselves or others to redistribute proprietary versions.   Non-copyleft free software (i.e. software distributed under a permissive free software license or released to the public domain) allows anyone to make proprietary redistributions.[ref]

This includes software written only for Microsoft Windows,<ref>
