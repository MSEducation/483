[[Oscar-class submarine]]

CATEGORIES: Submarine classes, Oscar-class submarines, Russian and Soviet navy submarine classes

Project 949 (Granit) and Project 949A (Antey) are Soviet Navy/Russian Navy cruise missile submarines (NATO reporting names: Oscar-I and Oscar-II respectively).
Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service, until the [tpl]sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0[/tpl] SSGN cruise missile submarine converted from SSBN and returned to service on October 15, 2007.  They are the fourth largest class of submarines in terms of displacement and length. Only the [tpl]sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|0[/tpl] Soviet/Russian submarines, the American Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines and the Russian [tpl]sclass2-|Borei|submarine|2[/tpl]s are larger.

==History==

The first submarine of Project 949 was laid down in the mid-1970s and was commissioned in 1980. In 1982 an updated and larger version (Project 949A) replaced the earlier version. In total thirteen submarines were constructed. The Oscar class was designed to attack NATO carrier battle groups  using long-range SS-N-19 "Shipwreck" anti-ship missiles and targeting data provided by the EORSAT satellite system.http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/oscar-submarine/http://faculty.fordham.edu/siddiqi/writings/p14_siddiqi_jbis_rorsat_1999.pdf In the financial problems that followed the fall of the Soviet Union the Oscar class was prioritized by the Russian navy and when many older submarine classes were retired the Oscar class remained active in both the Northern and Pacific fleets. In 2011, five submarines are currently active with several more in reserve or waiting for repairs.

==Project 949 Granit==

Two Project 949 Granit submarines were built at Severodvinsk and assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. They were K-525 laid down in 1975 and K-206 laid down in 1979. Both were decommissioned in 1996[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.military-today.com/navy/oscar_1_class.htm |title=Oscar 1 class |work=Military Today |accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl] and scrapped in 2004.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/navy/northern_fleet/decommissioning/33199 |title=Zvezdochka dismantling two nuclear subs |publisher=Bellona Foundation |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl]

==Project 949A Antey==

Eleven Project 949A Antey submarines were completed at Severodvinsk, of which five were assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet.
At one stage it had been planned to develop a new fourth-generation follow-on to the Project 949A, but this plan was later scrapped.

The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about [tpl]convert|10|m[/tpl] longer than its predecessor (~[tpl]convert|154|m[/tpl] rather than [tpl]convert|143|m|abbr=on[/tpl]), providing space for improved electronics and possibly quieter propulsion. Some sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to early [tpl]sclass-|Akula|submarine[/tpl] but inferior to the Akula II as well as subsequent (4. generation) designs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/11/subnoise.php |title=China’s Noisy Nuclear Submarines » FAS Strategic Security Blog |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24[/tpl]  It also has a larger fin, and a seven-bladed propeller instead of a four-bladed one.[tpl]cite web |url =http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/949.htm |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |title=Project 949 Granit / Oscar I ; Project 949A Antey / Oscar II |accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl]
Like all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of double hull construction. Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a bridge open to the elements on top of the sail but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station in the fin/sail.
A distinguishing mark is a slight bulge at the top of the fin. A large door on either side of the fin reaches this bulge. These are wider at the top than on the bottom, and are hinged on the bottom. The Federation of American Scientists reports that this submarine carries an emergency crew escape capsule; it is possible that these doors cover it. The VSK escape capsule can accommodate 110 people.
The Oscar Class is commonly referred to as Mongo by crews of US patrol aircraft in reference to their massive size. [tpl]citation needed |date=November 2010[/tpl]
In December 2012, construction began on a special purpose research and rescue submarine, designated project 09852, and allegedly based on project 949A (Oscar II class) submarines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Russia_builds_deep_sea_research_submarine-2112126.html |title=Russia builds deep-sea research submarine |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl] The submarine is designed to carry smaller submarines. Some sources speculated that the boat being built/modified is actually the incomplete "Belgorod".[tpl]cite web |url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2012/12/russia-builds-nuclear-submarine-deep-water-research-21-12 |title=Russia builds nuclear submarine for deep-water research |author= |date= |work=Barents Observer |accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl] However, another source gave a different account stating that the boat is similar to AS-31 Losharik, a far smaller special purpose submarine.[tpl]cite web|author=20.12.2012 |url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=16670 |title=Second Research Sub Keel-Laid at Sevmash |publisher=Rusnavy.com |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/210.htm |title=Project 210 Losharik |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06[/tpl]

==Ships in the class==

Three more Project 949A Antey submarines were planned.
