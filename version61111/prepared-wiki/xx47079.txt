The Songhua River ([tpl]zh|s=松花江|p=Sōnghuā Jiāng[/tpl]) or Sungari River (Manchu: 35px, Sunggari Ula) is a river in Northeast China, and is the largest tributary of the Heilong River (Amur), flowing about [tpl]convert|1434|km|mi[/tpl] from Changbai Mountains through Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The river drains [tpl]convert|557180|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of land,[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4g0I9qMfDDoC&pg=PA122&dq=songhua+river&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=32#v=onepage&q=songhua%20river&f=false |title=National Geographic Atlas of China, p. 36[/tpl] and has an annual discharge of [tpl]convert|2463|m3/s|cuft/s[/tpl].National Conditions: Main Rivers accessed October 21, 2010.
As the Second Songhua River, it joins the Amur at Tongjiang, Heilongjiang. It is then interrupted by the Baishan, Hongshi and Fengman Dams, which are used for hydroelectricity production. Fengman Dam forms a lake that stretches 62 km upstream. Below the dam, the Second Songhua flows northwest until its largest tributary, the Nen River, joins it near Da'an and creates the Songhua. The Nen River drains the northern Manchurian Plain. The river travels east until it joins the Hulan River near Harbin. Then it passes between the northern end of the eastern Manchurian mountain system and the Lesser Khingan Range. The river then flows into the Amur River valley. The river freezes from late November until March. It has its highest flows when the mountain snow melts during the spring thaw. The river is navigable up to Harbin by medium-sized ships. Smaller craft can navigate the Songhua up to Jilin and the Nen River up to Qiqihar.
The extreme flatness of the Manchurian Plain has caused the river to meander widely over time. The result of the meandering is that the river is surrounded by a wide plain that is filled with swirls and curves, showing paths the river once took.

In November 2005, the river was contaminated with benzene, leading to a shutdown of Harbin's water supply and threats of a Russian lawsuit against China.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.cctv.com/program/newshour/20100322/102807.shtml |title=Water pollution in China alarming, CCTV.com[/tpl] The spill stretched 80 kilometers and eventually reached the Amur River in Russia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eAUImCyjIcQC&pg=PA245&dq=songhua+river&hl=en&ei=a7irS8vhN4ySsgPF8uCSDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=songhua%20river&f=false |title=China By Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, p.245.[/tpl]
On July 28, 2010, several thousand barrels were washed away by floods from two chemical plants in China's Jilin City. Barrels contained some toxic chemicals like Trimethylsilyl chloride and Hexamethyldisiloxane, about 170 kg of a poisonous substance in each. There were reports that some barrels exploded on contact with water.Khabarovsk Region prevents poisoned Sungari water from reaching Amur, Jul 30, 2010, Moscow Time[tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Defence lines were opened in attempt to intercept the barrels with chemicals, RIA Novosti, 30.07.2010
