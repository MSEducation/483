==Career==

As a child, Jang Hyuk spent most of his life in his birthplace Busan, before making his drama debut in the SBS drama Model in 1997. Besides the TV drama School and a minor role in the little-seen film Zzang, Jang appeared in the music video To My Mother, the 1999 debut single of popular boyband g.o.d.. He also acted in several music videos from his rap album, released in 2000 under the name TJ Project. His career first began to take off in 2001 when he was cast in the lead role of the special-effects extravaganza Volcano High together with actress Shin Min-ah. His acting in the eccentric role drew praise from fans and critics."Actors and Actresses of Korean Cinema: Jang Hyuk". Koreanfilm.org. Retrieved 2012-11-13.
In 2002 he continued to make a name for himself, starring in the sleeper hit Jungle Juice, which made the top of the weekly box-office, and especially in the hugely popular TV drama Successful Story of a Bright Girl with actress Jang Na-ra. He also took a role in Public Toilet, the HK-Korea co-production by acclaimed Hong Kong director Fruit Chan which won a Special Mention in the Upstream section of the 2002 Venice film festival.
In 2003 Jang appeared with actress Lee Na-young in the comedy Please Teach Me English, by director Kim Sung-soo. His next project was even more high-profile, opposite top star Jeon Ji-hyun in Kwak Jae-yong's Windstruck. Although this film was generally not well received in Korea, it went on to beat Shiri and become one of the best-selling Korean films in Japan.
In late 2004, together with fellow actors Song Seung-heon and Han Jae-suk, Jang was found to have illegally avoided his mandatory military service. Amid widespread public condemnation, Jang apologized to his fans, then began to serve his two-year term.[tpl]cite web|title=More Actors Come Forward on Draft Dodging|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/09/19/2004091961025.html|work=The Chosun Ilbo|date=September 19, 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Song Seung-heon Appointed as Artilleryman, Jang Hyuk as Rifleman|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/entertainment_news_view.html?No=1592|work=KBS Global|date=December 17, 2004[/tpl]
