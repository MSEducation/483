==History==

Berkeley Middle School was built over 30 years ago as a high school. A few years later it was changed to a middle school then a junior high school. About 10 years ago it became the middle school it is today. The original building has been added to and now makes up four connected buildings.
In late 2010, Dr. Gaston stepped down from his occupation as the school's principal. The former vice principal, Karen Swann, took over as the principal for the remainder of the school year, with Amour Mickel stepping up as vice principal. These changes remained at the start of the 2011-2012 year.

==Notable Incidents==

On December 13, 2011, around 8:30AM, a strong smell was reported coming from a bathroom. Williamsburg Fire Department's hazardous materials experts took samples and, around 12:00, the substance remained unknown but was deemed safe. Due to their proximity to the bathroom, 6th grade classes were sent to the gym while the substance was investigated. There was no early dismissal but parents were allowed to pick their children up."Source of school smell deemed safe." Wavy 10 13 12 2011. n.pag. Web. 13 Dec 2011. .
