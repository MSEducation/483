Armenian Genocide Museum of America (AGMA) is a proposed Armenian museum in Washington, D.C., United States, run by the Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial Inc. (AGM&M). The project was launched in 2000 and is yet to be finalized.

==Concept and organization==

The idea to dedicate a building for commemorating the Armenian Genocide was launched by Hirair Hovnanian and Anoush Mathevosian.[tpl]cite news |title=Plans for Museum Buoy Armenians And Dismay Turks |author=Stephen Kinzer |date= April 24, 2002 |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802EFDA1F3FF937A15757C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 [/tpl]
The project was run by the Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) from 2000 to 2003. In November 2003, the project was transferred to the Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial Inc. (AGM&M), with the Armenian Assembly of America given a trusteeship position.

==Location==

The Armenian Genocide Museum will be housed in the former National Bank of Washington building, located on the southeast corner of 14th and G Streets, N.W., in downtown Washington, D.C. The building was purchased for $7.25 million, in addition to four adjacent properties, costing a total of $20 million. The site is two blocks from the White House and three blocks north of the National Mall.[ref][tpl]cite news |date= January 30, 2004 |title=$100 million museum takes control of site |work=Washington Business Journal |author=Sean Madigan |url=http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2004/02/02/story3.html [/tpl]
