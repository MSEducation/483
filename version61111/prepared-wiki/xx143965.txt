On February 6, 2011 during Super Bowl XLV, after Pro-Bowl cornerback Charles Woodson suffered a broken collar bone, Bush would have to fill a cornerback slot as well as continue his special teams duties.  In the second quarter, the Steelers were on the Green Bay 49 yard line with a 2nd and 11.  Bush made a great read and drove on a Ben Roethlisberger pass intended for Michael Wallace over the middle, resulting in the Packers second interception of the game.  This would prove pivotal in the game, as the ensuing drive resulted with a touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Greg Jennings.ESPN Box Score Super Bowl XLV  Bush ended Super Bowl XLV with one interception, one hit on quarterback, one pass defended, and five total tackles of which four were solo.ESPN Box Score
