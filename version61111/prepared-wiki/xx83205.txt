==History==

In the nineteenth century, Juhu was an island: a long, narrow sand bar rising above sea level by a metre or two, just off the west coast of Salsette. It could be reached during low tides by walking across the tidal inlet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/greater_bombay/general.html#1| title= Geography - Salsette group of Islands|accessdate=28 March 2012|work= Maharashtra State Gazetteer, Greater Bombay district |year=1986[/tpl]
Juhu was called "Juvem" by the Portuguese. At its north point, nestled the village of Juhu, inhabited by Bhandaris (toddy tappers), Agris (salt traders) and Kulbis (cultivators) and at its south point, opposite Bandra island, lived a small colony of fisher folk and cultivators (Koliwada). The inhabitants of Juhu were mainly East Indians and there was a small section of Goans. The Church of St. Joseph was built by the Portuguese in 1853.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stjosephchurchjuhu.com/our_parish/church_history |title=Juhu Church History |publisher=http://stjosephchurchjuhu.com |accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]
The open beaches of Juhu have attracted the well-heeled and the most affluent among Mumbai's population for almost a century. In the 1890s, Jamsetji Tata purchased land on Juhu and built a bungalow there. He planned to develop 1200 acres (5 km²) in Juhu Tara. This was to yield 500 plots of one acre (4,000 m²) each and a seaside resort. Simultaneously he wanted to extend the Mahim Causeway to Santacruz, to access to this area. After his death in 1904, the scheme was abandoned. With the dawn of aviation in the 20th century, the Bombay Flying Club commenced operations in 1929 at what eventually became the present Juhu Aerodrome.[tpl]cite news |title=Bombay Flying Club First Annual Report |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1929/1929-1%20-%200670.html |work=Flight Global |date=1 August 1929 |accessdate=16 September 2011 [/tpl]
