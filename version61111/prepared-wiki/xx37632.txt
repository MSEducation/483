==History==

After the Normans conquered Dublin and its hinterland in the 12th century, Hugh Tyrrel, 1st Baron of Castleknock, granted a large area of land, including what now comprises the Phoenix Park, to the Knights Hospitaller. They established an abbey at Kilmainham on the site now occupied by Royal Hospital Kilmainham. The knights lost their lands in 1537 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII of England. Eighty years later the lands reverted to the ownership of the King's representatives in Ireland. On the restoration of Charles II of England, his Viceroy in Dublin, the Duke of Ormonde, established a Royal Hunting Park on the land in 1662. It contained pheasants and wild deer, making it necessary to enclose the entire area with a wall. It was briefly granted to the king's mistress the Duchess of Cleveland in the 1670s but recovered due to the opposition of the Earl of Essex.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The Park originally included the demesne of Kilmainham Priory south of the River Liffey, but when the building of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham commenced in 1680, the Park was reduced to its present size, all of which is now north of the river. It was opened to the people of Dublin by the Earl of Chesterfield in 1745.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In 1882, it was the location for two murders. The Chief Secretary for Ireland (the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs), Lord Frederick Cavendish, and the Under-Secretary for Ireland (chief civil servant), Thomas Henry Burke, were stabbed to death with surgical knives while walking from Dublin Castle. A small insurgent group called the Invincibles were responsible.[tpl]cite book |last=Roundell |first=Julia |title=The Nineteenth Century and After: Volume 60 |publisher=Spottiswoode & Co |date=July–December 1906 |location=London |pages=559–575 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d-1XAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA559 |quote=From A Diary at Dublin Castle during the Phoenix Park Trial [/tpl]
During the Emergency thousands of tons of turf were transported from the bogs to Dublin and stored in high mounds along the main road on the park.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-farewell-to-the-old-sod-1311611.html |title=A farewell to the old sod |publisher=Irish Independent |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=12 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last=Corcoran |first=Tony |title=The Goodness of Guinness: A Loving History of the Brewery, It's People, and ... |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc |year=2009 |location=New York |page=83 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=05Ni_dhbZkAC&pg=PA83 |isbn=9781602396531 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heartland.ie/articles/early-days-kildare-scheme-and-turf-camps |title=Early Days: The Kildare Scheme and the Turf Camps |first=Maureen |last=Gill-Cummins |work=Taken from Scéal na Móna, Vol. 13, no. 60, December 2006, p70-72. |publisher=Bord na Móna |year=2012 |accessdate=12 June 2012[/tpl]

==Features==

The Park is split between three civil parishes: Castleknock to the north-west, Chapelizod to the south and St James' to the north. The last named is mainly centred south of the River Liffey around St James' parish church. The Park has its own piece of legislation the Phoenix Park Act, 1925 which includes giving powers to Park rangers to remove and arrest of offenders who disobey its bye-laws, which include "No person shall act contrary to public morality in the Park".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/about/phoenixparkbyelaws/|title=Phoenix Park Bye Laws|work=Office of Public Works|accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/about/phoenixparkact/|title=Phoenix Park Act|work=Office of Public Works|accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl]

===Áras an Uachtaráin===

The residence of the President of Ireland, Áras an Uachtaráin, built in 1754, is located in the park. As the Viceregal Lodge, it was the official residence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland until the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922.

===Dublin Zoo===

Dublin Zoo is one of Dublin's main attractions. It houses more than 700 animals and tropical birds from around the world and was founded in 1830[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dublinzoo.ie/inside.asp?pageId=2&sectionId=2&level=1 |title=About the Zoo - Zoo History |publisher=Dublin Zoo |accessdate=10 May 2009 [/tpl] and opened to the public on 1 September 1831, with animals from the London Society, making it the third oldest zoo in the world. Within a year the zoo housed 123 species.[tpl]cite book |last=Kilfeather |first=Siobhán Marie |title=Dublin: a cultural history |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |location= |pages=115–116 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8QWZRVAPa6sC&pg=PA115 |isbn=0-19-518201-4[/tpl]

===Papal Cross===

The Papal Cross was erected at the edge of Fifteen Acres for the visit of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open air mass in the park at the time. The white cross, which dominates its surroundings, is [tpl]convert|35|m|ft[/tpl] high and was built with steel girders. It was installed with some difficulty: after several attempts, the cross was eventually erected just a fortnight before the Pope arrived.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/about/sightsofthepark/ |title=Sights of the Park |publisher=Office of Public Works |accessdate=12 August 2010[/tpl]

===Monuments===

The Wellington Monument is a [tpl]convert|62|m|ft[/tpl] tall obelisk commemorating the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It is the largest obelisk in Europe and would have been even higher if the publicly subscribed funding had not run out. Designed by Robert Smirke, there are four bronze plaques cast from cannons captured at the Battle of Waterloo—three of which have pictorial representations of Wellington's career while the fourth has an inscription at the base of the obelisk.
A second notable monument is the "Phoenix Column" (shown in the header photograph above), a Corinthian column carved from Portland Stone located centrally on Chesterfield Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the Park, at the junction of Acres Road and The Phoenix, the main entrance to Áras an Uachtaráin. A contemporary account described it in the following terms:
 "About the centre of the park is a fluted column thirty feet high, with a phoenix on the capital, which was erected by the Earl of Chesterfield during his viceregality."An Accurate Observer, "Reminiscences of Half a Century", published in London (1838) (1747) 

===Deerfield Residence===

The Deerfield Residence (previously the Chief Secretary's Lodge), originally built in 1776 was the former residence of the Chief Secretary for Ireland and before that was the Park Bailiff's lodge. It has been the official residence of the United States Ambassador to Ireland since February 1927, and was until the early 1960s the Embassy of the United States in Dublin.[tpl]cite web|title=Ambassador's residence |publisher=Embassy of the United States: Dublin - Ireland|url=http://dublin.usembassy.gov/index/embassy-news/ambassador/ambassadors-residence2.html |accessdate=27 September 2010[/tpl]

===Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and Ashtown Castle===

The oldest building in the park is Ashtown Castle, a restored medieval tower house dating from the 15th century. Restoration began in 1989 and it is located beside the Visitor Centre which houses interpretive displays on the 5,500 years of park and area history.

===People's Gardens===

The Gardens, located close to the Parkgate Street entrance, comprise an area of [tpl]convert|9|ha|acre[/tpl], and were re-opened in 1864. These gardens were initially established in 1840 as the Promenade Grounds. They display Victorian horticulture, including ornamental lakes, children's playground, picnic area and bedding schemes. A statue is in the gardens dedicated to executed Easter Rising leader Seán Heuston. There is a plaque in honour of the Irish sculptor Jerome Connor on Infirmary Road, overlooking the Garden's which he frequently visited. The opening hours are 8am till dusk. Closing times vary during the year.

===Magazine Fort===

The Magazine Fort in the south east of the Park marks the location where Phoenix Lodge was built by Sir Edward Fisher in 1611. In 1734 the house was demolished when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset directed that a powder magazine be provided for Dublin. An additional wing was added to the fort in 1801 for troops. It was the scene of the Christmas Raid in 1939.
The magazine fort has been satirically immortalised in a jingle by Jonathan Swift who wrote:
"Now's here's a proof of Irish sense,  Here Irish wit is seen, 
When nothing's left that's worth defence, 
We build a Magazine."

==Environment==

There are 351 identified plant species in the park; three of these are rare and protected. The park has retained almost all of its old grasslands and woodlands and also has rare examples of wetlands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/about/naturebiodiversity/ |title=Nature & Biodiversity |publisher=Office of Public Works |accessdate=15 July 2009[/tpl] Deer were introduced into the park in the 1660s; the current 400–450 fallow deer descend from the original herd.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/about/naturebiodiversity/fauna/ |title=Fauna |publisher=Office of Public Works |accessdate=15 July 2009[/tpl] 30% of the park is covered by trees, mainly broadleaf.
A Birdwatch survey in 2007–08 found 72 species of bird including buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel and jay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/media/Birds%20of%20the%20Phoenix%20Park%202007%202008.pdf|title=The Birds of Phoenix Park County Dublin Birdwatch Ireland March 2008[/tpl]
The park also holds several streams, tributaries of the River Liffey.
In July and August 2006, the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, issued three orders exempting two new community nursing units, to be built at St. Mary's Hospital in the Park, from the usual legally required planning permission, despite the Phoenix Park being a designated and protected national monument. The Department of Health said the decision was made because of what it called the department's "emergency response to the accident and emergency crisis at the time", although the nursing units, in use since 2008, are mainly for geriatric care.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0518/1224246810397.html|title=Harney exempted Phoenix Park plan |work=The Irish Times|date=5 May 2009|accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl]
In a 2009 Conservative Management Plan for the Park, the Office of Public Works (a Department of Finance agency) commented, "...the erection, without the necessity of resorting to normal planning procedures, of two major developments in St. Mary's Hospital illustrates the vulnerability of The Phoenix Park to internal development, which impacts significantly on the essential character of the Park and its unique value as a historic designed landscape." In a section entitled Pressures and Threats on the Park, subsection Planning Issues, the document expressed concern that, "Without appropriate planning designation, there is a risk that development can take place which is not in line with the co-ordinated vision of this Plan." The document warned of similar risks to the integrity of the Park such as "uncoordinated building and construction...and the current condition of certain historic buildings such as the Magazine Fort, the farm buildings below St. Mary's Hospital and Mountjoy House in the Ordnance Survey Complex."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoenixpark.ie/media/Phoenix%20Park%20Conservation%20Management%20Plan%20Consultation%20Draft%20March%202009.pdf |title=The Phoenix Park: Conservative Management Plan: Consultation Draft March 2009 |publisher=Office of Public Works |date=March 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2010[/tpl]
