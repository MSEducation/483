Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is the eighth studio album by alternative rock band Sonic Youth. It was released on May 3, 1994, through record label DGC.

==Background==

Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star includes one of the group's biggest hits, "Bull in the Heather". Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre appears in the music video for the song "Bull in the Heather". Another song, "Screaming Skull", is about the band's nostalgia for their days on independent labels, particularly SST Records, which is mentioned frequently throughout the song, along with the label's "Superstore" in Los Angeles.
Lee Ranaldo did not write or sing any songs on this album.
According to the band's official website, if the volume is turned up high on this album one can hear Sister played underneath.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/lp/lp10.html |title=sonicyouth.com Discography – Album: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star |work=sonicyouth.com |accessdate=April 17, 2013[/tpl]

==Cancelled single==

"Self-Obsessed and Sexxee" was intended to be the second single from this album. A promo CD was issued, but plans for a regular release were cancelled and promo pressing ceased. The remaining copies were sold off through Sonic Death. The CD included the same B-sides as "Bull in the Heather".

==Critical reception==

Rolling Stone called the album "quietly confident; more ambitious and weirder than Dirty", though "they've saved their integrity at the expense of quality; with a little more grease, their grit might get across better."
