On her show, she is depicted as regularly seeing a therapist to discuss relationships and other problems.

==Work Out show==

In 2004, Warner opened Sky Sport and Spa. On July 19, 2006, the Bravo network aired the first episode of Work Out. The reality show's first season followed Warner's daily routine, giving a behind-the-scenes look at how Warner runs her day-to-day business, juggles her personal life with then girlfriend Milenna (Mimi) Saraiva, and deals with her employees' personal issues.
On March 18, 2007, Bravo launched a second season of "Work Out," where it continues to show Warner handling her personal life and controversial relationship with employee Rebecca Cardon, launching a new business venture, integrating a new trainer (Gregg Butler) into the mix, and dealing with the sudden death of trainer Doug Blasdell.
There was much debate over her relationship with Rebecca, whom she began to casually date during the filming of the second season late 2006. In April 2007, Jackie stated during the Work Out "Reunion" show that due to the attention they have received, the relationship was to be kept private until decided otherwise.[tpl]cite web |url=http://video.bravotv.com/player/?id=103195 |title=Work Out Reunion snippet |accessdate=2007-07-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012141356/http://video.bravotv.com/player/?id=103195  |archivedate = 2007-10-12[/tpl]
As seen on season three, Jackie dated, and lived with, a 25 year-old bartender named Brianna Stockton.  At the end of season three, Jackie and Brianna appeared to have ended their relationship.
Bravo cancelled the show after Season 3 of Work Out, which created much controversy. In the May 6, 2008 episode Jackie and her SkySport office manager Lisa were overheard in Jackie's office gossiping negatively about the physical appearance of trainer Brian Peeler's client. Brian and his client were both working out several feet away from the office. The client turned out to be well-known fitness model and breast cancer survivor Jamie Eason. Negative comments were made regarding Jamie's breast implants and were overheard by Eason's boyfriend, who was right outside Jackie's office, unbeknownst to Jackie. The actual footage was not shown by Bravo, but Jamie's boyfriend Rich Luzzi, as well as Jamie Eason herself, have stated that Jackie made most of the negative comments and Lisa only chimed in.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] Lisa said later in her Bravo blog that Jackie was heard making negative comments by Jamie Eason's boyfriend.BRAVOtv.com : Work Out : Season 3 : Blogs : lisa 
Jackie denied making any comments herself, both in her on-the-air commentary and on her Bravo blog after the episode aired, and said the negative comments were made only by her assistant Lisa.BRAVOtv.com : Work Out : Season 3 : Blogs : jackie When Brian Peeler tried to discuss the situation with her, Jackie refused to do so and fired Brian. This turn of events, when aired, caused a media maelstrom of protests, petitions, and calls to cancel Work Out due to perceived inappropriate workplace behavior by Jackie, her alleged attempts to deflect blame and to cover up her supposed part in the situation, and her lack of an apology. The episode aired on May 6, and by May 9 Gatorade, a major sponsor of the show, dropped its sponsorship and publicly criticized the comments about a breast cancer survivor made on the program.Lesbian Fitness Guru Jackie Warner Needs a New Sponsor The show was cancelled shortly afterward, and Warner sold Sky Sport and Spa in 2009.
