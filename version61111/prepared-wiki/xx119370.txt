[[IntraMural Physical Education Building (IMPE)]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign

The IntraMural Physical Education Building, more commonly known as IMPE (pronounced "impy") is a complex of athletic facilities at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign available to students and members through the Division of Campus Recreation. It is located on Peabody Drive across from numerous residence halls.

==Renovation==

In January 2006, the 49-million dollar renovations began to completely overhaul IMPE. The East Wing has remained open thus far during renovations, but the dramatic decrease in available space and facilities has greatly affected the number of people going to CRCE and other athletic facilities on campus.  Upon completion of the renovations, IMPE was renamed the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC).
