[[2001–02 Prva HNL]]

CATEGORIES: Prva HNL seasons, 2001–02 domestic association football leagues, 2001–02 in Croatian football

The 2001–02 Prva HNL was the eleventh season of the Prva HNL since its establishment in 1992. NK Zagreb became champions for the first time, and were the first and to date only league winners from outside the Eternal Derby rivalry. The campaign began on 28 July 2001 and ended on 4 May 2002. The league expanded to 16 teams (from 12 in the previous season), and was contested by all the 12 teams who competed in the previous season plus four newly promoted ones from Druga HNL. 
The first goal of the season was scored by Dinamo Zagreb's Dario Zahora against newly promoted TŠK Topolovac in the 13th minute of the game on the opening day of the season on 28 July.[tpl]cite news |first=Goran |last=Čop |title=Ilijini mladi lavovi |url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20010730/prilozi.htm |work= |publisher=Slobodna Dalmacija |date=30 July 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |language=Croatian|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kEY1yAc0|archivedate=2009-10-02|deadurl=no[/tpl] Miljenko Mumlek of Varteks scored the first hat-trick of the season against Hajduk Split, two of them from penalty kicks, at Poljud on 17 August 2001.[tpl]cite news |first=Ante |last=Cibilić |title=Petarda uzdrmala Poljud prije Mallorce |url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2001/08/18/Clanak.asp?r=spo&c=1 |work= |publisher=Vjesnik |date=18 August 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |language=Croatian|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kEY2kD1z|archivedate=2009-10-02|deadurl=no[/tpl]
NK Zagreb clinched their first ever title after they drew 0–0 against Čakovec and their last competitor for the title Hajduk Split lost 1–0 to Hrvatski Dragovoljac in the penultimate 29th round of the season which took place on 27 April 2002. It was the third Prva HNL title for NK Zagreb manager Zlatko Kranjčar, who thus became the first manager to have won the Prva HNL in charge of two different clubs (in 1996 and 1998 he clinched two championship titles with Croatia Zagreb, renamed Dinamo Zagreb in 2000). The top goalscorer of the season was Ivica Olić with 21 goals scored in 29 appearances for NK Zagreb.

==Promotion and relegation==

Since it had been decided that the league would expand to 16 teams for the 2001–02 season, only Marsonia were in danger of relegation, having finished last the previous season. Marsonia then played second level side Solin in a two-legged promotion/relegation playoff on 3 and 10 June 2001. The aggregate score was 5–5, but Marsonia won the tie on away goals rule, so no team were relegated.
