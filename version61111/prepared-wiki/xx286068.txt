Conduit is the sixth studio album by Welsh post-hardcore band Funeral for a Friend. It was released on 28 January 2013 through Distiller Records and 5 February 2013 through The End Records in the United States. This is the band's first release with former Rise to Remain drummer Pat Lundy, who replaced long-term drummer and vocalist Ryan Richards after the material was written[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl] but before recording, except for "High Castles", which is inherited from the earlier EP See You All in Hell.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/funeral-for-a-friend/63945 | title =  Funeral For A Friend's new drummer Pat Lundy reveals how he joined the band | publisher = New Musical Express | date = 23 May 2012 | accessdate = 9 October 2012[/tpl] Throughout the recording of the album the band released several teaser videos that showed the recording of individual instruments.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/watch-funeral-for-a-friend-post-studio-update/ | title = Watch: Funeral For A Friend Post Studio Update | publisher = This Is Fake DIY | date = 7 May 2012| accessdate = 8 October 2012 | quote = [/tpl]

==Style==

Conduit is described as being more consistently heavy than their previous releases, as they have all varied in style.[tpl]cite web|url = http://alreadyheard.com/post/40516950954/album-review-funeral-for-a-friend-conduit#.UPforWeuR8E | title = Album Review: Funeral For A Friend - Conduit | author = Sean Reid | work = Already Heard | publisher = | date = 14 January 2013 | accessdate = 18 January 2013 | quote = [/tpl] Conduit is seen as the band returning to their musical roots, this is reflected in how it is some of the band's heaviest material[tpl]cite web|url = http://mediablasphemy.com/2013/featured/8264/ | title = Funeral For A Friend – Conduit: Review | author = Ian Pemberton | work = Media Blasphemy | date = 11 January 2013 | accessdate = 18 January 2013 | quote = [/tpl] and that raw music featured on the album captures the energy of a younger band. Much like their previous work the album is considered as post-hardcore. The album features a combination of metalcore guitar riffs, metallic breakdowns, gang vocals, 'emotionally charged hooks' and melodic choruses. Matthew Davies has summarised the record neatly by saying “it's a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure.” Saying elements of it are "extremely direct and gritty".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/features/funeral-for-a-friend-we-never-thought-we-would-throw-in-the-towel/ | title = Funeral For A Friend: 'We Never Thought We Would Throw In The Towel' | author = Hugh Morris | publisher = This Is Fake DIY | date = 8 July 2012 | accessdate =2 August 2012 | quote = Matt reckons the new album, currently being mixed, is a return to those roots. “It's kind of hard to anticipate what people are going to think it. We love it. It's extremely direct and gritty,” he says, “It's a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure.”[/tpl]
The band's new drummer Pat Lundy has summarised the style on the record as "lot heavier and a lot more current" describing Davies' vocals as "exploring more than ever now".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/funeral-for-a-friend/63987 | title = Funeral For A Friend planning 'very different' new album | publisher = New Musical Express | date = 25 May 2012 | accessdate = 9 October 2012[/tpl] Davis' screaming vocals are seen as bridging the gap between his normal melodic vocals and the screamed vocals of the band's previous drummer and vocalist Ryan Richards, who left prior to the recording of this album (however, Davies previously used more conventional screamed vocals of his own prominently in some early songs by the band and as occasional elements on later albums).[tpl]cite web|url = | title =  Review: Funeral For A Friend – ‘Conduit’ |url = http://indulge-sound.com/2013/01/12/review-funeral-for-a-friend-conduit/ | author = Heather McDaid | work = Indulge-sound.com | publisher = | date = 12 January 2013 | accessdate = 18 January 2013 | quote = [/tpl] Lyrical themes on the album range through several topics, "from the passage of time to the power of advertising to friends dying".
The song 'The Distance' is seen as continuing the album's theme as being "a driving rocker that speaks to making a connection" and has been claimed to feature one of the album's catchiest choruses and guitar licks. ‘Best Friends and Hospital Beds’ is an example of a song featured on the album that is in critics opinion designed for live shows.
Tracks 'Death Comes To Us All' and 'Grey' have been compared to the "apocalyptic anthems" of their previous album Welcome Home Armageddon.

==Title and packaging==

Conduit has been described by the other band members as about the experiences of being in a band.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/funeral-for-a-friends-sixth-album-conduit-to-be-released-in-january-2013 | title = Funeral For A Friend’s Sixth Album ‘Conduit’ To Be Released In January 2013! | author = | work = Rocksound | publisher = Freeway Press | date = 4 October 2012 | accessdate = 8 October 2012[/tpl] For the album art the band recruited Wales-based artist Snowskull, who was revealed to be Matthew Evans, who was a founding vocalist in Funeral for a Friend. Matthew Davies, the band's current vocalist, decided to contact Evans as Davies felt the inclusion of a former member was very apt. Evans also performed backing vocals on track 1, "Spine".

==Release and promotion==

The first single released from the album was "Best Friends And Hospital Beds".

==Reception==

Conduit received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 11 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Rock Sound writer Ben Patashnik gave the album a 9 out of 10 score praising the band's youthful energy and as being "one of our most treasured bands", summarising his review with "if they can't be the biggest band in the UK any more, this album screams, they might as well go back to being one of the best." The Shields Gazette gave the album a six out of ten commenting on the raw sound of the album: "Many of the melodic touches are gone, and this is a much rawer offering, as if they were just setting out. That works well on the likes of Nails and Sun-Less, but some tracks do sound a bit samey. Not a bad album then, but not their best". Ross Watson of the Scottish publication The Skinny praised the album's "short, lean entirely engaging" punk approach.
