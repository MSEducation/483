[[Geography of Eritrea]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Eritrea

Eritrea is located in the Horn of Africa and is bordered on the northeast and east by the Red Sea, on the west and northwest by Sudan, on the south by Ethiopia, and on the southeast by Djibouti. The country has a high central plateau that varies from [tpl]convert|1800|to|3000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level. A coastal plain, western lowlands, and some 350 islands comprise the remainder of Eritrea's land mass. Eritrea has no year-round rivers.

==Climate==

Hot, dry desert strip along Red Sea coast; cooler and wetter in the central highlands (up to [tpl]convert|610|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of rainfall annually); semiarid in western hills and lowlands; rainfall heaviest during June–September except in coastal desert. The climate is temperate in the mountains and hot in the lowlands. Asmara, the capital, is about [tpl]convert|2400|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level. Maximum temperature is [tpl]convert|26|C|F|1[/tpl]. The weather is usually sunny and dry, with the short or belg rains occurring February–April and the big or meher rains beginning in late June and ending in mid-September.
