The Advocate was a weekly newspaper in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon, established to cover issues relating to racial minorities. It was founded in 1903 and is believed to have run until 1933, the latest date for which microfilm is available.
In its early days it was known as the Mt. Scott Herald (published in Lents from 1913 to 1924) and possibly as the Beaver State Herald (published in Gresham and Montavilla).http://www.lib.washington.edu/mcnews/afroamerican_primarysources/newspapers.html
