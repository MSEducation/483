thumb|Brad Wall is the current premier of Saskatchewan.
This is a list of the premiers of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, since it was formed in 1905. Saskatchewan uses a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly.  The premier, sometimes called the prime, or first, minister, is Saskatchewan's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. The premier chooses a "cabinet" from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Saskatchewan, and presides over that body.
Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the legislative assembly. An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.
Prior to 1905, Saskatchewan was part of the North-West Territories and was governed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories from 1870 until 1897, and the Premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905.
