==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Thom Owen wrote the album "At the concert, Doc Watson and his family were in fine form, breathing life into a number of old-timey songs, ranging from ballads to folk songs to gospel. It's an exciting, affectionate performance, highlighted by four duets with Clarence White."
