With one of the fastest growing economies in the world, clocked at a growth rate of 8.3% in 2010, India is fast on its way to becoming a large and globally important consumer economy. The Indian middle class was estimated to be 250 million people in 2007, by McKinsey & Company.About 5 per cent of India is middle class It will reach 600 million by 2030. According to Deutsche Research the estimates are nearly 300 million people for all Middle Class.Deutsche Bank Research: The middle class in India  If current trends continue, Indian per capita purchasing power parity will significantly increase from 4.7 to 6.1 percent of the world share by 2015.IMF- World Economic Outlook Database, April 2010 In 2006, 22 percent of Indians lived under the poverty line. India aims to eradicate poverty by 2020.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hindustantimes.com/news/181_1735396,0008.htm|title=Poverty can be eradicated by 2020: Kalam|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=2006-07-04[/tpl]

The standard of living in India shows large disparity. For example, rural areas of India exist with very basic (or even non-existent) medical facilities, while cities boast of world class medical establishments. Similarly, the very latest machinery may be used in some construction projects, but many construction workers work without mechanisation in most projects.Labouring Brick by Brick: A Study of Construction Workers - www.sewa.org

==Poverty==

A 24.3% of the population earned less than US$1 (PPP, around US$0.25 in nominal terms) a day in 2005, down from 42.1% in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&piPK=64165421&theSitePK=469372&menuPK=64166093&entityID=000158349_20080826113239|title=The developing world is poorer than we thought, but no less successful in the fight against poverty|publisher=World Bank|year=2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=332669|title=India has fewer poor people: World Bank|publisher=Business Standard[/tpl] 41.6% of its population is living below the new international poverty line of $1.25 (PPP) per day, down from 59.8% in 1981. The World Bank further estimates that a third of the global poor now reside in India.
On the other hand, the Planning Commission of India uses its own criteria and has estimated that 27.5% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2004–2005, down from 51.3% in 1977–1978, and 36% in 1993-1994.Poverty estimates for 2004-05, Planning commission, Government of India, March 2007.

Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under planning, to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. Programmes like Food for work and National Rural Employment Programme have attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|title=Economic Survey 2004–2005|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2004-05/esmain.htm| accessdate = 2006-07-15[/tpl] In August 2005, the Indian parliament passed the Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, the largest programme of this type, in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of India's 600 districts.  The Indian government is planning to bring in more economic reforms which can help farmers and unskilled labourers transition into industrialized sectors.

==Physical infrastructure==

Since independence, India has allocated nearly half of the total outlay of the five-year plans for infrastructural development. Much of the total outlay was spent on large projects in the area of irrigation, energy, transport, communications and social overheads. Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment.[tpl]cite book | author=Sankaran, S | title=Indian Economy: Problems, Policies and Development | publisher=Margham Publications | year=1994 | id=ISBN[/tpl]

India's low spending on power, construction, transportation, telecommunications and real estate, at $31 billion or 6% of GDP in 2002 has prevented India from sustaining a growth rate of around 8%. This has prompted the government to partially open up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment.[tpl]cite news | title=Infrastructure the missing link | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/09/03/india.eye.infra/ | accessdate=14 August 2005 | work=CNN | date=6 October 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Infrastructure in India: Requirements and favorable climate for foreign investment | url=http://www.asiatradehub.com/india/intro.asp | accessdate=14 August 2005 [/tpl] India holds second position in the world in roadways' construction.[tpl]cite web | title=Infrastructure Rankings | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2085rank.html[/tpl]
As of 31 December 2005, there were an estimated 835,000 broadband lines in India.[tpl]cite web | title=World broadband statistics q4-2005 | url=http://www.point-topic.com/contentDownload/dslanalysis/world%20broadband%20statistics%20q4%202005.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-07-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060705053249/http://www.point-topic.com/contentDownload/dslanalysis/world+broadband+statistics+q4+2005.pdf  |archivedate = 2006-07-05[/tpl] Low tele-density is the major hurdle for slow pickup in broadband services. Over 76% of the broadband lines were via DSL and the rest via cable modems.
A 2007 study by the Asian Development Bank showed that in 20 cities the average duration of water supply was only 4.3 hours per day. No city had a continuous water supply. The longest duration of supply was 12 hours per day in Chandigarh, and the lowest was 9 hours per day in Rajkot.ADB 2007, p. 3

==Regional imbalance==

One of the critical problems facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. For instance, the difference in growth rate between the forward and backward states was 0.3% (5.2% & 4.9%) during 1980–81 to 1990–91, but had grown to 3.3% (6.3% & 3.0%) during 1990–91 to 1997–98.[tpl]cite book | author=Datt, Ruddar & Sundharam, K.P.M. | title=Indian Economy | pages = 471–472 | chapter = 27[/tpl] Per Capita Income in India varies drastically. As of 2010, New Delhi had a Per Capita Income of $ 3,020 whereas Bihar's Per Capita Income was at a paltry $ 445.
The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities. Even the industrial townships in the interiors, Bhilai for instance, resulted in very little development in the surrounding areas.[tpl]cite book | author=Bharadwaj, Krishna | year=1991 | chapter = Regional differentiation in India | editor=Sathyamurthy, T.V. (ed.) | title = Industry & agriculture in India since independence | pages=189–199 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-564394-1[/tpl] After liberalisation, the disparities have grown despite the efforts of the union government in reducing them. Part of the reason being that manufacturing and services and not agriculture are the engines of growth. The more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.[tpl]cite paper | author=Sachs, D.
