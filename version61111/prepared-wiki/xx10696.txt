Real Madrid Club de Fútbol ([tpl]IPA-es|reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol[/tpl]; Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.
Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the team has traditionally worn a white home kit since. The word real is Spanish for royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 85,454-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club since its inception.
The club is the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €513 million, and the most valuable sports team, worth €2.4 billion (US$3.3 billion).[tpl]cite web | title = Deloitte Football Money League 2013 | url = http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/sports/football/deloitte-football-money-league/7c19cb03a366c310VgnVCM1000003256f70aRCRD.htm | publisher = Deloitte UK | accessdate =30 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title = The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams | url = http://www.forbes.com/soccer-valuations/ | publisher = Forbes[/tpl] It is one of three clubs to have never been relegated from the top flight of Spanish football, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with FC Barcelona and El Derbi madrileño with Atlético Madrid.
The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s. Domestically, Real Madrid has won a record 32 La Liga titles, 19 Copas del Rey, 9 Supercopas de España, 1 Copa Eva Duarte and 1 Copa de la Liga.[tpl]cite web|title = World Football: The 11 Most Successful European Clubs in History | url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/510011-world-football-the-11-most-successful-european-clubs-in-history/page/12 | accessdate =22 January 2012[/tpl] Internationally it has won a record nine European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles and a joint record three Intercontinental Cups, as well as two UEFA Cups, and one UEFA Super Cup.

==History==

===Early years (1897–1945)===

Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución libre de enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded Football Club Sky in 1897, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. It split into two clubs in 1900: New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Club Español de Madrid.Ball, Phil p. 117. On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[tpl]cite web|title = Pre-history and first official title (1900–1910) | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202730681095/noticia/Noticia/Real_Madrid_turns_106_(I).htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate =12 July 2008|author=Luís Miguel González[/tpl] Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][/ref] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.
In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[tpl]cite web| title = A spectacular leap towards the future (1921–1930) | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202730681768/noticia/Noticia/Real_Madrid_turns_106_(III).htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | date =28 February 2007 |accessdate =12 July 2008|author=Luís Miguel González[/tpl] Real Madrid won its first League title in the 1931–32 season.

On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went back to being named Madrid Football Club. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943 Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of a semi-final[tpl]cite news|title=Real Madrid v Barcelona: six of the best 'El Clásicos'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/la-liga/8946213/Real-Madrid-v-Barcelona-six-of-the-best-El-Clasicos.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=9 December 2011|location=London[/tpl] of the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of General Franco.

===Santiago Bernabéu Yeste and European success (1945–78)===

Santiago Bernabéu Yeste became president of Real Madrid in 1945. Under his presidency, the club, its stadium Santiago Bernabéu and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War damages. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera",  known today as La Fábrica.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/es/1202773840831/noticia/Noticia/undefined |title=Real Madrid C.F. - Web Oficial — El Padre de la cantera |publisher=Realmadrid.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl] Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent of them being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[tpl]cite web|title = An exceptional decade (1951–1960) | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202730565386/noticia/Noticia/Real_Madrid_turns_106_(VI).htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate=12 July 2008|author=Luís Miguel González[/tpl]
In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by the French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe Gabriel Hanot, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created an exhibition tournament of invited teams from around Europe that would eventually become what today is known as the UEFA Champions League.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=512/newsId=419682.html | title=Hats off to Hanot | accessdate=11 July 2008 | date=12 May 2006 | publisher=uefa.com | author=Matthew Spiro |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080519095732/http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=512/newsId=419682.html |archivedate = 19 May 2008[/tpl] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19071.pdf | title=Regulations of the UEFA Champions League | format=PDF| publisher = UEFA | accessdate =12 July 2008[/tpl]; Page 4, §2.01 "Cup" & Page 26, §16.10 "Title-holder logo" The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966 defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition. This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name "Ye-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus in The Beatles' song "She Loves You" after four members of the team posed for Diario Marca dressed in Beatles wigs. The Ye-yé generation was also European Cup runner-up in 1962 and 1964.
In the 1970s, Real Madrid won five league championships and three Spanish Cups.[tpl]cite web|title=Trophy Room |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/es/Club/1193040475224/PalmaresTotal/Palmares.htm |publisher=Realmadrid.com |accessdate=12 July 2008 [/tpl] The club played its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1971 and lost to English side Chelsea 2–1.[tpl]cite web|title = European Competitions 1971|url = http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec197071.html#cwc|publisher = RSSS|accessdate =27 September 2008 [/tpl] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][/ref] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in the memory of its former president.

===Quinta del Buitre and seventh European Cup (1980–2000)===

By the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title until a new batch of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left the club for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.
In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid was proclaimed league champion and players like Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro, Iván Zamorano, and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup. In 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, The Whites defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final thanks to a goal from Predrag Mijatović.[tpl]cite web|title = 1991–2000 – From Raúl González to the turn of the new millennium | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193041516534/Historia/Club.htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate =12 July 2008[/tpl]

===Los Galácticos (2000–2006)===

In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president. He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club got its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the famous Galáctico side including players such as Zinédine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Fabio Cannavaro and David Beckham. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite a UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup (football) win in 2002, followed by the League in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons.[tpl]cite web|title = 2001 – present — Real Madrid surpasses the century mark| url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193041516534/Historia/Club.htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate =12 July 2008[/tpl]
The few days after the capturing of the league title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque, after Real's sporting director claimed that del Bosque was not the right man for the job; they wanted someone young to shake up the team.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The bad atmosphere continued when the Real legend and captain Fernando Hierro left the club after a disagreement with the management, as did Steve McManaman.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] However, the club toured Asia in pre-season and introduced newly signed David Beckham. Pérez and his directors refused to renew Claude Makélélé's contract with a better salary, upsetting Makélélé who asked for a transfer, eventually moving to Chelsea[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In the final days of the transfer window, Fernando Morientes left the club on loan to Monaco.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===New president Ramón Calderón (2006–2009)===

Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the La Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years but Capello was sacked. On 9 June 2007, Real played against Zaragoza at La Romareda. The match got off to a bad start when Real Madrid were forced to change their lineup some minutes before the start of the match when young defender Miguel Torres tore his hamstring during warm-up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. Real's title challenge looked to be over.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] However, a late Ruud van Nistelrooy equalizer followed by a last-minute Raúl Tamudo goal sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Sevilla were also held 0–0 away against Mallorca, which meant that a win at home against Mallorca would effectively secure Los Merengues their 30th Spanish league title.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The title was won on 17 June, Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu, while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal respectively. At half time Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona; however, three goals in the last half-an-hour secured Real Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. The first goal came from Reyes who scored after a good work from Higuaín. An own goal followed by another goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title. Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Second Pérez term and the Mourinho era (2009–13)===

On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202773095983/noticia/ComunicadoOficial/ANNOUNCEMENT_OF_THE_BOARD_OF_DIRECTORS.htm |title=First measures adopted by the Real Madrid Board of Directors |publisher=Realmadrid.com |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8076515.stm|title=Perez to return as Real president |date=1 June 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan,The Times Madrid Signs Kaká timesonline.co.uk and then purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for a record-breaking £80 million.
José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mourinho-to-be-unveiled-at-madrid-on-monday-after-1637m-compensation-deal-1986040.html|title=Mourinho to be unveiled at Madrid on Monday after £7m compensation deal |date=28 May 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=31 May 2010 | location=London | first=Gordon | last=Tynan[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8708315.stm|title=Real Madrid unveil José Mourinho as their new coach |date=31 May 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 May 2010[/tpl] In April 2011, a strange occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of eighteen days. The first fixture was for the Liga campaign on 17 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the Copa del Rey final (which ended 1–0 to Madrid), and the controversial two-legged Champions League semifinal on 27 April and 2 May (3–1 loss on aggregate) to Barcelona.
The first Clasico saw Cristiano Ronaldo get his first goal against Barcelona due to a penalty given to Madrid after a foul to Marcelo. The Copa del Rey final gave Real Madrid its first title under Mourinho with a header from Cristiano Ronaldo in extra time. The Champions League semifinal was perhaps the most controversial of the four, with the expulsion of Pepe in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabéu, after an alleged "dangerous challenge" to Barcelona defender Daniel Alves. Alves was carried out in a stretcher "unable to walk", but after Pepe was shown red, Alves came running back into the field within seconds. After Pepe's sending off, coach José Mourinho was also sent off, receiving a fine and a five-match ban. This same match was also controversial in that Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets being captured on video saying what seemed like a supposed racial slur to Madrid left-back Marcelo. The second leg was not as controversial as the first, with perhaps the exception of an annulled goal to Gonzalo Higuaín, after Cristiano Ronaldo was deemed to have fouled Javier Mascherano as a result of a foul to Ronaldo by Gerard Piqué.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/8490345/Barcelona-v-Real-Madrid-Ronaldo-fury-over-Gonzalo-Higuain-goal-that-got-away.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Henry | last=Winter | title=Barcelona v Real Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo fury over Gonzalo Higuain goal that got away in Champions League | date=3 May 2011[/tpl]

Real Madrid began the 2012-13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals, but finished as second in the league competition. A major transfer of the season was signing of Luka Modrić, in the region of £33 million. In the Champions League, they were drawn in the "group of death" along Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City and Ajax, finishing second with ten points behind Dortmund. In the 16 round defeated Manchester United, quarter-finals Galatasaray, and reached third straight semifinal finish at the Champions League, where were again stopped by Dortmund. After a disappointing extra time loss to Atlético Madrid in the 2013 Copa del Rey final (which broke a 14-year skid for Atleti), Florentino Perez announced the departure of Mourinho at the end of the season by "mutual agreement".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22583729|title=Jose Mourinho: Real Madrid boss to leave next month|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Jose Mourinho: Real Madrid season worst of my career|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22578880|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=17 May 2013[/tpl] Mourinho returned to the English Premier League with Chelsea, a team he managed from 2004 to 2007.

==Crest and colours==

===Emblem evolution===

File:Real crest.png|1902
File:Real crest 4.png|1908
File:Real crest 5.png|1920
File:Real Madrid emblem 1931.png|1931

The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, "MCF" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.
The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title "Real Madrid", roughly translated as "Royal".[tpl]cite web|title = Presidents — Pedro Parages | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193041516821/1193042223056/contenido/Presidente/Pedro_Parages.htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate =18 July 2008[/tpl] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.
With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all the royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile. In 1941, two years after the end of the Civil War, the crest's "Real Corona", or "Royal Crown", was restored while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well. In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club was again called Real Madrid Club de Fútbol. The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.

Real Madrid's traditional home colours are all white, although before its foundation in the club first game against themselves they adopted a blue and a red oblique stripe on the shirt to differentiate the two teams (the club crest design has a purple stripe which isn't associated to this. It was incorporated the year they lost the royal crown, as it the traditional region of Castile colour); but unlike today, black socks were worn. Lastly, the black socks will be replaced by dark blue ones.[tpl]cite web|title = Camiseta Real Madrid | url = http://www.santiagobernabeu.com/contentid-15.html | publisher = santiagobernabeu.com | accessdate =29 November 2008|language=Spanish[/tpl] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was however one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925, the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to look like the English team but the initiative lasted only one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit claiming that the other brought bad luck. Years later, Leeds United switched their blue shirt for a white one after marveling at Real Madrid's 7–3 Victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow's Hampden Park.Real Madrid home kit in 1905 was all-white, so the supporters start calling the players as Los Blancos By the early 1940s the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast (which have remained ever since). On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.
Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. The club's kit is currently manufactured by Adidas whose contract extends from 1998.[tpl]cite web|title = Leaders in sporting goods |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202733617742/noticia/Noticia/Leaders_in_sporting_goods.htm | publisher = Realmadrid.com | date = 1 December 2006| accessdate =12 July 2008 |author=Álvaro Velasco |quote=Ramón Calderón says: We began working with Adidas again in 1998 [/tpl] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons.

==Grounds==

After moving between grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home ground for eleven years. After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid moved its home matches to Estadio Chamartín which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.Ball, Phil p. 118. In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title. After some successes, the 1943 elected president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Estadio Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club. A new stadium was built and was inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[tpl]cite web| title = History — Chapter 3 – The New Chamartin, an exemplary stadium | url = http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/Santiago_Bernabeu/1193041512791/Historia/History.htm| publisher = Realmadrid.com | accessdate =12 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] This was the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium as it is known today, although it did not acquire this name until 1955.

==Rivalries==

===El Clásico===

There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as 'The Classic' (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.Ghemawat, Pankaj. p. 2
Over the years, the record from Real Madrid and Barcelona is 81 victories for Madrid, 76 victories for Barcelona, and 39 draws.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ceroacero.es/confronto_equipas.php?op=ver_confronto&equipa_1=40&equipa_2=50 |title=Victory Tracker |publisher=Ceroacero.es |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18[/tpl]
During the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and especially of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.Kleiner-Liebau, Désirée. p. 70[tpl]Cite news|author=Phil Ball |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/apr/21/championsleague.sport |title=The ancient rivalry of Barcelona and Real Madrid|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media |date= 21 April 2002|accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London[/tpl] Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barcelona became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barcelona. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.Spaaij, Ramón. p. 251
On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond– Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom Real Madrid's stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1697027,00.html|title=Barcelona vs. Real Madrid: More Than a Game|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=Time|last=Abend|first=Lisa[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=The Guardian|last=Lowe|first=Sid[/tpl] However, during the war, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.
During the 1950s the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.Burns, Jimmy. pp. 31–34 The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice at the knock-out rounds of the European Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/barcamadrid.html |title=FC Barcelona vs Real Madrid CF since 1902 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=21 August 2010 |author=García, Javier[/tpl] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the "Match of The Century" by Spanish media, and was watched by more than 500 million people.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7773773.stm |title=Real win Champions League showdown |publisher=BBC News |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2010[/tpl]

===El Derbi madrileño===

The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was originally founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of Madrid FC. Further tensions came because initially Real supporters came from the middle class while the Atlético supporters were drawn from the working class. Today these distinctions are largely blurred. They met for the first time on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first League Championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.
The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-final. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Bernabéu while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay which Real  won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.Real have won El Derbi madrileño 75 times.
Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable. A high point coming in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 0–4 victory at Atlético  at the Vicente Calderón Stadium.

==Finances and ownership==

It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players such as Zinédine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.
The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand, and not enough on the performances of the team.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl]
