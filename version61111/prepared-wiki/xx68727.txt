==History==

The original Maple Leaf passenger train was a Grand Trunk Western Railroad service between Chicago, Illinois and Toronto, Ontario.  The service operated between Chicago's Dearborn Station and Toronto's Union Station on a route through Stratford, Ontario, Port Huron, Flint, Lansing, and Battle Creek, Michigan and South Bend, Indiana.  The route between Battle Creek and Port Huron is still served by Amtrak trains 365 and 364 and is called the Blue Water service.
The long-standing Maple Leaf  name was later applied to a joint Lehigh Valley Railroad/Canadian National overnight service between New York City and Toronto, which followed a route through  Geneva, New York and Wilkes-Barre, Allentown, and Bethlehem in eastern Pennsylvania.1946 Lehigh Valley timetable for The Maple Leaf. http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=46013 The last LV/CN Maple Leaf ran on February 4, 1961.
Amtrak and Via Rail introduced the Maple Leaf along the Hudson River and Erie Canal on April 26, 1981. The new Maple Leaf was the first collaboration between the two companies and the first New York-to-Toronto passenger service in a decade. The new train employed Amtrak's Amfleet coaches with a dinette car.   A 1982 consist included a baggage car, two coaches and a dinette; time spent in customs ranged from thirty minutes to two hours.[tpl]cite news | title=New York to Toronto Train | first=Andrew H. | last=Malcolm | publisher=New York Times | date=February 14, 1982 | accessdate=2010-07-26 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/travel/new-york-to-toronto-tra-in.html[/tpl]
In the US an Amtrak crew operates the train whereas in Canada a Via Rail crew is in charge.[tpl]cite news | title=Amtrak's new Toronto-NY line fills 10-year void; may be a winner | publisher=Miami News | date=April 28, 1981 | accessdate=2010-07-26 | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IaglAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wfMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5163,2109370&dq=amtrak+maple-leaf&hl=en[/tpl]  Because of this need for a crew exchange, the Maple Leaf was one of the last Amtrak trains to receive the new GE Genesis locomotive owing to the Via Rail's crews' unfamiliarity with the unit. The Maple Leaf retained the EMD F40PH until Via received its own Genesis locomotives in 2002.[tpl]rp|107[/tpl]

===2013 Terror Plot===

In 2013, the Maple Leaf was the target of a terror plot involving an attempt by two men, both non-citizen residents of Canada, who sought to derail the train as it crossed a bridge over the Twenty Mile Creek near Jordan, Ontario.  The two men were allegedly affiliates of an Al-Qaeda group operating out of Iran.[tpl]cite news|last=Rocha|first=Euan|title=Canada thwarts "al Qaeda-supported" passenger train plot|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE93L0YW20130423?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters Canada|date=22 April 2013|author2=Alastair Sharp[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Macdonald|first=Alaistair|title=Canada Thwarts Alleged Plot to Attack Train|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324235304578438973803805096.html|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=22 April 2012|author2=Siobhan Gorman|author3=David George-Cosh[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.niagarathisweek.com/mobile/news/article/4313523/ |title=Jordan train bridge reportedly target of thwarted terror plot |publisher=Niagarathisweek.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl]

==Route details==

A change of locomotive is made at Albany on select days with P42DC units utilized north of Albany and P32AC-DM units taking over the remainder of the route to Penn Station. The Maple Leaf has previously operated with P32ACDM units directly from Toronto to New York.  Rarely, the P32ACDM may stay on the train to Toronto.  East of the border crossing, the service is shared with Empire Service trains.  Prior to the completion of the Empire Connection in 1991 the Maple Leaf originated at Grand Central Terminal in New York instead of Penn Station.[tpl]cite news |title=Travel Advisory; Grand Central Trains Rerouted To Penn Station |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/travel/travel-advisory-grand-central-trains-rerouted-to-penn-station.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl]
