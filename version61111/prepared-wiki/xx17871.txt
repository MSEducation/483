Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse.

==History==

Tetanus was well known to ancient people who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Notes on tetanus (lockjaw) |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=332 |year=1996 |pmid=8609513 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.60.3.332|pmc=1073859[/tpl] In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a patient with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves.
In 1891, C. tetani was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment. Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.
