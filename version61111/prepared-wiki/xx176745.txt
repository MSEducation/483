[[Bedourie oven]]

CATEGORIES: Cookware and bakeware, Australian cuisine

The Bedourie oven is an Australian adaptation of the camp oven (Dutch oven). Drovers working on Bedourie Station, in western Queensland, found that the heavy cast iron camp ovens they used for cooking would often break as a result of falling from their pack horses. The Bedourie oven was developed in response to this problem.  Made from mild steel, it was lighter and less brittle than cast iron, and would not break if dropped.
