Gordon M. Dineen (born September 21, 1962) is an American professional ice hockey coach. He is a former NHL defenceman.
Although born in Canada, Dineen spent much of his youth in the United States, while his father Bill Dineen played and coached professionally.  He returned to Canada to play major junior hockey for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. He was drafted by the New York Islanders with the forty-second pick in the 1981 draft. His brothers Kevin and Peter were also NHL players.

Dineen, a tough-checking defenceman, made his NHL debut in the 1982–83 season when he played 2 games for the New York Islanders. He played a total of 528 games in his career, for the Islanders, the Minnesota North Stars, Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators, where he was a team captain during the 1993–94 season.
