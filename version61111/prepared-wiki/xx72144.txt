[[Stelzer engine]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed engines

The Stelzer engine is a two-stroke opposing-piston design proposed by Frank Stelzer. It uses conjoined pistons in a push-pull arrangement which allows for fewer moving parts and simplified manufacturing.
An engine of the same design appeared on the cover of the February 1969 issue of Mechanix Illustrated magazine.
