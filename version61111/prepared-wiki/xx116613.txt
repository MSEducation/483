==Story==

In the 1920s, just after World War I, in an Irish village named Kilshannon, Edwina Broome has moved into the neighborhood known as "Widows' Peak," named for the prevalent marital status of the residents, who are a rather exclusive group. The residents are curious about their new neighbor, Edwina, but information is not available about her, including for the leader of the place, Mrs. Doyle Counihan, whose son is busy attempting to attract Edwina. Miss O'Hare and Edwina immediately dislike each other, however, and soon some accidental encounters begin to look like Edwina is trying to ruin her new rival. The problems escalate and the town is in an uproar, but they get no closer to solving the mystery of the newcomer.Ed Sutton, Widows' Peak Summary http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111712/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl

==Production notes==

The film was mainly shot on location in the counties of Wicklow, Dublin and Kilkenny. While it had been intended for Maureen O'Sullivan to play the role of Miss O'Hare, the part went to O'Sullivan's daughter Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan declined the part due to her advanced age and dwindling stamina.
Set in the 1920s, the film's period wardrobe needs were handled by Angels and Bermans as well as Costumi d'Arte and European Costume Company. Consolata Boyle was the costume designer.
The film grossed $6.2 million in U.S. theatrical release.

==Reception==

The film was well received by critics and the public. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, the movie "uses understated humor and fluent, witty speech; it's a delight to listen to, as it gradually reveals how eccentric these apparently respectable people really are."
