Due to lack of funds and general disorganization the team was assembled the last minute. It lacked official documents to travel to Paris, professional uniforms, training and practice.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.kaunodiena.lt/dienrastis/miestas/i-olimpiada-be-kamuolio-105879 |title=Į olimpiadą – be kamuolio |journal=Kauno diena | first=Romas |last=Poderys | volume=321 |issue=28384 |date= 2008-07-26 |issn=1392-7639[/tpl] Hastily assembled men did not have time to play a single game before departing for the Olympics.
