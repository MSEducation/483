==History==

===Holy Family Church===

About 1890, Rev. Father W. Ketcham, the Roman Catholic pastor of Muskogee (then part of Indian Territory), visited Tulsa from time to time to say Mass in a private residence. He and his superior, Rt. Rev. Bishop Meerschaert, obtained permission from the Creek Indian tribal chief to build a church. However, no building was constructed until several years later."Holy Family Church Tulsa, Indian Territory"
Beginning in November 1897, Rev. Charles Van Hulse visited Tulsa (then also part of Indian Territory) once a month to hold Roman Catholic church services in a private residence. At the start of 1899, a subscription drive raised pledges of $1,400 for the purpose of building a church. A contract was let in May, 1899 and the building was dedicated on September 10, 1899.
Rev. Theophilius Van Hulse succeeded his brother in November 1900, and remained in Tulsa until 1906 when he was succeeded by Rev. John G. Heiring, who oversaw plans to expand the church facilities. This included expanding the rectory and the school.

By 1910, the church had outgrown its original capacity. Rev. Heiring turned his attention to building a new complex at the intersection of Eighth and Boulder, the present location."Tulsa Landmarks and Famous Places - Holy Family Cathedral." Accessed September 29, 2010. http://www.bestoftulsa.com/landmarks/holy_family_cathedral.shtml Construction of the sanctuary was completed in only two years with construction of the rectory beginning five years later, in 1919.

===Holy Family School===

The history of Holy Family School is intertwined with that of the church. In 1899, Mother, later Saint, Katharine Drexel, an heiress to the Drexel banking family of Philadelphia, provided funds to construct St. Theresa's Institute, the predecessor of Holy Family School. Initially, this was designated to benefit Indian and African American children of the Oklahoma and Indian Territories. Children of all races were admitted beginning in 1910. When the initial loan was repaid ten years later, the school was renamed Holy Family School.
Three Sisters of Mount Carmel came from New Orleans to teach at the new school. They were replaced in 1902 by Sisters of Divine Providence from San Antonio.
