Lahore Junction railway station was commissioned by the British Government and construction was contracted to Mian Mohammad Sultan Chughtai, a formal prince of the Royal Mughal Empire. The front portion was disliked by the government (as seen in older photographs) and was subsequently rebuilt by Sultan Mohammad. from his own pocket.

Lahore's Hindus and Sikhs who tried to migrate to India were frequently attacked and killed in large numbers that many considered the station unsafe and opted to make the journey by road. At the same time, trains arriving from India were filled with dead bodies of Muslims.
