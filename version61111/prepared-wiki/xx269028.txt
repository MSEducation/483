Artillerigatan is a street in the district of Östermalm in Stockholm, Sweden.

==History==

Artillerigatan was previously divided into three street sections; Löjtnantsgatan in the southern part (around Riddargatan), Artillerigatan (between Riddargatan and Storgatan) and Kvarngatan to the north. In Stockholm's major street name revision project of 1885 Artillerigatan became the name for the entire street.
The name is derived from derives from the large artillery yard and buildings for the Royal Artillery on the west side between Riddargatan and Storgatan. The building currently contains the Swedish Army Museum.

Artillerigatan stretches from the harbour at Nybroviken where it joins Strandvägen in the south, rising across Östermalm to Armfeldtsgatan in the district of Gärdet in the north. The cross streets are, from south to north, Riddargatan, Storgatan, Linnégatan, Kommendörsgatan, Karlavägen,  Östermalmsgatan, Valhallavägen and Strindbergsgatan. The street is about 1.5 kilometers long.

On the next block between Väppargatan and Riddargatan, on the west side are the Hovstallet (Royal Stables 1894) and Music Museum (Musikmuseum) occupying all the block west to Sibyllegatan. North of Riddargatan is the Swedish Army Museum (Armémuseum, see above) and north of it leading up to Storgaten is the Hedvig Eleonora Church (1737).
