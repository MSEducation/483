Cluny or Clugny is a commune in the Saône-et-Loire department of the region of Burgundy, in eastern France. It is 20 km northwest of Mâcon.
The town grew up around the Benedictine Cluny Abbey, founded by Duke William I of Aquitaine in 910. The height of Cluniac influence was from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th.
The abbey was sacked by the Huguenots in 1562, and many of its valuable manuscripts were destroyed or removed.
