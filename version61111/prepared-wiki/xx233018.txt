==Background==

Pink wrote the song at a party hosted at her home, where everyone was drunk or drinking except for her, and she wanted them all to leave. She went to the beach and had a line in her head saying "How do I feel so good sober?". Eventually it had nothing to do with alcohol but with identities. "How do I feel so good with just me, without anyone to lean on?", Pink says in an interview.[tpl]YouTube|id = AwZhHmgGahs|title = P!nk - MTV Choose or Loose[/tpl] and MTV. Retrieved 2008-10-19. She also stated that the song was one of the darkest she wrote for the album. "Sober is a dark, kind of sad song. And it’s about the voices that we choose and I had this idea in my head, ‘Like how do I feel this good sober?...I don’t know it’s just a really, really personal beautiful song, one of my favorites…"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sonybmg.nl/view/en/3498871-P%21nk+is+sober.html |title= Pink is Sober|publisher= Sony BMG Netherlands|language=Dutch|accessdate=2010-07-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100623011902/http://www.sonybmg.nl/view/en/3498871-P!nk+is+sober.html|archivedate=2010-06-23|accessdate=2009-01-25[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

The song received positive reviews. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club stated that it is "a solemn song that slinks along at a slower speed, the better to bear out the grainy range of her voice."

==Music video==

The music video was filmed in the last days of September in Stockholm, Sweden.[ref][tpl]cite web|title=Pink i Sverige|first=Av Therese|last=Hansson|date=2008-10-05|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1323351/pink-i-sverige|publisher="NÖje"|language=Swedish|accessdate=2010-07-02[/tpl]
[/ref] A live video from London has been used in Australia and New Zealand to promote for the song until the official music video was released on November 25. It was directed by Jonas Akerlund. The video starts with views from the city and then a little TV is turned on in Pink's bedroom and Pink appears in white. The song starts, and Pink is shown in the bedroom lying on the bed alone, and a girl is shown walking out of the door of the room. As the first verse starts, Pink is shown sitting on a sofa in a party where her doppelgänger is drunk and flirting with different girls and guys. Pink's doppelgänger is shown in the bathroom, throwing up. Pink enters the bathroom and sits beside her doppelgänger who seemed disturbed and then walks out. Pink is now lying on the bed, her doppelgänger calls her up, but Pink doesn't answer her cell. As the chorus begins, Pink is shown singing on her bed in her bedroom and on the sofa in the party. And then pictures of a white room where Pink is dressed with white outfit and wearing a white pageboy wig are shown. The second verse is sung in the same location. As the chorus starts again, Pink is shown walking in the room where the party was held where everybody is blacked out and drunk, including her doppelgänger. As the song reaches its climax, the bridge kicks off and Pink is shown spanking and making out with her doppelgänger in bed. The scene was cut or replaced by almost all TV channels. Various scenes from the video are then shown and the video ends with one of the Pinks walking out of the door of the bedroom leaving the other Pink alone.
