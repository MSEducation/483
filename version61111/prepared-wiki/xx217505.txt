==Making==

It was produced by DJ Premier.Coleman, Mark (1996-09-19). Review: It Was Written. Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2008-08-01. Album producer Steve Stoute said it was a challenge getting both Premier and Nas in the studio thanks to idiosyncrasies in timetables, so when he did get them together, he left it for ages before returning to the studio, upon which he was so impressed with the results he stole the cassette and put it in his car to listen to it, much to the chagrin of Nas, who promptly rung Premier saying "Where the fuck is my tape?". Stoute then drove back to Queensbridge to return it.

Rolling Stone writer Mark Coleman describes its beat as "a spooky, jazz-fusion groove."
The song features a mistake at the start of the song: "It's like I'm a gun, shit. It's like I'm a motherfucking gun". Tone of the Trackmasters wanted it removed, but it was ultimately decided by Nas that it would be kept on the grounds that people wouldn't understand that the song was in the perspective of a gun.
