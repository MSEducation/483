==Club career==

Gray was born in Lewisham, in south London. He began his football career with Arsenal as a trainee. After a few seasons he made the switch across London to join Crystal Palace for £500,000 in 2000. He is an attacking left winger, can also play as an auxiliary striker, and has learnt full back duties so he can help out in defence. Following his move to Palace Gray was instrumental in The Eagles' success and played a major part in helping them achieve promotion in the 2003–04 season,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] despite missing the play-off final through suspension. In addition to his successes during that season he spent a month on loan with Cardiff City. One of Gray's most memorable games for Palace was when he scored as Palace surprisingly knocked Liverpool out of the 2002–03 FA Cup at Anfield.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2708843.stm |title=Palace stun Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2003 |accessdate=27 October 2009[/tpl]
Gray's contract expired in June 2004, allowing him to sign for Birmingham City on a free transfer. He played a number of games in his first season in the Midlands and remained a key part of manager Steve Bruce's plans up until the 2005–06 season, but found himself out of the first team after the Blues' promotion, and was released in May 2007.
