Nevado (1813? – 1821) was a Mucuchies dog that was given to Simón Bolívar by the local people of Mucuchíes, Mérida, in the Venezuelan Andes. It was given as a kind of present shortly after the Battle of Niquitao during his triumphal Admirable Campaign from New Granada (today Colombia) to Caracas in 1813.Rem Sapozhnikov, "Merida state - hideout from stresses of civilisation", 2007.

When Bolívar received news that Nevado was badly injured, he rushed to the dog, but he came too late.
