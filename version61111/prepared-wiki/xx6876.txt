According to the panspermia hypothesis, microscopic life exists throughout the Universe, and is distributed by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids.Rampelotto, P. H. (2010).

The meaning of life—its significance, origin, purpose, and ultimate fate—is a central concept and question in philosophy and religion. Both philosophy and religion have offered interpretations as to how life relates to existence and consciousness, and on related issues such as life stance, purpose, conception of a god or gods, a soul or an afterlife. Different cultures throughout history have had widely varying approaches to these issues.

==Early theories==

===Materialism===

Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. Empedocles (430 BC) argued that every thing in the universe is made up of a combination of four eternal "elements" or "roots of all": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.[ref]

Democritus (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a soul (psyche). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a living thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.[tpl]cite web | first1=Richard | last1=Parry | date=August 25, 2010 | title=Democritus | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#4 | accessdate=2012-05-25 [/tpl]
[tpl]quote|Plato's world of eternal and unchanging Forms, imperfectly represented in matter by a divine Artisan, contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic Weltanschauungen, of which atomism was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent... This debate persisted throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from Epicurus... while the Stoics adopted a divine teleology... The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system.[tpl]cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125[/tpl]|R. J. Hankinson|Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought[/tpl]
The mechanistic materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher René Descartes, who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in cell theory in biological science encouraged this view. The evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of natural selection.[tpl]cite book | first1=Paul | last1=Thagard | title=The Cognitive Science of Science: Explanation, Discovery, and Conceptual Change | publisher=MIT Press | year=2012 | isbn=0262017288 | pages=204–205 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&pg=PA204 [/tpl]

===Hylomorphism===

Hylomorphism is a theory (originating with Aristotle (322 BC)) that all things are a combination of matter and form.  Biology was one of his main interests, and there is extensive biological material in his extant writings. In this view, all things in the material universe have both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its soul (Greek psyche, Latin anima). There are three kinds of souls: the vegetative soul of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the animal soul, which causes animals to move and feel; and the rational soul, which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.Aristotle, De Anima, Book II Each higher soul has all the attributes of the lower one. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.[tpl]cite book | first1=Don | last1=Marietta | page=104 | title=Introduction to ancient philosophy | publisher=M.

This account is consistent with teleological explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past evolutionary history of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.[tpl]Cite book | first1=Steve | last1=Stewart-Williams | year=2010 | title=Darwin, God and the meaning of life: how evolutionary theory undermines everything you thought you knew of life | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0521762782 | pages=193–194 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&pg=PA193 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl]

===Vitalism===

Vitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with Stahl (17th century), and held sway until the middle of the 19th century. It appealed to philosophers such as Henri Bergson, Nietzsche, Wilhelm Dilthey,[tpl]cite book | first1=Sanford | last1=Schwartz | title=C. S. Lewis on the Final Frontier: Science and the Supernatural in the Space Trilogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | isbn=0199888396 | page=56 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4hQLdPtJe9EC&pg=PA56 [/tpl] anatomists like Bichat, and chemists like Liebig.[tpl]cite journal | first1=Ian | last1=Wilkinson | title=History of Clinical Chemistry – Wöhler & the Birth of Clinical Chemistry | journal=The Journal of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine | volume=13 | issue=4 | year=1998 | url=http://ifcc.nassaro.com/index.asp?cat=Publications&scat=eJIFCC_&suba=Vol_13_No_4&subx=History_of_Clinical_Chemistry_W%C3%B6hler_and_the_Birth_of_Clinical_Chemistry_&zip=1&dove=1&zona=full&numero=&aq=1 | accessdate=0212-06-12 [/tpl] Vitalism included the idea that there was a fundamental difference between organic and inorganic material, and the belief that organic material can only be derived from living things. This was disproved in 1828, when Friedrich Wöhler prepared urea from inorganic materials.[ref]
