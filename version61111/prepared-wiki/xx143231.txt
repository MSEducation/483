[[How to Get Everything You Ever Wanted in Ten Easy Steps]]

CATEGORIES: The Ordinary Boys albums, 2006 albums

How to Get Everything You Ever Wanted in Ten Easy Steps is the third album by English indie band The Ordinary Boys, released following on from lead singer Preston's appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in January 2006. It was released on 23 October 2006 in the UK. It signified a transition in the band's sound from ska-inspired British indie to a more pop and disco one. The hit single "Boys Will Be Boys" is included as a bonus track.  This song also featured on the band's second album, Brassbound, but was a success long after the release of the previous album. The band put all of the songs from the album on their myspace page for fans to listen to. The album has been billed by the band as their best album and the one which they are most proud of, but response critics and most importantly from fans and the general public were mixed and lukewarm.
The album charted at #15, with the then current single "Lonely at the Top" dropping from 10 to 31 on album release week. After this the album left the top 75 after three weeks in the chart. It did re-enter after the release of "I Luv U", but the last reported sales figures claimed that the album is their least successful sales-wise.
