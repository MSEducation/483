"Chest Fever" is a song recorded by The Band on its 1968 debut, Music from Big Pink. It is, according to Peter Viney, a historian of the group, “the Big Pink track that has appeared on most subsequent live albums and compilations,” second only to The Weight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/chest_fever_viney.html |title=Peter Viney on "Chest Fever" |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl]
The music for the piece was written by Robbie Robertson, guitarist and vocalist. Total authorship is typically credited solely to Robertson, although the lyrics, according to Levon Helm, were originally improvised by Levon Helm and Richard Manuel, telling the story of a man who becomes sick when he is spurned by the woman he loves.Levon Helm and Stephen Davis.

Robertson has since said the lyrics were nonsensical, used only while the instrumental tracks were recorded. "I'm not sure that I know the words to 'Chest Fever'; I'm not even so sure there are words to 'Chest Fever'." He has also stated the entirety of the song does not make sense.
At the Woodstock Festival in 1969, The Band performed on the final day, between Ten Years After and Blood, Sweat, and Tears. They opened the set with "Chest Fever".
The song featured a dramatic solo organ intro played by Garth Hudson.  Writing in the 3rd edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Paul Evans stated that "The organ mastery of 'Chest Fever' unleashed the Band's secret weapon, Garth Hudson."[tpl]cite book|title=The Rolling Stone Album Guide|edition=3rd|author=Evans, P.|editor=DeCurtis, A., Henke, J. & George-Warren, H.|pages=18-19|year=1992|publisher=Straight Arrow Publications|isbn=0679737294[/tpl]   The introduction is based on Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. In live performances, this solo evolved into an improvisation drawing from numerous musical styles and lasting several minutes. "When Levon Helm has complained about the share out of royalties at this period, this is the song he quotes," states Viney. "His theme is that Garth's contribution was always grossly under-estimated and under-credited. As he says, 'what do you remember about 'Chest Fever' - the lyrics or the organ part?'"[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

==Later performances==

Viney notes that, despite the death of Richard Manuel later line ups of The Band continued to perform "Chest Fever" with Helm singing lead vocals. It "rapidly became an on-stage showpiece for Garth's organ", and as such it was an essential song. The intro was a improvisation piece called "The Genetic Method".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
He says the definitive recordings of the song can be found on  "Live in Washinton," (sic) an Italian bootleg of the group’s 1976 King Biscuit Flower Hour performance, or the version on The Complete Last Waltz.
The song has been covered numerous times by bands including Three Dog Night, Sugarloaf and, most recently, the rootsy jam bands Widespread Panic and Tishamingo. It has also been covered by John Mayer during his Battle Studies tour.
