==History==

Bosnia and Herzegovina once was a part of Yugoslavia. While the international prefix for Yugoslavia was +38, places in Bosnia and Herzegovina were assigned phonecodes (and postcodes) beginning with 7 and 8. If the phonecode of a city was 0xx, the appropriate postcode was xx000. These postcodes are still valid, at least in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Note: the codes listed below are now all obsolete. However, they are still used at times to identify places in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly 071 (Sarajevo), 078 (Banja Luka) and 075 (Tuzla).
