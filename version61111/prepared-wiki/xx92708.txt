==Setting==

Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is set in the year 2279. The territory of the Galactic Alliance,
spanning several galaxies, is the primary setting for the game. The Galactic Alliance is made up
of twelve races (including Humans), and is run behind the scenes by huge mega-corporations seeking
to exploit the farthest reaches of space.
Player characters usually assume the role of Battlelords, mercenaries employed by the corporations to
further their business by any means, legal or otherwise. They face various challenges, including rival
mercenaries, Rebels, hostile alien lifeforms on unexplored worlds, and the alien race known as the Arachnids.

==System==

===Character Statistics and Skills===

Each character has eight Vital Statistics scores and four Secondary Statistics scores. These are significantly influenced
by the character's race. There are no character classes or character levels in Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century; the system is skill-based, with skills being increased with experience earned. Some races have matrix abilities (psionics) which can also be advanced with character experience, while other races are more suited for physical combat or other occupations.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ssdc.com/Catalog/Battlelords.php| title=Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century| publisher=SSDC, Inc.| accessdate=2006-10-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061114023100/http://www.ssdc.com/Catalog/Battlelords.php| archivedate= 14 November 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Growing Up===

Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century features a detailed character generation process that not only encompasses the eight Vital Statistics and four Secondary Statistics, which are generated using d100 (percentile) dice, but allows for determining events from the characters past.  These are a mix of good and bad; granting a character several thousand credits worth of equipment or horribly maiming them.  They are featured in several tables including a racial specific table and a job specific table which is chosen by the player.

===Combat===

Combat is resolved through the use of d100 attack rolls and detailed hit location tables; futuristic armor systems and massive critical hits feature prominently. Actions are resolved in half actions (1 second each) and full actions (3 seconds each).  Each character can perform two half actions or one full action in a 3-second round.  These include but are not limited to; aiming, firing a single round, swinging a sword, dying quickly, diving for cover, running, and dying with a lengthy speech.

===Other system features===

As of 2007, the system does not feature rules for space combat. These rules are planned for forthcoming supplements.
Vehicle rules were added to the system with the publication of Engines of War in 2007.
