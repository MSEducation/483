The nearby beach, known as Slapton Sands, was in 1944 part of the site of the ill-fated Exercise Tiger. A Sherman tank that was sunk in this action has been recovered and now stands on the road behind the beach at nearby Torcross. Part of Exercise Fabius took place a week after Exercise Tiger on Slapton Sands. The beach itself is not sand, but consists of small smooth pebbles ranging in size from ¼ inch to several inches.

==Geography and environmental importance==

Behind Slapton Sands is Slapton Ley, a nature reserve and good example of serial or ecological succession — the process whereby open water becomes reed bed and eventually, as silt and leaf litter builds up, woodland. The beach itself is a good example of a bar: the material that makes up the beach was pushed up by the rising sea levels during the Flandrian transgression after the last glacial period (from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago). A similar process formed Chesil Beach. Beaches formed like this are reworked by coastal processes now but are not supplied by enough material to recreate them, should material be removed. This had terrible consequences nearby at Hallsands where most of the beach was removed as building material for Devonport dockyards, leaving the village exposed to storms.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] It was struck by a storm in 1917 and most of the village was washed away although no villagers were killed.
Further north, the beach is known as Strete Sands and at the northernmost end is Pilchard Cove which is regarded by some as one of the most attractive nudist beaches in England.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
The southern end of the beach is known as Torcross Sands.
