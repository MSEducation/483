Charles Proteus Steinmetz (April 9, 1865 – October 26, 1923) was a mathematician and electrical engineer. He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry.[tpl]cite conference|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/139.html|website=Invent Now, Inc.

Steinmetz suffered from dwarfism, hunchback, and hip dysplasia, as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes Gymnasium and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in mathematics and physics.

==Early socialist==

Following the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the University of Breslau to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a socialist university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.
As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to Zürich in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to Charles in order to sound more American and chose the middle name Proteus after a childhood taunt given to him by classmates. Proteus was a wise hunchbacked character from the Odyssey who knew many secrets and he felt it suited him.
Cornell University Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist, contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as the fact that he was in arrears with his tuition at the University of Breslau and that life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters was full of tension.
Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by  1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the U.S. because the country lacked a "powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office" and because "only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today."

==Engineering wizard==

Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of alternating current (AC) systems theory: hysteresis, steady-state analysis, and transients.

===AC steady state circuit theory===

Steinmetz's work revolutionized AC circuit theory and analysis, which had been carried out using complex, time-consuming calculus-based methods. By  1893, Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to "a simple problem of algebra". He was the first to use complex number phasor representation, whereby the letter j is used to designate the 90 degree rotation operator in AC system analysis. 
In July 1898 he published the breaking article "Complex-Quantities-and-Their-Use-in-Electrical-Engineering" based on his findings in 1893. His seminal books and many American Institute of Electrical Engineers papers "taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena.[tpl]cite web|title=Steinmetz, Putting it in Perspective - R, L, and C Elements and the Impedance Concept|url=http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|publisher=Zabreb School of Engineering|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]

===AC transient theory===

Steinmetz also made greater strides to the understanding of lightning phenomena.  He undertook a systematic study of it, resulting in experiments of man-made lightning in the laboratory; this work was published. Steinmetz was called the "forger of thunderbolts", being the first to create artificial lightning in his football field-sized laboratory and high towers built at General Electric, using 120,000 volt generators. He erected a lightning tower to attract lightning and studied the patterns and effects of lightning resulting in several theories and ideas.

==Professional and personal aspects==

Steinmetz served as president of the Board of Education of Schenectady, and as president of the Schenectady City Council. He was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) from 1901 to 1902,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz |title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz |author= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl] as well as the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME)—which later became the International Municipal Signal Association (IMSA)—from 1913 until his death. Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not all about engineering. He was an honorary member and advisor to the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta at Union (whose chapter house there was one of the first electrified houses ever).
Steinmetz was an agnostic.[tpl]cite book|title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz: A biography|year=1924|publisher=The Century & Co.|first=John Winthrop |last=Hammond|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=447[/tpl][tpl]efn|Quoting from Hammond, "This has placed him before the public as an atheist.* The title he did not deny. The writer, however, would put him down as a confirmed agnostic, for an atheist is a person who knows there is no God, and Steinmetz was not of that..."[/tpl]
Steinmetz died on October 26, 1923 and was buried in Vale Cemetery, Schenectady.

==Legacy==

One of the highest technical awards given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, for major contributions to standardization within the field of electrical and electronics engineering, is named in his honor as the IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award.
His connection to Union College is celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium,[tpl]cite web|title=Union College Steinmetz Symposium|url=http://www.union.edu/academic/beyond/research/steinmetz/[/tpl]  a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the Union College computer center, is named after him.
Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the actor Rod Steiger in the CBS anthology series, The Joseph Cotten Show. The episode centered on his socialist activities in Germany.
A Chicago Public High School is named for him.
A public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.[tpl]cite web|last=Steinmetz Park Association (2006)|title=Steinmetz Park Master Plan|url=http://www.cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf|accessdate=January 22, 2013|location=Schenectady, N.Y.|page=3[/tpl]

==Patents==

At the time of his death, Steinmetz held over 200 patents:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.becklaser.de/hbeng/steinmetz.html|title=C. P. Steinmetz|publisher=Becklaser[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

Steinmetz is featured in John Dos Passos's USA Trilogy in one of the biographies.The 42nd Parallel, p. 335.
He also serves as a major character in Starling Lawrence's The Lightning Keeper.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/books/13star.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Starling Lawrence Writes a Novel About the Early Days of G.E | first=Dinitia | last=Smith | date=May 13, 2006[/tpl]
In the animated television show The Simpsons, his name was used as a kind of expletive by the industrialist character Mr. Burns ("Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz!") in reference to someone who was overthinking a decision.[tpl]cite web|last=Crittenden|first=Jennifer|title=Scenes from the Class Struggle in Sprinfield|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F11.html|year=1996[/tpl]
Novelist John Ball grew up in Steinmetz's house. His parents were graduate students paid by GE to live with and take care of the man Ball called "Uncle Steinie". Ball used to tell Steinmetz stories to the Southern California Mystery Writers Association meetings.
