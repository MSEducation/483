The Monkwearmouth railway bridge (also Sunderland railway bridge or Wearmouth railway bridge) is a rail bridge built 1879 crossing the River Wear at Sunderland and Monkwearmouth. The bridge lies adjacent to and upstream of the Wearmouth road bridge.
Originally built as part of the Monwearmouth Junction line, it provided the first direct railway link between Newcastle and Sunderland. As of 2012 the bridge remains in use and is used by Tyne and Wear Metro and Durham Coast Line services.

==History and design==

The bridge was built as part of the infrastructure for the Monwearmouth Junction line, opened 1879; a connecting line across the wear built to connect the line of the former Brandling Junction Railway at Monkwearmouth to the south bank at Sunderland and the line of the former Durham and Sunderland Railway.[tpl]citation| url = http://archive.org/details/northeasternrail00tomlrich| title = The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development| first  =W.W.| last = Tomlinson|authorlink = William Weaver Tomlinson| year= 1915|publisher = Andrew Reid and Company, Newcastle; Longmans, Green and Company, London| page = 685[/tpl][tpl]citation| url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bv2BrOMo8cIC | title = Civil Engineering Heritage: Northern England|first =Robert William|last = Rennison| publisher = Thomas Telford Publishing| year = 1996|edition =2|isbn = 07277 2518 1|page = 65[/tpl] 
The bridge was designed by T.E. Harrison: it consisted of a [tpl]convert|300|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] main span, an iron bowstring bridge, constructed from box girders connected by a  Vierendeel truss with curved corner strengthening to create elliptical voids in the bracing. The iron bridge was supported [tpl]convert|86|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above high water level on the Wear. At either end of the bridge were three [tpl]convert|25|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] span masonry arches. Hawks Crawshay and Sons built the ironwork, John Waddell was contractor for the stonework. At the time of its construction it was claimed to be the largest hogsback iron bridge in the world.[tpl]citation| url  =http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1207051&| title = MONKWEARMOUTH RAILWAY BRIDGE OVER RIVER WEAR WITH VIADUCT TO NORTH| work = list.english-heritage.org.uk| publisher = English Heritage[/tpl]
The structure was grade II listed in 1978, planning consent was required for alterations to the structure circa 2000 for works relating to Metro construction: for the installation of overhead line electrification;[ref]Sources:

===Use===

The bridge and railway allowed trains to run directly from Newcastle to Hartlepool, by creating a through line from Newcastle to Sunderland.
Since 2002 the bridge has also carried the Tyne and Wear Metro. It is part of the modern (2012) Durham Coast Line.[tpl]citation| url = http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/sunrail.html| title = SUNDERLAND RAILWAY BRIDGE| work = www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk|accessdate = October 2012[/tpl]
