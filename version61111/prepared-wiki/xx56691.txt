Husaby, near Kinnekulle, is a village belonging to Götene Municipality in the province of Västergötland, Sweden. It is most known for the old stone church Husaby Church. Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian king of Sweden, is rumoured to have allowed himself to be baptised at a well by the church in 1008.
During the 11th century, it was a wooden church. The tower was built in the late 11th century, and in the early 12th century the stone church.  Architecturally, it is remarkable for its steep walls and high towers, arguably the only Romanesque architecture in Sweden of that kind.
The church belonged to a network of royal estates called Uppsala öd.
