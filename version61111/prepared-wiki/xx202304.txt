==Early days==

Charles W. Gwynn passed through this town while he was reconnoitering the Ethiopian-Sudan border in March 1900. There he found "a young Egyptian officer in charge of a small Government post, but he apparently had had no communications with anyone since the river Sobat had fallen, and was anxiously awaiting its rise in hopes of a steamer to replenish his stores."Gwynn, "The Frontiers of Abyssinia: A Retrospect", Journal of the Royal African Society, 36 (1937),  p. 157

==Civil war==

SPLA-Nasir, a splinter faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Army active from 1991 to 1994, derived their name from the town because it was their base.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
