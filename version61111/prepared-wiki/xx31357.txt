James Montgomery "Jimmy" Doohan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|ə|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|DOO|ən[/tpl]; March 3, 1920 – July 20, 2005) was a Canadian character and voice actor best known for his role as Montgomery "Scotty" Scott in the television and film series Star Trek. Doohan's characterization of the Scottish Chief Engineer of the Starship Enterprise was one of the most recognizable elements in the Star Trek franchise, for which he also made several contributions behind the scenes. Many of the characterizations, mannerisms, and expressions that he established for Scotty and other Star Trek characters have become entrenched in popular culture.
Following his success with Star Trek, he supplemented his income and showed continued support for his fans by making numerous public appearances. Doohan inspired fans to pursue careers in engineering and other fields, as a result of his portrayal of Scotty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1493093.stm|title=Obituary: James Doohan|publisher=BBC News|date=July 20, 2005|accessdate=April 29, 2007[/tpl]

==Early life==

Doohan was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. His father was a pharmacist, veterinarian, and dentist; his mother was a homemaker.James Doohan profile at Film Reference.com Doohan's father reportedly invented an early form of high-octane gasoline in 1923. Doohan's 1996 autobiography recounted his father's serious alcoholism. The family moved to Sarnia, Ontario, and Doohan attended high school at the Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School (SCITS), where he excelled in mathematics and science. He enrolled in the 102nd Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps in 1938.[tpl]cite web|title=#102 Cadet Corps|url=http://www.armycadethistory.com/Cadet%20Corps%20DB/db_cc_102.htm|work=The Official History Website of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets|publisher=Army Cadet League of Canada|accessdate=May 15, 2013|quote=C/Maj James Doohan (1938-40)[/tpl]

==Military service==

At the beginning of the Second World War, Doohan joined the Royal Canadian Artillery.[tpl]cite web|last=Enk|first=Bryan|title=Real Life Tough Guys|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/photos/real-life-tough-guys-1374864278-slideshow/afi-life-achievement-award-a-tribute-to-mel-brooks-awards-presentation-photo-1374864255359.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 13th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. Doohan went to England in 1940 for training. His first combat was the invasion of Normandy at Juno Beach on D-Day. Shooting two snipers, Doohan led his men to higher ground through a field of anti-tank mines, where they took defensive positions for the night. Crossing between command posts at 11:30 that night, Doohan was hit by six rounds fired from a Bren gun by a nervous Canadian sentry:[tpl]cite book|last=Graves|first=Donald E.|title=Century of Service|year=2005|page=244|publisher=Midpoint Trade Books Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-896941-43-5[/tpl] four in his leg, one in the chest, and one through his right middle finger. The bullet to his chest was stopped by a silver cigarette case. His right middle finger had to be amputated, something he would conceal during his career as an actor.Despite his efforts, the injured hand can be seen in several Star Trek episodes: "The Trouble With Tribbles", "Tomorrow Is Yesterday", "The Enemy Within", "The Ultimate Computer" and "Catspaw", as well as in The Search for Spock when giving parts from the USS Excelsior to Dr. Leonard McCoy, in The Final Frontier when Nyota Uhura brings him dinner on the bridge of the USS Enterprise-A, and in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Relics", when the missing finger is clearly apparent as Scotty offers Captain Jean-Luc Picard a drink while on a re-creation of the original Enterprise bridge.
Doohan trained as a pilot (graduating from Air Observation Pilot Course 40 with 11 other Canadian artillery officers),[tpl]cite book|last=Knight|first=Darrell|title=Artillery Flyers at War|year=2010|page=482|publisher=Merriam Press|location=Bennington|isbn=978-0-557-32964-9[/tpl] and flew Taylorcraft Auster Mark V aircraft for 666 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, as a Royal Canadian Artillery officer in support of 1st Army Group Royal Canadian Artillery. All three Canadian (AOP) RCAF Squadrons were manned by Artillery Officer-pilots and accompanied by non-commissioned RCA and RCAF personnel serving as observers.[tpl]cite book|title=Battle History 666|year=2006|publisher=Abel Book Company|location=Calgary|isbn=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Fromow|first=D.

Although never actually a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doohan was once labelled the "craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Force". A story from his flying years tells of Doohan slaloming a plane—variously cited as a Hurricane or a jet trainer—between mountainside telegraph poles to prove it could be done, which earned him a serious reprimand. (The actual feat was performed in a Mark IV Auster on Salisbury Plain north of RAF Andover in the late spring of 1945).[tpl]cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen E.|title=The Making of Star Trek|year=1968|page=245|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-24691-8[/tpl][tpl]r|upi19690421[/tpl]

==Early acting career==

After the war, Doohan moved to London, Ontario for further technical education. After hearing a radio drama that he knew  he could do better, he recorded his voice at the local radio station, and learned about a drama school in Toronto. There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City,[tpl]cite journal|last=Koolstra|first=Jeffrey D.|title=An Interview with James "Scotty" Doohan|journal=Infinite Energy|date=July–Aug 1999|issue=26|url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue26/scotty.html|accessdate=May 15, 2013[/tpl] where classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall, and Richard Boone.
In 1946 he had several roles for CBC radio,[tpl]cite web |title=James Doohan: Giving it all he's got - CBC 75th Anniversary |url=http://www.cbc.ca/75/2011/07/james-doohan-giving-it-all-hes-got.html |date=July 13, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=May 15, 2013[/tpl] starting January 12. For several years Doohan would shuttle between Toronto and New York as work demanded. He estimated he performed in over 4,000 radio programs and 450 television programs during this period, and earned a reputation for his versatility.[tpl]cite web|title=Star Trek Doohan, James|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/doohan|work=Star Trek.com|publisher=CBS Studios Inc.[/tpl]
In the mid-1950s he appeared as forest ranger Timber Tom (the northern counterpart of Buffalo Bob) in the Canadian version of Howdy Doody. Coincidentally, fellow Star Trek cast member William Shatner appeared simultaneously as Ranger Bill in the American version. Doohan and Shatner both appeared in the 1950s Canadian science fiction series Space Command. Doohan also appeared in several episodes of Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans 1957-58.
For GM Presents, he played the lead role in the 1956 CBC TV drama Flight into Danger, then in 1960 "The Night they Killed Joe Howe".[tpl]cite news|title=Joseph Howe Subject of Show|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19601001&id=s4wtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HJ0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6786,138915|newspaper=The Gazette|date=October 1, 1960|page=26[/tpl] (Arthur Hailey rewrote the former into the novel Runway Zero-Eight, then adapted to Terror in the Sky.)
His credits included The Twilight Zone, GE True, Hazel, The Outer Limits, Bewitched, Fantasy Island, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964) and Bonanza. In the Bonanza episode, "Gift of Water" (1962), he co-starred with actress Majel Barrett, Star Trek's Nurse Chapel. He was an assistant to the United States president in two episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He had an uncredited role in The Satan Bug (1965).  The movie "Man in the Wilderness" was filmed in Spain with Richard Harris in 1971.

==Star Trek==

Doohan developed a talent for accents as a child.[tpl]r|upi19690421[/tpl] Auditioning for the role of Chief Engineer of the USS Enterprise, before Gene Roddenberry (the creator of Star Trek), Doohan did several different accents. Roddenberry asked which he preferred, and Doohan replied "Well, if you want an engineer, he better be a Scotsman because, in my experience, all the world's best engineers have been Scottish".[tpl]cite news |title=`SCOTTY' HAS ACCENTED VERSATILE ACTOR'S CAREER |author=Scott D. Pierce |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/285993/SCOTTY-HAS-ACCENTED-VERSATILE-ACTORS-CAREER.html?pg=all |newspaper=Deseret News |date=April 16, 1993 |accessdate=May 15, 2013[/tpl] He chose the name "Montgomery Scott" after his grandfather.
In later years Doohan would revisit this casting process at Star Trek conventions, demonstrating a variety of possible voices and characters.  When Roddenberry produced Star Trek: The Animated Series in the early 1970s, Doohan's ability to perform different voices was used by having him perform most "guest star" male roles in the series, including Robert April, which the show cited as the Enterprise's first captain. Doohan was the alien navigator Lieutenant Arex,[tpl]cite web|title=Behind The Voice Actors - James Doohan|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/James-Doohan/|accessdate=May 15, 2013|work=Behind The Voice Actors[/tpl] and did seven different voices for a record episode.[tpl]cite web|title=James Doohan|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/729/000025654/|accessdate=May 15, 2013|work=NNDB|publisher=Soylent Communications[/tpl]
The Scott character, as conceived, would have been a semi-regular, but with fellow cast members Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy), was elevated in importance to leads alongside William Shatner's Captain James T. Kirk. It was made clear that, owing to his high technological orientation, Lt. Cmdr. Scott was the third-in-command of the Enterprise, and at times the ship was left in his care. Scott was frequently used in subplots regarding disabled ship components (such as the dilithium crystals which regulated the warp drive, the transporter teleportation device, or just fiddling in the Jefferies tubes) and as a foil for Kirk's ambitious tactical approaches, which were said to strain the propulsion and/or defenses of the starship ("I cannae push it any faster, Captain!" or "I cannae guarantee that she'll hold up!"). In this capacity, Scott proved to be as much of a tinkerer, or improvisational engineer, as a high-tech specialist, often apparently holding the Enterprise together with little more than baling wire and his own spittle. In the end, many fans saw the Enterprise itself as the show's star, leaving Scott in an enviable position as her defender. For example, in "The Trouble With Tribbles", Scott stands idly by and even keeps Chekov from starting any trouble as a Klingon insults Kirk; however, Scott is finally provoked into violence when the Klingon insults the Enterprise herself.
Doohan was quoted as saying, "Scotty is ninety-nine percent James Doohan and one percent accent."[tpl]cite web|title=James Doohan - Interview|url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/Interview/03-05-20_JamesDoohan.htm|accessdate=May 15, 2013|work=Sci-fi Online[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Dillard|first=J.M.|title=Star Trek: Where no-one has gone before|date=April 1996|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0671002060|page=17|url=http://books.google.ca/books?ei=_beTUYb7OIfKrQH1g4GABg&id=Eh2p_Dm7cH8C&dq=star+trek%3A+where&q=percent#search_anchor|edition=Second Revised|coauthors=Susan Sackett|accessdate=May 15, 2013|quote="The character is ninety-nine percent James Doohan and one percent accent"[/tpl]  Using his considerable vocal skills, Doohan devised the Vulcan and Klingon language dialogue heard in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Later, professional linguists, particularly Marc Okrand, expanded Klingon into a fully constructed language with a working grammar. In addition to playing Scotty, he also did many guest voices on Star Trek including:

==After Star Trek==

Doohan hoped that Star Trek would benefit his acting career.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3a8iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FrMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4120,5103972|title='Star Trek' Ace Is Former Pilot|agency=United Press International|newspaper=Beaver County Times|date=April 21, 1969|accessdate=May 6, 2011|location=Beaver, Pennsylvania|pages=B12[/tpl] After the series ended, however, he found himself typecast and had a hard time getting other roles. After his dentist reminded him he would "always be Scotty", he supported his family with income from personal appearances.[tpl]cite news|title=Actor James Doohan, 85; Played Scotty on 'Star Trek'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/20/AR2005072002406.html|accessdate=May 15, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 21, 2005|agency=Associated Press[/tpl]
Unlike some other members of the cast, Doohan relished meeting fans and was always ready to entertain with a story or a song. Most parts depended on his Trek fame and engineer reputation. He was Captain in the short-lived Saturday morning live-action kids' show, Jason of Star Command, and had a cameo in the made-for-TV movie Knight Rider 2000 as "Jimmy Doohan, the guy who played Scotty on Star Trek". In the TV series Homeboys in Outer Space, he was Pippen, a pun on Scotty and basketball star Scottie Pippen.
Other parts were not as plentiful. He was himself in an episode of The Ben Stiller Show. He played Damon Warwick, father of James Warwick, on the daytime soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful.[tpl]cite web|title=Ian on 'The Bold and the Beautiful'|url=http://ianonline.stormpages.com/bbian.htm|accessdate=May 15, 2013|quote=James Doohan... guest-starred for several appearances as James` dad Damon|work=Ian Buchanan ONLINE[/tpl] After knowing about cold fusion since 1989 from technical journals, he narrated for the video "Cold Fusion: Fire From Water", about the physics behind cold fusion. His last role was Clive Chives in the 1999 British film The Duke.
When the Star Trek franchise was revived, Doohan reprised his role of Scotty in seven Star Trek films and made a guest appearance on Star Trek: The Next Generation's 130th episode "Relics". Many of Doohan's film appearances did centre on the role of Scotty, such as a cameo in National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, where he plays a policeman who tells his superior officer "I am giving it all she has got, Captain!" in the same accent he used in Star Trek. However, he refused to contribute to the Futurama episode "Where No Fan Has Gone Before" or allow his image to be used in it, and was "replaced" in the episode by the created character "Welshie" who was ultimately given the redshirt treatment.
Although he continued to work with William Shatner in the Star Trek movies, in private life Doohan didn't care for him, and was once quoted as saying, "I like Captain Kirk, but I can't say that I'm very fond of Bill", declining to be interviewed by Shatner for Shatner's first Star Trek: Memories book about the show. However, Doohan consented to be interviewed for William Shatner's second book, Star Trek: Movie Memories.Shatner, William, Star Trek: Movie Memories.

==Inspiration==

Many fans told Doohan over the years that it was he who inspired them to choose engineering as a profession. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, an engineer before he participated in NASA's Apollo program, personally told Doohan on stage at Doohan's last public appearance, "From one old engineer to another, thanks, mate."[tpl]cite web|title=R.I.P. James Doohan 1920-2005|url=http://soulofstartrek.blogspot.com/2005/07/r.html|work=Soul of Star Trek|date=July 20, 2005[/tpl] In a later interview, this time for the first Trekkies film, Doohan related the story of a young fan who was contemplating suicide; Doohan says that he convinced her to attend his next convention appearance, and later found out that his encouragement and kind words had not only saved her life, but also inspired her to go back to school and become an electronics engineer.Doohan tells the anecdote in the 1997 documentary Trekkies, directed by Roger Nygard

==Death==

Doohan suffered from Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary fibrosis in later life. In 2004 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3873045.stm|title=Star Trek Scotty has Alzheimer's|publisher=BBC News|date=July 7, 2004|accessdate=February 6, 2007[/tpl]
On July 20, 2005, at 5:30 in the morning, Doohan died at his home in Redmond, Washington.

==Legacy==

Scotty's exploits as the redoubtable Chief Engineer aboard the Enterprise inspired many students to pursue a career in engineering. Because of this, the Milwaukee School of Engineering granted Doohan an honorary degree in engineering.[tpl]cite video|people=James Doohan|title=James Doohan on engineering students|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqedcvB8MKw[/tpl] He was immortalized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 31, 2004.

==Personal life==

Doohan was married three times. He had five children{–}Larkin, Deirdre, twins Christopher and Montgomery{–}with first wife Janet Young before a 1964 divorce. His marriage to Anita Yagel from 1967 to 1972 produced no children. In early 1974, he was introduced to 17-year-old fan Wende Braunberger at a theatre performance, later marrying that same year when she was 18 and he 54, on October 12, 1974.
