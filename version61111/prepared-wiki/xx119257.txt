Julius Exter, fully Julius Leopold Bernhard Exter (September 20, 1863, Ludwigshafen am Rhein – October 16, 1939, Übersee am Chiemsee) was a German avant-garde painter whose techniques were close to the Der Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) school of artists and who became known as the 'prince of colours' for his lively expressionism style. He was an active member of the Munich Secession movement founded in 1892.
Some of his paintings (e.g. Woman with boat) reflect scenes of the Bavarian Chiemsee area where he resided in Übersee-Feldwies and opened a painting school. His work is exhibited in the Augustian Monastery on Herrenchiemsee, accessible from nearby Prien. Karl Friedrich Lippmann studied at Julius Exter school.
