Alexander Ivanovich Dubrovin ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Ива́нович Дубро́вин[/tpl]) (1855, Kungur - 1921? or after 1929) was a Russian right wing politician, a leader of the Union of the Russian People (URP).

==Biography==

A trained doctor, Dubrovin gave up his practice to concentrate on opposing what he saw as creeping liberalism in the Russian aristocracy, turning his own movement, the Russian Assembly, over to the newly formed URP in 1905 when he was appointed head of the new group's directorate.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 104 Both anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic he believed in the Zhidomasonstvo (Judeo-Masonic) conspiracy and took the lead in organising the pogroms of the Black Hundreds.Rees, op cit
Gaining a popular following amongst the peasants, petite bourgeoisie and lumpenproletariat due to his demagogy, Dubrovin sat in the State Duma of the Russian Empire despite being a firm believer in absolutism and before organising a failed boycott of the Third Duma in 1907. Closely involved in the trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis, as later described in Bernard Malamud's novel The Fixer, Dubrovin himself fell foul of the law when his tendency towards violence saw him indicted for the murder of a fellow Duma member.
Within the URP Dubrovin was the leader of an extreme faction based around the Russkoe znamya newspaper and in 1910 this became the base of his support when the majority faction of the URP fell under Nikolai Markov. With Dubrovin somewhat lacking in charisma and seen as somewhat unbalanced, his faction fell into insignificance.

==Death controversy==

According to Philip Rees Dubrovin was shot in 1918 for his activities against the October Revolution. A number of other sources however place Dubrovin alive after this date and his actual date of death remains unresolved. On [tpl]date|1920-10-21|mdy[/tpl] Dubrovin was arrested in Moscow by Cheka. He was charged as an organizer of pogroms, murders etc. in 1905—1917 when he was the chairman of URP. In their entirety these corpus delicti (components of crime) were qualified under the Criminal Code Article "the counter-revolutionary activity". No activity after the 1917 has been incriminated to Dubrovin. 
Dubrovin’s files at FSB archives keep two consecutive death sentences dated [tpl]date|1920-12-29|mdy[/tpl] and [tpl]date|1921-4-21|mdy[/tpl] which indicates that at least one time Dubrovin’ applied for amnesty was satisfied. No documental traces of the actual implementation of this sentence were found.[tpl]cite book| author=Репников А. В.| year=2007| title=op. cit|edition=Известия высших учебных заведений.
