The European Parliament (abbreviated as Europarl or the EP) is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union (EU). Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU and it has been described (by its own members)  as one of the most powerful legislatures in the world. The Parliament is composed of 766 members, who represent the second largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/07/AR2009060702402.html |title=Conservatives Post Gains In European Elections |author=Brand, Constant and Wielaard, Robert |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date= 8 June 2009|accessdate=17 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/07/eu-elections-social-democrats |title=Misery for social democrats as voters take a turn to the right |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 7 June 2009|accessdate=17 August 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20120103MUN34829/html/18-new-MEPs-take-their-seats | title=18 new MEPs take their seats | publisher=European Parliament | date=10 January 2012 | accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl]
It has been directly elected every five years by universal suffrage since 1979.  However, turnout at European Parliament elections has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Turnout in 2009 stood at 43% of all European voters, ranging from 90% in Luxembourg and Belgium (where compulsory voting is used) to 20% in Slovakia. Turnout was under 50% in 18 out of 28 member states.[tpl]cite web|title=Turnout at the European elections (1979–2009)|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/000cdcd9d4/Turnout-%281979-2009%29.html|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl]
Although the European Parliament has legislative power that the Council and Commission do not possess, it does not formally possess legislative initiative, as most national parliaments of European Union member states do.However, it may have a de facto capacity of initiative — see Powers and functions. Parliament is the "first institution" of the EU (mentioned first in the treaties, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is accountable to Parliament.  In particular, Parliament elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.
The President of the European Parliament (Parliament's speaker) is Martin Schulz (S&D), elected in January 2012. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the Group of the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). The last union-wide elections were the 2009 Parliamentary Elections. The European Parliament has three places of work – Brussels (Belgium), Luxembourg and Strasbourg (France).
Luxembourg is home to the administrative offices (the 'General Secretariat').
Meetings of the whole Parliament ('plenary sessions') take place in Strasbourg and in Brussels. Committee meetings are held in Brussels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-parliament/index_en.htm |title=European Parliament |publisher=Europa |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2012-12-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community|publisher=Eur-lex|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl]

==History==

The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the "Common Assembly" of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states (see dual mandate), having no legislative powers.[tpl]cite web|title = European Parliament|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_parliament-en-ad6a0d57-08ef-427d-a715-f6e3bfaf775a.html|accessdate =19 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = EPP-ED Chronology—1951–1960|publisher=European People's Party|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology02.asp|accessdate =5 July 2007[/tpl] The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the University of Manchester;[tpl]cite web|title = Professor Farrell: "The EP is now one the of the most powerful legislatures in the world"|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070615IPR07837|date=18 June 2007|accessdate =5 July 2007[/tpl]
Its development since its foundation is a testament to the evolution of the union's structures without one clear "master plan". Some such as Tom Reid of the Washington Post said of the union, "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU".[tpl]cite book|last=Reid|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The United States of Europe|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2004|location=London|page=272|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-14-102317-1[/tpl] Even the Parliament's two seats, which have switched several times, are a result of various agreements or lack of agreements.

===Consultative assembly===

The body was not mentioned in the original Schuman Declaration. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the Council of Europe's Assembly to perform the task. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated the leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term "representatives of the people" and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. In this, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952[tpl]cite web|title =Ad Hoc Assembly, Information and Official Documents of the Constitutional Committee, October 1952 to April 1953|publisher=Archive of European Integration|year=1953|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/991/01/political_union_draft_treaty_1.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate =29 October 2008[/tpl] with extra members but after the failure of the proposed European Defence Community the project was dropped.[tpl]cite web|title = Composition of the European Parliament|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/political_composition_of_the_european_parliament_2004-en-13cdefb7-829e-4567-b709-6057d1fcb990.html |accessdate =19 April 2013[/tpl] thumb|left|Session of the Council of Europe's Assembly in the former House of Europe in Strasbourg in January 1967
Despite this the European Economic Community and Euratom were established in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the "European Parliamentary Assembly." The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality.[tpl]cite web|title = 1945–1959 The beginnings of cooperation: 1958|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/1958/index_en.htm |accessdate =20 September 2012[/tpl] This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.[tpl]cite web|title =50th anniversary of the European Parliament celebrated in Strasbourg|publisher=European Parliament|date=12 March 2008|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20080311IPR23707+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |accessdate =6 April 2010[/tpl]
The three communities merged their remaining organs as the European Communities in 1967 and the body was renamed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962. In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the Community's budget, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975.[tpl]cite web|title = Power of the purse of the European Parliament|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/power_of_the_purse_of_the_european_parliament-en-f0eebff2-b760-467d-951c-7ef14a350199.html |accessdate =19 April 2013[/tpl] Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system before hand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the European Court of Justice leading to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but the issue of voting systems would be put off till a later date.[tpl]cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine | coauthors = Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher=Manchester University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 [/tpl]

===Elected Parliament===

In 1979, its members were directly elected for the first time. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed.[tpl]cite web|title = Framework|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/AboutUs/APCE_framework.htm|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate =5 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title =Overview of the Pan-African Parliament|publisher=Pan-African Parliament|url=http://www.pan-africanparliament.org/AboutPAP_Overview.aspx|accessdate =5 July 2007[/tpl] After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.[tpl]cite web|title = The history of the European Parliament|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/shotlist_page/20070314SHL04223/default_fr.htm|accessdate =5 July 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU. For example in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties.[tpl]cite web|title = The European Parliament's proposals|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_european_parliament_s_proposals-en-9169f4c4-6aa2-40d7-af99-9004fb85332c.html |accessdate =19 April 2013[/tpl] Furthermore the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto.[tpl]cite web|last = European Parliament Website|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate =1 July 2007 [/tpl]
Since the election the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after German reunification). Following this the Treaty of Nice imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected, 732. thumb|right|Palace of Europe, Parliament's Strasbourg hemicycle until 1999
Like the other institutions, the Parliament's seat was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two seat arrangement was contested by Parliament but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.[tpl]cite web|first=|title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_seats_of_the_institutions_of_the_european_union-en-cd672879-aeb1-4cad-a0c1-9e4ff75ff660.html|publisher=CVCE|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
The Parliament gained more powers from successive treaties, namely through the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure),[tpl]cite web|first=|title=Power to legislate of the European Parliament|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/power_to_legislate_of_the_european_parliament-en-4f35fdb4-323e-49a0-a138-5b11d701d9a3.html|publisher=CVCE|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission.[tpl]cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=30 September 2002|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =19 April 2013[/tpl] The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.

===Barroso I===

In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted pressure on the Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.[tpl]cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =We have to democratise procedures|date=2 November 2004|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051129143940/http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620| archivedate = 29 November 2005[/tpl]
Along with the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Parliament's democratic mandate has given it greater control over legislation against the other institutions. In voting on the Bolkestein directive in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The Financial Times described it in the following terms:[tpl]cite web|title = How the European parliament got serious|date=23 February 2006|work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/56b6d760-a412-11da-83cc-0000779e2340.html|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl]
In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the Treaty of Lisbon.[tpl]cite web|last = Beunderman |first=Mark|title = Frattini seeks to apply new EU treaty rules before 2009|publisher=EU Observer|date=9 November 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25117|accessdate =9 November 2007 [/tpl] Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.[tpl]cite web|title =Parliamentary reform put into practice|publisher=European Parliament|date=17 January 2008|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20080116BKG18998&language=EN|accessdate =3 February 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title =Parliamentary reform: third package adopted|publisher=European Parliament|date=20 March 2009|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20090320IPR52228+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate =3 February 2009 [/tpl]

===Recent history===

The Lisbon Treaty finally came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire of the EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the Commission President to Parliament's own elections. Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates before hand, only the EPP (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.
Barroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions ) with support of the European People's Party, European Conservatives and Reformists and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.[tpl]cite web|title = MEPs elect Barroso to a second term as Commission President|publisher=European Parliament|date=16 September 2009|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-60584-257-09-38-901-20090911IPR60583-14-09-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl] The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists' call for a delayed vote (the EPP had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).[tpl]cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title = A second term – but at what price?|publisher=European Voice|date=17 September 2009|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/a-second-term-–-but-at-what-price-/65887.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl]
Once Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).[tpl]cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title = How Jeleva was forced out|publisher=European Voice|date=21 January 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/how-jeleva-was-forced-out/66933.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl]
Before the final vote, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.[tpl]cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title =MEPs agree working relations with Barroso|publisher=European Voice|date=28 January 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/meps-agree-working-relations-with-barroso/66982.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl]
During the setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded, however they got broader financial control over the new body.[tpl]cite web|title =Parliament twists Ashton's arm over EEAS|publisher=EurActiv|date=11 June 2010|url=http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/parliament-twists-ashtons-arm-over-eeas-news-495150|accessdate =19 September 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Vogel|first=Toby|title =Backing of MEPs paves way for launch of diplomatic corps|publisher=EurActiv|date=21 October 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/backing-of-meps-paves-way-for-launch-of-diplomatic-corps/69215.aspx|accessdate =19 September 2011 [/tpl]

==Powers and functions==

The Parliament and Council can be regarded as two chambers in a bicameral legislative branch of the European Union, with law-making power being officially distributed equally between both parliamentary chambers. However there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law.[tpl]cite web|title = Fact Sheets 1.3.8 The Commission|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/1_3_8_en.htm|accessdate =14 June 2007 [/tpl] The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law.[tpl]cite web|first= Amie|last= Kreppel|title = Understanding the European Parliament from a Federalist Perspective: The Legislatures of the USA and EU Compared|publisher=Center for European Studies, University of Florida|year=2006|url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/COMFEDFINAL.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =26 September 2008[/tpl] Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.[tpl]cite web|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=24 June 2008|title = Pöttering defends parliament's role at EU summits|publisher=The Parliament Magazine|url=http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|accessdate =25 June 2008 [/tpl]
The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a "pan-European soapbox" with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States.[tpl]cite book | last = Schnabel | first = Rockwell | coauthors = Francis Rocca | title = The Next Superpower?: the Rise of Europe and its Challenge to the United States | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers | year = 2005 | location = Oxford | page = 111 | isbn = 978-0-7425-4548-9 [/tpl] Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.[tpl]cite web|last=Kirk|first=Lizabeth|date=11 January 2001|title = No guarantee EP will back Treaty of Nice|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/1249|accessdate =19 September 2011 [/tpl]

===Legislative procedure===

With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union's legislative procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the "ordinary legislative procedure" (previously named "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.[tpl]cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate =12 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007[/tpl] This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.
The few other areas that operate the special legislative procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007[/tpl] There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures, this is a "written declaration" which is similar to an early day motion used in the Westminster system. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.[tpl]cite web|title = Written declarations|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/writtenDecl.do|accessdate =1 November 2007[/tpl]

===Budget===

The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority with powers gained through the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.[tpl]cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=Europa website|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate =4 December 2009 [/tpl]
The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the budgetary power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission.[tpl]cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher=European Parliament| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate =15 October 2007 [/tpl] Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament has a defacto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.[tpl]cite web|first=Honor|title = Member states to signal broad backing for diplomatic service blueprint|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/24/29916|date=23 April 2010|accessdate =2 May 2010 [/tpl]

===Control of the executive===

Unlike most EU states, which usually operate parliamentary systems, there is a separation of powers between the executive and legislative which makes the European Parliament more akin to the United States Congress than an EU state legislature. The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament.[tpl]cite web|title = The Union's institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/parliament_en.htm|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl] That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority) who "elect" the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.[tpl]cite web|title = Background Information: Election of the European Commission|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate =1 July 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=9&language=EN|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament.[tpl]cite web|last =Bowley|first=Graham|title =Buttiglione affair highlights evolving role of Parliament : Questions arise on democracy at the EU|work=International Herald Tribune |date=18 October 2004|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/18/brussels_ed3_.php|accessdate =1 July 2007[/tpl] That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public—who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.[tpl]cite web|last =Murray|first=Alasdair|title =Three cheers for EU democracy| publisher=Centre for European Reform|year=2004|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html|accessdate =7 July 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070610003606/http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html |archivedate=10 June 2007[/tpl]
The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission if they have a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the Santer Commission, who subsequently resigned of their own accord. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their presidency; the obligation on the President of the European Council to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission Question Time" every Tuesday). At present, MEPs may ask a question on any topic whatsoever, but in July 2008 MEPs voted to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.[tpl]cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title=New rules to make it harder for MEPs to form political groups|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26468|date=9 July 2008|work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=10 July 2008[/tpl]

===Supervisory powers===

The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty.[tpl]cite web|title = Maastricht Treaty 15 years on: birth of the "European Union"|publisher=European Parliament|date=7 February 2007|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-2784-036-02-06-901-20070206STO02783-2007-05-02-2007/default_en.htm|accessdate =6 July 2007[/tpl] The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights—the former led to the creation of the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties.[tpl]cite web|title = Supervisory power|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=8&language=EN|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] Furthermore it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors[tpl]cite web|title =Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Rule 101: Appointment of the Members of the Court of Auditors|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20070101+RULE-101+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate =7 July 2007[/tpl] and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.
The European Ombudsman is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.[tpl]cite news|last=Rickards|first=Mark|title = MEPs get taste of people power|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7075573.stm|accessdate =3 November 2007 [/tpl]

==Members==

The parliamentarians are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by universal adult suffrage and sit according to political allegiance; about a third are women. Before 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments.[tpl]cite web|title = Members|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=45&pageRank=3 |accessdate =27 October 2007[/tpl]
Under the Lisbon Treaty, seats are allocated to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751 (however, as the President cannot vote while in the chair there will only be 750 voting members at any one time).[tpl]cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|title =EU agrees new 'Treaty of Lisbon'|date=19 October 2007|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25001|accessdate =19 November 2007[/tpl]
The seats are distributed according to "degressive proportionality", i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgian voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six large countries.
Germany (82.5 million inhabitants) has 99 seats, i.e. one seat for 859,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 67,000 inhabitants.
It is intended that the new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, will avoid political horse trading when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.[tpl]cite web|title = Distribution of EP seats: Constitutional Affairs Committee approvals proposal|date=2 October 2007|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/001-11037-274-10-40-901-20071001IPR11035-01-10-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm |accessdate =7 October 2017[/tpl]
Pursuant to this apportionment, the constituencies are formed. In six EU member states (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of proportional representation.

===Transitional arrangements===

Due to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh parliament was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20100223BKG69359&language=EN | title=Ratification of Parliament's 18 additional MEPs completed | publisher=European Parliament | date=29 November 2011 | accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl] This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election.[tpl]cite web|title = Agreement details: Protocol amending the Protocol on Transitional Provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Deposited with the Government of the Italian Republic)|publisher=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/accords/Default.aspx?command=details&id=297&lang=EN&aid=2010057&doclang=EN|accessdate =4 October 2011[/tpl] Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany is the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats will not be removed until the 2014 election.[tpl]cite web|last=Willis|first=Andrew|title = MEPs seek change to Lisbon Treaty to accommodate new colleagues|date=8 April 2010|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/18/29822|accessdate =2 May 2010[/tpl] Therefore, the current number of MEPs is 766 (754 after 2011 amendment plus 12 from Croatia added on 1 July 2013), but will be 751 after 2014 elections.

===Salaries and expenses===

Before 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gives all members an equal monthly pay of 7,000 euro each, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs would retire at 63 and receive the whole of their pension from the Parliament. Travelling expenses would also be given based on actual cost rather than a flat rate as happens now.[tpl]cite web|title = Statute for Members of the European Parliament|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/mep_status_en.htm|accessdate =27 October 2007[/tpl] Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and by other state governments the facilities of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and in other states they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.[tpl]cite web|title = 7. Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Union|publisher=Eur-Lex|date=16 December 2004|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2004/c_310/c_31020041216en02610266.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =27 October 2007[/tpl]

===Political groups===

MEPs in Parliament are organised into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S&D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament.[tpl]cite web|last = Kreppel|first=Amie|title = The European Parliament and Supranational Party System|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|url=http://193.60.94.203/97805218/06251/sample/9780521806251ws.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.[tpl]cite web|title = "What to expect in the 2009–14 European Parliament": Analysis from a leading EU expert|publisher=European Parliament website|year=2009|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-60547-292-10-43-901-20090911STO60546-2009-19-10-2009/default_en.htm|accessdate =17 February 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Cohesion rates|publisher=Vote Watch|year=2010|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/cx_european_party_groups.php|accessdate =17 February 2010 [/tpl]
Groups are often based on a single European political party such as the socialist group (before 2009). However, they can, like the liberal group, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents.[tpl]cite web|title = Party Politics in the EU|publisher=civitas.org.uk|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/download/CIT.3.EU%20Political%20Parties.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries.[tpl]cite web|title=European Parliament increases threshold to form a political group|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/009-33698-189-07-28-901-20080708IPR33697-07-07-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm|date=9 July 2008|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=10 July 2008[/tpl] Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive for the formation of groups. However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group.[tpl]cite web|last=Brunwasser|first=Matthew|title=Bulgaria and Romania bolster far right profile in EU Parliament|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/14/news/right.php|date=14 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune accessdate=2007-07-07[/tpl] There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, but they never came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees — traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties.[tpl]cite web|title = Far-Right Wing Group Sidelined in European Parliament|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2335201,00.html|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=7 July 2007[/tpl] When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.[tpl]cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title = MEPs welcome fall of far-right group|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25148|publisher=EU Observer|date=14 November 2007|accessdate=14 November 2007[/tpl]

===Grand coalition===

Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities.[tpl]cite web|last=Settembri|first=Pierpaolo|title = Is the European Parliament competitive or consensual ... "and why bother"?|url=http://www.fedtrust.co.uk/admin/uploads/FedT_workshop_Settembri.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Trust|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=7 October 2007[/tpl] However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.
When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the Community budget, President Jacques Santer stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. The Socialist group supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down. Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that:
During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties.[tpl]cite web|title = Interview: Graham Watson, leader of group of Liberal Democrat MEPs |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/elections/interview-graham-watson-leader-group-liberal-democrat-meps/article-128543|publisher=Euractiv|date=15 June 2004|accessdate=1 November 2007[/tpl] This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists.[tpl]cite news|title = European Parliament elects new president |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/398892.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 1999|accessdate=1 November 2007[/tpl] In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.[tpl]cite web|title=The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is born|date=14 July 2004|publisher=Graham Watson MEP website|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000017/the_alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_is_born.html|accessdate=7 October 2007[/tpl]

===Elections===

 
 
Elections have taken place, directly in every member-state, every five years since 1979. [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl] there have been seven elections. Occasionally, when a nation joins mid-term, a by-election will be held to elect their representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013 (see below). Elections take place across four days according to local custom and, apart from having to be proportional, the electoral system is chosen by the member-state. This includes allocation of sub-national constituencies; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member-states according to their population, with no state having more than 99, but no fewer than 5, to maintain proportionality.[tpl]cite web|title = The European Parliament: electoral procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts/1_3_4_en.htm|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl]
The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the European elections of 2009, held in June of that year. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world, since nearly 380 million citizens were eligible to vote. The proportion of MEPs elected in 2009 who were female was 35%; in 1979 it was just 16.5%. There are a number of proposals to "dress up" the elections to attract greater public attention to them. These include most notably the idea of linking them more closely to the Commission presidency. This would be by having political parties running with candidates for the job, so the largest party would essentially be forming the government, as in the parliamentary system of government.[tpl]cite web|last=Spongenberg|first=Helena|title=EU wants to dress up 2009 elections on TV|date=26 February 2007|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://www.euobserver.com/9/23566|accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last = Palmer|first=John|title = Size shouldn't matter|work=The Guardian | location=London |date=10 January 2007|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/john_palmer/2007/01/good_rather_than_bad_not_b_ig.html|accessdate =28 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political|publisher=EU Observer|date=27 June 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370|accessdate =28 June 2007 [/tpl] This was attempted in 2004, however only the European Green Party, which was the first true pan-European party to be established with a common campaign,[tpl]cite web|title =European Greens Found European Greens|date=23 February 2004|publisher=Deutsche Welle|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1119463,00.html|accessdate =30 January 2008 [/tpl] proposed a candidate for the post of President: Daniel Cohn-Bendit.[tpl]cite web|last=Hughes|first=Kirsty|title =Nearing Compromise as Convention goes into Final Week?|publisher=EPIN|url=http://www.epin.org/pdf/comment_Hughes2_june03.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =30 January 2008 [/tpl] Meanwhile, the closest any other party had come in that election was when the People's Party mentioned four or five people they'd like to be President.[tpl]cite web|title =The EP elections: Deepening the democratic deficit|publisher=Euractiv|date=16 June 2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/ep-elections-deepening-democratic-deficit/article-128495|accessdate =27 July 2007 [/tpl] In 2009, the incumbent President Barroso was formally nominated by the EPP, yet the Socialists were unable to agree on a candidate, in part due to some of their national leaders backing Barroso, leading to there only being one declared candidate (whose party formed the largest group regardless).[tpl]cite web|title =Socialists agree to disagree on Barroso|date=19 June 2009|publisher=EurActiv|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/socialists-agree-disagree-barroso/article-183319|format=|accessdate =14 July 2009 [/tpl]

==Proceedings==

Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3½ days in Strasbourg for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part-sessions are organised in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.[tpl]cite web|title = European Parliament 2007 calendar of activities|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/ext/hemicycle/PLAN_BRU.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =14 September 2009 [/tpl] The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority.

Members are arranged in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences.[tpl]cite web|title = Brussels seating plan|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN_BRX_30%20JAN_2008.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227035017/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc/PLAN_BRX_30+JAN_2008.pdf| archivedate = 27 February 2008[/tpl] The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other.[tpl]Cite book|last=Corbett|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Corbett|author2=Francis Jacobs|author3=Michael Shackleton|title = The European Parliament|edition=7|year=2007|place=London|publisher=John Harper|isbn=978-0-9665544-7-2|page=167|authorlink2=Francis Jacobs|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.[tpl]cite web|title = The European Parliament Ushers|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20051017FCS01532&secondRef=0|accessdate =21 June 2007 [/tpl]

===President and organisation===

The President, Martin Schulz MEP of the S&D, is essentially the speaker of the Parliament. He or she presides over the plenary when it is in session and the President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term.[tpl]cite web|title = Duties of the President|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-019+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Functions|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/president/functions.html|accessdate =20 September 2012[/tpl]
In most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others, however in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.[tpl]cite web|title = Parliament's Protocol Service |date=28 July 2006|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060728FCS09980&secondRef=0|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate =28 October 2007 [/tpl]
A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP,, though the history of Parliament sometimes excludes the early Common Assembly, in which interpretation the first President would be Robert Schuman (another founding father) in those circumstances. one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen.[tpl]cite web|title = Former E.P.

During the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous Vice-Presidents) presides over the chamber. Prior to 2009, the oldest member fulfilled this role[tpl]cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Rule 11: Oldest member|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20070101+RULE-011+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] but the rule was changed to prevent far-right French MEP Jean-Marie Le Pen taking the chair.
Below the President, there are 14 Vice-Presidents who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the Conference of Presidents which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are six Quaestors.

[tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], the European Parliament budget was EUR 1.756 billion.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00059f3ea3/The-budget-of-the-European-Parliament.html| title = The budget of the European Parliament| publisher = European Union| accessdate =22 April 2011| quote = The 2014 EP budget amounts to € 1,756 billion of which 35% is for staff expenses, mainly salaries for the 6000 officials working in the General Secretariat and in the Political Groups.. [/tpl] A 2008 report on the Parliament's finances highlighted certain overspending and miss-payments. Despite some MEPs calling for the report to be published, Parliamentary authorities had refused until an MEP broke confidentiality and leaked it.

===Committees and delegations===

The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees consisting of 28 to 86 MEPs each (reflecting the political makeup of the whole Parliament) including a Chairman, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary.[tpl]cite web|title = How the Parliament is Organised|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=45|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.[tpl]cite web  | last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher=University of Pittsburgh  |date=February 2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =7 October 2007 [/tpl]
Committees can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the Subcommittee on Human Rights) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. on extraordinary rendition). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the "Conference of Committee Chairmen". When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliaments powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a "Cinderella committee", however as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous attracting increasing attention to its work.
The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the United States Congress, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.
Delegations of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the  delegation to the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and through election observation in third countries.[tpl]cite web|title =European Parliament: In Detail|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert.do?language=EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate =9 July 2007 [/tpl]

===Translation and interpreting===

Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the EU's 24 official languages, ranging from English and German to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world[tpl]cite web|title = Press Release: Irish language arrives in European Parliament|date=11 January 2007|publisher=European Parliament Irish Office|url=http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928103833/http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html| archivedate = 28 September 2007[/tpl] and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand).[tpl]cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters.|date=12 April 2006|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060403FCS06935&secondRef=0|accessdate =21 June 2007[/tpl] Citizens may also address the Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician.[tpl]cite web|title = The European Parliament allows the written communication of citizens in Basques in Basque, Catalan and Galician.|year=2006|publisher=Ciemen|url=http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&lg=gb|accessdate =21 June 2007[/tpl]
Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting) —for example, when interpreting out of Estonian into Maltese. Interpreters need to be proficient in two other Union languages besides their native language. Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.
While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day.[tpl]cite web|title = In European Parliament, debate—in 21 languages—can be pricey|date=12 September 2006|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0912/p05s01-woeu.html|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] Many see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage. Although there was a small-scale campaign to make French the single tongue for all legal texts, due to the claim that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.[tpl]cite web|title = Campaign to make French sole legal language in EU|date=7 February 2007|work=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/07/europe/EU-GEN-EU-French.php|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl]
Because the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual corpus known as Europarl.  It is widely used to train statistical machine translation systems.Philipp Koehn (2005) Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation, in MT Summit 2005

==Seat==

The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly in the world with more than one meeting place and one of the few that does not have the power to decide its own location.[tpl]cite web|last=Alvaro|first=Alexander|title=Europe's strangest migrants|date=6 July 2006|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/1906/europes-strangest-migrants.html|accessdate=1 December 2011[/tpl]
The Strasbourg seat is seen as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, the  Strasbourg region having been fought over by the two countries in the past. However it is questioned over the cost and inconvenience of having two seats for the parliament. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe (with which the "mutual cooperation" is being continuously "fostered"),[tpl]cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament's work already being carried out there. Therefore despite Strasbourg being the main seat, it is the one most questioned, although some do believe Strasbourg should be the single capital.[tpl]cite web|last=Wheatly|first=Paul|title = The two-seat parliament farce must end|date=2 October 2006|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/2047/the-two-seat-parliament-farce-must-end.html|publisher=Café Babel|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610174433/http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=A&Id=2047| archivedate = 10 June 2007[/tpl]
Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a "travelling circus",[tpl]cite web|first=|title=Greens condemn EU parliament's 'traveling circus'|date=26 April 2007|url=http://www.4ecotips.com/eco/article_show.php?aid=1222&id=280|publisher=4ecotips|accessdate=5 July 2007[/tpl] and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing through numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol—of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions".[tpl]cite web|last = | first =|authorlink=|title = Wallstrom: "Strasbourg has become a negative symbol"|date=9 September 2006|publisher=New Europe|url=http://www.neurope.eu/articles/64641.php|accessdate =26 August 2011 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Green party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia Malmström MEP.[tpl]cite web|last = Malmström | first = Cecilia|authorlink=Cecilia Malmström|title = OneSeat.eu|url=http://www.oneseat.eu/|accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl]

However, as Parliament's seat is fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Council unanimously, meaning it could be vetoed by a single country: notably, France. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has stated that its seat is "non-negotiable", having no intention of surrendering the French based seat.[tpl]cite web|last=Banks|first=Martin|title=Sarkozy slated over Strasbourg seat|date=24 May 2007|publisher=EU Politix: The Parliament|url=http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200705/8216d9d5-0c44-46e2-a6d8-6166c30e812f.htm|accessdate=22 June 2007[/tpl] In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week.[tpl]cite web|title = MEPs vote to reduce Strasbourg calendar|date=10 March 2011|publisher=EurActiv|accessdate =24 March 2011 | url = http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/meps-vote-reduce-strasbourg-calendar-news-502987[/tpl] The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating "we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do."[tpl]cite web|title = Le conseil municipal adopte à l'unanimité une motion confortant et élargissant le siège du Parlement européen à Strasbourg|date=21 March 2011|publisher=EurActiv|accessdate =24 March 2011 | url = http://www.strasbourg.eu/accueil?ItemID=1633917363[/tpl] As of July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs are in favour of a single seat.Majority of MEPs now favour single seat theparliament.com
