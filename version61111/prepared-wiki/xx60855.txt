Tahir "Tie" Domi (born November 1, 1969) is a retired Canadian  professional ice hockey player of Albanian origin. Known for his role as an enforcer, he played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers and Winnipeg Jets over a sixteen-year NHL career. He has more penalty minutes than any other player in the history of the Maple Leafs (see Maple Leafs records) and third overall in penalty minutes in NHL history.

==Playing career==

===Minor and junior===

Domi grew up in the town of Belle River, Ontario, playing minor hockey for the local Belle River Rink Rats (OMHA). His parents are from the town of Bitola, in the modern-day Republic of Macedonia, and are of Albanian ethnicity.  As a 15-year old, Domi played for the Belle River Canadiens of the Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League.  He moved up a level the following year with the Windsor Bulldogs of the Western Junior B Hockey League.
After being selected in the First round (1st overall) of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Peterborough Petes, Domi began his major junior career in 1986–87. He spent his first year as a part-time player with the Petes, also seeing time with the nearby Peterborough Roadrunners in the Metro Junior A Hockey League. Playing a full season with the Petes in 1987–88, he recorded an OHL career-high 22 goals and 43 points over 60 games. With 292 penalty minutes, Domi quickly earned a reputation as an enforcer.
During the off-season, he was selected in the second round (27th overall) by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Upon his selection, Domi returned to the Petes for one more season of junior, recording 14 goals and 30 points over 43 games.

===Early professional career===

Domi turned professional in 1989–90 with Toronto's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Newmarket Saints. He recorded 14 goals and 25 points over 57 games, while also making his NHL debut, appearing in two games with the Leafs that year. In the off-season, he was traded to the New York Rangers. He split the subsequent year between New York and their AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers. During his 28 games with New York in 1990–91, he scored his first NHL goal. After playing a full NHL campaign with the Rangers in 1991–92, Domi was traded early the following season to the Winnipeg Jets.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===

In 1995, Domi was traded back to the Toronto Maple Leafs. That year, New York Rangers defenceman Ulf Samuelsson was famously knocked unconscious by a sucker punch to the face from Domi. Domi received an eight-game suspension and a fine for the incident, described by some as one of the cheapest shots in NHL history.The NHL’s cheapest shots - Tie Domi on Ulf Samuelsson http://sports.ca.msn.com/nhl/photos/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=23350398&page=8 Domi insisted that Samuelsson provoked the punch by repeatedly calling him "dummy".DREGER: SUCKER-PUNCH CONSIDERED AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS http://www.tiedomi.com/?p=843 In the 1997–98 season, Domi set a Leafs single-season record with 365 penalty minutes, passing a mark set by Tiger Williams in 1977–78.
During the 2000–01 season, Domi was fined $1,000 (the maximum[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] possible fine at the time) for an incident involving a fan during an away game against the Philadelphia Flyers. Sitting in the penalty box, Domi used his water bottle to spray water at a heckler, prompting another Flyers fan, Chris Trumbore, to begin yelling at him and climbing up the glass. The glass panel gave way, and the fan fell into the penalty box where Domi was seated. Flyers management reportedly received a fine for not having better crowd control and security in place.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jim_kelley/10/21/rick.rypien.suspension/index.html |title=Rypien had to pay for NHL's sins |publisher=si.com |date=October 21, 2010[/tpl] 
On May 3, 2001, in the closing seconds of Game 4 of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semi-finals, well away from the play, Domi threw an elbow at the head of New Jersey Devils defenceman Scott Niedermayer, knocking him unconscious. Domi received a five-minute intent to injure penalty and was later suspended by the league for the remainder of the playoffs.
On June 30, 2002, Domi was traded to the Nashville Predators by Toronto for Nashville's 8th round choice (Shaun Landolt) in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He never played a game with Nashville, later re-signing with Toronto as a free agent on July 14, 2002. He had his best season in the 2003-04 NHL season, when he set career highs of 15 goals and 29 points.
In what turned out to be his final season of 2005–06, Domi scored his 100th NHL goal. Also, Domi played his 1,000th career NHL game, on March 3, 2006 against the Buffalo Sabres. Seven days later, on March 10, 2006, Domi was a healthy scratch for the Maple Leafs game versus the New York Islanders. It was the first time since the 1999 playoffs that Tie had been made a healthy scratch by coach Pat Quinn. Domi stated publicly that he was not happy with being benched, a fact that was underlined by his staying in his hotel room, not arriving at the game until after the second period. This is widely regarded as a contributing factor in the decision to buy out his contract.http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2363548
On June 30, 2006, the Maple Leafs opted to buy out the final year of Domi's contract.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=170091&hubname= |title=Domi bought out |publisher=TSN.ca |date=June 30, 2006[/tpl] Domi became a free agent on July 1, 2006.

===Family===

In the mid-1990s, Domi was romantically linked to Canadian Member of Parliament Belinda Stronach. Stronach was accused of being a "homewrecker", as Domi was married at the time to his wife, Leanne.http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=66b30a52-2913-4dd8-bb58-c2f55dd54326 Stronach joins Domi in the sin bin In 2004, Domi and Leanne filed suit against Ottawa sports radio station The Team 1200 after commentator Don Romani insinuated on the air that he beat his wife. The lawsuit was dropped after Romani left the station, which apologized to the Domis and said his remarks were "an ill-advised attempt at humour".http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1844812 Domi and Leanne, who later divorced, have three children: daughters Carlin and Avery Rose, and son Max.   On September 26, 2006, a temporary settlement in Domi's divorce was struck. 
Tie's son, Max Domi, is also a hockey player and has played for the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. During the 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, an international under-18 competition Max was participating in, Domi allegedly stole a video camera belonging to a Swedish coach, who was recording the Canadian team's practice – a legal practice. Domi took the unmanned camera before later returning it without the battery.NHL notes: Domi making enemies http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/News/2012/08/21/20126126.html
