[[Special defence]]

CATEGORIES: Scots law, Scots law legal terms

A special defence in Scots law may be raised in criminal proceedings upon notice by the accused ahead of the trial. If established, it results in an acquittal.Tony Callahan, "Case for the defence in Scotland", Evening Times (Glasgow, Scotland), 18 August 2001, p 8 via factiva accessed 24 September 2011. The only purpose of the special defence procedure is to give fair notice: it does not prejudice the plea of not guilty by an accused; the Crown still must prove the acts charged beyond a reasonable doubt.I D Macphail, Criminal Evidence - 24 Nov 2010.pdf Scottish Criminal Evidence, Procedure and Practice (2010)[tpl]Rp|29[/tpl]Lambie v H M Advocate 1973 JC 53 at 58
