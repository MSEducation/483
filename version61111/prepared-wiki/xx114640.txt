Victory at Entebbe is a made-for-television film from 1976 based on an actual event: Operation Entebbe and the freeing of Israeli hostages at Entebbe Airport (now Entebbe International Airport) in Uganda. The airport is Uganda's main airport and is situated near the capital city of Kampala, Uganda.
The film starred Anthony Hopkins, Burt Lancaster, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Dreyfuss and Kirk Douglas, and was directed by Marvin J. Chomsky.  Julius Harris portrayed Idi Amin, following the untimely, fatal heart attack suffered by the original actor, Godfrey Cambridge.
It was filmed on videotape at The Burbank Studios, California and later transferred to film for distribution around the world, giving the film the slightly stilted visual style of a studio-bound TV drama but with a film-like look and big Hollywood names in the cast. Shooting on video shortened the production time, allowing the film to be ready for television less than six months after the event that inspired it. 
Linda Blair and Helmut Berger were dating each other during production.
