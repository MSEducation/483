A neutron star is a type of stellar remnant that can result from the gravitational collapse of a massive star during a Type II, Type Ib or Type Ic supernova event. Neutron stars are the densest and tiniest stars known to exist in the universe; although having only the diameter of about 10 km (6 mi), they may have a mass of several times that of the Sun. Neutron stars probably appear white to the naked eye.
Neutron stars are the end points of stars whose inert core's mass after nuclear burning is greater than the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs, but whose mass is not great enough to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure to become black holes. Such stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles without net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. Neutron stars are very hot and are supported against further collapse by quantum degeneracy pressure due to the phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two neutrons (or any other fermionic particles) can occupy the same place and quantum state simultaneously.
The discovery of pulsars in 1967 suggested that neutron stars exist. Born in supernova explosions, these bodies are "only" ~12-13 kilometers by radius and spin around as rapidly as 642 times a second,[tpl]cite journal | author = Backer, D.; Kulkarni, S.; Heiles, C.; Davis, M.; Goss, M. | title = Millisecond Pulsar in 4C 21.53 | journal = IAU Circ. | volume = 3743 | year = 1982 | editor = B.G.

In contrast, the Sun's radius is about 60,000 times that. Neutron stars have overall densities of [tpl]val|3.7|e=17[/tpl] to [tpl]val|5.9|e=17|u=kg/m3[/tpl] ([tpl]val|2.6|e=14[/tpl] to [tpl]val|4.1|e=14[/tpl] times the density of the Sun),[tpl]val|3.7|e=17|u=kg/m3[/tpl] derives from mass 2.68[tpl]Esp|30[/tpl] kg / volume of star of radius 12 km; [tpl]val|5.9|e=17|u=kg m−3[/tpl] derives from mass [tpl]val|4.2|e=30|u=kg[/tpl] per volume of star radius 11.9 km which is comparable to the approximate density of an atomic nucleus of [tpl]val|3|e=17|u=kg/m3[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_center/ASM/ns.html| title=Calculating a Neutron Star's Density| accessdate=2006-03-11[/tpl] NB 3[tpl]Esp|17[/tpl] kg/m3 is [tpl]val|3|e=14|u=g/cm3[/tpl]
The neutron star's density varies from below [tpl]val|1|e=9|u=kg/m3[/tpl] in the crust - increasing with depth - to above [tpl]val|6|e=17[/tpl] or [tpl]val|8|e=17|u=kg/m3[/tpl] deeper inside (denser than an atomic nucleus).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/nstar.html| title=Introduction to neutron stars| accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl] This density is approximately equivalent to the mass of a Boeing 747 compressed to the size of a small grain of sand. A normal-sized matchbox containing neutron star material would have a mass of approximately 5 billion tonnes.
In general, compact stars of less than 1.44 solar masses – the Chandrasekhar limit – are white dwarfs, and above 2 to 3 solar masses (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit), a quark star might be created; however, this is uncertain. Gravitational collapse will usually  occur on any compact star between 10 and 25 solar masses and produce a black hole.http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/black_holes.html, a ten stellar mass star will collapse into a black hole. Some neutron stars rotate very rapidly and emit beams of electromagnetic radiation as pulsars. Gamma-ray bursts may be produced from rapidly rotating, high-mass stars that collapse to form a neutron star, or from the merger of binary neutron stars. There are thought to be on the order of 108 neutron stars in the galaxy, but they can only be easily detected in certain instances, such as if they are a pulsar or part of a binary system. Non-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are virtually undetectable; however, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed one thermally radiating neutron star, called RX J185635-3754.

==Formation==

Any star with an initial main-sequence mass of around 10 solar masses or above has the potential to become a neutron star. As the star evolves away from the main sequence, subsequent nuclear burning produces an iron-rich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of material from shell burning cause the core to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Electron degeneracy pressure is overcome and the core collapses further, sending temperatures soaring to over 5 billion Kelvin. At these temperatures, photodisintegration (the breaking up of iron nuclei into alpha particles by high- energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature climbs even higher, electrons and protons combine to form neutrons, releasing a flood of neutrinos. When densities reach nuclear density of 4 x 1017 kilograms per cubic meter, neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. The infalling outer atmosphere of the star is flung outwards, becoming a Type II or Type Ib supernova. The remnant left is a neutron star. If it has a mass greater than about 2-3 solar masses, it collapses further to become a black hole. Other neutron stars are formed within close binaries.
As the core of a massive star is compressed during a supernova, and collapses into a neutron star, it retains most of its angular momentum. Since it has only a tiny fraction of its parent's radius (and therefore its moment of inertia is sharply reduced), a neutron star is formed with very high rotation speed, and then gradually slows down. Neutron stars are known to have rotation periods from about 1.4 ms to 30 seconds. The neutron star's density also gives it very high surface gravity, up to 7[tpl]e|12[/tpl] m/s2 with typical values of a few [tpl]e|12[/tpl] m/s2 (that is more than 1011 times of that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is the fact that neutron stars have an escape velocity of around 100,000 km/s, about a third of the speed of light. Matter falling onto the surface of a neutron star would be accelerated to tremendous speed by the star's gravity. The force of impact would likely destroy the object's component atoms, rendering all its matter identical, in most respects, to the rest of the star.

==Properties==

The surface of the neutron star is made of iron. In the presence of a strong magnetic field the atoms of iron polymerize. The polymers pack to form a lattice with density about ten thousand times that of terrestrial iron and strength a million times that of steel. It has excellent electrical conductivity along the direction of the magnetic field, but is a good insulator perpendicular to this direction. Immediately beneath this surface the neutron star is still solid, but its composition is changing. Larger nuclei, particularly rich in neutrons, are formed, and materials that on Earth would be radioactive are stable in this environment. With increasing depth, the density rises. When its density reaches 400 billion times that of water, the nuclei can get no larger and neutrons start ‘dripping’ out. As the density increases further, the nuclei dissolve in a sea of neutrons. The neutron fluid is a superfluid – it has no viscosity and no resistance to flow or movement. Within a few kilometres of the surface the density has reached the density of the atomic nucleus. Up to this point the properties of matter are reasonably well understood, but beyond it understanding becomes increasingly difficult. The composition of the core of the star is particularly uncertain: it may be liquid or solid; it may consist of other nuclear particles (pions, for example, or hyperons); and there may be another phase change, where quarks start ‘dripping’ out of the neutrons, forming another liquid.
A neutron star has a mass comparable to that of the Sun, but as it is only about 10 km (6 mi) in radius, it has an average density 1 quadrillion times that of water. Such a large mass in such a small volume produces an intense gravitational force: objects weigh 100 billion times more on the surface of a neutron star than on the surface of the Earth. The intense gravitational field affects light and other electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star, producing significant redshift (z approximately equal to 0.2). The strong gravitational attraction allows neutron stars to spin rapidly (hundreds of revolutions per second) without disintegrating. Such spin rates are expected if the core of the original star collapses without loss of angular momentum - if the original star has a magnetic field, then this too may be conserved and concentrated in the collapse to a neutron star. Pulsars, gamma-ray burst sources, and the neutron stars in some X-ray binaries are believed to have magnetic fields with a strength of about 100 million teslas (roughly a trillion times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field).
The gravitational field at the star's surface is about 2[tpl]e|11[/tpl] times stronger than on Earth.  Such a strong gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens and bends the radiation emitted by the star such that parts of the normally invisible rear surface become visible.[tpl]cite web |first=Corvin |last=Zahn |title=Tempolimit Lichtgeschwindigkeit |date=1990-10-09 |url=http://www.tempolimit-lichtgeschwindigkeit.de/galerie/galerie.html |language=German |quote=Durch die gravitative Lichtablenkung ist mehr als die Hälfte der Oberfläche sichtbar.

A fraction of the mass of a star that collapses to form a neutron star is released in the supernova explosion from which it forms (from the law of mass-energy equivalence, [tpl]nowrap|E [tpl]=[/tpl] mc2[/tpl]). The energy comes from  the gravitational binding energy of a neutron star.
Neutron star relativistic equations of state provided by Jim Lattimer include a graph of radius vs. mass for various models.Neutron Star Masses and Radii, p. 9/20, bottom  The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius).  BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to observed neutron star gravitational mass of "M" kilograms with radius "R" meters,J. M. Lattimer and M. Prakash, "Neutron Star Structure and the Equation of State" Astrophysical J. 550(1) 426 (2001); http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002232
Given current values
and star masses "M" commonly reported as multiples of one solar mass,
then the relativistic fractional binding energy of a neutron star is
A two-solar-mass neutron star would not be more compact than 10,970 meters radius (AP4 model).  Its mass fraction gravitational binding energy would then be 0.187, −18.7% (exothermic).  This is not near 0.6/2 = 0.3, −30%.
A neutron star is so dense that one teaspoon (5 milliliters) of its material would have a mass over [tpl]val|5.5|e=12|u=kg[/tpl] (that is 1100 tonnes per 1 nanolitre), about 900 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza.The average density of material in a neutron star of radius 10 km is [tpl]val|1.1|e=12|u=kg cm−3[/tpl]. Therefore, 5 ml of such material is [tpl]val|5.5|e=12|u=kg[/tpl], or 5 500 000 000 metric tons. This is about 15 times the total mass of the human world population. Alternatively, 5 ml from a neutron star of radius 20 km radius (average density [tpl]val|8.35|e=10|u=kg cm−3[/tpl]) has a mass of about 400 million metric tons, or about the mass of all humans. Hence, the gravitational force of a typical neutron star is such that if an object were to fall from a height of one meter, it would only take one microsecond to hit the surface of the neutron star, and would do so at around 2000 kilometers per second, or 7.2 million kilometers per hour.Miscellaneous Facts
The temperature inside a newly formed neutron star is from around 1011 to 1012 kelvin. However, the huge number of neutrinos it emits carry away so much energy that the temperature falls within a few years to around 106 kelvin. Even at 1 million kelvin, most of the light generated by a neutron star is in X-rays. In visible light, neutron stars probably radiate approximately the same energy in all parts of visible spectrum, and therefore appear white.
The pressure increases from 3×1033 to 1.6×1035 Pa from the inner crust to the center.Neutron degeneracy pressure (Archive). Physics Forums. Retrieved on 2011-10-09.
The equation of state for a neutron star is still not known. It is assumed that it differs significantly from that of a white dwarf, whose EOS is that of a degenerate gas which can be described in close agreement with special relativity. However, with a neutron star the increased effects of general relativity can no longer be ignored. Several EOS have been proposed (FPS, UU, APR, L, SLy, and others) and current research is still attempting to constrain the theories to make predictions of neutron star matter.NASA. Neutron Star Equation of State Science Retrieved 2011-09-26 This means that the relation between density and mass is not fully known, and this causes uncertainties in radius estimates. For example, a 1.5 solar mass neutron star could have a radius of 10.7, 11.1, 12.1 or 15.1 kilometres (for EOS FPS, UU, APR or L respectively).

==Structure==

Current understanding of the structure of neutron stars is defined by existing mathematical models, but it might be possible to infer through studies of neutron-star oscillations. Similar to asteroseismology for ordinary stars, the inner structure might be derived by analyzing observed frequency spectra of stellar oscillations.
On the basis of current models, the matter at the surface of a neutron star is composed of ordinary atomic nuclei crushed into a solid lattice with a sea of electrons flowing through the gaps between them. It is possible that the nuclei at the surface are iron, due to iron's high binding energy per nucleon.V. S. Beskin (1999). "Radiopulsars". УФН. T.169, №11, p.1173-1174 It is also possible that heavy element cores, such as iron, simply sink beneath the surface, leaving only light nuclei like helium and hydrogen cores. If the surface temperature exceeds 106 kelvin (as in the case of a young pulsar), the surface should be fluid instead of the solid phase observed in cooler neutron stars (temperature 6 kelvin).
The "atmosphere" of the star is hypothesized to be at most several micrometers thick, and its dynamic is fully controlled by the star's magnetic field. Below the atmosphere one encounters a solid "crust". This crust is extremely hard and very smooth (with maximum surface irregularities of ~5 mm), because of the extreme gravitational field.neutron star
Proceeding inward, one encounters nuclei with ever increasing numbers of neutrons; such nuclei would decay quickly on Earth, but are kept stable by tremendous pressures. As this process continues at increasing depths, neutron drip becomes overwhelming, and the concentration of free neutrons increases rapidly. In this region, there are nuclei, free electrons, and free neutrons. The nuclei become increasingly small (gravity and pressure overwhelming the strong force) until the core is reached, by definition the point where they disappear altogether.
The composition of the superdense matter in the core remains uncertain. One model describes the core as superfluid neutron-degenerate matter (mostly neutrons, with some protons and electrons). More exotic forms of matter are possible, including degenerate strange matter (containing strange quarks in addition to up and down quarks), matter containing high-energy pions and kaons in addition to neutrons, or ultra-dense quark-degenerate matter.
