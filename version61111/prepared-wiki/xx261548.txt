[[Brighton and Hove City Council election, 2011]]

CATEGORIES: Brighton and Hove Council elections, English local elections, 2011

Elections to Brighton and Hove City Council were held on 5 May 2011, in line with other local elections in the United Kingdom. The whole council, a unitary authority, was up for election with 54 councillors elected from 21 wards.
The Green Party made significant gains, overtaking the Conservatives to become the largest party with 23 seats, the largest Green group on any council.  The Greens gained seats at the expense of all three other parties, taking the only ward previously in Liberal Democrat hands.  The Conservatives lost not only to the Greens but to Labour Co-op candidates in different parts of the city.[tpl]cite news|last=Ridgway|first=Tim|title=Updated: Greens triumph in Brighton and Hove|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9013061.Updated__Greens_triumph_in_Brighton_and_Hove/|accessdate=2011-07-21|newspaper=The Argus|date=8 May 2011[/tpl]
The Greens, Conservatives and Labour Co-op fielded candidates for every ward on the council. The Liberal Democrats contested all but one ward. The UK Independence Party, European Citizens Party and Trade Unionists and Socialists Against Cuts also fielded candidates. In addition, there were six independents standing, including re-standing councillor and former Liberal Democrat David Watkins.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1244754#subtitle2|title=Election candidates 2011|publisher=Brighton & Hove Council|date=2011-04-04|accessdate=2011-04-09[/tpl]
Following the election the Labour Co-operative group rejected the possibility of forming a coalition with the Green Party, who then went on to form the first ever Green council administration in the UK, as a minority administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsfrombrighton.co.uk/brighton-hove-city-council/labour-are-not-looking-at-coalition-with-greens/|publisher=News From Brighton|title=Labour are not looking for coalition with Greens|accessdate=2011-07-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightonhovegreens.org/localsites/bh/news/uks-first-green-council-administration-announced.html|publisher=Brighton and Hove Green Party|title=UK's first Green council administration announced|accessdate=2011-07-21[/tpl]

==Changes between 2007 and 2011 elections==

Since the 2007 Council Election there were a number of changes to the make up of the council:
In the Regency, Goldsmid and St. Peter's & North Laine wards there were by-elections, all of which were won or held by the Green Party. In Brunswick and Adelaide one councillor, David Watkins defected from the Liberal Democrats and stood as an independent in this election.  Jayne Bennett, originally elected as an Independent in the 2007 election in the Stanford/Hove Park ward, rejoined the Conservative Party during the course of the council, and stood as such in 2011.
Two ward names were changed during the four-year period: Hollingbury and Stanmer became Hollingdean and Stanmer, and Stanford ward was renamed Hove Park, using the council's powers under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.
