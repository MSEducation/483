Henry Michael King NicholasRyan, John, et al. Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide To Home-made Nations, Lonely Planet, 2006, ISBN 1-74104-730-7 (born 6 January 1979) is an author and micronational leader. He first attracted a cult following in 2003, after changing his name by deed poll to HM King Nicholas I, and founding a new empire from his royal seat – a four-berth caravan trailer just outside Sheringham, Norfolk.
Originally performed as a 'dare' with a friend, his new, royal persona soon took on a life of its own, as he sold peerages over the Internet, blagged his way into local high-society and pursued a relationship (unsuccessfully) with "fellow royal" Zara Phillips.
King Nicholas and the Copeman Empire (ISBN 0-09-189920-6) was published in June 2005 by Ebury Press/Random House. The book describes how—after being unemployed for several months, under pressure from his family to make something of himself, and dared by a friend—he changes his name by deed poll to HM King Nicholas I and founds a new empire from his Sheringham caravan.King Nicholas and the Copeman Empire
