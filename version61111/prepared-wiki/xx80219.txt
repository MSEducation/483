[[Quebec general election, 1892]]

CATEGORIES: 1892 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

In the Quebec general election of 1892 on March 8, 1892 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Honoré Mercier.
Mercier had been accused of corruption and removed from office as Premier by Quebec Lieutenant-governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891.  The scandal probably influenced the outcome of the election.  Mercier gave up the post of Liberal leader (and leader of the Opposition) to Félix-Gabriel Marchand, and was later acquitted of all charges.
Boucher de Boucherville resigned a year later, and was replaced by Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative leader and premier. Taillon in turn resigned in 1896, and was replaced by Edmund James Flynn.  Flynn lost the 1897 election, and the Conservatives never held power in Quebec again.
