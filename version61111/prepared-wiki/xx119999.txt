[[Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory]]

CATEGORIES: Particle experiments

MACRO (Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory) was a particle physics experiment located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Abruzzo, Italy.  A number of universities contributed personnel and equipment, including Boston University and University of L'Aquila.
The primary goal of MACRO was to search for magnetic monopoles. The active elements of MACRO were liquid scintillator and streamer tubes, optimized for  high resolution tracking and timing.  This design also allowed MACRO to operate as a neutrino detector and as a cosmic ray observatory.
The experiment ceased operating in 2001.[tpl]cite news|title=MACRO delivers its final word on monopoles |author=Giorgio Giacomelli and Laura Patrizii, Bologna |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28847 |newspaper=CERN Courier |date=May 1, 2003 |accessdate=December 16, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63xk5RkxQ|archivedate=December 16, 2011[/tpl] No monopole candidates were detected, meaning that the flux of monopoles is less than 5.6×10−15 per square centimetre per steradian per second (cm−2sr−1s−1) for velocities between one ten thousandth and one thousandth of the speed of light (between thirty thousand and three hundred thousand metres per second).[tpl]cite journal |author=S.

The magnetic monopole is a theorized particle that has not yet been observed. It is a possible solution to Maxwell's equations. One researcher claimed to have observed a monopole with a light-bulb-sized detector. The fact that a detector the size of multiple football pitches (MACRO) has not yet duplicated this feat leads most to disregard the earlier claim.
The MACRO project included a large underground cavern, approximately 800 metres underground, which was further hollowed out and housed hundreds of long chambers filled with scintillating fluid – a fluid that gives off photons when a charged or magnetic particle passes through it. At opposing ends of the chamber were a pair of photomultiplier tubes. Photomultiplier tubes contain a number of small charged "plates." They look like flood lights, but they are collectors that can take a handful of photons and "multiply" them.  This multiplication begins by using the photo-electric effect to convert photons that hit the first "plate" into electrons. These electrons are then attracted to the next plate which gives off more electrons that it receives. The next plate does the same, thus amplifying the signal more at each plate. The photomultipliers used in the MACRO experiment were produced by Thorn-EMI, and were sensitive to a signal as small as five photons. After decommissioning, MACRO donated about 800 photomultiplier tubes to the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment.  The exact voltage put on each plate was determined by a custom circuit board designed by some of the scientists involved with the project. The project leader at Boston University was Prof. James Stone.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
The scintillating chambers were assembled into high stacks and long rows. When a signal was detected, it was usually detected in multiple chambers. The timing of each signal from each photomultiplier told the approximate path and speed of the particle. The type of signal and the speed through the "pool" of chambers told researchers if they had observed a monopole or merely some common charged particle.
