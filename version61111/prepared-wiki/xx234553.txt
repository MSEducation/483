A new species of Syncretocarpus (Asteraceae: Heliantheae: Helianthinae) from Central Peru. Phytologia 87: 110-113.  It is a member of the subtribe Helianthinae, which includes the common sunflower.

==Description and systematics==

The genus is characterized by the presence of corky margins on the cypselae (achenes), as well as the presence in two species of a conspicuous elaiasome.  It appears to be the sister group to the Andean genus Pappobolus, which lacks either corky margins or an elaiasome on its cypselae.
