==Description==

The Cape elephantfish is a smooth silvery or bronze fish  which grows to 120 cm in total length, with a digging proboscis on the front of its snout. The first dorsal spine has a large venomous spine in front of it. There are darker markings on the flanks and head. At maturity, the males have a pair of calcified claspers, paired retractable prepelvic graspers, and a door-knocker-like projection (tentaculum) on their heads.

It is found off the coasts of Namibia and South Africa inshore and down to 374 m.

==Ecology==

The Cape elephantfish eats sea urchins, bivalves, crustaceans, gastropods, worms, and bony fish. Its predators include seals and sharks.
It is oviparous, laying two egg cases at a time. The egg case is large (about 25 cm) and spindle-shaped, with a ragged frill all around it. Females mature at 50 cm, males at 44 cm. Mating and egg laying occurs inshore.
