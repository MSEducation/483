==Proliferation of All-American teams==

In 1931, Damon Runyon wrote a column about the proliferation of “All-America” teams.  He noted: “The ‘All’ boys are it, tooth and nail.  They are ‘All’-ing North, South East and West.  They will wind up ‘All’-Americaing, the most virulent form of the ‘All’ plague that besets us every Winter.  The late Walter Camp little realized what he was bringing upon the country . . . At the moment, Mr. Camp probably had no idea that he was sowing the seed of a fearful pestilence.”[tpl]cite news|author=Runyon, Damon|title=Runyon Makes One Selection for ‘All’ Eleven|publisher=Chester Times|date=1931-12-03[/tpl]  Runyon noted that Camp’s word was viewed as gospel, but with his passing “the rush to fill his shoes was prodigious,” and the “’All’ business became a national obsession.”
