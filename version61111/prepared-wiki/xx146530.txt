"Do You Wanna Touch Me", also referred to as "Do You Wanna Touch Me? (Oh Yeah)" is a glam rock song performed by Gary Glitter. The song reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1973, his third successive UK hit. The song represented something of a departure from the "trademark" of the Glitter sound and it was co-written by Glitter and his record producer Mike Leander. The song was also used in The Runaways biopic of the same name.

==Joan Jett version==

"Do You Wanna Touch Me" was later covered by rock singer Joan Jett in 1982, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.
A cover of the song by Joan Jett from her 1981 album Bad Reputation appears in a 2008 TV commercial for Hewlett-Packard's TouchSmart computers. The commercial was withdrawn when the company learned that Glitter, now a convicted child molester, had written the song. On 29 October 2008, it was reported that Glitter would receive Â£100,000 in royalties from Hewlett Packard for the advertisement.http://uk.news.launch.yahoo.com/dyna/article.html?a=/29102008/364/glitter-payout-sparks-outrage.html&e=l_news_dm

==Glee cover controversy==

On the TV show Glee, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the members of the Glee Club cover this song in the "Sexy" episode. The performance caused some controversy in the UK over the resulting royalty payments to convicted child molester Glitter. The charity Kidscape said the song's inclusion was "wholly inappropriate".http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8375863/Gwyneth-Paltrow-in-Gary-Glitter-controversy-over-Glee.html The UK version of the Album Glee: The Music, Volume 5 does not therefore include the song, but replaces it with "Afternoon Delight" by Starland Vocal Band.

==Covered by The Cure==

This song was played several times at the end of The Cure's concerts in 1980 and 1985 during The Head Tour.
