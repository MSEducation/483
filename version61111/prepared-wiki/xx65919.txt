CATEGORIES: NBC network shows, Television series by Warner Bros. Television

Mystery Island was a live-action segment on the CBS Saturday morning package program The Skatebirds (1977-1978), produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions.

==Plot==

The show featured the adventures of a plane crew: Chuck, Sue, and Sandy along with their robot P.O.P.S. who became stranded after the evil mad scientist Dr. Strange caused their plane to crash-land on his remote island by using his tractor beam. Dr. Strange hoped to capture P.O.P.S. and use it in his quest for world domination.

==About P.O.P.S.==

The P.O.P.S. prop or costume was a re-use of the original Robot B-9 from Lost in Space, modified with a bubble on its shoulders, a cylindrical (rather than bubble) head, a blue-and-white paint job, and other minor changes (P.O.P.S. image.). It has since been restored to its original Robot B-9 appearance.
