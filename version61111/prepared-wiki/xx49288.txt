The population genetics of genetic drift are described using either branching processes or a diffusion equation describing changes in allele frequency. These approaches are usually applied to the Wright-Fisher and Moran models of population genetics. Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after t generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of p and q, the variance in allele frequency across those populations is

===3. Mutation===

Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation in the form of new alleles. Mutation can result in several different types of change in DNA sequences; these can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning. Studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70 percent of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sawyer SA, Parsch J, Zhang Z, Hartl DL |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila |journal=Proc.

In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lynch, M. |year=2007 |title=The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity |journal=PNAS |volume=104 | pages=8597–8604 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702207104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.8597L |pmid=17494740 |pmc=1876435 |issue=suppl. 1[/tpl] If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.[tpl]cite journal| title=Deterministic Mutation Rate Variation in the Human Genome |journal=Genome Research|author= Smith N.G.C., Webster M.T., Ellegren, H. | year=2002 |volume=12 |pages=1350–1356 |doi=10.1101/gr.220502 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/9/1350.abstract |issue=9 |pmid=12213772 |pmc=186654[/tpl] Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Petrov DA, Sangster TA, Johnston JS, Hartl DL, Shaw KL |year=2000 |title=Evidence for DNA loss as a determinant of genome size |journal=Science |volume=287 | pages=1060–1062 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5455.1060 |issue=5455 |bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1060P |pmid=10669421[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Petrov DA |year=2002 |title=DNA loss and evolution of genome size in Drosophila |journal=Genetica |volume=115 | pages=81–91 |doi=10.1023/A:1016076215168 |issue=1 |pmid=12188050[/tpl] Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kiontke K, Barriere A , Kolotuev I, Podbilewicz B , Sommer R, Fitch DHA , Felix MA |year=2007 |title=Trends, stasis, and drift in the evolution of nematode vulva development |journal=Current Biology|volume=17 | pages=1925–1937 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.061 |issue=22 |pmid=18024125[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Braendle C, Baer CF, Felix MA |year=2010 |title=Bias and Evolution of the Mutationally Accessible Phenotypic Space in a Developmental System |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=6 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000877 |issue=3 |pmid=20300655 |pmc=2837400 |editor1-last=Barsh |editor1-first=Gregory S |pages=e1000877 [/tpl] For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.[tpl]cite journal | last=Palmer |first=RA | title=Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development | journal=Science | year=2004 | pages=828–833 | volume=306 | doi=10.1126/science.1103707 | pmid=15514148 | issue=5697 |bibcode = 2004Sci...306..828P [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=West-Eberhard |first=M-J. |year=2003 |title=Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-512235-0 [/tpl]
Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes. If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stoltzfus, A and Yampolsky, L.Y. |year=2009 |title=Climbing Mount Probable: Mutation as a Cause of Nonrandomness in Evolution |journal=J Hered |volume=100 | pages=637–647 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esp048 |pmid=19625453 |issue=5 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Yampolsky, L.Y. and Stoltzfus, A |year=2001 |title=Bias in the introduction of variation as an orienting factor in evolution |journal=Evol Dev|volume=3 | pages=73–83 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003002073.x |pmid=11341676 |issue=2[/tpl] Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Haldane, JBS |year=1933|title=The Part Played by Recurrent Mutation in Evolution |journal=American Naturalist|volume=67 | pages=5–19 |jstor=2457127 |doi=10.1086/280465 |issue=708[/tpl] For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.051 | pmid = 17306543 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 452–454 | last = Protas | first = Meredith | title = Regressive evolution in the Mexican cave tetra, Astyanax mexicanus | journal = Current Biology | year = 2007 | last2 = Conrad | first2 = M | last3 = Gross | first3 = JB | last4 = Tabin | first4 = C |last5 = Borowsky | first5 = R | pmc = 2570642 | ref = harv [/tpl] This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in a bacterium during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.[tpl]cite journal |author=Maughan H, Masel J, Birky WC, Nicholson WL |title=The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis |doi= 10.1534/genetics.107.075663 |journal=Genetics |volume=177 |pages=937–948 |year=2007 |pmid=17720926 |pmc=2034656 |issue=2[/tpl] When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size,[tpl]cite journal |author=Masel J, King OD, Maughan H |title=The loss of adaptive plasticity during long periods of environmental stasis |doi= 10.1086/510212 |journal=American Naturalist|volume=169 |issue=1 |pages=38–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17206583 |pmc=1766558[/tpl] indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift.

====Evolution of mutation rate====

Due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on cells, organisms have evolved mechanisms such as DNA repair to remove mutations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bertram J |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=Mol. Aspects Med. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |year=2000 |pmid=11173079 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |ref=harv[/tpl] Therefore, the optimal mutation rate for a species is a trade-off between costs of a high mutation rate, such as deleterious mutations, and the metabolic costs of maintaining systems to reduce the mutation rate, such as DNA repair enzymes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sniegowski P, Gerrish P, Johnson T, Shaver A |title=The evolution of mutation rates: separating causes from consequences |journal=BioEssays |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1057–66 |year=2000 |pmid=11084621 |doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200012)22:123.0.CO;2-W |ref=harv[/tpl] Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates,[tpl]cite journal |author=Drake JW, Holland JJ |title=Mutation rates among RNA viruses |journal=Proc.

===4. Gene flow and transfer===

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations, which are usually of the same species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Morjan C, Rieseberg L |title=How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles |journal=Mol. Ecol. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1341–56 |year=2004 |pmid=15140081 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02164.x |pmc=2600545 |ref=harv[/tpl] Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms, or the exchange of pollen. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer.
Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies, as well as introducing genetic variation into a population. Immigration may add new genetic material to the established gene pool of a population. Conversely, emigration may remove genetic material. Population genetic models can be used to reconstruct the history of gene flow between populations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gravel, S.|title=Population Genetics Models of Local Ancestry|year=2012|bibcode=2012arXiv1202.4811G|volume=1202|pages=4811|arxiv=1202.4811|doi=10.1534/genetics.112.139808|first1=S.|journal=Genetics|issue=2[/tpl]

====Reproductive isolation====

As barriers to reproduction between two diverging populations are required for the populations to become new species, gene flow may slow this process by spreading genetic differences between the populations. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the Great Wall of China, which has hindered the flow of plant genes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Su H, Qu L, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H |title=The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? |journal=Heredity |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=212–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12634804 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237 |ref=harv[/tpl]
Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Short RV |title=The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal=J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. |issue=23 |pages=359–64 |year=1975 |pmid=1107543 |ref=harv[/tpl] Such hybrids are generally infertile, due to the two different sets of chromosomes being unable to pair up during meiosis. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gross B, Rieseberg L |title=The ecological genetics of homoploid hybrid speciation |doi= 10.1093/jhered/esi026 |journal=J. Hered. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=241–52 |year=2005 |pmid=15618301 |pmc=2517139 |ref=harv[/tpl] The importance of hybridization in creating new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals,[tpl]cite journal |author=Burke JM, Arnold ML |title=Genetics and the fitness of hybrids |journal=Annu. Rev. Genet. |volume=35 |issue= |pages=31–52 |year=2001 |pmid=11700276 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.085719 |ref=harv [/tpl] with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vrijenhoek RC |title=Polyploid hybrids: multiple origins of a treefrog species |journal=Curr.

Hybridization is, however, an important means of speciation in plants, since polyploidy (having more than two copies of each chromosome) is tolerated in plants more readily than in animals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wendel J |title=Genome evolution in polyploids |journal=Plant Mol. Biol. |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=225–49 |year=2000 |pmid=10688139 |doi=10.1023/A:1006392424384 |ref=harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Sémon M, Wolfe KH |title=Consequences of genome duplication |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=505–12 |year=2007 |pmid=18006297 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.09.007 |ref=harv [/tpl] Polyploidy is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction, with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during meiosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Comai L |title=The advantages and disadvantages of being polyploid |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=836–46 |year=2005 |pmid=16304599 |doi=10.1038/nrg1711 |ref=harv [/tpl] Polyploids also have more genetic diversity, which allows them to avoid inbreeding depression in small populations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Soltis P, Soltis D |title=The role of genetic and genomic attributes in the success of polyploids |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=13 |pages=7051–7 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10860970 |pmc=34383 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.13.7051 |ref=harv |bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.7051S [/tpl]

====Genetic structure====

Because of physical barriers to migration, along with limited tendency for individuals to move or spread (vagility), and tendency to remain or come back to natal place (philopatry), natural populations rarely all interbreed as convenient in theoretical random models (panmixy) (Buston et al., 2007). There is usually a geographic range within which individuals are more closely related to one another than those randomly selected from the general population. This is described as the extent to which a population is genetically structured (Repaci et al., 2007). Genetic structuring can be caused by migration due to historical climate change, species range expansion or current availability of habitat.

====Horizontal Gene Transfer====

Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title=Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 |journal=Annu Rev Genet |volume=37 |pages=283–328 |year=2003 |pmid=14616063 |ref=harv[/tpl] In medicine, this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Walsh T |title=Combinatorial genetic evolution of multiresistance |journal=Curr.

==Complications==

Basic models of population genetics consider only one gene locus at a time. In practice, epistatic and linkage relationships between loci may also be important.

===Epistasis===

Because of epistasis, the phenotypic effect of an allele at one locus may depend on which alleles are present at many other loci. Selection does not act on a single locus, but on a phenotype that arises through development from a complete genotype.
According to Lewontin (1974), the theoretical task for population genetics is a process in two spaces: a "genotypic space" and a "phenotypic space". The challenge of a complete theory of population genetics is to provide a set of laws that predictably map a population of genotypes (G1) to a phenotype space (P1), where selection takes place, and another set of laws that map the resulting population (P2) back to genotype space (G2) where Mendelian genetics can predict the next generation of genotypes, thus completing the cycle. Even leaving aside for the moment the non-Mendelian aspects of molecular genetics, this is clearly a gargantuan task. Visualizing this transformation schematically:
(adapted from Lewontin 1974, p. 12). XD
T1 represents the genetic and epigenetic laws, the aspects of functional biology, or development, that transform a genotype into phenotype. We will refer to this as the "genotype-phenotype map". T2 is the transformation due to natural selection, T3 are epigenetic relations that predict genotypes based on the selected phenotypes and finally T4 the rules of Mendelian genetics.
In practice, there are two bodies of evolutionary theory that exist in parallel, traditional population genetics operating in the genotype space and the biometric theory used in plant and animal breeding, operating in phenotype space. The missing part is the mapping between the genotype and phenotype space. This leads to a "sleight of hand" (as Lewontin terms it) whereby variables in the equations of one domain, are considered parameters or constants, where, in a full-treatment they would be transformed themselves by the evolutionary process and are in reality functions of the state variables in the other domain. The "sleight of hand" is assuming that we know this mapping. Proceeding as if we do understand it is enough to analyze many cases of interest. For example, if the phenotype is almost one-to-one with genotype (sickle-cell disease) or the time-scale is sufficiently short, the "constants" can be treated as such; however, there are many situations where it is inaccurate.

===Linkage===

If all genes are in linkage equilibrium, the effect of an allele at one locus can be averaged across the gene pool at other loci. In reality, one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at other loci, especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. Recombination breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid genetic hitchhiking, where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is linked to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. This is a problem for population genetic models that treat one gene locus at a time. It can, however, be exploited as a method for detecting the action of natural selection via selective sweeps.
In the extreme case of primarily asexual populations, linkage is complete, and different population genetic equations can be derived and solved, which behave quite differently to the sexual case.[tpl]cite journal |author=Michael M.

The population genetics of microorganisms lays the foundations for tracking the origin and evolution of antibiotic resistance and deadly infectious pathogens. Population genetics of microorganisms is also an essential factor for devising strategies for the conservation and better utilization of beneficial microbes (Xu, 2010).

==History==

Population genetics began as a reconciliation of the Mendelian and biometrician models. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician R.A. Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J.B.S. Haldane worked out the mathematics of allele frequency change at a single gene locus under a broad range of conditions. Haldane also applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that selection coefficients could be larger than Fisher assumed, leading to more rapid adaptive evolution.[tpl]Harvnb |Bowler|2003| pp=325–339[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb |Larson|2004| pp=221–243[/tpl]
The American biologist Sewall Wright, who had a background in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks.
The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked. John Maynard Smith was Haldane's pupil, whilst W.D. Hamilton was heavily influenced by the writings of Fisher. The American George R. Price worked with both Hamilton and Maynard Smith. American Richard Lewontin and Japanese Motoo Kimura were heavily influenced by Wright.

===Modern evolutionary synthesis===

The mathematics of population genetics were originally developed as the beginning of the modern evolutionary synthesis. According to Beatty (1986), population genetics defines the core of the modern synthesis. In the first few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists continued to believe that Lamarckian and orthogenic mechanisms of evolution provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. However, as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable.[tpl]Harvnb |Mayr|Provine|1998| pp=295–298, 416[/tpl] During the modern evolutionary synthesis, these ideas were purged, and only evolutionary causes that could be expressed in the mathematical framework of population genetics were retained.[tpl]cite book |last=Provine | first=W. B. |year=1988| title=Evolutionary progress |chapter= Progress in evolution and meaning in life | pages=49–79 |publisher=University of Chicago Press[/tpl] Consensus was reached as to which evolutionary factors might influence evolution, but not as to the relative importance of the various factors.
Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan's lab, had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. Many more biologists were influenced by population genetics via Dobzhansky than were able to read the highly mathematical works in the original.[tpl]cite journal|last=Provine | first=William B. |year=1978| title=The role of mathematical population geneticists in the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s |journal=Studies of the History of Biology|volume=2 | pages=167–192[/tpl]

===Selection vs. genetic drift===

Fisher and Wright had some fundamental disagreements and a controversy about the relative roles of selection and drift continued for much of the century between the Americans and the British.
In Great Britain E.B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work, in collaboration with Fisher, contributed to a shift in emphasis during the course of the modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.[tpl]cite book|author=Mayr, E§|year=1988|title=Towards a new philosophy of biology: observations of an evolutionist|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=402[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb |Mayr|Provine|1998| pp=338–341[/tpl]
Recent studies of eukaryotic transposable elements, and of their impact on speciation, point again to a major role of nonadaptive processes such as mutation and genetic drift.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jurka, Jerzy, Weidong Bao, Kenji K.
