Mount Remarkable is a national park in South Australia (Australia), 238 km north of Adelaide.
Edward John Eyre named Mount Remarkable in June 1840. The Nukunu people, who called Mount Remarkable "Wangyarra", ("arra" meaning running water) inhabited the area before the arrival of European settlers in 1844. 
Alligator Gorge and Mambray Creek were dedicated as National Pleasure Resorts in 1952. These areas were added to and became managed by the National Parks Commission in the 1960s. After the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1972, Alligator Gorge, Mambray Creek and Mount Remarkable were proclaimed as Mount Remarkable National Park. Further additions have brought the present total to more than 160 km², the most recent being the Warren Bonython Link in 1998 which joined the eastern and western sections of the park.
