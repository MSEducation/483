I Saw Her Standing There is a compilation album by the English rock band The Beatles. Available as both a 2-CD and a 2-LP set, it is a collection of their early recordings, featuring songs from the band's Decca Auditions and performances from the Cavern Club, as well as their first ever radio interview. The album also includes the instrumental track "Cry for a Shadow", the only Beatles composition to be credited to "Harrison/Lennon".

==CD version==

The CD version of the album contains 49 songs, 29 of which are previously unreleased on any official Beatles album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spincds.com/blog/2013/01/21/i-saw-her-standing-there-2cd-by-the-beatles/ |title=I Saw Her Standing There (2CD) by The Beatles |publisher=Spin CDs |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl]

Disc 1 is mainly compiled from early performances by The Beat Brothers (a backing group - not connected to the Beatles) and feature rock and roll singer Tony Sheridan on vocals. Ringo Starr appears only on the last two tracks on disc 2.

==LP version==

Due to the limited amount of music that can fit on a vinyl record, the 2-LP version compiles only the highlights of the original CD, and contains 27 songs.
