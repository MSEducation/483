Otto (or Othon in French, Oddone in Italian) (1010/1020 – [tpl]circa|1057[/tpl])Hellmann, Grafen, p. 17 was count of Savoy from  c.1051 until his death. Through marriage to Adelaide of Susa, he was also margrave of Turin from c.1046 until his death.

==Family==

He was a younger son of Humbert, the first Count of Savoy, and his wife Ancilla of Lenzburg. Otto  became count of Savoy c.1051 after the death of his elder brother, Amadeus I of Savoy.Hellmann, Grafen, p. 13
In 1046 he married Adelaide, heiress of Turin and Susa.Previté-Orton, Early History, p. 221 They had five children:

==Rule==

Through his marriage to Adelaide, Otto obtained extensive possessions in northern Italy. Thereafter, the House of Savoy concentrated their expansion efforts towards Italy instead of north of the Alps as they had done before. Savoy's lands occupied much of modern Savoy and Piedmont, although several other small states could be found between them.
In the 1050s, Otto allowed coins to be minted at Aiguebelle. The archbishop of Vienne, Léger, who had sole right of minting in the region, complained to Pope Leo IX, so Otto forbade further coining at Aiguebelle.Hellmann, Grafen, p. 15; Demotz, Le Comté, p. 24
