[[Homeschooling]]

CATEGORIES: Homeschooling, School types

Homeschooling or homeschool (also called home education or home based learning) is the education of children at home, typically by parents or by tutors, rather than in other formal settings of public or private school. Although prior to the introduction of compulsory school attendance laws, most childhood education occurred within the family or community,A. Distefano, K. E. Rudestam, R. J. Silverman (2005) Encyclopedia of Distributed Learning (p221) ISBN 0-7619-2451-5 homeschooling in the modern sense is an alternative in developed countries to attending public or private schools. Homeschooling is a legal option for parents in many countries, allowing them to provide their children with a learning environment as an alternative to public or private schools outside the individual's home.
Parents cite numerous reasons as motivations to homeschool their children. The three reasons that are selected by the majority of homeschooling parents in the United States are concern about the school environment, to provide religious or moral instruction, and dissatisfaction with academic instruction at public and private schools. Homeschooling may also be a factor in the choice of parenting style. Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, to allow for more traveling, while many young athletes and actors are taught at home. Homeschooling can be about mentorship and apprenticeship, where a tutor or teacher is with the child for many years and then knows the child very well. Recently, homeschooling has increased in popularity in the United States, with the percentage of children 5-17 who are homeschooled increasing from 1.7% in 1999 to 2.9% in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_040.asp |title=Number and percentage of homeschooled students ages 5 through 17 with a grade equivalent of kindergarten through 12th grade, by selected child, parent, and household characteristics: 1999, 2003, and 2007 |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl]
Homeschooling can be used as a form of supplementary education, a way of helping children learn, in specific circumstances.  Homeschooling may also refer to instruction in the home under the supervision of correspondence schools or umbrella schools. In some places, an approved curriculum is legally required if children are to be home-schooled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/New_York.pdf |format=PDF|title=Homeschooling in New York: A legal analysis |author=HSLDA |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 September 2013[/tpl] A curriculum-free philosophy of homeschooling may be called unschooling, a term coined in 1977 by American educator and author John Holt in his magazine Growing Without Schooling. In some cases, a liberal arts education is provided using the trivium and quadrivium as the main model.

==History==

For much of history and in many cultures, enlisting professional teachers (whether as tutors or in a formal academic setting) was an option available only to the elite social classes. Thus, until relatively recently, the vast majority of people were educated by family members (especially during early childhood), family friends or any one with useful knowledge.
The earliest public schools in the modern West began in the early 16th century in the German states of Gotha and Thurungia.Education: Free and Compulsory – Mises Institute  However, even in the 18th century, the vast majority of people in Europe lacked formal schooling, which means they were homeschooled, tutored or received no education at all."Education" Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th ed., vol. 8, p. 959. Regional differences in schooling existed in colonial America; in the south, farms and plantations were widely dispersed such that community schools like those in the more compact settlements were impossible. In the middle colonies, the educational situation varied when comparing New York with New England How they were schooled until the 1850s.History of Alternative Education in the United States  Formal schooling in a classroom setting has been the most common means of schooling throughout the world, especially in developed countries, since the early and mid 19th century. Native Americans, who traditionally used homeschooling and apprenticeship, vigorously resisted compulsory education in the United States.Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377, 386 n.30
In the 1960s, Rousas John Rushdoony began to advocate homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. public school system. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia (a general and concise study of education), The Messianic Character of American Education (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum (a parent-oriented pedagogical statement). Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the HSLDA (Home School Legal Defense Association) in court cases.
During this time, the American educational professionals Raymond and Dorothy Moore began to research the academic validity of the rapidly growing Early Childhood Education movement. This research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on Early Childhood Education and the physical and mental development of children.
They asserted that formal schooling before ages 8–12 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but was actually harmful to children. The Moores began to publish their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. They presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in special education classes, and behavioral problems were the result of increasingly earlier enrollment of students.Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, 1975 The Moores cited studies demonstrating that orphans who were given surrogate mothers were measurably more intelligent, with superior long term effects – even though the mothers were "mentally retarded teenagers" – and that illiterate tribal mothers in Africa produced children who were socially and emotionally more advanced than typical western children, "by western standards of measurement."
Their primary assertion was that the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor afterward corrected in an institutional setting. Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children – particularly special needs and starkly impoverished children, and children from exceptionally inferior homes– they maintained that the vast majority of children are far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting (assuming that the child has a gifted and motivated teacher). They described the difference as follows: "This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for all children – when obviously most children already have even more secure housing."
Similar to Holt, the Moores embraced homeschooling after the publication of their first work, Better Late Than Early, 1975, and went on to become important homeschool advocates and consultants with the publication of books like Home Grown Kids, 1981, Homeschool Burnout, and others.
At the time, other authors published books questioning the premises and efficacy of compulsory schooling, including Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich, 1970 and No More Public School by Harold Bennet, 1972.
In 1976, Holt published Instead of Education; Ways to Help People Do Things Better. In its conclusion, he called for a "Children's Underground Railroad" to help children escape compulsory schooling.Christine Field. The Old Schoolhouse Meets Up with Patrick Farenga About the Legacy of John Holt In response, Holt was contacted by families from around the U.S. to tell him that they were educating their children at home. In 1977, after corresponding with a number of these families, Holt began producing Growing Without Schooling, a newsletter dedicated to home education.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl]
In 1980, Holt said, "I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were."A Conversation with John Holt (1980)
Holt later wrote a book about homeschooling, Teach Your Own, in 1981.
One common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both Holt and the Moores is that home education should not be an attempt to bring the school construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. They viewed it as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

==Methodology==

Homeschools use a wide variety of methods and materials. Families, for a variety of reasons (parent education, finances, educational philosophies, future educational plans, where they live, past educational experiences of the child, child’s interests and temperament) chose different educational methods, representing a variety of educational philosophies and paradigms.
Some of the methods used include Classical education (including Trivium, Quadrivium), Charlotte Mason education, Montessori method, Theory of multiple intelligences, Unschooling, Radical Unschooling, Waldorf education, School-at-home (curriculum choices from both secular and religious publishers), A Thomas Jefferson Education, unit studies, curriculum made up from private or small publishers, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, distance learning (both on-line and correspondence), dual enrollment in local schools or colleges, and curriculum provided by a local schools and many others.  Some of these approaches are used in private and public schools.  Educational research and studies support the use of some of these methods.  Unschooling, natural learning, Charlotte Mason Education, Montessori, Waldorf, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, unit studies are supported to varying degrees by research by constructivist learning theories and situated cognitive theories.  Elements of these theories may be found in the other methods as well.
A student’s education may be customized to support his learning level, style, and interests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://12most.com/2012/02/07/compelling-reasons-to-homeschool-children/ |title=12 Most Compelling Reasons to Homeschool Your Children |publisher=12most.com |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl]  It is not uncommon for a student to experience more than one approach as the family discovers what works best as students grow and circumstances change.  Many families use an eclectic approach, picking and choosing from various suppliers. For sources of curricula and books, "Homeschooling in the United States: 2003"Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 – Executive Summary found that 78 percent utilized "a public library"; 77 percent used "a homeschooling catalog, publisher, or individual specialist"; 68 percent used "retail bookstore or other store"; 60 percent used "an education publisher that was not affiliated with homeschooling." "Approximately half" used curriculum or books from "a homeschooling organization", 37 percent from a "church, synagogue or other religious institution" and 23 percent from "their local public school or district."  41 percent in 2003 utilized some sort of distance learning, approximately 20 percent by "television, video or radio"; 19 percent via "Internet, e-mail, or the World Wide Web"; and 15 percent taking a "correspondence course by mail designed specifically for homeschoolers."
Individual governmental units, e. g. states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements.HSLDA | Homeschooling-State

===Unit studies===

In a unit study approach, multiple subjects like math, science, history, art, and geography, are studied in relation to a single topic like Native Americans, ancient Rome, or whales.  For example, a unit study of Native Americans could combine age-appropriate lessons and projects teaching literature (Native American legends), writing (report on a famous native American), vocabulary and spelling (Native American words that are now part of the English language), art and crafts (pottery, beadwork, sand painting, making moccasins), geography (original locations of tribes in the Americas), social studies (cultures of the different tribes), and science (plants and animals used by Native Americans).  Unit studies may be purchased or be parent prepared.[tpl]Verify credibility|date=August 2010[/tpl]Unit Study Approach. TheHomeSchoolMom.com.[tpl]Verify credibility|date=August 2010[/tpl] Unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unitstudy.com/ |title=Unit Studies by Amanda Bennett |publisher=Unitstudy.com |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl]

===All-in-one curricula===

All-in-one homeschooling curricula (variously known as "school-at-home", "The Traditional Approach", "school-in-a-box" or "The Structured Approach"), are instructionist methods of teaching in which the curriculum and homework of the student are similar or identical to taught in a public or private school.  Purchased as a grade level package or separately by subject, the package may contain all of the needed books, materials, internet access for remote testing, traditional tests, answer keys, and extensive teacher guides.  These materials cover the same subject areas as public schools which allow an easy transition back into the school system.  These are among the more expensive options for homeschooling, but they require minimal preparation and are easy to use.  Examples of curriculum providers are K12.com,K12.com Calvert School, A Beka Book, Bob Jones Press, Alpha Omega Publishers, Educator’s Publishing Service, My Father's World, Sonlight, Modern Curriculum Press, University of North Dakota Distance Education,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ndcde.org/Home.aspx |title=North Dakota Center for Distance Education |publisher=Ndcde.org |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl] etc.  Some localities provide the same materials used at local schools to homeschoolers.  Purchase of a complete curriculum and their teaching/grading service from an accredited distance learning curriculum provider may allow students to obtain an accredited high school diploma.How To Prepare For Homeschooling.

===Unschooling and natural learning===

Some people use the terms "unschooling" or "radical unschooling" to describe all methods of education that are not based in a school.
"Natural learning" refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time "teaching", looking instead for "learning moments" throughout their daily activities. Parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the child's role as being responsible for asking and learning.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
The term "unschooling" as coined by John Holt describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead. "Unschooling" does not indicate that the child is not being educated, but that the child is not being "schooled", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. Holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.
"Unschooling" should not be confused with "deschooling," which may be used to indicate an anti-"institutional school" philosophy, or a period or form of deprogramming for children or parents who have previously been schooled.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Both unschooling and natural learning advocates believe that children learn best by doing; a child may learn reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating a small business or sharing in family finances. They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Another prominent proponent of unschooling is John Taylor Gatto, author of Dumbing Us Down, The Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Weapons of Mass Instruction. Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of "state controlled consciousness" and serves as a prime illustration of the total institution — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free thinking or dissent.John Taylor Gatto, Weapons of Mass Instruction (Odysseus Group, 2008).

===Autonomous learning===

Autonomous learning is a school of education which sees learners as individuals who can and should be autonomous i.e. be responsible for their own learning climate.
Autonomous education helps students develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality and freedom of discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning.
Autonomous learning is very popular with those who home educate their children. The child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or what interests to pursue. In home education this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.
According to Home Education UK the autonomous education philosophy emerged from the epistemology of Karl Popper in The Myth of the Framework: In Defence of Science and Rationality, which is developed in the debates, which seek to rebut the neo-Marxist social philosophy of convergence proposed by the Frankfurt School  (e.g. Theodor W. Adorno, Jürgen Habermas, Max Horkheimer).

==Homeschooling and college admissions==

Many students choose to pursue higher education at the college or university level, some through dual enrollment while in high school and through standardized tests such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and DANTES Subject Standard Tests (DSST).
The College Board recommends that homeschooled students keep detailed records and portfolios to aid them in the admission process.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20000501homeschool5.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Homeschooled students take unorthodox route to become top college candidates | first1=Pamela R. | last1=Winnick | date=2000-05-01[/tpl]
Over the last several decades, US colleges and universities have become increasingly open to accepting home-schooled students.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/03/06/homeschoolers_find_university_doors_open/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Homeschoolers find university doors open | date=2007-03-06[/tpl] 75% of colleges and universities have an official policy for homeschool admissions.P. & Gloeckner, G. (2004).  “A Study of Admission Officers’ Perceptions of and Attidtudes Toward Homeschool Students”  Journal Of College Admission, (185), 12-21.  95% have received applications from homeschoolers for admission.  Documents that may be required for admission vary, but may include ACT/SAT scores, essays, high school transcript, letters of recommendation, SAT 2 scores, personal interviews, portfolio, and a GED.  78% of admissions officers expect homeschooled students to do as well or better than traditional high school graduates at college.  Students coming from a home school graduated college at a higher rate than their peers¬—66.7 percent compared to 57.5 percent—and earned higher grade point averages along the way.M. F. (2010).  “Exploring academic outcomes of homeschooled students” Journal of College Admission, (208),18-52.
Such students have matriculated at over 900 different colleges and universities, including institutions with highly selective standards of admission such as the US military academies, Rice University, Haverford College, Harvard University, Stanford University, Cornell University, Brown University, Dartmouth College, and Princeton University.A. Distefano et al. (2005) Encyclopedia of Distributed Learning (p222) ISBN 1-59781-572-1

==Homeschool cooperatives==

A Homeschool Cooperative is a cooperative of families who homeschool their children.  It provides an opportunity for children to learn from other parents who are more specialized in certain areas or subjects.  Co-ops also provide social interaction for homeschooled children.  They may take lessons together or go on field trips.  Some co-ops also offer events such as prom and graduation for homeschoolers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Homeschoolers are beginning to utilize Web 2.0 as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online. With social networks homeschoolers can chat, discuss threads in forums, share information and tips, and even participate in online classes via blackboard systems similar to those used by colleges.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Homeschool athletics==

In 1994, Jason Taylor was a homeschool football player in Pennsylvania who engaged a legal battle against the N.C.A.A. (the leading oversight association governing U.S. collegiate athletics) and its classification of homeschool athletes as essentially high school drop-outs. Taylor's legal victory has provided a precedent for thousands of other homeschool athletes to compete in colleges and attain the same opportunities in education and professional development that other athletes enjoy. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Other homeschool students who have risen to the top of collegiate competition include N.C.A.A. 2005 champion tennis player, Chris Lam, Kevin Johnson of the University of Tulsa basketball team, 2010-2011 Big South Player of the Year Jesse Sanders of the Liberty University Flames and the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow from the University of Florida .[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] In 2012, another homeschool student was a Heisman Trophy finalist: Collin Klein of Kansas State University.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In Texas, Six-Man Football has also been popular among homeschoolers, with at least five teams being fielded for the 2008-2009 season. Interestingly enough, the top 3 places in the Texas Independent State Championship (TISC, also referred to as "the Ironman Bowl) were claimed by homeschool teams.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Motivations==

Parents give many different reasons for homeschooling their children.  In the 2003 and 2007 NHES, parents were asked whether particular reasons for homeschooling their children applied to them. The three reasons selected by parents of more than two-thirds of students were concern about the school
environment, to provide religious or moral instruction, and dissatisfaction with the academic instruction available at other schools. From 2003 to 2007, the percentage of students whose parents reported homeschooling to provide religious or moral instruction increased from 72 percent to 83 percent. In 2007, the most common reason parents gave as the most important was a desire to provide religious or moral instruction (36 percent of students). Typically the religious belief being represented is evangelical Christian.Sadker, D.M. & Zittleman, K.R. (2013). Teachers, schools, and society (10th ed.). New York, NY: Mc Graw Hill.p. 155. This reason was followed by a concern about the school environment (such as safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure) (21 percent), dissatisfaction with academic instruction (17 percent), and "other reasons" including family time, finances, travel, and distance (14 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009030 |title=1.5 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2007 |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl] Other reasons include more flexibility in educational practices and family core stability for children with learning disabilities or prolonged chronic illnesses, or for children of missionaries, military families, or families who move often, as frequently as every two years.
In addition, some parents want more opportunities to socialize with a wide range of ages, to travel more, to do more field trips, to visit museums, to do outdoor education, to attend concerts, to visit work places, to tour government buildings, to seek mentor-ships, and to study nature outside. A homeschooling family can do more field trips, with only one vehicle and one parent required.[tpl]cite web|title=field trips|url=http://school.familyeducation.com/home-schooling/travel/39270.html|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]

====Test results====

Numerous studies may suggest that homeschooled students on average outperform their peers on standardized tests.HSLDA | Academic Statistics on Homeschooling Homeschooling Achievement, a compilation of studies published by the Home School Legal Defense Association, supported the academic integrity of homeschooling. This booklet summarized a 1997 study by Ray and the 1999 Rudner study.[tpl]cite web|title=Academic Achievement|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/study/comp2001/default.asp| publisher=HSLDA|accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl] The Rudner study noted two limitations of its own research: it is not necessarily representative of all homeschoolers and it is not a comparison with other schooling methods.[tpl]cite web|title=Achievement and Demographics of Home School Students|url=http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/543/666|publisher=Education Policy Analysis Archives|accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl] Among the homeschooled students who took the tests, the average homeschooled student outperformed his public school peers by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. The study also indicates that public school performance gaps between minorities and genders were virtually non-existent among the homeschooled students who took the tests.HSLDA | Homeschooling Achievement
A study conducted in 2008 found that 11,739 homeschooled students, on average, scored 37 percentile points above public school students on standardized achievement tests.[tpl]cite web|last=Ray|first=Brian|title=Progress Report 2009: Homeschool Academic Achievement and Demographics|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/media/2009/200908100.asp|work=Survey|publisher=National Home Education Research Institute|accessdate=6 January 2013[/tpl] This is consistent with the Rudner study (1999). However, Rudner has said that these same students in public school may have scored just as well because of the dedicated parents they had.[tpl]cite journal|last=Welner|first=Kariane Mari|coauthors=Kevin G.

In 2011 Martin-Chang found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented home schooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally school children on standardized tests (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same socioeconomic and educational background).[tpl]cite journal|last=Martin-Chang|first=Sandra|coauthors=Gould, O.N., & Meuse, R.E.|title=The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from home-schooled and traditionally-schooled students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science /Revue Canadienne Des Sciences Du Comportement|year=2011|volume=43|pages=195–202 |doi=10.1037/a0022697|url=http://crdh.concordia.ca/researchers/Sandra_Martin-Chang.html|accessdate=7 January 2013[/tpl]
In the 1970s Raymond S. and Dorothy N. Moore conducted four federally funded analyses of more than 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in Better Late Than Early, 1975. This was followed by School Can Wait, a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals.Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, Seventh Printing, 1993, addendum They concluded that, "where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten."
Their reason was that children, "are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready." They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of "1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools – senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination – cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5)  failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason."Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy Moore. When Education Becomes Abuse: A Different Look at the Mental Health of Children According to the Moores, "early formal schooling is burning out our children. Teachers who attempt to cope with these youngsters also are burning out." Aside from academic performance, they think early formal schooling also destroys "positive sociability", encourages peer dependence, and discourages self-worth, optimism, respect for parents, and trust in peers. They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity.
The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report on the development of genius, indicating a requirement for "1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance." Their analysis suggested that children need "more of home and less of formal school" "more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books," and "more old fashioned chores – children working with parents – and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements."

====Socialization====

John Taylor later found, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, "while half of the conventionally schooled children scored at or below the 50th percentile (in self-concept), only 10.3% of the home-schooling children did so."Self-Concept in home-schooling children, John Wesley Taylor V, Ph.D., Andrews University, Berrien Springs, MI He further stated that "the self-concept of home-schooling children is significantly higher statistically than that of children attending conventional school. This has implications in the areas of academic achievement and socialization which have been found to parallel self-concept. Regarding socialization, Taylor's results would mean that very few home-schooling children are socially deprived. He states that critics who speak out against homeschooling on the basis of social deprivation are actually addressing an area which favors homeschoolers.
In 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included:

===Criticism===

People claim the studies that show that homeschooled students do better on standardized tests,HSLDA | Academic Statistics on Homeschooling compare voluntary homeschool testing with mandatory public-school testing.
By contrast, SAT and ACT tests are self-selected by homeschooled and formally schooled students alike. Homeschoolers averaged higher scores on these college entrance tests in South Carolina.Homeschool Legal Defense Association. "Academic Statistics on Homeschooling." http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000010/200410250.asp Other scores (1999 data) showed mixed results, for example showing higher levels for homeschoolers in English (homeschooled 23.4 vs national average 20.5) and reading (homeschooled 24.4 vs national average 21.4) on the ACT, but mixed scores in math (homeschooled 20.4 vs national average 20.7 on the ACT as opposed homeschooled 535 vs national average 511 on the 1999 SAT math).[tpl]Cite news |author=Daniel Golden |title=Home-Schooled Kids Defy Stereotypes, Ace SAT Test |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=11 February 2000 |url=http://www.oakmeadow.com/resources/articles/WSJArticle.htm[/tpl]
Some advocates of homeschooling and educational choice counter with an input-output theory, pointing out that home educators expend only an average of $500–$600 a year on each student, in comparison to $9,000-$10,000 for each public school student in the United States, which suggests home-educated students would be especially dominant on tests if afforded access to an equal commitment of tax-funded educational resources."Fostering Educational Innovation in Choice-Based Multi-Venue and Government Single-Venue Settings."

According to study done on the homeschool movement,[tpl]cite book|last=Stevens|first=Mitchell L.|title=Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeshcooling Movement|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691114682|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7135.pdf[/tpl]  home schoolers are making headlines by winning national spelling bees and exceeding at elite universities. Not only are these homeschooled children excelling in these areas, they are academically successful and remarkably well socialized.National Home Education Research Institute president Brian Ray agrees that socialization is not a problem, contrast to what most people think, in the homeschooling community.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sizer|first=Bridget Bentz|title=Socialization: Tackling Homeschooling's "S" word|journal=pbsparents[/tpl]  He says socialization is not a problem for the vast majority of homeschool students, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups or homeschool co-ops.
