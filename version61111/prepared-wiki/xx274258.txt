==History==

The Minori services commenced from the start of the revised timetable on 22 March 1997, with one working in each direction daily.[tpl]cite book |title = JR特急10年の歩み|trans_title= 10 Years of JR Limited Express Trains | publisher = Kousai Shuppansha | date = May 1997 | location = Japan | page = 146| isbn = 4-330-45697-4[/tpl]
Services were increased to three workings in each direction daily from 1 October 1997, with two services in each direction operating between Niigata and [tpl]ja-stalink|Nagano[/tpl], absorbing earlier Akakura express services and coinciding with the opening of the Nagano Shinkansen. Services to and from Nagano were subsequently cut back due to poor loadings, reduced to two workings in each direction daily between Niigata and Takada from 1 December 2001. The Minori services were discontinued from the start of the revised timetable on 1 December 2002, being replaced by new Kubikino rapid services operating between Niigata and [tpl]ja-stalink|Arai||Niigata[/tpl].
