Chris Putnam is an American computer engineer, known for his 2005 hack on Facebook which subsequently landed him a career position at the firm.
While attending Georgia Southern University in 2005, Putnam and two friends wrote a computer worm that spread throughout Facebook. The worm used cross-site scripting to change users profiles to resemble MySpace, and deleted some contact details.[tpl]cite web|last=Yin|first=Sara|title=7 Hackers Who Got Legit Jobs From Their Exploits|url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/266255/7-hackers-who-got-legit-jobs-from-their-exploits/4|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Barrett|first=Brian|title=How Hacking Facebook Got This Man Hired...

Moskovitz consequently offered him an interview, and several months later, Putnam moved to Menlo Park, California to begin working at Facebook.[tpl]cite web|last=Johnson|first=Caleb|title=How a Man Got Hired by Facebook by Infecting It with a 'MySpace Worm'|url=http://www.switched.com/2011/02/23/chris-putnam-hired-facebook-infecting-worm/|work=Switched.com|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Tsotsis|first=Alexia|title="The Hacker Company": Facebookers Snag A Vintage Sign For New HQ|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/the-hacker-company-facebookers-snag-a-vintage-sign-for-new-hq/|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Paul|first=Ian|title=Hackers Gone Mild: 6 Rebels Turned Insiders|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/231318/Hackers_Gone_Mild_6_Rebels_Turned_Insiders.html|work=PC World|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]
