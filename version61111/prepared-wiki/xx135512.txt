KSYC-FM (103.9 FM) is a country music formatted radio station based in Yreka, California, owned and operated by Buffalo Broadcasting.

==History==

The station was founded in the 1970s by Dalmatian Enterprises, Inc., which also owned KSYC-AM 1490, the original country music station in Siskiyou County.  The new station was given the call letters KYRE and licensed to operate at frequency 97.7 FM.  It signed on the air on June 1, 1983 and played the pop/rock format with George Calvin Booth as the station's program director and main on-air talent.  In the latter years of KYRE, it was promoted as "Hot Hits Y98".
The station was purchased in 1995 by Siskiyou Radio Partners, Inc., and the call letters were changed to KSYC-FM as a way of moving the country music format over to the FM band and make way for the fast-growing news/talk format on the AM station.  The frequency was also moved from FM 97.7 to FM 103.9 that same year.  The station's program director became Kevin Sponsler, who was PD of the AM station before the switch.  KSYC-FM quickly replaced rival KWHO-FM as the county's only country music station when that station was sold to Huth Broadcasting in 1997 and KWHO's music format changed from country to hot adult contemporary.
KSYC-FM was sold to Four Rivers Broadcasting in 2000, as was KSYC, KMJC, and KMJC-FM and later KWHO (from Huth Broadcasting) in 2001.  It was then sold to Jamison-Wolf Broadcasting in 2008 along with sister station KNTK (now KSIZ).  The station's general manager is Lee Jamison and program director is once again Kevin Sponsler, who served that position previously from 1995 to 2003.  Local news is featured hourly in the mornings with news director Rick Martin anchoring and longtime news veteran Corky Small in the afternoons.
The station was rumored to have been sold to Jefferson Public Radio in the fall of 2010, but the sale never went through.  When the rumors were true of the pending purchase, the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted against the sale and JPR withdrew its offer.*UPDATE* Jefferson Public Radio withdraws offer to purchase KSYC-FM, Mike Slizewski, Siskiyou Daily News, December 17, 2010  The station was then acquired on March 1, 2011, by local and longtime residents of Siskiyou County, Mark and Cindy Baird, to continue that long standing tradition of excellence in broadcasting.  The company is known as Buffalo Broadcasting.KSYC's official website
