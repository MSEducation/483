==2009-10 season==

They started the 2009-10 season slow out of the gate, anchored to the bottom of the table and going through three managers when Kadiri Ikhana left after eight games. On February 27, 2010 they were suspended indefinitely by the league for "noncompliance of statutes" after a shakeup of their management staff. This was after the team was robbed in Edo State on their way back from a minicamp in Abuja. They managed to finish in 16th place with 48 points, avoiding relegation by one point.
