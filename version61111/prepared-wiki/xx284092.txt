Imperial 400 was an American motel chain. It was founded in 1959 by Bernard Whitney in Los Angeles, California. Its properties were typically two-story buildings with "gull wing" shaped roofs over the lobby. It was a limited-service hotel chain, competing mainly with Travelodge.[tpl]cite book |last1=Jakle |first1=John A. |last2=Sculle |first2=Keith A. |last3=Rogers |first3=Jefferson S. |title=The Motel in America |year=1996 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5383-4 |pages=160-162[/tpl]
