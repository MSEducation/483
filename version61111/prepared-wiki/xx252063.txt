Between 1918 and 1923 Eis performed on stage at the Neue Wiener Bühne (New Vienna stage), the Renaissancebühne (Renaissance stage) and the Kammerspielen.  Later, she moved to Hamburg, where she played at the  Thalia Theater and at the Deutschen Schauspielhaus until 1932.  When she returned to Vienna, she joined an ensemble group at the Burgtheatre (City Theatre), where she played character and tragic roles up until her death.  Her performances as Elizabeth I, Lady Macbeth, Sappho, Medea, and Iphigenia are considered noteworthy.
