[[Lagrangian point]]

CATEGORIES: Trojans (astronomy), Lagrangian mechanics

The Lagrangian points ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɑː|n|dʒ|i|ən[/tpl]; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are the five positions in an orbital configuration where a small object affected only by gravity can theoretically be part of a constant-shape pattern with two larger objects (such as a satellite with respect to the Earth and Moon). The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. A satellite at L1 would have the same angular velocity of the earth with respect to the sun and hence it would maintain the same position with respect to the sun as seen from the earth. Without the earth's gravitational influence, a satellite of the sun, at the distance of L1, would have to move at a higher angular velocity than that of the earth.
Lagrangian points are the constant-pattern solutions of the restricted three-body problem. For example, given two massive bodies in orbits around their common center of mass, there are five positions in space where a third body, of comparatively negligible mass, could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies. As seen in a rotating reference frame that matches the angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies, the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined with the satellite's acceleration are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary with respect to the first two."Lagrange Points" by Enrique Zeleny, Wolfram Demonstrations Project.

==History and concepts==

The three collinear Lagrange points (L1, L2, L3) were discovered by Leonhard Euler a few years before Lagrange discovered the remaining two.[tpl]Cite book|title=Dynamical Systems, the Three-Body Problem, and Space Mission Design |last=Koon |first=W.

In 1772, Joseph Louis Lagrange published an "Essay on the three-body problem". In the first chapter he considered the general three-body problem. From that, in the second chapter, he demonstrated two special constant-pattern solutions, the collinear and the equilateral, for any three masses, with circular orbits.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book|last= Lagrange |first= Joseph-Louis |authorlink= Joseph-Louis Lagrange |title= Oeuvres de Lagrange |year= 1867–92 |publisher= Gauthier-Villars |chapter = Tome 6, Chapitre II: Essai sur le problème des trois corps |pages = 229–334 |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k229225j/f231.image.r=Oeuvres+de+Lagrange.langFR [/tpl] Thence, if one mass is made negligible, one immediately gets the five positions now known as the Lagrange Points; but Lagrange himself apparently did not note that.[tpl]OR|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Early in the 20th century, Trojan asteroids were discovered at the [tpl]L4[/tpl] and [tpl]L5[/tpl] Lagrange points of the Sun–Jupiter system.

==Terminology==

The five Sun–Earth Lagrangian points are called SEL1–SEL5, and similarly those of the Earth–Moon system EML1–EML5, etc.

==The Lagrangian points==

The five Lagrangian points are labeled and defined as follows:

===[tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl]===

The [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] point lies on the line defined by the two large masses M1 and M2, and between them.  It is the most intuitively understood of the Lagrangian points: the one where the gravitational attraction of M2 partially cancels M1's gravitational attraction.
