Innisfail is a town located in the far north of the state of Queensland, Australia, which until 1910 was known as Geraldton. It is the major township of the Cassowary Coast and is well renowned for its sugar and banana industries, as well as for being one of Australia's wettest towns. In March 2006 Innisfail gained worldwide attention when severe Tropical Cyclone Larry passed over causing extensive damage.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.innisfail.oz-e.com.au/facts.html| title=Tourism and Regional Information| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/qld/cyclone/tc_larry/| title=Australian Bureau of Meteorology Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry Report| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]

==History==

Prior to European settlement the Innisfail area was occupied by five separate societies of the Mamu people. These Aboriginal people followed migratory lifestyles in the rainforest and traversed rivers in string-bark canoes.
The first arrival of European people came in 1872 when survivors of the shipwreck, the "Maria" arrived on the coastal areas surrounding what is now the Johnstone River. Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone's search party came with the intention of rescuing remaining survivors. The crew would later venture up river between what is today Flying Fish and Coquette Points. Johnstone wrote very highly of the area, stating:[tpl]quote|A most glorious view appeared - a noble reach of fresh water, studded with blacks with their canoes and catamarans, others on the sandy beaches; deep blue fresh water expanding to an imposing breadth.|Robert Johnstone (1872)|[/tpl]
Johnstone named the area after himself and upon his recommendation the explorer George Dalrymple arrived in the area in September 1873 to chart the area further.
Later in 1879, Irishman Thomas Henry FitzGerald arrived in the area to establish a sugar industry. He was accompanied by large numbers of Kanaka South Sea Islanders workers accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish labourers.  The house built by FitzGerald and thus the first establishment in the area was called Innisfallen, after the largest island in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland.
From 1879, settlement was named Geraldton after FitzGerald, but in 1910 was renamed 'Innisfail' to avoid confusion with the town of the same name in Western Australia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39891469 |title=CHANGE OF NAME. |newspaper=Cairns Post (Qld. : 1909-1954) |location=Qld. |date=19 August 1910 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The 1920s and 1930s saw the beginning of a major period of settlement by Italian immigrants and noteworthy populations from Greece and Malta. Later in this period populations from Yugoslavia, India and the Philippines would also settle in the area.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.innisfail.oz-e.com.au/hist.html| title=History of the Innisfail Region| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]
Local rugby league footballer Kerry Boustead was the only player from outside the Sydney and Brisbane Leagues selected to represent Australia on the 1978 Kangaroo tour.
The Innisfail War Memorial in Jack Fossey Park on Fitzgerald Esplanade was dedicated on 16 April 2005; it commemorates those who served in all wars.[tpl]cite web|title=Innisfail Cenotaph|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/display/91661-innisfail-cenotaph|publisher=Monument Australia|accessdate=5 April 2014[/tpl]

==Culture==

Today Innisfail remains incredibly multicultural, with prominent populations of indigenous Australians, Europeans (in particular Italians), Indians and East Asians (in particular Hmongs).[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.indigenous.gov.au/sra/qld/fact_sheets/qld04.html| title=SRA Fact Sheet Innisfail - Australian Government| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.multiculturalaustralia.edu.au/doc/innisfail_pioneers.pdf|format=PDF| title= Innisfail Pioneers - Italian History| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.lgaq.asn.au/lgaq/general/community/CulturalDiversity/Johnstone_Shire_Council_of_Month.html| title= Cultural Diversity in the Johnstone Shire Council| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
There are a number of events that take place annually to celebrate the cultural diversity within the Innisfail community:
Such events are extremely popular among residents and attract good turnouts.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.jsc.qld.gov.au/business/index.shtml| title= About Johnstone Shire Council| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]
In 2001 Los Angeles band Sugar Ray filmed part of their music DVD "Music in High Places" at the Johnstone Crocodile Farm in Innisfail.
Being a small community, and one that was recently subjected to a severe natural disaster Innisfail harbours a definite sense of community. The township has only 2 secondary schools: Good Counsel College and Innisfail State College and a single business district.
There are many events that act predominantly as community events, the main ones include:
While Innisfail was always reputed to have a positive sense of community spirit, the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Larry and the unified cleanup effort acted to promote this spirit through shared suffering.[ref]

==Geography==

Innisfail's town centre is situated at the junction of the North and South Johnstone Rivers, approximately [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the coast. It is located near large tracts of old-growth tropical rainforest surrounded by vast areas of extensive farmlands. Queensland's highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere; part of Australia's Great Dividing Range, is [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|0[/tpl] to the north.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.townsvillenet.com.au/mountains/bartlefrere.htm| title=Mt. Bartle Frere Trail| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]

===Climate===

Innisfail experiences a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af) as it has no month with a mean temperature below [tpl]convert|18|C|F|1[/tpl] or with less than [tpl]convert|60|mm|in|1[/tpl] of rainfall.[tpl]cite book | last = Linacre | first = Edward | coauthors = Geerts, Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 | url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&lpg=PA379&pg=PA379#v=onepage&q=&f=false | isbn = 0-415-12519-7[/tpl] Consistently, humid, very warm to hot weather dominates in Innisfail. In particular Innisfail is reputed as being among the wettest towns in Australia.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.cairnsconnect.com/region/tully.asp|  title=Tully -  Cairns Connect| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] Babinda, [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Innisfail is generally considered to be the wettest. Unlike most of tropical Australia,Median Rainfall for July the southern winter or “dry” season is not completely dry as moist easterly winds bring frequent showers;See Mean rainfall May to September for an explanation rainfall is, however, still far lower than during the southern summer. Monthly totals of over [tpl]convert|1000|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] are a routine occurrence in the region between January and April and some months will not experience a day without rain if the monsoon is unsually heavy.

===Cyclones===

Innisfail is consistently under threat from tropical cyclones developing in the Coral Sea in and around summer months.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.windworker.com.au/qldcyclones.htm| title=List of Queensland Cyclones - Windworker Roof Renovations| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] Furthermore, high rainfall associated with aforementioned cyclones and monsoons, combined with Innisfail settlement on adjoining rivers causes flooding to be commonplace, occurring to varied degrees of severity annually.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bom.gov.au/hydro/flood/qld/brochures/johnstone/johnstone.shtml| title=Flood Warning system for the Johnstone River| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] Innisfail suffered extensive damage in 2006 due to Cyclone Larry as the site of landfall and received over 100mm of rain in the span of three hours.
Tropical Cyclone Larry, an Australian Category 5 cyclone, struck the locality at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town.
Severe structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. Clean drinking water was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the Australian Defence Force was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only 1 indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone.
Cyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia. Inflated cost remained until farmers were able to meet demand again in early 2007. In February 2011 Cyclone Yasi hit Innisfail.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200603/s1595732.htm| title=ABC news - Innisfail Devastated| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.abgc.org.au/pages/media/cyclonelarry.asp| title=Australian Banana Growers Council - Cyclone Larry Report| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/disaster-drives-big-price-surge/2006/03/20/1142703287961.html| title=Sydney Morning Herald - Disaster drives big price surge| accessdate=2006-06-02 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=21 March 2006[/tpl]

==Council Controversy==

On 8 February 2007 the Johnstone Shire Council was sacked by the Queensland State Government by Queensland's Local Government Minister, Andrew Fraser because of internal conflict, inappropriate behaviour and financial problems, despite an issued show cause presented on 2 August 2006.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/02/08/1843394.htm| title=ABC - Sacking of JSC| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=47579| title=Queensland Government - Show Cause Issued| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]
Among the perceived gross misconduct were the following incidences:
 
 "Send up a truckload of piss so we can all get fucking drunk" - George Pervan - 2006 [tpl]cite news| url= http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21200048-421,00.html| title=News.com.au - Sacked Council gone bananas| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

While 2 councillors had attempted to get the Queensland Government to revoke the decision Andrew Fraser has stated that while the action is regrettable it was indeed the correct decision.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/02/08/1843394.htm| title=ABC news story - 'Ineffective Council Sacked' | accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]

==Innisfail today==

At present Innisfail has largely recovered from the devastation of Cyclone Larry. After the cyclone the township underwent something of an economic boom that stemmed from an influx of tradespeople and business eager to capitalize upon relatively significant insurance payouts. According to reports local trade had increased some 30 - 40% opposed to expected increases of 10%.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/05/19/1642580.htm| title= Innisfail Business booming after cyclone - ABC report| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]

The main industries remain predominately banana and sugar cane and have since recovered from the natural disaster. Outlying areas of Innisfail have also resumed manufacture of tea, pawpaws and other exotic fruits.
Innisfail remains a popular destination for backpackers seeking employment in the fruit picking industry.  Tourism is of importance to the township and the town consistently seeks to attract visitors passing through on the Bruce Highway.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.innisfailtourism.com.au/content/view/18/50/| title= Innisfail tourism| accessdate=2006-06-02[/tpl]
