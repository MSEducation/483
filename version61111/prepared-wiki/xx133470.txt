Potamalpheops is a genus of shrimp in the family Alpheidae. It was originally erected by Powell in 1979 to house species from Africa. Later, Horton H. Hobbs, Jr. realised that the troglobitic shrimp he had described in 1973 from Oaxaca, Mexico as Alpheopsis stygicola, also belonged to the genus,[tpl]cite journal |author=Horton H.
