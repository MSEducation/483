It rises in the mountains west of Corvalllis, in the Siuslaw National Forest along the county line between Benton and Lincoln counties at [tpl]coord|44.749284|-123.601773|type:river_region:US-OR_source:gnis|name=Yaquina River source[/tpl]. It flows south, then generally west, in a highly serpentine course, past Toledo. It enters the Pacific in Yaquina Bay, a broad estuary at Newport. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has its Pacific Marine Center on the river in Newport. The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse is located on the coast near the mouth of the river.
