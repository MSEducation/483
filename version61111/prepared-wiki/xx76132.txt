The wall has been used as a canvas for many paintings and writings. It has been called the "world's largest protest graffiti".[tpl]cite web|url=http://projectinterchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/20100804-israels-security-wall-is-worlds-largest-protest-graffiti-by-chitleen-sethi-from-the-tribune.pdf|format=pdf|title=Israel's "security" wall is world's largest protest graffiti|publisher=projectinterchange.org|author=Sethi, Chitleen K.|date=August 4, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] Some of these (but not all) have been removed by the Israelis, and sometimes by people on the Palestinian side.
Graffiti on the Palestinian side of the wall has been one of many forms of protest against its existence, demanding an end to the barrier, or criticizing its builders and its existence ("Welcome to the Ghetto-Abu Dis"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/20/israel|title=The Plot of the Eastern Segregation Wall|publisher=The Guardian|author=Chris McGreal|date=19 January 2004|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] and "Blessed are the Peacemakers"[tpl]cite web|url=http://cnsnews.com/node/15249|title=Jerusalem Arabs Look to God for Answer|publisher=cnsnews.com|author=Julie Stahl|date=July 7, 2008|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]).

Although many artists received positive attention and reviews, some Palestinian people had negative opinions toward the artists' movement. A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that "they don't necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn't be" (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating "something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. elder man wasn't speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower" (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead "of an aggressive prison Wall" (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.[tpl]cite book|last=Parry|first=William|title=Against the Wall the Art of Resistance in Palestine|publisher=Lawrence Hill|location=Chicago|pages=192[/tpl]Against The Wall

As part of a Dutch-Palestinian collaboration, led by Palestinian activist Faris Arouri, Internet users were invited to submit 80-character long messages to be spray-painted on the security barrier in exchange for a donation of 30 Euro.

====In book and documentary film====

The British photojournalist William Parry has recently published a book entitled "Against the Wall" The wall was the primary focus of British playwright David Hare's dramatic monologue Wall, which is being adapted as a live-action/animated feature-length documentary by the National Film Board of Canada, to be completed in 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/mar/20/david-hare-west-bank-playwright-journalist|title=David Hare on the West Bank: the playwright turns journalist|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Dickson|first=Andrew|location=London|date=March 20, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-film-board-canada-animate-273705|title=National Film Board of Canada to Animate Israel's West Bank Barrier For Theatrical Doc|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|date=14 December 2011|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]
The barrier is also the subject of the 2011 documentary film, 5 Broken Cameras, which documents the story of Emad Burnat, a Palestinian farmer of the Palestinian village of Bil'in, who had intended to use his videocamera to record vignettes of his son's childhood but ended up filming the resistance movement to the Israeli separation wall that was erected through his village.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/6/7/five_broken_cameras_home_videos_evolve|title=5 Broken Cameras: Home Videos Evolve into Stirring Film on Palestinian Resistance to Israeli Wall|publisher=Democracy Now!|author=Amy Goodman & Juan González|date=June 7, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] This award-winning film tells the story of the nonviolent protests of the village residents and the international and Israeli activists who join them, and of how in the course of his filming one after another of his cameras is shot or smashed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125423/|title=5 Broken Cameras|publisher=IMDb|date=22 September 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]

===Border opinions===

Some speculate that because sections of the barrier are not built along the Green Line but in the West Bank, the real purpose is to acquire territory. Some people describe the barrier as the de facto future border of the State of Israel. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, has said that the barrier has "unilaterally helped to demarcate the route for future Israeli control over huge West Bank settlement blocks and large swathes of West Bank land".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1220-09.htm|title=US Peace Activists Denounce Sharon's Speech|accessdate=2008-03-18|last=Lobe|first=Jim|date=2003-12-20|publisher=Inter Press Service[/tpl] According to B'Tselem, "the overall features of the separation barrier and the considerations that led to determination of the route give the impression that Israel is relying on security arguments to unilaterally establish facts on the ground ..." Chris McGreal in The Guardian writes that the barrier is, "evidently intended to redraw Israel's borders".[ref][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,16518,1594808,00.html|title=Israel redraws the roadmap, building quietly and quickly|last=McGreal|first=Chris|authorlink=Chris McGreal|date=October 18, 2005|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=2007-04-16[/tpl]

The fence is a warning: If Palestinians don't stop terrorism and forfeit their dream of destroying Israel, Israel may impose its own map on them... and, because Palestine isn't being restored but invented, its borders are negotiable."[tpl]cite web|date=2003-10-30|url=http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/fenced_in.htm|title=Fenced In|work=The New Republic|last=Yossi Klein Halevi|accessdate=2008-03-17[/tpl]
On March 9, 2006, The New York Times quoted then-acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as stating that if his Kadima party wins the upcoming national elections, he would seek to set Israel's permanent borders by 2010, and that the boundary would run along or close to the barrier.[tpl]cite news|date=March 9, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/international/middleeast/09cnd-mideast.html?|title=Olmert Wants to Set Israeli-Palestinian Border by 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-03-17|author=Greg Myre|quote=Ehud Olmert, said that if his Kadima Party wins national elections this month, he would seek to set Israel's permanent borders by 2010, and that the boundary would run along or close to Israel's separation barrier in the West Bank.[/tpl]

===Comparisons to apartheid===

Ahmad Hajihosseini, Observer for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), said that building and maintaining the wall is a crime of apartheid,[tpl]cite web|date=2003-10-14|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7895.doc.htm|title=Press Release SC/7895 Security Council 4841st Meeting (AM)|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2008-03-17|last=AHMAD HAJIHOSSEINI|quote=AHMAD HAJIHOSSEINI, Observer for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), said the form of apartheid Israel practised against Palestinians fulfilled all elements of the crime as defined under the 1976 apartheid Convention.[/tpl] isolating Palestinian communities in the West Bank and consolidating the annexation of Palestinian land by Israeli settlements.
Malcolm Hedding, a South African minister who worked against South African apartheid and Executive Director of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, said that the West Bank barrier has nothing to do with apartheid and everything to do with Israel's self-defense. He said that Israel has proven its desire to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians while granting political rights to its own Arab citizens within a liberal democratic system, but that the Palestinians remain committed to Israel's destruction. By contrast, he says, it was a tiny minority in South Africa that held power and once democracy came, the National Party that had dominated the masses disappeared.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/EditionFrancaise/Home.aspx|title=Abbas ne reconnaît pas le droit d'Israël à exister|language=French|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|author=Herb Keinon|date=September 17, 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://spme.org/spme-research/letters-from-our-readers/malcolm-hedding-israel-and-apartheid/8079/|title=Israel and Apartheid|publisher=Scholars For Peace in the Middle East|author=Malcolm Hedding|date=March 3, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Expose-apartheid-charges-real-agenda|title=Expose 'apartheid' charge's real agenda|work=The Jerusalem Post|author=Malcolm Hedding|date=March 11, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]

===Comparison with the Saudi–Yemen barrier===

In February 2004 The Guardian reported that Yemeni opposition newspapers likened the barrier Saudi Arabia was building to the Israeli West Bank barrier,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/yemen/Story/0,,1149722,00.html|title=Saudi security barrier stirs anger in Yemen|accessdate=2007-03-23|last=Whitaker|first=Brian|work=The Guardian|date=February 17, 2004|location=London[/tpl] while The Independent headed an article with "Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel's "security fence" in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-enrages-yemen-with-fence-569574.html|title=Saudi Arabia enrages Yemen with fence|accessdate=2007-03-23|last=Bradley|first=John|work=The Independent|date=February 11, 2004|location=London[/tpl]
Head of Saudi Arabia's border guard, Talal Anqawi, dismissed comparisons with Israel's West Bank barrier: "The barrier of pipes and concrete could in no way be called a separation fence. What is being constructed inside our borders with Yemen is a sort of screen ... which aims to prevent infiltration and smuggling," he said. "It does not resemble a wall in any way."
