He is also General Chair of the IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society and Associate Editor of IEEE Technology and Society.

===Ideas and inventions===

Many of Mann's inventions pertain to the field of computational photography.
Mann also works in the fields of computer-mediated reality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://veillance.me/committee|title=Committee of IEEE ISTAS - Social Implications of Living in a SmartWorld|accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl] He is a strong advocate of privacy rights, for which work he was an award recipient of the Chalmers Foundation in the fine arts. His work also extends to the area of sousveillance (a term he coined for "inverse surveillance"). Mann and one of his PhD students, James Fung, together with some of his other students, have been building a cyborg community around the cyborg-logging concept.[tpl]cite web|url=http://glogger.mobi/about.php|title=About Us|publisher=glogger.mobi|accessdate=2012-07-23[/tpl]
His CyborGLOGS ('glogs), such as the spontaneous reporting of news as everyday experience,[tpl]cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/eastcampusfire.htm|title=wearcam.org as roving reporter; (c) Steve Mann, Feb. 1995|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl] were an early predecessor of 'blogs and the concept of blogging, and earlier than that, his pre-internet-era live streaming of personal documentary and cyborg communities defined cyborg-logging as a new form of social networking.

===Anonequity project===

Mann is presently collaborating with a number of researchers including Ian Kerr, Canada Research Chair in Ethics, Law & Technology, University of Ottawa, who teaches a course on "Cyborg Law" that uses Mann's book.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/glaw.htm|title=Cyborg Law Course|publisher=Wearable Computing and Interaction Design|accessdate=2012-07-23[/tpl] Mann, together with Kerr and others, are doing a SSHRC-funded project to study the Ethics, Law & Technology of anonymity, authentication, surveillance, and sousveillance, in addition to issues related to cyborg-law. The anonequity project is ongoing, and collaborator Kerr has also researched and lectured widely on implantable technologies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idtrail.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=212&Itemid=43|title=Co-investigators & collaborators|publisher=On the Identity Trail|accessdate=2012-07-23[/tpl]

==Media coverage==

Mann has been described as the "father of wearable computing".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/05/google-project-glass-digital-goggles|title=Google Project Glass: will we really wear digital goggles?|first=Jack|last=Schofield|work=The Guardian|date=2012-04-05|accessdate=2012-07-23|quote=Steve Mann, a Canadian known as the father of wearable computing, has been developing systems since the 1980s with obvious industrial, medical and military applications.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4039816/ISSCC--Dick-Tracy-watch-watchers-disagree|title=ISSCC: 'Dick Tracy' watch watchers disagree|first=Peter|last=Clarke|work=EE Times|date=2000-02-08|accessdate=2012-07-23|quote=Steve Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto, was hailed as the father of the wearable computer and the ISSCC's first virtual panelist, by moderator...[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first = Jack | last = Schofield | authorlink = Jack Schofield | title = From man to borg - Is this the future? | date = 2001-08-01 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2001/aug/02/onlinesupplement.gadgets | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2012-07-21[/tpl]
In 1961 Edward O. Thorp (with Claude Shannon) built a microprocessor timing circuit into a shoe, for covertly cheating at roulette, and referred to himself as inventor of the wearable computer.computer">[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/courses/mobwear/resources/thorp-iswc98.pdf |title=The Invention of the First Wearable Computer Online paper by Edward O. Thorp of Edward O. Thorp & Associates |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl][/ref] However, there has been some debate as to whether or not Thorp's covert timing device is a wearable computer in the modern sense of "computer" as a general-purpose device.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/wearable_computing.html|title=Wearable Computing|work=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction-Design.org|first=Steve|last=Mann|year=2012|accessdate=2012-07-23[/tpl]
Mann has also been described as "the world's first cyborg" in Canadian popular press such as NOW, The Globe and Mail, National Post, and Toronto Life but has himself rejected the term "cyborg" as being too vague.[tpl]cite book|title=Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer|author=Steve Mann|coauthors=Hal Niedzviecki|publisher=Randomhouse Doubleday|year=2001|isbn=9780385658263[/tpl] Mann has been described as the founder of the field of wearable computing based on his early work in personal imaging, although there is controversy surrounding the exact definition of wearable computing, and whether any one person can be considered to have invented it. For example, a wearable camera was described by Vannevar Bush in his essay "As We May Think" in the Atlantic Monthly in July 1945, though he never built any working prototypes of such a device.  Mann has also been described as "the father of AR", in association with his early computer vision systems that helped people see better (e.g. while welding, or in other high-dynamic range situations, with dynamic range management, overlays, and augmentation as well as diminishment in both the additive and subtractive sense).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/quantigraphic-camera-promises-hdr-eyesight-from-father-of-ar-12246941/|title=Quantigraphic camera promises HDR eyesight from Father of AR|first=Chris|last=Davies|work=SlashGear|date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl]

==Publications==

Mann is author of more than 200 publications, including a textbook on electric eyeglasses and a popular culture book on day-to-day cyborg living. Selected works:

==McVeillance and the Mann-Wassel Law==

On July 16, 2012, after numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact McDonalds, Mann published a first-person account of a July 1st 2012 incident from when he and his family were eating dinner at BFI Champs Elysées, a McDonald's restaurant in Paris, France, as follows (excerpt):

Within a day, this incident was posted on reddit under the title "Steve Mann, father of wearable computing, physically assaulted by McDonald's for wearing Digital Eye Glass," quickly becoming the top post on the site. The subsequent media coverage resulted in Mann being successful in contacting McDonald's Head of Customer Service, but only to receive a denial, not an apology.  Mann requested a review of the video surveillance recordings from the many surveillance cameras in this McDonald's establishment, but received no further replies from McDonald's. (alternate link)
Subsequently Mann sent a much shorter letter, in French, to McDonald's Head of Customer Service, but also received no reply. (alternate link)
As a result of this incident, rather than bringing legal action against McDonald's, Mann teamed up with the IEEE (world's largest technical society), the ACLU, and some industry leaders such as the Pete Wassell, CEO of Augmate Corporation, to propose the Mann-Wassell law for presentation to the New York legislature (alternate link), as well an IEEE conference on the topic of Veillance.  The goal of this work is to create a legal, policy, and social climate to counteract the actions of companies like McDonald's, that are likely to have a chilling effect on the research and use of Augmediated Reality technologies in everyday life.  In this context, Mann also formalized the concept of McVeillance as placing people under surveillance while simultaneously forbidding them from using their own cameras. More precisely, McVeillance was defined as the ratio (linearly) or difference (logarithmically) of surveillance to sousveillance. (alternate link)  McVeillance is one of the topics of the IEEE conference.

Due to the employees alleged rough handling of the device, which he claimed was soundly attached to his head, the temporary storage buffer in the computer system could no longer be overwritten by new images, the damage to the system thus causing photos of these persons to remain stored in the glass memory.
