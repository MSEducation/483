Northlake Mall is an upscale shopping mall located eight miles (13Â km) north of center city Charlotte, North Carolina off of Interstate 77 at exit 18, Harris Blvd, and off of Interstate 485 at exit 21 Harris Blvd and owned by upscale mall company Taubman Centers.
In 2005, when Northlake Mall opened,http://mecktimes.com/news/2013/02/08/commercial-confidential-northlake-mall/ it filled a void for the lack of retail in the northern portion of Mecklenburg County. A mall had been planned for this region for years, but plans never materialized until a few years prior to the mall's opening. It has become the dominant retail destination for the thriving communities in North Charlotte and the Lake Norman region, from where it gets its name.
It was announced in 2013 that Northlake Mall would receive Charlotte's second H&M store, after the recently announced store at Carolina Place Mall. These two stores will be the only H&M stores in the Charlotte area. Once opened, North Carolina will have six H&M stores.
