Khuy ([tpl]lang-ru|Хуй[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ru|xuj|[/tpl], "dick") is a controversial song by the Russian punk band Grazhdanskaya Oborona. It was released in 1990.

==History==

The song was written in the autumn of 1989 when Miroslav Nemirov, Igor Zhevtun, Dmitry Selivanov and someone called Bakulin were taking a walk and discussed serious topics, such as rape, when Nemirov began to sing an early version of what would become the chorus. According to Nemirov, the song was part of the reason for GrOb's breakup, as Letov had modified it.
On the actual recorded version, however, Igor "Jeff" Zhevtun sung on it, due to Letov having torn his throat from too much screaming, however Letov did contribute guitar to the track.
On the 2013 remaster, the track is slowed down to 3:22. The track also ends differently: instead of the final "Khuy!" being slowed down and cut out, the "uy" part is abruptly cut out, with an extra echo added.

==Music video==

A music video was filmed, showing GrOb playing in front of a white wall in black and white, interspersed with shots of Chrissie Amphlett masturbating with a long dildo that had a neon blue light in it, in colour. Holodomor footage is also seen.

==Composition==

The song consists of only one verse and chorus repeated, mixed with screaming and humming the melody. The song's chord progression is Bm-D-C# for the chorus and intro and F#m-A-Bm-D for the verses. On all original CD and cassette versions, however, the song is sped a half step up, resulting in the progression being Cm-D#-D and Gm-A#-Cm-D#.
