===Historical changes===

Nyole has an interesting development from Proto-Bantu *p → Nyole [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl]. Schadeberg (1989) connects this sound change to rhinoglottophilia, where the sound change developed first as [tpl]IPA|*p[/tpl] → [tpl]IPA|ɸ[/tpl] → [tpl]IPA|h[/tpl].  Then, given the acoustic similarity of [tpl]IPA|h[/tpl] and breathy voice to nasalization, the sound change progressed as [tpl]IPA|h[/tpl] → [tpl]IPA|h̃[/tpl] → [tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl]. The velar place of articulation development is due to velar nasals being the least perceptible of the nasals and its marginal status in (pre-)Nyole and other Bantu languages.  In closely related neighboring languages, *p developed variously into [tpl]IPA|/h/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] or was deleted.
This historical development results in so-called "crazy" alternations, like [tpl]IPA|/n/ + /ŋ/[/tpl] resulting in [tpl]IPA|/p/[/tpl] as in the following:
In the above two words, when the first person singular subject prefix [tpl]IPA|/n-/[/tpl] is added to the stem starting with [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl], the initial consonant surfaces as [tpl]IPA|/p/[/tpl].  In other forms (like [tpl]IPA|/oxu-ŋuliira/[/tpl] "to hear" and [tpl]IPA|/oxu-ŋumula/[/tpl] "to rest"), the original stem-initial [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl] can be seen.
