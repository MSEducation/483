[[List of Irish counties' coats of arms]]

CATEGORIES: Counties of Ireland, Ireland-related lists, Lists of coats of arms

The following is a list of Irish counties' coats of arms. In the majority of cases these are arms assigned to county councils created by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 or later legislation, either by the Chief Herald of Ireland in what is now the Republic of Ireland or the College of Arms in Northern Ireland.
All but two county councils in the Republic has a coat of arms. In Northern Ireland county councils were abolished in 1973, but the traditional arms are still occasionally used. There are no official county flags. Flags with the GAA county colours serve as de facto county flags.

==History==

The earliest Irish county arms date from the late 17th century, when those of counties Carlow, Kilkenny and "Typerary" were recorded by Richard Carney, Ulster King of Arms.Genealogical office Ms.60, Some 1150 Tricks of Family arms, with arms of Bishoprics and of counties Carlow, Tipperary and Kilkenny collected by Carney, Ulster about 1668, folio 190 In each case the arms consist of an ermine shield bearing a fesse or central horizontal band on which heraldic devices of local families are displayed. The arms of Tipperary became obsolete when the county was divided into North and South Ridings in 1838.
When county councils were established in 1899, each was obliged to adopt a seal. In some cases these used an unofficial coat of arms, but no arms were officially granted prior to the splitting of heraldic jurisdiction in 1943.Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, Second edition, London, 1915
In 1914 a system of county and city flags were designed as unit colours for the Irish Volunteers. Each county flag was to include a coat of arms, with a list of suggested designs drawn by The O'Rahilly. While few of these colours were ever manufactured, some of the county devices were later to occur in official grants.G. A. Hayes-McCoy, A History of Irish Flags from Earliest Times, Dublin, 1979

===Grants by the Chief Herald of Ireland===

With the establishment of the Genealogical Office in 1943, a native Irish heraldic jurisdiction was established. One of the earliest grants by the new office was to Dublin County Council on September 30, 1944. The grant was notable for its use of Norse symbolism and the motto in the Irish language.Susan Hood, Royal Roots - Republican Inheritance, the Survival of the Office of Arms, Dublin, 2002 In 1949 Edward MacLysaght, the Chief Herald, discovered the seventeenth century arms of counties Carlow and Kilkenny, and wrote to the county councils concerned informing of their existence.Genealogical Office Ms 527, MacLysaght Miscellany From 1956 there was a steady flow of grants to county councils. In 1990 Tipperary South Riding County Council was granted arms based on those recorded by Richard Carney.Genelogical Office Register of Arms Q (1943-52), Register of Arms R (1952-59), Register of Arms S (1959-66), Register of Arms T (1966-72), Register of Arms U (1973-78), Register of Arms V (1978-81), Register of Arms W+X (1982-95), Register of Arms Y (1996-99)

===Grants by the College of Arms===

In 1943 heraldic jurisdiction in Northern Ireland passed to the College of Arms in London, with the creation of the merged office of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. Five out of six of the northern county councils received grants of arms from London. In each case supporters were also granted.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1971 In all cases these arms became obsolete with the abolition of county councils by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972.
