Cynosarges or Kynosarges ([tpl]lang-gr|Κυνόσαργες[/tpl]) was a public gymnasium located just outside the walls of Ancient Athens [tpl]LSJ|*kuno/sarges|Κυνόσαργες|ref[/tpl] on the southern bank of the Ilissos river. Its exact location is unknown but it is now generally located in the southern suburbs of Athens. The Stones of Athens, Wycherley, R.E., Princeton 1978.Pg 229
Its name was a mystery to the ancients that was explained by a story about a white  or swift dog,  etymologising the name as Kynos argos, from genitive of kyon (dog) and argos (white, shining or swift). The legend goes that on one occasion when Didymos, an Athenian, was performing a lavish sacrifice, a white (or swift) dog appeared and snatched the offering; Didymos was alarmed, but received an oracular message saying that he should establish a temple to Heracles in the place where the dog dropped the offering.Suda, κ2721, ε3160. In another account, (Suda, ει290) a white dog was being sacrificed, and an eagle stole and dropped the offering.
Herodotus mentions a shrine there in 490/89 BC,Herodotus, Historiae 6.116 and it became a famous sanctuary of Heracles which was also associated with his mother Alcmena, his wife Hebe and his helper Iolaus.Pausanias, Description of Greece 1.19.3.
