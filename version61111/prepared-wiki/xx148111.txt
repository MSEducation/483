==History==

Westfield Eastgardens is built on the site of a former pagewood bus depot factory. The factory closed in 1982 and was soon followed by the nearby W. D. & H. O. Wills factory. The closure of these two sites would result in job losses of around 1000 people. In order to save jobs, the Government of New South Wales persuaded Westfield to develop the site. The Government rezoned the site and added crown land in order to convince Westfield. In July 1982 three other commercial landlords whose own trade would be affected by the new shopping centre made a challenge to the Land and Environment Court. Following this the Government passed legislation that disallowed an appeal to be made to the Land and Environment Court. Significant public debate followed about the right of the New South Wales Government to overrule the legal process. 
The shopping centre was opened on 23 September 1987 and was the largest shopping centre in Australia for a short period until Chadstone Shopping Centre in Malvern East in Melbourne, Victoria was redeveloped. When the centre opened it had two supermarkets, a department store, two discount department stores, a 6-screen Hoyts cinema as well as 180 other retailers.[tpl]cite web | title=westfield.com/corporate | work=Westfield Group | url=http://www.westfield.com/corporate/portfolio/au/eastgardens.html | accessdate=5 January 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050915075921/http://www.westfield.com/corporate/portfolio/au/eastgardens.html  |archivedate = 15 September 2005[/tpl]  The centre was redeveloped in 2002. This added a new supermarket, discount department store and brought the total amount of retailers to 290 with parking for 3260 cars and the upgrade of Hoyts. When the redevelopment completed, Westfield Eastgardens was the first shopping centre in NSW to house three discount department stores, Kmart, Target and Big W.[tpl]cite web | title=eps.net.au | work=Westfield on the move at Tuggerah, EastGardens | url=http://www.eps.net.au/onestop/story.asp?id=87 | accessdate=20 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060924114421/http://www.eps.net.au/onestop/story.asp?id=87  |archivedate = 24 September 2006[/tpl]

===Myer===

David Jones Limited announced in May 2007 that it would not renew its lease for its Eastgardens store within the Westfield Eastgardens centre due to its proximity to the company's Westfield Bondi Junction and Elizabeth Street/Market Street stores. Myer announced shortly after that it would take David Jones' space after an extensive refurbishment. The David Jones closed on 23 September 2007 with the new Myer store opening on 8 March 2008.[tpl]cite web | title=westfield.com | work=Myer to open at Westfield Eastgardens | url=http://westfield.com/corporate/newsroom/announcements/2007/2007516_22541.html | accessdate=13 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070525043557/http://westfield.com/corporate/newsroom/announcements/2007/2007516_22541.html  |archivedate = 25 May 2007[/tpl] David Jones Eastgardens closed on the 20th anniversary of it and Eastgardens' opening, 23 September 1987.

===Roof collapse===

Eastgardens suffered significant damage when part of the car park collapsed at around 7am AEST on Tuesday 24 July 2012.  Around five hundred people were evacuated from the building when a second-level steel beam that supported the car park roof broke.  The entire shopping centre was closed off after a survey found the collapse may have caused structural damage in other areas of the building.  The dislodgement of the beam caused a partial roof collapse near the food court entrance on the second level, bringing down a plant room, air conditioning units, a cool room, toilet facilities, exhaust fans and an electrical switchboard. Police set up an exclusion zone around the centre and redirected road traffic.  The building was closed pending further investigation.  The building reopened the following day for retail trade, although some areas in the food court remained closed.  Repairs were underway to restore the collapsed sections of the building. [ref]
