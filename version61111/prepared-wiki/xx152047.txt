[[Jack Olding]]

CATEGORIES: English businesspeople

Jack Olding of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England had a company (Jack Olding & Co. Ltd), which specialised in the import and modification of tanks and tractors during the Second World War (notably being the sole importer into the UK of Caterpillars).
He had a factory on the A1 just to the north of Hatfield, at a site now known as Oldings Corner.
After the war, partly because of government pressure caused by a shortage of dollars, he made an ultimately unsuccessful gamble by relinquishing the Caterpillar agency for what proved to be the less successful Vickers VR tractor. Indeed, the company is recognised as the only Caterpillar dealer to voluntarily give up the franchise. 
On his death the company passed to Scottish Land Development.Maurice H. Sanders, Earth and Tree Moving in War and Peace: 60 golden years, Volume I, Cortney Publications, Ashwell (1999).
Jack Olding's real name was Henry John Douglas Olding.http://www.hatfield-herts.co.uk/features/olding.html
