My GamesFever is a live daytime interactive game show formerly aired on MyNetworkTV stations owned by the Fox Television Stations Group.  Featured in the two-hour program were interactive games where the viewers could win cash prizes. The show aired from 1 p.m. – 3 p.m, in two separate feeds (Eastern and Pacific) every Monday through Friday.

==Format==

On My GamesFever, the contestants were home viewers. American residents 18 or older could enter the contest by text messaging a request or using the network's website. Potential contestants could enter up to twenty-five times per phone number on each show.
After a few moments, a contestant was notified whether or not their entry is chosen (at random) to proceed to another random selection process. If an entry was selected in the second phase, the contestant was called on his or her home or mobile phone, depending on the method of entry. The contestant then came on-air and was given a chance to play. 
Contestant selection was based on call volume, as reflected by an on-screen thermometer.  When the thermometer reached a certain level, or after a certain amount of time, a caller was selected to play the game. A $.99 fee is charged for each text message entry, in addition to standard text messaging rates charged by the wireless provider. Entries on the website were free. Regardless of the method of entry, each entry had an equal chance of being selected. Residents of certain states were ineligible to play various entry methods.
