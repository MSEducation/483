[[Campylobacter]]

CATEGORIES: Proteobacteria

Campylobacter (meaning "twisted bacteria") is a genus of microaerophilic Gram-negative bacteria.  Motile, with either unipolar or bipolar flagella, the organisms have a characteristic spiral/corkscrew appearance (see photo) and are oxidase-positive.[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=Kenneth James |editor1-last=Ryan |editor2-first=C.

==History==

The symptoms of Campylobacter infections were described in 1886 in infants by Theodor Escherich.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2006.10.047 |title=Prevalence of Campylobacter species, Helicobacter pylori and Arcobacter species in stool samples from the Venda region, Limpopo, South Africa: Studies using molecular diagnostic methods |year=2007 |last1=Samie |first1=A. |last2=Obi |first2=C.L. |last3=Barrett |first3=L.J. |last4=Powell |first4=S.M. |last5=Guerrant |first5=R.L. |journal=Journal of Infection |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=558–66 |pmid=17145081[/tpl]  These infections were named cholera infantum, or summer complaint.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-006 |title=Defining and Managing Infant Mortality: A Case Study of Philadelphia, 1870–1920 |year=2008 |last1=Condran |first1=Gretchen A. |last2=Murphy |first2=Jennifer |journal=Social Science History |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=473–513[/tpl] The genus was first discovered in 1963;[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=Irving |editor1-last=Nachamkin |editor2-first=Christine M. |editor2-last=Szymanski |editor3-first=Martin J. |editor3-last=Blaser |title=Campylobacter |edition=3rd |first1=Lies |last1=Debruyne |first2=Dirk |last2=Gevers |first3=Peter |last3=Vandamme |chapter=Taxonomy of the Family Campylobacteraceae |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=No0IaqKKkYEC&pg=PA3 |id=[tpl]hdl|1854/LU-680725[/tpl] |pages=3–25 |publisher=ASM Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-55581-437-3[/tpl] however, the organism was not isolated until 1972. Infections the United States from campylobacter—which is linked to many foods, including poultry, raw milk and produce – has risen up to 14 percent in 2012 compared to 2006-2008. They were at their highest level since 2000.[tpl]cite news|title=Infections from some foodborne germs increased, while others remained unchanged in 2012|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0418-foodborne-germs.html|accessdate=April 19, 2013|newspaper=Centers for Disease Control|date=April 18, 2013[/tpl]

==Genome and proteome==

The genomes of several Campylobacter species have been sequenced.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030015 |title=Major Structural Differences and Novel Potential Virulence Mechanisms from the Genomes of Multiple Campylobacter Species |year=2005 |last1=Fouts |first1=Derrick E. |last2=Mongodin |first2=Emmanuel F. |last3=Mandrell |first3=Robert E. |last4=Miller |first4=William G. |last5=Rasko |first5=David A. |last6=Ravel |first6=Jacques |last7=Brinkac |first7=Lauren M. |last8=Deboy |first8=Robert T. |last9=Parker |first9=Craig T. |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=3 |pages=e15 |pmid=15660156 |issue=1 |pmc=539331 |last10=Daugherty |first10=Sean C. |last11=Dodson |first11=Robert J. |last12=Durkin |first12=A.

Campylobacter species contain two flagellin genes in tandem for motility, flaA and flaB.  These genes undergo intergenic recombination, further contributing to their virulence.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Christopher C. R. |last1=Grant |first2=Michael.

Sequence features. Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 15 proteins which are uniquely found in members of the genus Campylobacter and serve as molecular markers for the genus. Eighteen other proteins were also found which were present in all species except Campylobacter fetus, which is the deepest branching Campylobacter species. A conserved insertion has also been identified which is present in all Campylobacter species except C. fetus. Additionally, 28 proteins have been identified present only in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, indicating a close relationship between these two species. Five other proteins have also been identified which are only found in C. jejuni and serve as molecular markers for the species.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-7-167 |title=Molecular signatures (unique proteins and conserved indels) that are specific for the epsilon proteobacteria (Campylobacterales) |year=2006 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=7 |pages=167 |pmid=16817973 |pmc=1557499[/tpl]

==Bacteriophage==

The confusing taxonomy of Campylobacter over the past decades make it difficult to identify the earliest reports of Campylobacter bacteriophages. Bacteriophages specific to the species we now know as C. coli and C. fetus (previously Vibrio coli and Vibrio fetus), were isolated from cattle and pigs during the 1960s.Firehammer, B.D. and Border, M.

==Pathogenesis==

Campylobacteriosis is an infection by Campylobacter.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl][tpl]full|date=January 2013[/tpl] The common routes of transmission are fecal-oral, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and the eating of raw meat. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea, periodontitis[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 |title=Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: A food production perspective |year=2007 |last1=Humphrey |first1=Tom |last2=O'Brien |first2=Sarah |last3=Madsen |first3=Mogens |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=237–57 |pmid=17368847[/tpl] or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever and pain.  The infection is usually self-limiting and in most cases, symptomatic treatment by liquid and electrolyte replacement is enough in human infections.  The use of antibiotics, on the other hand, is controversial  .[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  Symptoms typically last for five to seven days.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The sites of tissue injury include the jejunum, the ileum, and the colon.  Most strains of C jejuni produce a toxin (cytolethal distending toxin) that hinders the cells from dividing and activating the immune system.  This helps the bacteria to evade the immune system and survive for a limited time in the cells.  A cholera-like enterotoxin was once thought to be also made, but this appears not to be the case.  The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis.  Although rarely has the infection been considered a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, no unequivocal case reports exist. In some cases, a Campylobacter infection can be the underlying cause of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Gastrointestinal perforation is a rare complication of ileal infection.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1102/1470-5206.2011.0006 |title=Small bowel perforation: An unusual cause |year=2011 |last1=Jassim |first1=S.S. |last2=Malik |first2=A. |last3=Aldridge |first3=A. |journal=Grand Rounds |volume=11 |pages=17–9[/tpl]

==Treatment==

Diagnosis of the illness is made by testing a specimen of faeces (bowel motion).

==Known risks==

In January 2013, the UK's Food Standards Agency warned that two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was contaminated with campylobacter, affecting an estimated half a million people annually and killing approximately 100.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9820838/FSA-warns-that-chicken-bacteria-could-be-next-meat-scandal.html[tpl]full|date=January 2013[/tpl]
