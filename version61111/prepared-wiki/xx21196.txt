Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. ISBN 0-904235-18-1. This was the first trolleybus system in Iran and remains the country's only such system. In 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn (Imam Hossein Square),Trolleybus Magazine No. 265 (January–February 2006), pp. 16–17. National Trolleybus Association (UK). [tpl]issn|0266-7452[/tpl]. near Imam Hossein station of the Tehran Metro Line 2. Two routes running northeastwards operate almost entirely in a segregated busway located in the middle of the wide carriageway (along Damavand Khiyaban), stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres, effectively making these routes trolleybus-BRT (but they are not called such). The other three trolleybus routes run south from Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn and operate in mixed-traffic. Both route sections are served both by limited-stop services and local (making all stops) services. A 3.2-km extension from Meydan-e-Shush to Meydan-e-Rah Ahan and the railway station there opened in March 2010.Trolleybus Magazine No. 298 (July–August 2011), pp. 89–90.

==Air pollution==

Tehran suffers from severe air pollution and the city is often covered by smog making breathing difficult and causing widespread pulmonary illnesses. It is estimated that about 27 people die each day from pollution-related diseases.Har Ruz 27 Tehrāni be Dalile Āludegiye Hawā mimirand. September 18, 2006 According to local officials, 3,600 people died in a single month due to the hazardous air quality.Iran smog 'kills 3,600 in month'. BBC News Online. January 9, 2007 80% of the city's pollution is due to cars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1007.html |title=Car exhaust fumes blamed for over 80% of air pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-09-25[/tpl] The remaining 20% is due to industrial pollution. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30% of air and 50% of sound pollution in Tehran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1239.html |title=Motorcycles Account for 30% of Air Pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-12[/tpl]
In 2007 Iran imposed fuel rations but the plan has met little success in reducing the pollution levels. In 2011, with the improvements in the public transport system and the rise in fuel prices due to the new subsidies reform plan, the Government is hoping to be able to improve the problems of pollution and traffic.
The air pollution is due to several different reasons:
However, the government, is engaged in a battle to reduce air pollution. It has, for instance, encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on compressed natural gas. Furthermore, since 1979 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has set up a "Traffic Zone" (Tarhe Trāfik) covering the city center during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit.
The government is also trying to raise people's awareness about the hazards of the pollution. One method that is currently being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the current level of particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The board also displays the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), which is a general indication of air quality based on the measurements of the above-mentioned five pollutants. The Pollution Indicator Boards classify the level of each pollutant as either safe, hazardous or dangerous.

Tehran is a relatively old city; as such, it has an architectural tradition unique to itself. Archaeological investigations and excavations in Tehran demonstrate that this area was home to civilizations as far back as 6,000 years BC in the village of Rey which is now incorporated into the city.

Despite the occurrence of earthquakes during the Qajar period and before, some buildings still remain from Tehran's era of antiquity.Tehran Capital City of Iran.
