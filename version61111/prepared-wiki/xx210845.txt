==Biography==

Rabinovitch is the son of Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Rabinovitch, av beis din of the Jerusalem Rabbinical Courts, and grandson of Rabbi Shmuel Benzion Rabinovitch (d. 1950), a Lubavitcher Hasid born in Russia who brought up six children in the Old Yishuv but died at a young age. Shmuel Rabinovitch was named after his grandfather. He grew up in the Kiryat Mattersdorf neighborhood of Jerusalem[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=15009 |last=Weinstock |first=Yair |title=The Life of the 'Kotel Rabbi' |work=Mishpacha |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] and studied at Yeshivat Kol Torah in Bayit Vegan.
During his army service, he served in the Rabbinical Corps of the Israel Defense Forces. Following that, he was appointed as an area rabbi in southwest Jerusalem.
Rabinovitch was appointed to the position of Rabbi of the Western Wall by former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former chief rabbis of Israel following the death of the Rabbi of the Western Wall, Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz, in 1995.

==Rabbi of the Western Wall==

The Western Wall is a frequent source of political and religious controversy, and Rabinovitch has been involved in and commented on many such controversies.
In May 2008, Rabinovitch prevented a delegation of Roman Catholic clergy from visiting the Wall while they wore visible crosses.[tpl]cite news |first=Steve |last=Weizman |coauthors=Shawn Pogatchnik and Ian Deitch |title=Irish prelates barred from Jerusalem's Western Wall  |url=http://stage-v2.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&sid=1396773 |publisher= Associated Press |date=2008-05-02  |accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl] Rabinovitch stated that anyone was welcome to pray at the Wall as long as he or she did not offend Jewish sensibility by wearing symbols of other religions. In a similar incident in 2007 with a group of Austrian clergy, Rabinovitch claimed that when Pope John Paul II visited the Wall he had not had a visible cross but pictures of the Pope's visit contradicted this claim.[tpl]cite news |title=Austrian bishops barred from Jewish holy site in Jerusalem for wearing crosses |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/12/africa/ME-GEN-Israel-Bishops-Banned.php |publisher=Associated Press |date= 2007-11-12|accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl] In 2009, Rabinovitch refused to honor the request of Pope Benedict XVI to clear the area of Jewish worshippers upon his visit to the Western Wall, and also asked the pope to cover the gold cross he wears around his neck. Israeli diplomatic sources overruled the latter request.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1886525,00.html |title=Jerusalem Rabbi Insists the Pope Must Hide his Cross |last=McGirk |first=Tim |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |work=TIME[/tpl]
Rabinovitch has maintained rigid gender separation at the Wall, conforming to Haredi practice. In 2009, he gave authority for the police to arrest a member of Women of the Wall who was praying with a tallit (a traditional Jewish prayer shawl worn by men) and holding a Sefer Torah. The act had caused an adverse reaction from Haredi worshippers and Rabinowitz claimed "It is an act of provocation that seeks to turn the Western Wall into disputed territory... A prayer that causes contention and desecration of the sanctity of the Western Wall has no value. It is an act of protest".[tpl]cite news |last=Weiss |first=Efrat |title=Police arrest woman praying at Western Wall |work=Ynetnews |date=November 18, 2009 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3807090,00.html[/tpl] 
Twice a year, Rabinovitch and his assistants collect the hundreds of thousands of prayer notes placed in the Wall and bury them in the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.

==Escorting dignitaries==

Rabinovitch accompanies many heads of state, religious figures, foreign dignitaries, and media on tours of the Wall and the Western Wall Tunnel. He escorted US First Lady Laura Bush together with Gila Katsav, wife of then-President of Israel Moshe Katsav, on a visit in 2005,[tpl]cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/05/images/20050522-4_p44900-326a-515h.html |title=White House Photos |date = May 2005|publisher=The White House |accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] and Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska, in 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4045160,00.html |title=Sarah Palin Visits Western Wall |last=Zitun |first=Yoav |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |work=Ynetnews[/tpl]
In July 2008, Rabinovitch accompanied U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama on a pre-dawn visit to the Wall. During this visit, Obama placed a prayer note in the Wall.[tpl]Cite news|first=Tim|last=McGirk|title=Obama's Private Prayer Leaked|date=2008-07-25|work=TIME|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1826734,00.html[/tpl] After Obama and his entourage departed, his note—written on hotel stationery—was removed from the Wall by a seminary student who sold it to the Maariv newspaper. The newspaper published the note, prompting criticism from other news sources and from Rabinovitch for violating the privacy that is inherent in notes placed in the Wall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/27/obama.prayer/ |title= Rabbi Condemns Release of Purported Obama Prayer Note |last=|first=|accessdate=2010-01-18|date=27 July 2008|publisher=CNN[/tpl]

==Other activities==

Rabinovitch is the chairman of the The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, a government-mandated organization which preserves and develops the Western Wall site and Western Wall Tunnel, as well as promotes the value of the site through education.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?Id=139 |title=About Us |publisher=The Western Wall Heritage Foundation |accessdate=27 June 2011[/tpl] Rabinovitch has also headed a public commission for environmental quality, and supervision and licensing of burials in Israel. He is a former vice president of the Aleh Children's Home in Jerusalem.

==Works==

Rabinovitch wrote the two-volume Sheilos u'Teshuvos Shaarei Tzion, describing the many halakhic questions that have arisen at the Western Wall and other holy sites."Book Review: Sefer Shaarei Tzion, Volume 2". Hamodia, June 21, 2012, p. C2. One chapter in Volume 1 deals exclusively with the question of disposing the prayer notes commonly inserted between the stones of the Wall. Rabinovitch rules that burning is a "pure" way to deal with the notes, but burying them is more honorable.
He is also the author of Minhagei HaKotel, a book on the history and customs of the Western Wall.
