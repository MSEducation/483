==History==

County Waterford is colloquially known as "The Déise", pronounced "day-sha" ([tpl]lang|ga|An Déise[/tpl]).  Some time between the 4th and 8th centuries, a tribe of native Gaelic people called the Déisi were driven from southern county Meath/north Kildare, conquering and settling here. The ancient principality of the Déise is today roughly coterminous with the current Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore. 
The westernmost of the baronies are "Decies within Drum" and "Decies without Drum", separated by the Drum-Fineen hills. There are many megalithic tombs and ogham stones[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prehistoricwaterford.com/sites-a-z/|title=Prehistoric Waterford tombs, dolmens and standing stones.[/tpl] in the county. The Viking influence can still be seen with Reginald's Tower, one of the first buildings to use a bricks and mortar construction method in Ireland. Woodstown, a settlement dating to the 9th Century was discovered 5.5 kilometres west of Waterford city. It was the largest settlement outside of Scandinavia and the only large-scale 9th Century Viking settlement discovered to date in Western Europe. Other architectural features are products of the Anglo-Norman Invasion of Ireland and its effects.

==Local government and politics==

Prior to the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001, the county was a unified whole despite the presence of two local authorities.[tpl]fact|date=February 2012[/tpl] Since that time, the administrative re-organisation has reduced the geographical extent of the county by the extent of the area under the jurisdiction of Waterford City Council. Today, the geographic extent of the county is limited to the area under the jurisdiction of Waterford County Council. Each local authority ranks equally as first level local administrative units of the NUTS 3 South-East Region for Eurostat purposes. There are 34 LAU 1 entities in the Republic of Ireland. The remit of Waterford County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the remit of Waterford City Council. Both local authorities are responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing. 
The county is part of the South constituency for the purposes of European elections. For elections to Dáil Éireann, the county is part of two constituencies: Waterford and Tipperary South. Together they return 7 deputies (TDs) to the Dáil. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009 defines the Waterford constituency as "The county of Waterford, except the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Tipperary South; and the city of Waterford."."[tpl]cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=Irish Statute Book database |accessdate=29 September 2010[/tpl]
