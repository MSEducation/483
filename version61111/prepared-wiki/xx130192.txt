In 1997, Mr. Sears was President of the Douglas Aircraft Company division of McDonnell Douglas.  In 2003, Mr. Sears was Boeing's CFO.

Druyun, who has been vice president and deputy general manager of Missile Defense Systems, also has been dismissed for cause.  Sears was dismissed for violating company policies by communicating directly and indirectly with Druyun about future employment when she had not disqualified herself from acting in her official government capacity on matters involving Boeing. In addition, an internally initiated review found both attempted to conceal their misconduct.[/tpl]  For his part in the Darleen Druyun scandal, Mr. Sears was sentenced to four months in prison, a $250,000 fine, and 200 hours of community service.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dodig.mil/IGInformation/IGInformationReleases/SearsSent021805.pdf |pages=2 |title=News release - Sears sentenced |accessdate=2010-10-18 |first=Paul J. |last=McNulty |authorlink=Paul J.

Insiders say the controversy was part of his attempt to amass a power base at his rivals' expense.  In 2002, Druyun, an Air Force procurement czar looking to move to the private sector, was possibly the most sought-after executive-to-be in the aerospace industry. With her understanding of the Pentagon procurement process and her contacts, Boeing, and most of its rivals, tried hard to land her. James F. Albaugh, a front-runner in the Boeing CEO race and head of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems, talked with her at least once under the assumption that she had recused herself from contract negotiations with Boeing, but he came up dry. It was only when Sears went back for one last try that Boeing had a deal, according to e-mail released as part of the criminal investigation of Sears and Druyun. That coup gave Sears a huge advantage over both Albaugh and Mulally. It also had the potential to expand his power base by making Druyun an ally. Sears previously declined to comment through an attorney and could not be reached for this story.[/tpl]
