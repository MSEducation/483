Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose the formation of a new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis.<ref name="BioOnline"/> The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled ''New Nation'' and established the [[Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia]] to pass laws.<ref name="newnation">[tpl]Cite news|title=Local Laws|publisher=New Nation|date=15 April 1870|page=3|work=Vol I No. 18[/tpl]</ref>

===Canadian resistance and the execution of Scott===

Despite the apparent progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and Thomas Scott, were arrested near Fort Garry.
Boulton was tried by a tribunal headed by Ambroise-Dydime LÃ©pine and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government.[ref]
