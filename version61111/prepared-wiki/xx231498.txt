CATEGORIES: Sport in Lebanon, Hiking trails in Lebanon

The Lebanon Mountain Trail (LMT) is a long-distance hiking trail in Lebanon. It extends from Qbaiyat in the north of Lebanon to Marjaayoun in the south, a [tpl]convert|440|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] path that transects more than 75 towns and villages at altitudes ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters (about 3,000-5,600 feet) above sea level. The LMT aims to showcase the natural beauty and cultural wealth of Lebanon’s mountains and to demonstrate the determination of the people of Lebanon to conserve their heritage.  The trail brings communities closer together and expands economic opportunities in rural areas through environmentally  and socially responsible tourism.
