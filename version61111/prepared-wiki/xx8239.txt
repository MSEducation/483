[[Migraine]]

CATEGORIES: Migraine

Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. The word derives from the Greek ἡμικρανία (hemikrania), "pain on one side of the head",[tpl]cite web |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=ἡμικρανία |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher= |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28mikrani%2Fa[/tpl] on Perseus from ἡμι- (hemi-), "half", and κρανίον (kranion), "skull".[tpl]cite book |first1=Kenneth |last1=Anderson |first2=Lois E. |last2=Anderson |first3=Walter D. |last3=Glanze |title=Mosby's Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary |year=1994 |publisher=Mosby |isbn=978-0-8151-6111-0 |page=998 |edition=4[/tpl]
Typically the headache affects one half of the head, is pulsating in nature, and lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.[tpl]Cite journal|title=The International Classification of Headache Disorders: 2nd edition |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=24 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=9–160 |year=2004 |pmid=14979299 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00653.x |author1= Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society[/tpl] as PDF Up to one-third of people with migraine headaches perceive an aura: a transient visual, sensory, language, or motor disturbance which signals that the headache will soon occur. Occasionally an aura can occur with little or no headache following it.
Migraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Piane|first=M|coauthors=Lulli, P; Farinelli, I; Simeoni, S; De Filippis, S; Patacchioli, FR; Martelletti, P|title=Genetics of migraine and pharmacogenomics: some considerations|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=December 2007|volume=8|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=18058067|doi=10.1007/s10194-007-0427-2|pmc=2779399[/tpl] About two-thirds of cases run in families.

It is, however, believed to be a neurovascular disorder. The primary theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dodick DW, Gargus JJ |title=Why migraines strike |journal=Sci.

Initial recommended management is with simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) for the headache, an antiemetic for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers. Specific agents such as triptans or ergotamines may be used by those for whom simple analgesics are not effective. Globally, approximately 15% of the population is affected by migraines at some point in life.

==Signs and symptoms==

Migraines typically present with self-limited, recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms. About 15-30% of people with migraines experience migraines with an aura[tpl]cite book|last=Gutman|first=Sharon A.|title=Quick reference neuroscience for rehabilitation professionals : the essential neurologic principles underlying rehabilitation practice|year=2008|publisher=SLACK|location=Thorofare, NJ|isbn=9781556428005|pages=231|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Ea0czzNxpkQC&pg=PA231|edition=2[/tpl] and those who have migraines with aura also frequently have migraines without aura. The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks is variable. A migraine lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus.[tpl]cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

===Prodrome phase===

Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines,[tpl]cite book|last=Rae-Grant|first=by D. Joanne Lynn, Herbert B. Newton, Alexander D.|title=The 5-minute neurology consult|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683307238|pages=26|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Atuv8-rVXRoC&pg=PA26[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Aminoff|first=Roger P.

===Aura phase===

An aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache. Auras appear gradually over a number of minutes and generally last fewer than 60 minutes. Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one. Visual effects occur most frequently; they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects. Vision disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person's ability to read or drive). These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle. Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines. Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.
Sensory aurae are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras. Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose-mouth area on the same side. Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense. Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems. Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.
Rarely, an aura occurs without a subsequent headache;The Headaches, pp.407–19 this is known as a silent migraine. However, it is difficult to assess the frequency of such cases, because patients who do not experience symptoms severe enough to drive them to seek treatment, may not realise that anything special is happening to them, and pass it off without reporting anything.

===Pain phase===

Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.[tpl]cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=1116–1117 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=[/tpl] It usually comes on gradually and is aggravated by physical activity. In more than 40% of cases however the pain may be bilateral, and neck pain is commonly associated.[tpl]cite book|last=Tepper|first=edited by Stewart J. Tepper, Deborah E.|title=The Cleveland Clinic manual of headache therapy|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461401780|pages=6|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=uaG08nAKG_wC&pg=PA6|date=2011-01-01[/tpl] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraines without an aura. Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head. The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults, however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bigal|first=ME|coauthors=Arruda, MA|title=Migraine in the pediatric population – evolving concepts|journal=Headache|date=July 2010|volume=50|issue=7|pages=1130–43|pmid=20572878|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01717.x[/tpl] The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.[tpl]cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability. In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body,[tpl]cite journal|last=Kaniecki|first=RG|title=Basilar-type migraine|journal=Current pain and headache reports|date=June 2009|volume=13|issue=3|pages=217–20|pmid=19457282|doi=10.1007/s11916-009-0036-7[/tpl] common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion. Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third.[tpl]cite book|last=Walton|first=edited by Robert P.

Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.

===Postdrome===

The effects of migraine may persist for some days after the main headache has ended; this is called the migraine postdrome. Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The patient may feel tired or "hung over" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kelman L |title=The postdrome of the acute migraine attack |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=214–20 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16426278 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2005.01026.x[/tpl] According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise."[tpl]cite book |author=Halpern, Audrey L.; Silberstein, Stephen D. |chapter=Ch. 9: The Migraine Attack—A Clinical Description |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7326/ |editor=Kaplan PW, Fisher RS |title=Imitators of Epilepsy |publisher=Demos Medical |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=1-888799-83-8 |pages= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7321/ |edition=2 |id=NBK7326[/tpl]

==Cause==

The underlying causes of migraines are unknown.[tpl]cite journal |author=Robbins MS, Lipton RB |title=The epidemiology of primary headache disorders |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=107–19 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20352581 |doi=10.1055/s-0030-1249220 [/tpl] However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors. They run in families in about two-thirds of cases and rarely occur due to a single gene defect. While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true. A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder,The Headaches, pp. 246–47 as are many biological events or triggers.

===Genetics===

Studies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine headaches. This genetic relationship is stronger for migraines with aura than for migraines without aura. A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.
Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schürks|first=M|title=Genetics of migraine in the age of genome-wide association studies|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=January 2012|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–9|pmid=22072275|doi=10.1007/s10194-011-0399-0|pmc=3253157[/tpl] One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.[tpl]cite journal|last=de Vries|first=B|coauthors=Frants, RR; Ferrari, MD; van den Maagdenberg, AM|title=Molecular genetics of migraine|journal=Human Genetics|date=July 2009|volume=126|issue=1|pages=115–32|pmid=19455354|doi=10.1007/s00439-009-0684-z[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Montagna|first=P|title=Migraine genetics|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|date=September 2008|volume=8|issue=9|pages=1321–30|pmid=18759544|doi=10.1586/14737175.8.9.1321[/tpl] Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ducros|first=A|title=of migraine.|journal=Revue neurologique|date=Apr 22, 2013|pmid=23618705|volume=169|issue=5|pages=360–71|doi=10.1016/j.neurol.2012.11.010[/tpl] Three of these genes are involved in ion transport. The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex. Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

===Triggers===

Migraines may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases and others the majority. Many things have been labeled as triggers, however the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Levy D, Strassman AM, Burstein R |title=A critical view on the role of migraine triggers in the genesis of migraine pain |journal=Headache |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=953–7 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19545256 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01444.x [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Martin PR |title=Behavioral management of migraine headache triggers: learning to cope with triggers |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20425190 |doi=10.1007/s11916-010-0112-z [/tpl]  A trigger may be encountered up to 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms.

====Physiological aspects====

Common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches). Migraines are more likely to occur around menstruation.[tpl]cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=EA|title=Prevention and treatment of menstrual migraine|journal=Drugs|date=2010-10-01|volume=70|issue=14|pages=1799–818|pmid=20836574|doi=10.2165/11538090-000000000-00000[/tpl] Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lay|first=CL|coauthors=Broner, SW|title=Migraine in women|journal=Neurologic Clinics|date=May 2009|volume=27|issue=2|pages=503–11|pmid=19289228|doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2009.01.002[/tpl] These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura. Migraines typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters or following menopause.

====Dietary aspects====

Reviews of dietary triggers have found that evidence mostly relies on self-reports and is not rigorous enough to prove or disprove any particular triggers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rockett|first=FC|coauthors=de Oliveira, VR; Castro, K; Chaves, ML; Perla Ada, S; Perry, ID|title=Dietary aspects of migraine trigger factors|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=June 2012|volume=70|issue=6|pages=337–56|pmid=22646127|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2012.00468.x[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Holzhammer J, Wöber C |title=trigger factors that provoke migraine and tension-type headache |language=German |journal=Schmerz |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=151–9 |date=April 2006 |pmid=15806385 |doi=10.1007/s00482-005-0390-2[/tpl] Regarding specific agents there does not appear to be evidence for an effect of tyramine on migraine,[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63523-5 |author=Jansen SC, van Dusseldorp M, Bottema KC, Dubois AE |title=Intolerance to dietary biogenic amines: a review |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=233–40; quiz 241–2, 296 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14533654 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1081-1206&volume=91&issue=3&spage=233&epage=241[/tpl] and while monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported as a dietary trigger,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Sun-Edelstein C, Mauskop A |title=Foods and supplements in the management of migraine headaches |journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19454881 |doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31819a6f65[/tpl] evidence does not consistently support this.[tpl]cite journal |author=Freeman M |title=Reconsidering the effects of monosodium glutamate: a literature review |journal=J Am Acad Nurse Pract |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=482–6 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16999713 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2006.00160.x [/tpl]

====Environmental aspects====

A review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded the overall evidence was of poor quality, but nevertheless suggested people with migraines take some preventive measures related to indoor air quality and lighting.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedman DI, De ver Dye T |title=Migraine and the environment |journal=Headache |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=941–52 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19545255 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01443.x [/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Migraines are believed to be a neurovascular disorder[tpl]cite journal |author=Bartleson JD, Cutrer FM |title=Migraine update.

===Aura===

Cortical spreading depression or spreading depression of Leão is bursts of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with an aura.The Headaches, Chp. 28, pp. 269–72 There are a number of explanations for its occurrence including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell. After the burst of activity the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours. It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.

===Pain===

The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine is unknown.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olesen|first=J|coauthors=Burstein, R; Ashina, M; Tfelt-Hansen, P|title=Origin of pain in migraine: evidence for peripheral sensitization|journal=Lancet neurology|date=July 2009|volume=8|issue=7|pages=679–90|pmid=19539239|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70090-0[/tpl] Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon)[tpl]cite journal|last=Akerman|first=S|coauthors=Holland, PR; Goadsby, PJ|title=Diencephalic and brainstem mechanisms in migraine|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=2011-09-20|volume=12|issue=10|pages=570–84|pmid=21931334|doi=10.1038/nrn3057[/tpl] while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck). The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp. The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shevel|first=E|title=The extracranial vascular theory of migraine – a great story confirmed by the facts|journal=Headache|date=March 2011|volume=51|issue=3|pages=409–17|pmid=21352215|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.01844.x[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms. Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis. It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.
The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the "5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria":
If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cousins|first=G|coauthors=Hijazze, S; Van de Laar, FA; Fahey, T|title=Diagnostic accuracy of the ID Migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Headache|date=Jul–Aug 2011|volume=51|issue=7|pages=1140–8|pmid=21649653|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.01916.x[/tpl] In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%. In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.

===Classification===

Migraines were first comprehensively classified in 1988.The Headaches, Pg 232-233 The International Headache Society most recently updated their classification of headaches in 2004. According to this classification migraines are primary headaches along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nappi|first=G|title=Introduction to the new International Classification of Headache Disorders|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=September 2005|volume=6|issue=4|pages=203–4|pmid=16362664|doi=10.1007/s10194-005-0185-y|pmc=3452009[/tpl]
Migraines are divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):

===Abdominal migraine===

The diagnosis of abdominal migraines is controversial.[tpl]cite book|last=Davidoff|first=Robert A.|title=Migraine : manifestations, pathogenesis, and management|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford u.a.|isbn=9780195137057|page=81|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=PAdn6xC3KlAC&pg=PA81 |edition=2 [/tpl] Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine[tpl]cite journal|last=Russell|first=G|coauthors=Abu-Arafeh, I, Symon, DN|title=Abdominal migraine: evidence for existence and treatment options|journal=Paediatric drugs|year=2002|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–8|pmid=11817981|doi=10.2165/00128072-200204010-00001[/tpl] or are at least a precursor to migraines. These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours. They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraines. Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.

===Differential diagnosis===

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headaches presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subaracchnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset. Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.
Those with stable headaches which meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.[ref]

==Prevention==

Preventive treatments of migraines include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.
The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Modi S, Lowder DM |title=Medications for migraine prophylaxis |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=72–8 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16417067 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=16417067[/tpl] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache.

===Medication===

Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.[tpl]Cite book|author=Kaniecki R, Lucas S. |chapter=Treatment of primary headache: preventive treatment of migraine |title=Standards of care for headache diagnosis and treatment |location=Chicago |publisher=National Headache Foundation |year=2004 |pages=40–52[/tpl] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol, and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use. Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied however for gabapentin. Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity, while frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Loder|first=E|coauthors=Burch, R; Rizzoli, P|title=The 2012 AHS/AAN guidelines for prevention of episodic migraine: a summary and comparison with other recent clinical practice guidelines|journal=Headache|date=June 2012|volume=52|issue=6|pages=930–45|pmid=22671714|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02185.x[/tpl]

===Alternative therapies===

While acupuncture may be effective, "true" acupuncture is not more efficient than sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly. Both have a possibility of being more effective than routine care, with fewer adverse effects than preventative medications.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K |last2=Allais |first2=G |last3=Brinkhaus |first3=B |last4=Manheimer |first4=E|last5=Vickers |first5=A |last6=White |first6=AR |editor1-last=Linde |editor1-first=Klaus |title=Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) |issue=1 |pages=CD001218 |year=2009 |pmid=19160193|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001218.pub2 |pmc=3099267[/tpl] Chiropractic manipulation, physiotherapy, massage and relaxation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.[tpl]cite journal |pages=127–33 |doi=10.1007/s10194-011-0296-6 |pmc=3072494 |title=Manual therapies for migraine: A systematic review |year=2011 |last1=Chaibi |first1=Aleksander |last2=Tuchin |first2=Peter J. |last3=Russell |first3=Michael Bjørn |journal=The Journal of Headache and Pain |volume=12 |issue=2 |pmid=21298314[/tpl] The evidence to support spinal manipulation is poor and insufficient to support its use.[tpl]cite journal|last=Posadzki|first=P|coauthors=Ernst, E|title=Spinal manipulations for the treatment of migraine: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials|journal=Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache|date=Jun 2011|volume=31|issue=8|pages=964–70|pmid=21511952|doi=10.1177/0333102411405226[/tpl] Of the alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.[tpl]cite journal|last=Holland|first=S|coauthors=Silberstein, SD; Freitag, F; Dodick, DW; Argoff, C; Ashman, E; Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache, Society|title=Evidence-based guideline update: NSAIDs and other complementary treatments for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society|journal=Neurology|date=2012-04-24|volume=78|issue=17|pages=1346–53|pmid=22529203|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182535d0c|pmc=3335449[/tpl]

===Devices and surgery===

Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.[tpl]cite journal |pages=111–27 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.007 |title=Efficacy of biofeedback for migraine: A meta-analysis |year=2007 |last1=Nestoriuc |first1=Yvonne |last2=Martin |first2=Alexandra |journal=Pain |volume=128 |pmid=17084028 |issue=1–2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=18726688 |year=2008 |last1=Nestoriuc |first1=Y |last2=Martin |first2=A |last3=Rief |first3=W |last4=Andrasik |first4=F |title=Biofeedback treatment for headache disorders: A comprehensive efficacy review |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=125–40 |doi=10.1007/s10484-008-9060-3 |journal=Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback[/tpl] Neurostimulation uses implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraines with encouraging results for severe cases.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=20816443 |year=2010 |last1=Schoenen |first1=J|last2=Allena |first2=M |last3=Magis |first3=D |title=Neurostimulation therapy in intractable headaches |volume=97|pages=443–50 |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(10)97037-1 |journal=Handbook of clinical neurology / edited by P.J.

==Management==

There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and pharmacological prevention. Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack. The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent. This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially narcotic analgesics. Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.[tpl]cite web|title=American Headache Society Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-headache-society/|publisher=Choosing Wisely|accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl]

===Analgesics===

Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=B|coauthors=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=2011-02-01|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868[/tpl] Several NSAIDs have evidence to support their use. Ibuprofen has been found to provide effective pain relief in about half of people[tpl]cite journal |author=Rabbie R, Derry S, Moore RA, McQuay HJ |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=10 |issue= 10|pages=CD008039 |year=2010 |pmid=20927770 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008039.pub2 |editor1-last=Moore |editor1-first=Maura |title=Ibuprofen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults[/tpl] and diclofenac has been found effective.[tpl]cite journal |author=Derry S, Rabbie R, Moore RA |title=Diclofenac with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD008783 |year=2012 |pmid=22336852 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008783.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Moore |editor1-first=Maura[/tpl]
Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kirthi V, Derry S, Moore RA, McQuay HJ |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=4 |issue= 4|pages=CD008041 |year=2010 |pmid=20393963 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008041.pub2 |editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=Maura |title=Aspirin with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults[/tpl] Ketorolac is available in an intravenous formulation. Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Derry S, Moore RA, McQuay HJ |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=11 |issue= 11|pages=CD008040 |year=2010 |pmid=21069700 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008040.pub2 |editor1-last=Moore |editor1-first=Maura |title=Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults[/tpl] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.

===Triptans===

Triptans such as sumatriptan are effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnston MM, Rapoport AM |title=Triptans for the management of migraine |journal=Drugs |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=1505–18 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20687618 |doi=10.2165/11537990-000000000-00000 [/tpl] They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics. The different forms available include oral, injectable, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets. In general, all the triptans appear equally effective, with similar side effects. However, individuals may respond better to specific ones. Most side effects are mild, such as flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred. They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease, who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems. In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.[tpl]cite web|title=Generic migraine drug could relieve your pain and save you money|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/best-buy-drugs/triptan.htm|work=Best Buy Drugs|publisher=Consumer Reports[/tpl] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution. They are not addictive, but may cause medication overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Tepper Stewart J. |last2=Tepper |first2=Deborah E. |title=Breaking the cycle of medication overuse headache |journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=236–42 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20360117 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.77a.09147 |first1=S. J.[/tpl]

===Ergotamines===

Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms. They appear equally effective to the triptans,[tpl]cite journal|last=Kelley|first=NE|coauthors=Tepper, DE|title=Rescue therapy for acute migraine, part 1: triptans, dihydroergotamine, and magnesium|journal=Headache|date=January 2012|volume=52|issue=1|pages=114–28|pmid=22211870|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.02062.x[/tpl] are less expensive,[tpl]cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

In the most debilitating cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morren|first=JA|coauthors=Galvez-Jimenez, N|title=Where is dihydroergotamine mesylate in the changing landscape of migraine therapy?|journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy|date=December 2010|volume=11|issue=18|pages=3085–93|pmid=21080856|doi=10.1517/14656566.2010.533839[/tpl]

===Other===

Intravenous metoclopramide or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options. Metoclopramide is the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department. A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Colman I |title=Parenteral dexamethasone for acute severe migraine headache: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials for preventing recurrence |journal=BMJ |volume=336|issue=7657 |pages=1359–61 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18541610 |pmc=2427093|doi=10.1136/bmj.39566.806725.BE|author-separator=,|author2=Friedman BW|author3=Brown MD|display-authors=3|last4=Innes|first4=G.
