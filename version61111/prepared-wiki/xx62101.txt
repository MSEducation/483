[[Amiga 4000]]

CATEGORIES: Amiga, Computer-related introductions in 1992

The Commodore Amiga 4000, or A4000, is the successor of the A2000 and A3000 computers.  There are two models, the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a Motorola 68040 CPU, and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a Motorola 68EC030.
The Amiga 4000 introduced the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics and continued the A3000's system architecture. However, the SCSI peripheral interface was replaced by lower cost IDE.
The A4000 is housed in a white desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later Commodore released an expanded tower version called the A4000T.

==Technical information==

===Processor and RAM===

The stock A4000 shipped with either a Motorola 68EC030 or 68040 CPU, 2 MB of Amiga Chip RAM and up to 16 MB of additional RAM in 32-bit SIMMs.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992[/tpl] There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the Chip RAM to 8MB.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011[/tpl] Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher rated 68040, 68060 and PowerPC CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher capacity RAM (128 MB or greater).

===A4000-CR version===

Unlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the motherboard does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2 MB RAM surface-mounted on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (Cost Reduced) and the surface mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost reduced models also made use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable NiCd battery. The NiCd backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging A4000 because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the motherboard.

===Graphics and sound===

The A4000 was the first Amiga model to ship with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduced improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 128, 256 and 262,144 (HAM-8) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the Paula sound chip), namely, four DMA-driven 8-bit PCM channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.

===Peripherals and expansion===

The A4000 has a number of Amiga compatible connectors including two DE-9 ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin RS-232 serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as, MIDI interfaces, serial modems and sound samplers.
Unlike early high-end Amiga models, the A4000 does not have an on-board DMA SCSI controller, instead a basic IDE controller was substituted. However, it is possible to add a SCSI controller as an expansion module.
Like the earlier Amiga 3000, the A4000 has four internal 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the AutoConfig standard, such as, graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even USB controllers.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc.[/tpl] One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the NewTek Video Toaster system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial desktop video production of standard-definition, broadcast quality video, consisting of tools for video switching, chroma keying, character generation, animation, and image manipulation.
The three ISA slots can be activated by use of a "bridgeboard", which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM PC Compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386 or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed in the two remaining ISA slots.
Later, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provided PCI slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as, graphic, sound and network cards.

===Operating System===

The A4000 shipped with AmigaOS 3.0, consisting of Workbench 3.0 and Kickstart 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were A4000 compatible as software only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.
AmigaOS 4, a PowerPC native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a CyberStorm PPC board is installed. Likewise, MorphOS, an alternative Amiga compatible operating system can be used with this hardware.
Variants of platform independent operating systems such as Linux and BSD can also be used with the A4000.
