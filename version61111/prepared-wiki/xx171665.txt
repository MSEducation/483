The preliminary engineering and evaluation design work were done in spring 2007.  The plant will use ConocoPhillips' proprietary natural gas liquefaction technology (Optimized CascadeSM Process) and it is to be constructed by Bechtel.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article149498.ece | title = Bechtel wins PNG gas plant race | newspaper = Upstream Online | publisher = NHST Media Group | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2008-03-01 | id = [tpl]subscription required[/tpl][/tpl]
