This is a list of sister states, regions, and cities in the U.S. state of New York. Sister cities, known in Europe as town twins, are cities which partner with each other to promote human contact and cultural links, although this partnering is not limited to cities and often includes counties, regions, states and other sub-national entities.
Many New York State jurisdictions partner with foreign cities through Sister Cities International, an organization whose goal is to, "Promote peace through mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation."[tpl]cite web | title =Mission and Goals | publisher =Sister Cities International | url =http://www.sister-cities.org/sci/aboutsci/mission | accessdate =2007-08-01[/tpl] Sister cities interact with each other across a broad range of activities, from health care and education to business and the arts.[tpl]cite web | title =Frequently Asked Questions | publisher =Sister Cities International | url =http://www.sister-cities.org/sci/aboutsci/faqs | accessdate =2007-08-01[/tpl]
