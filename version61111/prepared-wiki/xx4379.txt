Thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43[/tpl] Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49[/tpl] It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem,Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, ISBN 0-03-029558-0. though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of irrational numbers.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R.

Plato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 86[/tpl] His Platonic Academy, in Athens, became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as Eudoxus of Cnidus, came.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 88[/tpl] Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as "breadthless length"), and reorganized the assumptions.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 87[/tpl] The analytic method is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name.
Eudoxus (408–c.355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, a precursor of modern integration[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 92[/tpl] and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 93[/tpl] The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 91[/tpl] while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, Aristotle (384—c.322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of logic.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 98[/tpl]
In the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the Musaeum of Alexandria.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 100[/tpl] It was there that Euclid (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The Elements introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104[/tpl] The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.Howard Eves, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, ISBN 0-03-029558-0 p. 141: "No work, except The Bible, has been more widely used...." In addition to the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry, the Elements was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as number theory, algebra and solid geometry, including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also wrote extensively on other subjects, such as conic sections, optics, spherical geometry, and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 102[/tpl]
The first woman mathematician recorded by history was Hypatia of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).Ecclesiastical History,Bk VI: Chap. 15
Archimedes (c.287–212 BC) of Syracuse, widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity,[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120[/tpl] used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130[/tpl] He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of π with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of π then known, 3[tpl]frac|10|71[/tpl] Apollonius of Perga (c. 262-190 BC) made significant advances to the study of conic sections, showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145[/tpl] He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely parabola ("place beside" or "comparison"), "ellipse" ("deficiency"), and "hyperbola" ("a throw beyond").[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 146[/tpl] His work Conics is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 152[/tpl] While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 156[/tpl]
Around the same time, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276-194 BC) devised the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 161[/tpl] The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the "Golden Age" of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 175[/tpl] Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably trigonometry, largely to address the needs of astronomers. Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190-120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162[/tpl] Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD) is credited with Heron's formula for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.S.C. Roy. Complex numbers: lattice simulation and zeta function applications, p. 1 http://books.google.com/books?id=J-2BRbFa5IkC&pg=PA1&dq=Heron+imaginary+numbers&hl=en&ei=UzjXToXwBMqhiALc9I2CCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Heron%20imaginary%20numbers&f=false. Harwood Publishing, 2007, 131 pages. ISBN 1-904275-25-7 Menelaus of Alexandria (c. 100 AD) pioneered spherical trigonometry through Menelaus' theorem.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 163[/tpl] The most complete and influential trigonometric work of antiquity is the Almagest of Ptolemy (c. AD 90-168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 164[/tpl] Ptolemy is also credited with Ptolemy's theorem for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of π outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 168[/tpl]
Following a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the "Silver Age" of Greek mathematics.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178[/tpl] During this period, Diophantus made significant advances in algebra, particularly indeterminate analysis, which is also known as "Diophantine analysis".[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180[/tpl] The study of Diophantine equations and Diophantine approximations is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the Arithmetica, a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and indeterminate equations.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 181[/tpl] The Arithmetica had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as Pierre de Fermat, who arrived at his famous Last Theorem after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the Arithmetica (that of dividing a square into two squares).[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 183[/tpl] Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the Arithmetica being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.

==Chinese mathematics==

Early Chinese mathematics is so different from that of other parts of the world that it is reasonable to assume independent development.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 201[/tpl] The oldest extant mathematical text from China is the Chou Pei Suan Ching, variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a date of about 300 BC appears reasonable.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 196[/tpl]
Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called "rod numerals" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.[tpl]Harvnb|Katz|2007|pp=194–199[/tpl] Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for "1", followed by the symbol for "100", then the symbol for "2" followed by the symbol for "10", followed by the symbol for "3". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 198[/tpl] Rod numerals allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the suan pan, or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the suan pan is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in Xu Yue's Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures.
The oldest existent work on geometry in China comes from the philosophical Mohist canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of Mozi (470–390 BC). The Mo Jing described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Needham |first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986|title=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|ref=harv|location=Taipei|publisher=Caves Books Ltd.|postscript=[/tpl]
In 212 BC, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang (Shi Huang-ti) commanded all books in the Qin Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the book burning of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles and values of π. It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Liu Hui commented on the work in the 3rd century AD, and gave a value of π accurate to 5 decimal places.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 202[/tpl] Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD Zu Chongzhi computed the value of π to seven decimal places, which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years. He also established a method which would later be called Cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere.[ref]

The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurs in the 13th century (latter part of the Sung period), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the Precious Mirror of the Four Elements by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280-1303), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to Horner's method. The Precious Mirror also contains a diagram of Pascal's triangle with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 205[/tpl] The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the magic square and magic circles, described in ancient times and perfected by Yang Hui (AD 1238–1298).
Even after European mathematics began to flourish during the Renaissance, European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.

==Indian mathematics==

The earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished between 2600 and 1900 BC in the Indus river basin. Their cities were laid out with geometric regularity, but no known mathematical documents survive from this civilization.[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 206[/tpl]
The oldest extant mathematical records from India are the Sulba Sutras (dated variously between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century AD),[tpl]Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 207[/tpl] appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and others.T. K. Puttaswamy, "The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians", pp. 411–2, in [tpl]Cite book|title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics|editor1-first=Helaine|editor1-last=Selin|editor1-link=Helaine Selin|editor2-first=Ubiratan|editor2-last=D'Ambrosio|editor2-link=Ubiratan D'Ambrosio|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-0260-2|ref=harv|postscript=[/tpl] As with Egypt, the preoccupation with temple functions points to an origin of mathematics in religious ritual. The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing a circle with approximately the same area as a given square, which imply several different approximations of the value of π.R. P. Kulkarni, "The Value of π known to Śulbasūtras", Indian Journal for the History of Science, 13 1 (1978): 32-41J.J. Connor, E.F. Robertson. The Indian Sulba Sutras Univ. of St. Andrew, Scotland http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_sulbasutras.html The values for π are 4 x (13/15)2 (3.0044...), 25/8 (3.125), 900/289 (3.11418685...), 1156/361 (3.202216...), and 339/108 (3.1389). In addition, they compute the square root of 2 to several decimal places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of the Pythagorean theorem.J.J. Connor, E.F. Robertson. The Indian Sulba Sutras Univ. of St. Andrew, Scotland http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_sulbasutras.html All of these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, indicating Mesopotamian influence. It is not known to what extent the Sulba Sutras influenced later Indian mathematicians. As in China, there is a lack of continuity in Indian mathematics; significant advances are separated by long periods of inactivity.
