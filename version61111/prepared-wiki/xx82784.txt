Babycham is the trade name of a light, sparkling perry invented by Francis Showering, a brewer in Shepton Mallet in Somerset, England; the name is now owned by Accolade Wines.  The brand was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25302633 | work=BBC News | title=How Babycham changed British drinking habits | date=23 December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Launched in the United Kingdom in 1953,[tpl]cite web|title=Babycham Collectables|url=http://www.millersantiquesguide.com/articles/babycham/|publisher=Miller's antiques and collectables|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]  It was the first alcoholic product to be advertised on British commercial television, the campaign being launched in 1957, with the drink originally marketed as a "genuine champagne perry".
In 1965, the Babycham Company sued the food writer, Raymond Postgate, founder of the Good Food Guide, for an article in Holiday magazine in which he warned readers against Babycham,  which "looks like champagne and is served in champagne glasses but is made of pears". The company sued for libel, claiming the article implied it was dishonestly passing off Babycham as champagne. The judge in his summing up stated that the article was defamatory, but that the jury could consider it as "fair comment" rather than a factual statement. Postgate was acquitted, and awarded costs.Law Reports, Oct 30, Nov 2, Nov 4, 1965, The Times Digital Archive
In 1978, the Babycham company was sued by French Champagne producers for abuse of their trade name. The case (H P Bulmer Ltd v J Bollinger SA 1978 RPC 79) hinged on the fact that Babycham had been described in advertising as ‘champagne perry’ or ‘champagne cider’. Champagne producers were litigating to protect their goodwill but because there would not actually be confusion, they were unsuccessful.See for example http://de.scribd.com/doc/114149526/2006-Wine-and-Society-The-Social-and-Cultural-Context-of-a-Drink or http://www.users.on.net/~roehr/notes/IntellectualProperty/IntellectualProperty-ExamNotes.pdf
The brand's appeal waned with the rise of cheaply available alternatives and a tightening up of the regulations governing alcohol advertising on television. 1996 saw a major relaunch of the brand and the reintroduction of the fawn mascot, a giant model of which can be seen outside the Shepton Mallet factory where the drink is produced. 1997 saw the reintroduction of Babycham Babe beauty contests that had been popular in the 1960s. The iconic 'Babycham' logo was designed and created by John Emperor of CDP (Collett Dickenson Pearce) who were a well known advertising company in London.

==In the 2000s==

In the first decade of the 21st century, the Babycham brand gained popularity outside the alcoholic beverage industry through authorized clothing and apparel featuring the fawn trademark and colourful, characteristically playful designs.
During 2011 sales were reported to be increasing, with approximately 15 million bottles sold each year.[tpl]cite news|last=Beckett|first=Fiona|title=Why is Babycham popular again?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/01/food-and-drink|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=27 February 2013|location=London|date=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Kerslake|first=Ross|title=Blast from the perry past: Babycham|url=http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2013/01/blast-from-the-perry-past-babycham/|publisher=The Drinks Business|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]
