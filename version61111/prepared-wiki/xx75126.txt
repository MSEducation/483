Admiral of the Fleet John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent GCB, PC[tpl]London Gazette|issue=15338 |date=1801-17-02 |startpage=201|endpage=|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl] (9 January 1735 – 14 March 1823) was an admiral in the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the Seven Years' War, American War of Independence, French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. He is best known for his victory at the 1797 Battle of Cape Saint Vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of Horatio Nelson.Mahan Vol. 1, p.35Mahan Vol. 1, p.101
Jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer.Mahan Vol. 1, p.173 As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.
Jervis' entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography by P. K. Crimmin describes his contribution to history: "His importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself."[tpl]cite book | title = Dictionary of National Biography| publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1992 | isbn=978-0-19-865305-9| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101014794/John-Jervis[/tpl]

Vol.1, p.15
Their family name Jervis is pronounced 'jerviss'.BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names, OUP, 1971 The name Jervis originates from the Norman name Gervase.

==Early naval career==

At the age of thirteen Jervis ran away and joined the navy at Woolwich, London.Brenton. Vol.1, p.16 After a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. Lady Jane Hamilton (mother of Sir William Hamilton) and Lady BurlingtonBrenton. Vol.1, p.17 became aware of Jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. Eventually they introduced the Jervis family to Admiral George Townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.7
On 4 January 1749 Jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun [tpl]HMS|Gloucester|1745|2[/tpl] on her way to Jamaica. On arrival in the West Indies, Jervis was detached on HM sloop [tpl]HMS|Ferret|1743|2[/tpl] to the Mosquito Coast where he saw constant service against Spanish guarda-costas and privateers.Brenton. Vol.1, p.19 When Townshend quit the West Indies he discharged Jervis into the [tpl]HMS|Severn|1747|2[/tpl] under Admiral Thomas Cotes. Cotes' flag captain Henry Dennis rated Jervis as a midshipman. On 31 July 1754 Jervis moved to the 24-gun [tpl]HMS |Sphinx|1748|2[/tpl].Tucker. Vol. 1, p.8 Jervis commented in a letter to his sister: "my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters of which I have almost enough to make an octavo volume". Whilst in Jamaica, the young Jervis drew funds against his father's account with a local banker. When the reply came from England that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. Jervis was forced to quit his mess and live on ship's rations in order to pay off the loan. The event deeply affected the young Jervis who swore never to "draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid."Brenton. Vol.1, p.20Tucker. Vol. 1, p.10 Sphinx was paid off at Spithead on 7 November 1754. Jervis was assigned to the 20-gun [tpl]HMS|Seaford|1754|2[/tpl] in December of the same year and then from the end of December until February 1755 was assigned to HM Yacht William and Mary under the navigational expert Captain John Campbell.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.11
Jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 January 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate [tpl]HMS| Royal George|1756|2[/tpl] of 100 guns.Tucker. Vol. 1, pp.12–13 By March, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun [tpl]HMS|Nottingham|1703|2[/tpl]. The Nottingham was part of Edward Boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent French reinforcements reaching New France.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.13 On 31 March 1756 Jervis moved to the 74-gun HMS [tpl]HMS| Devonshire|1745|2[/tpl] and on 22 June he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun Prince under Captain Charles Saunders in the Mediterranean.  When the captain was promoted to admiral, Jervis followed him to the 74-gun [tpl]HMS|Culloden|1747|2[/tpl] in November 1756.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.14 In January 1757 Jervis was promoted to temporary command of [tpl]HMS|Experiment|1740|6[/tpl]. In her, he fought a large French privateer in an indecisive action off Cape Gata. When the captain of the Experiment regained his health Jervis moved back to the Culloden. In June 1757, he followed Saunders to the 90-gun HMS St George. Jervis returned to England in temporary command of the 80-gun [tpl]HMS|Foudroyant|1758|2[/tpl], a ship that had been captured by Henry Osborn's fleet at the Battle of Cartagena. He followed Saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the North American station; Jervis was promoted to Lieutenant of HMS Prince.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.16

===Quebec and promotion to captain===

The fleet, part of an expedition to capture the French possessions in North America, left England in February 1759. They stopped first at Louisbourg which had been captured from the French the previous year. By June, the ice along the Saint Lawrence River had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of Quebec City.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.17  On 15 May 1759, Jervis had been  promoted acting commander of the sloop [tpl]HMS|Porcupine|1746|6[/tpl].Ralfe. Vol.1, p.278 In this command Jervis impressed General James Wolfe in the preparations which led to the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Porcupine and the frigate [tpl]HMS|Halifax|1756|2[/tpl] led the armed transports past Quebec to land up river. One biographer, Jedediah Tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both Wolfe and the subsequently famous James Cook boarded the Porcupine to ensure the success of the mission.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.18
For his efforts Jervis was promoted commander and took command of [tpl]HMS|Scorpion|1746|6[/tpl].Tucker. Vol. 1, pp.15–20 Jervis returned to England in September but immediately returned to North America in command of the Albany. In May 1760 Jervis was attached to Admiral Sir George Rodney's Channel squadron.
In October 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun [tpl]HMS|Gosport|1741|2[/tpl].Tucker. Vol. 1, p.21The Naval Chronicle Vol. 4, p.4 Gosport had on board a young midshipman, George Elphinstone, later Viscount Keith, who took over Jervis' command in the Mediterranean after Jervis' departure in 1799.Brenton. Vol.1, p.21 In 1762, HMS Gosport, [tpl]HMS|Danae|1759|6[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Superb|1760|6[/tpl] under Captain Joshua Rowley, convoyed the East and West Indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of Commodore de Ternay.
By the end of 1763 the Gosport has been paid off and Jervis remained unemployed until February 1769 when he was appointed to the 32-gun [tpl]HMS|Alarm|1758|6[/tpl],Tucker. Vol. 1, p.23The Naval Chronicle Vol. 4, p.5 the first coppered warship in the Royal Navy.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.oldcopper.org/victory%20copper.htm|title=HMS Victory Copper Sheathing |author=  Vin Callcut 2002–2010|year=2010|publisher= http://www.oldcopper.org |accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] He was tasked with delivering bullion to the English merchants in Genoa. During his time in Genoa two Turkish slaves escaped a Genoese galley and hid aboard one of Alarm[tpl]'s[/tpl] boats. They were forcibly removed; Jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. The slaves were produced and Jervis took custody of them.Tucker. Vol. 1, pp.24–26
On 30 March 1770 the Alarm was driven ashore off MarseillesBrenton. Vol.1, p.22 but with the efforts of Jervis, the crew and the local French authorities under the governor of Marseilles, Georges René Le Peley de Pléville she was brought off and repaired. Jervis personally returned to Marseilles with a letter of thanks from the Board of the Admiralty to the governor for his assistance.GrundnerTucker. Vol. 1, pp.27–33
In 1771 Alarm returned to England to collect the Duke of Gloucester, King George III's brother in order that he could winter in Italy.Tucker. Vol. 1, pp.35–37 He lived aboard with his entourage until May 1772 when Alarm returned to England and was paid off.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.38

===Touring Europe and Russia===

Between October 1772 and June 1775, Jervis travelled extensively. He began in France where he studied the language and made observations about French life.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.39 He accompanied Captain Samuel Barrington to Russia where they spent time in Saint Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine of Russia.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.40 The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. They came home via the Netherlands,Tucker. Vol. 1, p.46 Jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. He and Barrington then took a private cruise along the Channel coast calling at various harbours including Brest, making and improving their charts as they went. When Jervis later became the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of Brest by these charts. In later years, he commented: "Had the young Captain Jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the Earl St Vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it."Tucker. Vol. 2, p.15

==American War of Independence==

===First Battle of Ushant===

At the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 Jervis was given the command of [tpl]HMS|Kent|1762|6[/tpl]; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service.Tucker. Vol. 1, p.47 He was therefore appointed instead to command of HMS Foudroyant, the ship he had brought to England as a prize seventeen years earlier. For the first few years of the war, the French supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of America. With the signing of the Treaty of Alliance in 1778 and the creation of the Franco-American alliance, the war widened.[ref]
