CRS4, also known as Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia (Italian: Centro di Ricerca, Sviluppo e Studi Superiori in Sardegna), is an  interdisciplinary research center, founded by the Sardinia Autonomous Region on November 30, 1990. Since 2003, the center is located in the Technology Park of Sardinia, in the commune of Pula. Several companies and research groups have chosen to establish their activities on this campus, giving rise to a thriving R&D community.
CRS4 is a private research center, but its shareholder is a regional agency: Sardegna Ricerche.
The center, initially headed by the Nobel Prize in Physics Carlo Rubbia, made the first Italian Website (www.crs4.it) in September 1993, and collaborated to the creation of the first European web newspaper in 1994 (L'Unione Sarda) and to one of the first and largest internet providers (Video On Line). In this sense CRS4 has been crucial for the development of the Internet and Web in Sardinia.Alberto Pinna "Soru: un incontro con Rubbia, cos√¨ nacque il web in Sardegna", Corriere della Sera, December 28, 1999 (in italian)Luca Ferrucci and Daniele Porcheddu "The ICT in the Cagliari area: Start up and evolution", 2003 (in english)
