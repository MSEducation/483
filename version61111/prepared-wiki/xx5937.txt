[[FX-87]]

CATEGORIES: Programming languages

FX-87 is a polymorphic typed functional language based on a system for static program analysis in which every expression has two static properties: a type and an effect.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jouvelot|first=P.|coauthors=Gifford, D.K.|title=The FX-87 Interpreter|journal=IEEE|date=9 October 1988|pages=65–72|doi=10.1109/ICCL.1988.13044|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=13044&abstractAccess=no&userType=inst|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]  In a study done by MIT, FX-87 yields similar performance results as functional languages on programs that do not contain side affects (Fibonacci, Factorial). FX-87 did yield a great performance increase when matching DNA sequences.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hammel|first=Todd|coauthors=David K.

KFX is the kernel language of FX-87.  It was described in 'Polymorphic Effect Systems', J.M. Lucassen et al., Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM Conference POPL, ACM 1988, pp. 47–57.
