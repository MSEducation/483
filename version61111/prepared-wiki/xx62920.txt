The [tpl]nihongo|Karasuma Line|烏丸線|Karasuma-sen[/tpl] is one of the two lines of the Kyoto Municipal Subway operated by Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau in Kyoto, Japan. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is colored green, and its stations are given numbers following the letter K. It serves the following wards of Kyoto: Sakyō-ku, Kita-ku, Kamigyō-ku, Nakagyō-ku, Shimogyō-ku, Minami-ku, and Fushimi-ku. It connects [tpl]ja-stalink|Kokusaikaikan[/tpl] in Sakyō-ku and [tpl]ja-stalink|Takeda||Kyoto[/tpl] in Minami-ku.
Between [tpl]ja-stalink|Kitaōji[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Jūjō|Jūjō|Kyoto Municipal Subway[/tpl], trains run beneath the north-south Karasuma Street, hence the name. They link to the other subway line, the Tozai Line, at [tpl]ja-stalink|Karasuma Oike[/tpl]. They also connect to the JR lines at Kyoto Station and the Hankyu Kyoto Line running beneath Shijō Street at the intersection of Shijō Karasuma, Kyoto's central business district. At Shijō Karasuma, the subway station is named [tpl]ja-stalink|Shijō[/tpl], whereas Hankyu's station is called [tpl]ja-stalink|Karasuma[/tpl].
The Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu Corporation jointly operate through services, which continue to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line to Kintetsu Nara Station in Nara. The Karasuma Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line connect at Kyoto and Takeda.
