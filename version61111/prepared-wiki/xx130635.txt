==Cancelled PA 48 North-South Parkway==

In 1963, a new PA 48 expressway was proposed to run parallel to the current PA 48 alignment from PA 51 in Elizabeth to the PA Turnpike/Parkway East Interchange in Monroeville.  Although several houses and an amusement complex of swimming pool, amusement park and drive-in theater (called Rainbow Gardens) were demolished in the process, the project was scrapped by the 1970s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pahighways.com/toll/PATurnpike43.html |title=PA Turnpike 43: Mon-Fayette Expressway |work=PA Highways |first= Jeffrey J. |last=Kitsko |date= March 14, 2010 |accessdate= June 25, 2011[/tpl]
