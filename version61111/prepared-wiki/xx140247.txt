The Fairweather Lodge Program is a psychosocial rehabilitation model combining congregate living with collaborative employment.

==History==

The Fairweather Lodge Program was developed by psychologist George Fairweather in California in 1963. Dr. Fairweather found that rehospitalization of patients with serious and persistent mental illness is less likely (i.e., "community tenure" is longer) when the people live and work together as a group, rather than individually.

==Lodge model==

A typical Fairweather Lodge is an affordable dwelling for 4â€“8 people who share in running the home, including domestic chores and purchase and preparation of food. The residents make their own house rules and manage their own activities. In addition, they run a small business chosen by consensus and jointly planned. Alternatively, they may be employed by the business run by their sponsoring agency. Such businesses may provide lawn care, custodial or laundry services, printing, furniture building, shoe repair, catering, or other services. The work is part-time or full-time, and organized so that one member can readily substitute for another whenever necessary.
The role of staff provided by the sponsoring agency of a Lodge is limited to mentoring, advising, mediating and helping in emergencies, although staff is continually on call. Lodge members may hire professional consultants such as accountants and lawyers to assist with the Lodge business operation as needed.
The sponsoring agency sets eligibility criteria and recruits candidates for membership, but acceptance into a Lodge requires a vote by existing residents.
Residents are charged for rent and operating expenses, but some costs (such as mortgage payments or transportation) may be covered by county and state programs as well as by business profits.

==Program principles==

1. The lodge must provide a safe, healthy and caring environment, which reinforces the recovery process. Tolerance of harmless individual idiosyncrasies must be established.
2. The lodge must be a part of the plan for managing symptoms and promoting good mental health.
3. Services must be available as long as the participant wants and needs them. Open entry and exit for consumers must be permitted.
4. People with psychiatric disabilities increase their community success and raise their social status through employment, through accumulating wealth and through direct consumerism. Opportunities for promotion and rising to a higher status are provided. 
5. Above and beyond economic roles, participants need to have meaningful roles in both the lodge and the larger community.
6. A successful lodge resembles a healthy family. An ongoing method to handle daily living problems needs to be implemented. 
7. In order to progress, people with psychiatric disabilities need autonomy commensurate with their behavioral abilities, with the ultimate goal of full autonomy. The program must provide the consumers as much autonomy as possible. 
8. Lodges must not be dependent on resources from any single entity. The program should not be dependent on the good will of the community in which it exists.
The Coalition for Community Living (CCL)is the national organization whose mission is to promote Fairweather Lodges. The CCL is currently collecting outcome data quarterly to measure whether existing lodges are upholding the principles of the Fairweather model. Information is gathered to ensure lodge members are safe and healthy based on whether they are eating healthily and exercising regularly, whether they smoke or use drugs and alcohol and whether they are safe in their neighborhoods. The outcome measures indicate whether lodge members have access to immediate psychiatric care if needed. The CCL also gathers information on wages and earnings to ensure lodge members are benefiting financially from the program by earning a living. Other measures of success include whether lodge members are participating in civic responsibilities, engaging in social activities, and sharing meals with their lodge mates like a family. Staff hours at lodges are also measured to ensure that lodges are as autonomous as possible. 
As of 2006 there are over 90 Fairweather Lodges in 16 US states.
