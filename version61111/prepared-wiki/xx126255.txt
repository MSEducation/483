Petrolifera Petroleum Limited ([tpl]tsx2|PDP[/tpl]), headquartered in Calgary, Alberta was a Canadian oil and gas company engaged in exploration and production activity in South America. Petrolifera’s production base stems from its 100 percent-owned Puesto Morales/Rinconada Concession in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina. In late 2005 and early 2006, several significant light oil discoveries were made on this concession.
Petrolifera was also successful in negotiating two major petroleum and natural gas exploratory licenses covering over five million acres (20,000 km²) in the Marañon and Ucayali Basins of Peru during 2005. These blocks are either on trend with or offset significant petroleum accumulations and are considered to be well-situated from a geological perspective.
Petrolifera is currently 31 percent owned and also managed by Connacher Oil and Gas ([tpl]tsx2|CLL[/tpl]) of Calgary, Alberta.
Petrolifera was acquired by Gran Tierra Energy in 2011.http://www.grantierra.com/news-archive.html?wnid=166
