Additional rooms in the nuclear bunker included an entrance room with decontamination shower, commander's office; separate rooms for the AN/FSG-1 computer (rows of racks/boxes), storage, ADL, and other system equipment; utility rooms for HVAC and other support systems, and a decontamination water storage room under the AAOC.  "Our radar must be kept above ground.  If that goes, we are out of business anyway" (BGen Robert A. Hewitt), so a less expensive and more vulnerable partially exposed bunker was acceptable for the AN/FSG-1. "Autonomous Operations" allowed remote missile batteries surviving a nuclear strike to launch without AADCP inputs.[tpl]Cite news |date=June 7, 1960 |title=Base is Dedicated: 'Blue Room' at Missile Master Gives Eerie But Secure Feeling |url=http://209.212.22.88/DATA/RBR/1960-1969/1960/1960.06.07.pdf |location=Red Bank, New Jersey |newspaper=Red Bank Register |pages=1–2 |accessdate=2011-09-30 |quote=RADAR SCANNER at Missile Master atop Highlands hills tells the height of aircraft or other flying objects.
