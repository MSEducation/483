[[Golden Ring]]

CATEGORIES: Golden Ring of Russia

The Golden Ring ([tpl]lang-ru|Золото́е кольцо́[/tpl]) is a ring of cities  northeast of Moscow, the capital of Russia. They formerly comprised the region known as Zalesye.
These ancient towns, which also played a significant role in the formation of the Russian Orthodox Church, preserve the memory of the most important and significant events in Russian history. The towns have been called "open air museums" and feature unique monuments of Russian architecture of the 12th–18th centuries, including kremlins, monasteries, cathedrals, and churches.  These towns are among the most picturesque in Russia and prominently feature Russia's famous onion domes.
