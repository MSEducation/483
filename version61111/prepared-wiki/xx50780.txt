Kilroy was here is an American popular culture expression that became popular during World War II; it is typically seen in  graffiti. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle — a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall — became associated with GIs in the 1940s.
In the United Kingdom, the graffiti is known as "Mr Chad" or just "Chad", and the Australian equivalent to the phrase is "Foo was here". "Foo was here" might date from World War I, and the character of Chad may have derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating "Kilroy was here".  Etymologist Dave Wilton says, "Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase." "Foo was here" became popular amongst Australian schoolchildren of post-war generations. Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, The Jeep, and Sapo.
Author Charles Panati says that in the United States "the mischievous face and the phrase became a national joke... The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up."[tpl]cite web|title=What's the origin of "Kilroy was here"?|work=The Straight Dope|date = 2000-08-04|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1812/whats-the-origin-of-kilroy-was-here|accessdate = [/tpl] The major Kilroy graffiti fad ended in the 1950s, but today people all over the world still scribble the character and "Kilroy was here" in schools, trains, and other similar public areas.
It is believed that James J. Kilroy was the origin of the expression, as he used the phrase when checking ships at the Fore River Shipyard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-kil1.htm|title=Kilroy  was here|last=Quinion|first=Michael|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl]

==Origin and use of the phrase==

The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen, who would draw the doodle and the text "Kilroy was here" on the walls and other places they were stationed, encamped, or visited.  An ad in Life magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that "whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that 'Kilroy was here.'"[tpl]cite book|title=LIFE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HkYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA120|date=17 May 1948|page=120|author1=Inc|first1=Time[/tpl]
Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom.Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523 At some point, the graffito (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged.
Many sources claim origins as early as 1939.[tpl]cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert|title=The 1940s|url=http://books.google.com/?id=G4IkgU7jpLwC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=%22kilroy+was+here%22+1939#v=onepage&q=%22kilroy%20was%20here%22%201939&f=false|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=113|chapter=Leisure Activities|isbn=9780313312991[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Jerold E.|title=Historical dictionary of the U.S. Army|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ygqNt3ra-vYC&pg=PA264&dq=kilroy+was+here+1939#v=onepage&q=kilroy%20was%20here%201939&f=false|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-29322-8|page=264|chapter=Kilroy[/tpl] An early example of the phrase being used may date from 1937, before World War II. A US History Channel video broadcast in 2007, Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed, includes a shot of a chalked "KILROY WAS HERE" dated 5/13/1937: Fort Knox's vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot. However, historian Paul Urbahns who was involved in the production of the program says that the footage was a reconstruction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kilroywashere.org/001-Pages/01-0KilroySightings-4.html|title=Kilroy Was Here in 1937 . . .

According to one story, it was reported that German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This began leading Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found "Kilroy was here" written in the VIPs' bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was.Rottman, Gordon L.: FUBAR: Soldier Slang of World War II ISBN # 978-1-84603-175-5) War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne in December 1944: "On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of McAuliffe's GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE."[tpl]cite book|last=Capa|first=Robert|title=Slightly Out of Focus|year=1947|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.[/tpl]

===Foo was here===

"Foo was here" graffiti is said to have been widely used by Australians during World War I: "He was chalked on the side of railway carriages, appeared in probably every camp that the 1st AIF World War I served in and generally made his presence felt."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-help/faq6.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions, 251 to 300 |publisher=Diggerhistory.info |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.polityka.pl/historia/217663,1,kilroy-tu-byl.read|title=Kilroy tu był|last=Dziatkiewicz|first=Łukasz|date=4 November 2009|work=Polityka|language=Polish|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl] If this is the case, then "Foo was here" pre-dates "Kilroy was here" by about twenty years.
The phrase "Foo was here" was used from 1941–45 as the Australian equivalent of "Kilroy was here". "Foo" was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, and the name may have derived from the 1930s cartoon Smokey Stover, in which the character used the word "foo" for anything he could not remember the name of.[tpl]cite book|last1=Patridge|first1=Eric|last2=Beale|first2=Paul|title=A dictionary of catch phrases: British and American, from the sixteenth century to the present day|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nm3jbg0JalMC&pg=PA136|year=1986|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05916-X|page=136[/tpl] It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for Forward Observation Officer, but this is likely to be a backronym.[tpl]cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html|title=foo|date=29 December 2003|work=The Jargon File 4.4.7|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl]

===Real Kilroys===

The Oxford English Dictionary says simply that Kilroy was "The name of a mythical person". One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962),[tpl]Find a Grave|name=James J. Kilroy|10932011[/tpl] an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature. The New York Times indicated J.J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the American Transit Association to establish the origin of the phenomenon.[tpl]cite journal|year=1946|title=Kilroy Was Here|journal=In Transit|publisher=Amalgamated Transit Union|volume=54-55|page=14[/tpl] The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships themselves as they were being built—so, at a later date, the phrase would be found chalked in places that no graffiti-artist could have reached (inside sealed hull spaces, for example), which then fed the mythical significance of the phrase—after all, if Kilroy could leave his mark there, who knew where else he could go?"Transit Association Ships a Street Car To Shelter Family of 'Kilroy Was Here'", The New York Times, December 24, 1946. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that "the phrase grew by accident."
The Lowell Sun reported in November 1945, with the headline "How Kilroy Got There", that a 21-year old soldier from Everett, Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy, Jr., wrote "Kilroy will be here next week" on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported at the same time that according to Sgt. Kilroy, when he was hospitalized early in World War II a friend of his, Sgt. James Maloney, wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, and other airmen soon picked up the phrase. Francis Kilroy himself only wrote the phrase a couple of times.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=ov8pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SGgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1606,3592510|title="Kilroy" Mystery is Finally Solved|last=Associated Press|date=14 November 1945|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun[/tpl]

==Chad==

The figure was initially known in the UK as "Mr Chad". Chad would appear with the slogan "Wot, no sugar", or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing.[tpl]cite web|last=Shackle |first=Eric |url=http://www.openwriting.com/archives/2005/08/mr_chad_and_kil.php |title=Mr Chad And Kilroy Live Again |publisher=Open Writing |date=2005-08-07 |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/19/a3568719.shtml |title=WW2 People's War – Mr. CHAD |publisher=BBC |date=2005-01-24 |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iUgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23|title=Wot! Chad's Here|last=Reeve|first=Elizabeth|date=18 March 1946|work=Life Magazine|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] The phrase "Wot, no —?" pre-dates "Chad" and was widely used separately from the doodle. Chad was used by the RAF and civilians; in the army Chad was known as Private Snoops, and in the Navy he was called The Watcher.[tpl]cite book|last1=Partridge|first1=Eric|last2=Beale|first2=Paul|title=A dictionary of slang and unconventional English: colloquialisms and catch phrases, fossilised jokes and puns, general nicknames, vulgarisms and such Americanisms as have been naturalised|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tvRp1whVFUsC&pg=PA194|edition=8|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-29189-5|page=194[/tpl] Chad might have first been drawn by British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton in 1938. Chatterton was nicknamed "Chat", which may then have become "Chad." Life Magazine in 1946 said that the RAF and Army were competing for claiming him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944. The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933; another name for Chad was "The Goon".
A theory suggested by a spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London in 1977 was that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=vYUwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iNwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7272,5785548&dq=kilroy+chad&hl=en|title=Changing Patterns in World Graffiti|date=16 March 1977|work=Ludington Daily News|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl] Life suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current, a sine wave through a straight line, resembles Chad, that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of electrical resistors. The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave.[tpl]cite book|last=Zakia|first=Richard D.|title=Perception and imaging|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NWtM-L83RnwC&pg=PA245|year=2002|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-80466-X|page=245[/tpl] Similarly, The Guardian noted in 2000 that several readers had told them that "Mr. Chad" was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that in 1941 at RAF Yatesbury a man named Dickie Lyle drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room, and wrote "Wot, no leave?" beneath it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/nov/25/books.guardianreview8|title=Dimpled and pregnant|first=Smallweed|date=25 November 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 that included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire drawing the circuit diagram, and the words "WOT! No electrons?" being added. The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick, and was initially called Domie or Doomie,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rafcaa.org.uk/legends.html|title=Wot no respect?|date=9 December 2009|work=RAF Related Legends|publisher=RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] the latter name also being noted by Life as used by the RAF. As alternatives to Chatterton or Mr Chadwick as the origin of the name Chad, REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed "Chad's Temple", the RAF claimed it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school, and the Desert Rats claimed it came from an officer in El Alamein.
It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple "What, no bread?" or "Wot, no char?" to the plaintive; one sighting, on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden, had the complaint "Wot, no engines?" The Los Angeles Times reported in 1946 that Chad was "the No. 1 doodle", noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with "Wot, no Tories?"[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/415580011.html?dids=415580011:415580011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+01%2C+1946&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=NO.+1+DOODLE&pqatl=google|title=No. 1 Doodle|last=Plimer|first=Denis|date=1 December 1946|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl] Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase "Wot—no Fuehrer?"[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=EK80AAAAIBAJ&sjid=lYYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6559,1420808|title=Mr. Chad travels|date=12 October 1946|work=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl]
As rationing became less common, so did the joke; while the cartoon is occasionally sighted today as "Kilroy was here",[tpl]cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/219500.html |title=Kilroy was here|work=Phrases.org.uk|date=|accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] "Chad" and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture. It is a common misconception that the graffiti was tied to the Berlin Wall, "Chad" long pre-dated the wall.

==Smoe==

Writing about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946,  The Milwaukee Journal describes the doodle as the European counterpart to "Kilroy was here", under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=8B4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ByUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2098,6309168|title=There Are Places Nobody Ever Was Before, but Look, Kilroy Was There|date=28 November 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] It noted that next to "Kilroy was here" was often added "And so was Smoe". While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Ny0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8iMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1704,5204006|title=Once Honorably Discharged, Kilroy is Here, but No Smoe|date=9 December 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for "Sad men of Europe".[tpl]cite book|last=Stewart|first=John Laurence|title=The forbidden diary: a B-24 navigator remembers|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a3nxAAAAMAAJ&q=kilroy|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-158187-1|page=45[/tpl] Correspondents to Life magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rEoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35|title=Letters to the Editor: Miscellany|date=16 November 1962|work=Life Magazine|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl]

==Other names==

Similar drawings appear in many countries. Herbie (Canada), Overby (Los Angeles, late 1960s),[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/489710892.html?dids=489710892:489710892&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+11%2C+1966&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=WALL+WRITERS+TURN+AWAY+FROM+BIG-NOSED+FAVORITE+OF+WORLD+WAR+II&pqatl=google|title=Wall writers turn away from big-nosed favorite of World War II: Kilroy Was Here, but Oger and Overby Take Over|last=Nelson|first=Harry|date=11 September 1966|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl] Flywheel, Private Snoops, The Jeep, and Clem (Canada) are alternative names. An advert in Billboard in November 1946 for plastic 'Kilroys' also used the names Clem, Heffinger, Luke the Spook, Smoe and Stinkie.[tpl]cite news|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DxoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT77|title=At last Kilroy is here (advert)|last=Chas.

In the United Kingdom, such graffiti is known as "Chad" or "Mr Chad". In Chile, the graphic is known as a "sapo" (slang for nosy); this might refer to the character's peeping, an activity associated with frogs because of their protruding eyes. In neighboring Peru, Kilroy is sometimes known as "Julito", which started as a running joke in that country's Foreign Ministry and is often seen scribbled on the whiteboards.
In Poland, Kilroy is replaced with "Józef Tkaczuk", an elementary school janitor (as an urban legend says), "Robert Motherwell" or "M. Pulina". Graffiti writings have the form of sentences like "Gdzie jest Józef Tkaczuk?" ("Where is Joseph Tkatchuk?") and "Tu byłem – Józef Tkaczuk" ("I was here – Joseph Thatchuk"). In Russia, the phrase "Vasya was here" ([tpl]lang-ru|Здесь был Вася[/tpl]) is a notorious piece of graffiti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/440515.html|title=Ключевое слово: "граффити"|last=Palveleva|first=Lily|date=24 March 2008|work=Радио Свобода|language=Russian|accessdate=30 August 2010[/tpl]
