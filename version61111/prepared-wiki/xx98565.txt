==Plot outline==

The show is based on a small town in the Old West, and narrated by an "old prospector"-type character named Gummy (H. Jon Benjamin). The episode begins with an armless, nameless gunslinger, dubbed Slim by the narrator. In the true style of Western films, Slim is in town for the purpose of revenge against Tommy Morgan (also voiced by Benjamin), who has been hiding in the hills due to a $1000 bounty on his head. While Slim is in town, Hanna Headstrong (Sarah Silverman), the daughter of a rancher in town, falls in love with him. Eventually, Slim and Tommy Morgan stand off.
