The Bergmann Hotel is a hotel and bar operating in Juneau, Alaska. It is among the National Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Marie Bergmann, and early history of the hotel==

The hotel was constructed by Marie E. Bergmann, who built the hotel to cater to local miners. According to a biography of the property and Ms. Bergmann maintained by the National Register of Historic Places, Ms. Bergmann  settled in the Juneau area in 1896, after the death of her husband in Seattle. 
A pioneer in pre-statehood Alaska, Bergmann was an established name in the Juneau hotel business of the period. Marie Bergmann began her professional life in Juneau by working in the hotel industry, as well as nursing. Ms. Bergmann originally envisioned a larger, more opulent hotel, but without additional investors and financing she was forced to scale back her plans. The grand opening of the hotel occurred on December 16, 1913. Marie Bergmann died in 1918 of a reported brain hemorrhage.[tpl]cite news|title=Landmark Bergmann Hotel, restaurant get new owners|publisher=Juneau Empire|author=Plenda, Melanie|date=2001-11-01|url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/110101/Loc_bergmann.shtml[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES INVENTORY - NOMINATION FORM|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|author= Michael W.

==Current use==

Although listed as a hotel, today the building serves primarily as tenement housing, with most occupants renting rooms by the week or month. Rooms in the Bergmann do not contain kitchens, although some contain microwaves, refrigerators and sinks. Restroom, shower and laundry facilities are shared. The hotel has been owned since 2001 by Juneau residents James, Maureen and Camilla Barrett.
In 2004, the Bergmann reopened a bar on the premises, despite protests from local residents and police who objected to the license because of a reputation for alcohol-related incidents and other problems at the hotel.[tpl]cite news|title=City OKs bar in Bergmann|publisher=Juneau Empire|author=Sidor, Tara|date=2004-08-24|url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/082404/loc_bergmann.shtml[/tpl] The bar closed in 2012.
