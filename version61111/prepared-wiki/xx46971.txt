This grip is used in the kata Yaraguwa.Weapons of Ryukyu Kobujutsu The useage of Tonfa is in pairs and is red oak or white oak by preference. The length is about three centimeters past the elbow when gripped. Weapons of Ryukyu Kobujutsu The starting grip, Honte-Mochi, places the Tonfa handle in the hand with the long arm resting along the bottom of the forearm. This grip provides protection or brace along one's forearms, and also provides reinforcement for uraken (back fist), hiji waza (elbow techniques) and punches. In use, the tonfa can swing out to Gyakute-Mochi grip for a strike or thrust. Martial artists may also flip the tonfa and grab it by the shaft, Tokushu-Mochi grip. This allows use of the handle as a hook in combat, similar to the Kama.TonfaWeapons of Ryukyu Kobujutsu
