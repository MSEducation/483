Givat Haim (Meuhad) ([tpl]Lang-he|גבעת חיים (מאוחד)[/tpl], lit. Haim Hill (Unified)) is a kibbutz near Hadera in Israel. It is located within the Hefer Valley Regional Council.

==History==

It was formed in 1952 by an ideological split in kibbutz Givat Haim (founded 1932), with Mapai-supporting members breaking away to create Givat Haim (Ihud), which joined the Mapai-affiliated Ihud HaKvutzot veHaKibbutzim, whilst Mapam-supporting members formed Givat Haim (Meuhad) which joined the HaKibbutz HaMeuhad movement. Today both kibbutzim belong to the Kibbutz Movement.

==Economy==

As well as agriculture, the kibbutz is home to Prigat, a major soft drink company in Israel.
