[[Blonde joke]]

CATEGORIES: Joke cycles, Gender jokes, Stereotypes

Blonde jokes are a class of jokes based on a stereotype of dumb blonde women.
These jokes about people, generally women, who have blonde hair serve as a form of blonde versus brunette rivalry. They are often considered to be derogatory as many are mere variants on traditional ethnic jokes or jests about other identifiable groups (such as Italian jokes involving Carabinieri).
In some cases, jokes about stereotypically stupid people have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.http://books.google.com/books?id=uk_WHTCTN9YC&pg=PA24
Some blonde jokes rely on sexual humour to portray or stereotype their subjects as promiscuous.http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrXrueVe-0C&pg=PT108 Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes,http://books.google.com/books?id=uk_WHTCTN9YC&pg=PA24 much as other jokes about dumb blondes are based on long-running ethnic jokes.

==Common traits==

Blonde jokes nearly always take the format of the blonde placing herself in a situation or making a comment that serves to highlight her supposed promiscuity and/or lack of intelligence, cluelessness and clumsiness. The blonde of the joke is usually placed in an unusual situation with a brunette or redhead. 
In some cases, these are meta-jokes,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrXrueVe-0C&pg=PT108 such as the blonde objecting to a ventriloquist act packed with sexist jokes about blondes:
The British Essex girl joke, very similar in content, became popular in the late 1980s; it satirises working-class girls from the county of Essex. 

==Criticism==

Like all humour based on stereotypes, blonde jokes are considered offensive to many people, particularly women.  However, blonde jokes, unlike other jokes that target minorities, do appear in mainstream media such as newspapers and television.  
Blonde jokes have been criticized as sexist by several authors, largely because the target is invariably dim-witted, female and sexually promiscuous.http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrXrueVe-0C&pg=PT108 Some blond males find blonde jokes offensive as well, though the jokes are commonly understood to refer specifically to young "bleach blonde" females.
