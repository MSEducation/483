A biophoton (from the Greek βίος meaning "life" and φῶς meaning "light") is a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum  emitted from a biological system. Emission of biophotons is technically a type of bioluminescence, but the latter term is  generally reserved for higher luminance luciferin/luciferase systems. The term biophoton used in this narrow sense should not be confused with the broader field of biophotonics, which studies the general interaction of light with biological systems.
The typical observed radiant emittance of biological tissues in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranges from 10−19 to 10−16 W/cm2 (approx 1-1000 photons/cm2/second). This light intensity is much weaker than that seen in the perceptually visible and well-researched phenomenon of normal bioluminescence but is detectable above the background of thermal radiation emitted by tissues at their normal temperature.
While detection of biophotons has been reported by several groups,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x |title=Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer imaging |year=2004 |last1=Takeda |first1=Motohiro |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Masaki |last3=Takayama |first3=Mariko |last4=Suzuki |first4=Satoshi |last5=Ishida |first5=Takanori |last6=Ohnuki |first6=Kohji |last7=Moriya |first7=Takuya |last8=Ohuchi |first8=Noriaki |journal=Cancer Science |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=656–61 |pmid=15298728[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00442.x |title=Ultra-weak photon emission as a non-invasive tool for monitoring of oxidative processes in the epidermal cells of human skin: Comparative study on the dorsal and the palm side of the hand |year=2010 |last1=Rastogi |first1=Anshu |last2=Pospíšil |first2=Pavel |journal=Skin Research and Technology |pmid=20637006 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=365–70[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/1011-1344(93)80076-L |title=Artificial sunlight irradiation induces ultraweak photon emission in human skin fibroblasts |year=1993 |last1=Niggli |first1=Hugo J. |journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=281–5 |pmid=8350193[/tpl] hypotheses that such biophotons indicate the state of biological tissues and facilitate a form of cellular communication are controversial.

==Detection and measurement==

Biophotons may be detected with photomultipliers or by means of an ultra low noise CCD camera to produce an image, using an exposure time of typically 15 minutes for plant materials.[tpl]cite journal |journal=MPMI|volume=18|issue=2|year=2005|pages=95–102|doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0095|title=Biophoton Imaging: A Nondestructive Method for Assaying R Gene Responses |url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-18-0095[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer|journal=Cancer Science |volume=95|issue=8 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x/pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x|pmid=15298728[/tpl]

==Proposed physical mechanisms==

Chemi-excitation via oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species and/or catalysis by enzymes (i.e., peroxidase, lipoxygenase) is a common event in the biomolecular milieu.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0891-5849(95)00002-F |title=From free radicals to electronically excited species |year=1995 |last1=Cilento |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Adam |first2=Waldemar |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=19 |pages=103–14 |pmid=7635351 |issue=1[/tpl] Such reactions can lead to the formation of triplet excited species, which release photons upon returning to a lower energy level in a process analogous to phosphorescence. That this process is a contributing factor to spontaneous biophoton emission has been indicated by studies demonstrating that biophoton emission can be attenuated by depleting assayed tissue of antioxidants[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/bio.1170040134 |title=Oxidative stress in the rat heart, studies on low-level chemiluminescence |year=1989 |last1=Ursini |first1=Fulvio |last2=Barsacchi |first2=Renata |last3=Pelosi |first3=Gualtiero |last4=Benassi |first4=Antonio |journal=Journal of Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence |volume=4 |pages=241–4 |pmid=2801215 |issue=1[/tpl] or by addition of carbonyl derivatizing agents.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1006/bbrc.2001.5285 |title=Activity-Dependent Neural Tissue Oxidation Emits Intrinsic Ultraweak Photons |year=2001 |last1=Kataoka |first1=Yosky |last2=Cui |first2=Yilong |last3=Yamagata |first3=Aya |last4=Niigaki |first4=Minoru |last5=Hirohata |first5=Toru |last6=Oishi |first6=Noboru |last7=Watanabe |first7=Yasuyoshi |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=285 |issue=4 |pages=1007–11 |pmid=11467852[/tpl] Further support is provided by studies indicating that emission can be increased by addition of reactive oxygen species.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Alberto |last1=Boveris |first2=Enrique |last2=Cadenas |first3=Rudolf |last3=Reiter |first4=Mark |last4=Filipkowski |first5=Yuzo |last5=Nakase |first6=Britton |last6=Chance |title=Organ chemiluminescence: Noninvasive assay for oxidative radical reactions |bibcode=1980PNAS...77..347B |jstor=8201 |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.1.347 |pmid=6928628 |year=1980 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=77 |pages=347–51 |issue=1 |pmc=348267[/tpl]

===Plants===

Imaging of biophotons from leaves has been used as a method for Assaying R Gene Responses. These genes and their associated proteins are responsible for pathogen recognition and activation of defense signaling networks leading to the hypersensitive response,Vol. 18, No. 2, 2005 /95 MPMI Vol. 18, No. 2, 2005, pp. 95–102. DOI: 10.1094 / MPMI -18-0095. © 2005 The American Phytopathological Society which is one of the mechanisms of the resistance of plants to pathogen infection. It involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have crucial roles in signal transduction or as toxic agents leading to cell death.Journal of Experimental Botany, Vol. 58, No. 3, pp. 465–472, 2007 [tpl]DOI|10.1093/jxb/erl215[/tpl]

===Animals===

Enhanced biophoton emission along with the growth of tumor has been observed in mice and biophoton emission has been correlated with EEG activity in rats.[tpl]Citation needed|citation was a 404 and not scientific source|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Theoretical Biophysics==

===Hypothesized involvement in cellular communication===

In the 1970s the then assistant professor Fritz-Albert Popp and his research group at the University of Marburg (Germany) showed that the spectral distribution of the emission fell over a wide range of wavelengths, from 200 to 800 nm. Popp proposed that the radiation might be both semi-periodic and coherent.
Russian, German, and other biophotonics experts, often adopting the term "biophotons" from Popp, have growing evidence that their theories may help explain cell functions, such as mitosis.
In 1974 Dr. V.P. Kaznacheyev announced that his research team in Novosibirsk had detected intercellular communication by means of these rays.[tpl]cite book |first1=Guy Lyon |last1=Playfair |first2=Scott |last2=Hill |title=The Cycles of Heaven: Cosmic Forces and What They Are Doing to You |publisher=Pan |year=1979 |page=107 |isbn=978-0-330-25676-6[/tpl] Kaznacheyev and his team carried out about 12 000 experiments up to the 1980s. Details of experiments are described in his book (in Russian).[ref]

One biophoton mechanism focuses on injured cells that are under higher levels of oxidative stress, which is one source of light, and can be deemed to constitute a "distress signal" or background chemical process is yet to be demonstrated.[ref]
