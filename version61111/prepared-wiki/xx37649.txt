John William "Bill" Stevenson (born September 10, 1963) is an American musician and record producer. He is the drummer and main songwriter for the California punk rock group Descendents. In late December 1981 he played a few concerts with Black Flag because their drummer ROBO was detained in England after a tour there. He went on to record with Black Flag on several of their albums until 1985. After this he focused his attention on Descendents and played with them until Milo Aukerman left in 1987. After Milo had left, Bill and the others from Descendents, Karl Alvarez and Stephen Egerton, got singer Dave Smalley of Dag Nasty and formed All. All went on to have two more singers, Scott Reynolds (1989–1993) and Chad Price (1993–present). Aukerman came back to do the 1996 album Everything Sucks and the newest, Cool to Be You. All and Descendents continue to tour between Stevenson's and Aukerman's respective careers as a recording engineer and a biochemist.
Stevenson was born in Torrance, California and attended Mira Costa High School, with fellow members of the Descendents.Spurrier, Jeff. "DESCENDENTS HANG OUT IN NEVER-NEVER LAND", Los Angeles Times, January 5, 1986. Accessed January 10, 2008.
