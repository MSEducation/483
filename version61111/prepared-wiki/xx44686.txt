The Golden Gloves is the name  given to annual competitions for amateur boxing in the United States. The Golden Gloves is often the term used to refer to the National Golden Gloves competition, but it also can represent several other amateur tournaments, including regional golden gloves tournaments and other notable tournaments such as the Intercity Golden Gloves, the Chicago Golden Gloves, and the New York Golden Gloves.
The national contest is sponsored and controlled by the Golden Gloves Association of America, Inc. Winners from regional Golden Gloves competitions compete in the national competition, called the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The Tournament of Champions is held once a year, and a new tournament site is selected annually. The U.S. Golden Gloves program is currently organized on a territorial basis to give all sections of the country representation. All tournaments are planned, promoted and directed by the Golden Gloves Charities and within the limits of the amateur boxing code.
The Golden Gloves are open to all non-professional pugilists age 16 and over who are United States citizens.[tpl]cite web | last =Murphy | first =Kim | coauthors =Tanfani, Joseph and Loiko, Sergei L. | title =The Tsarnaev Brothers' Troubled Trail to Boston | publisher =Los Angeles Times | date =April 28, 2013 | url =http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-boston-suspects-20130428-dto,0,15030.htmlstory | accessdate =April 30, 2013 [/tpl] There is also a Silver Gloves amateur tournament, which is for amateur pugilists age 10 to 15 years old.
