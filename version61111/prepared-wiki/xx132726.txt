==Season summary==

After nine seasons without success, Western Suburbs finally made a significant impact on the league, finishing a respectable third behind the traditionally  strong sides of Balmain and South Sydney. Balmain ultimately won their third consecutive premiership finishing eight points ahead of second placed South Sydney. The Balmain side only failed to win one of their games during the season against Newtown in round 8.
Balmain's secure defence only allowed 61 points to be scored against them in 14 games, a statistic indicating their dominance. Annandale managed to avoid bottom spot thanks to Glebe surrendering their two points to them following a 31-5 win for Glebe in round 8. The points were moved over to Annandale due to Glebe fielding Dan "Laddo' Davies an ineligible player under the residential criteria of the time.
As well as losing Davies, fourteen of Glebe's first grade players were suspended for a year after the players boycotted a match against Balmain. The NSWRFL changed the venue of the game from the Sydney Cricket Ground to Birchgrove Oval in Balmain, drastically reducing spectator numbers and, in doing so, cutting Glebe's share of the big gate takings expected at the SCG. A team consisting of lower grade players was fielded and Glebe lost heavily, 40â€“9. The NSWRFL suspended all the footballers who refused to play, including Frank, Laidley and Albert Burge.
Balmain also won the three round City Cup played in the late season. Members of the Balmain premiership winning side included Bob Craig.
