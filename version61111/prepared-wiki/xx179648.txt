The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as Stop the Week, After Hours, People Like Us and TV-am.
Some of their most famous songs include Shattered Illusions, Herpes Tango, Lieder and Taboo.  They were the subject of several BBC documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in The Stage magazine for ten years, and written two books, The Joy of Sequins in 1995 and Fascinating Who? in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time "juggling acting, cabaret and writing". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred Irish setter called "Dillie", born in 1999.
After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director, Russell Churney, plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs.http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=nathan@bluekitedesigns.com for Jermyn Street Theatre |url=http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/ |title=Jermyn Street Theatre, the official online home of London's leading Off-West-End venue |publisher=Jermynstreettheatre.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |title=COLE KITCHENN LTD – Producers – General Management – Personal Management |publisher=Colekitchenn.com |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] In 2008 they performed at the Jermyn Street Theatre, followed by three nationwide tours.
