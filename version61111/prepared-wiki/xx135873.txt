Digne Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Jérome de Digne) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and national monument of France, located in the town of Digne-les-Bains. It is the seat of the Bishops of Digne, Riez and Sisteron, formerly Bishops of Digne.
Construction began in 1490 by the order of the then bishop Antoine de Guiramand to cater for the movement of the town's population to a higher, more secure and defensible location round the local castle.  The cathedral was renovated and expanded in the 1860s under the direction of architect Antoine-Nicolas Bailly.  
The previous cathedral in the old town, Notre-Dame-du-Bourg (Cathédrale Notre-Dame-du-Bourg de Digne), a late Romanesque building of the 13th century, still stands as a museum.
