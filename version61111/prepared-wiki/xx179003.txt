Rowan Atkinson presents...Canned Laughter was a one-off ITV sitcom featuring Rowan Atkinson broadcast on 8 April 1979. Atkinson plays three roles; the nerdy Robert Box (who has been cited as an early incarnation of the Mr. Bean character), his sinister boss Mr. Marshall, and would-be stand-up comic Dave Perry. Made by LWT, the 30 minute episode was directed by Geoffrey Sax.

==Synopsis==

The episode particularly focuses on Robert Box as he prepares for work and decides to ask the only woman in his office out to dinner. Meanwhile, Dave Perry announces to a neighbour that he has his first major gig at a "swish restaurant" in Camden Town. At work, after the whole office has been refused a pay increase by Mr. Marshall, Box summons up the courage to ask Lorraine, played by Sue Holderness on the date. The episode culminates in the restaurant, where a series of coincidences and misunderstandings spoil the evening.
