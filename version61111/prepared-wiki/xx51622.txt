Kamarajar Salai, a six-lane road and one of the arterial roads of Chennai City, runs alongside the beach providing a sea view starting from the Victoria War Memorial near the Cooum River delta till the lighthouse to the south. The road extends further south beyond the lighthouse where it is known as the 'Santhome High Road', running away from the sea but parallel to the beach till Santhome.

==Legacy==

Although the beach promenade was created in 1884, the sandy shore has been mentioned in the literature much earlier. The beach shore has a mentioning in the verse no. 2297 of the 4000 Divya Prabandham written by Peyalwar. The verse, dating back to 7th century AD, was written in Tamil, and it says that the sea was so rich with white waves bringing to the shore very precious gems like red corals and white pearls and that the light of the dusk (moonlight) falls on these gems at the shore and makes the area brightened with beautiful colours.[tpl]cite web|title=Verse 2297 by Peyalwar, in the '4000 Divya Prabhandam'|url=http://dravidaveda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2886|work=Dravida Veda|accessdate=16 April 2012[/tpl]
Grant Duff, the governor of Madras who developed the beach promenade, recalls in his memoirs:
Grant Duff christened it the Madras Marina in 1884, the same year when the beach promenade was created, on which he explains in a letter:
In New India, the newspaper that was run by Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist and Home Rule advocate, the beauty of Marina Beach was described back in 1914. On 6 October 1914, Anne Besant wrote,[tpl]cite book|author=Mythily Sivaraman|title=Fragments of a life: a family archive|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AXN1Mq2WuYsC&pg=PA44|accessdate=13 October 2011|year=2006|publisher=Zubaan|isbn=978-81-89013-11-0|page=44[/tpl]
She also added that Madras [tpl]cquote|... in keeping with her dignity as a progressive city with a population of over half a million souls, (its) delectable evening resort, Marina Beach will be converted into being 'a thing of beauty and joy forever'.[/tpl]

==Future developments==

In January 2014, the corporation announced a makeover of the 2.8-km stretch on the southern part of the beach from Lighthouse to Foreshore Estate, including development of walkways, benches, a gallery, bicycle tracks, concrete roads, service trenches, rainwater trenches and streetlight fittings at an estimated cost of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 400 million. The development would provide alternative accommodation to vendors of the existing market on the Marina Loop Road by commissioning of a modern fish market on the stretch. The loop road connecting the Lighthouse and Foreshore Estate, which is currently a 20-metre-wide road, will be converted to a four-lane concrete road barricaded on both sides with stainless steel pillared railings and will pass all along the Santhome coast of the Marina Beach. A 2.4-metre-wide bicycle track, a 3.3-metre-wide walkway and a 2.5-metre-wide gallery will be developed on the eastern side of the road. The western side of the road will have a fish market with cold storage facilities as well as a walkway.[ref]

The Corporation also plans to develop more than 300 heritage pillars, each 1.2 metres tall, on the western side of Kamarajar Salai opposite the beach. The uniformly designed heritage pillars will be made of granite and iron on the stretch from All India Radio to Swami Sivananda Salai. The pillars would replace the existing walls of various institutions to improve aesthetics around the beach.

==In popular culture==

Marina Beach has been featured in numerous Tamil movies, including the 2012 Tamil movie Marina that is entirely based upon the lives of child workers in the beach.
