Francisco Morazán became a martyr and a symbol of the Republic of Central America. He gave his life however unsuccessfully, attempting to preserve the 'Union'. Now, more than one hundred and sixty years after his death, Central America is still plagued by power struggles,Honduras supreme court 'ordered army coup' telegraph U.K., 28 Jun 2009.

More often than not, the five republics have emulated Carrera than Morazán; but the dream of The Great Central American Country is still alive. His image can be found in bills, logos, and stamps. Institutions, cities, departments, schools, and parks among other things bear Morazán's name, in order to preserve his legacy.
El Salvador was among the first countries to pay tribute to Morazán. On March 14, 1887. The National Assembly of the Republic of El Salvador replaced the name of the department of "Gotera" with "Morazán". So as "to perpetuate the name of the great leader of the Central American Union".Francisco Morazán Quezada rree.gob.sv, 2005. Retrieved February 28, 2010. In 1943, Honduras renamed the Tegucigalpa department, Francisco Morazán. On Novembre 15, 1887 the town of Tocoy Tzimá became 'Morazán' in Guatemala. In 1945, Port Morazán was founded in Nicaragua.
Costa Rica, the country that he invaded and where he died honored him with a park in the center of its capital San Jose.  However in this country the legacy of Morazan is completely the opposite of what he would have wanted.  The fear of getting dragged  into Central American affairs that brought Morazan down is still a constant in the country.  Immediately after Morazan's adventure it became the first country to formally end its relation with the Central American Federation.  Today it is not a member of any political integration organism of Central America, like its Parliament or Court, and has even rejected the symbolic step of using a common design for its passport covers.  Costa Rica's refusal has given birth then to the CA-4 concept,  where Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua (Central America 4) have taken bigger steps towards integration.
In the political field the idea of integration is still preserved in the mind of many Central Americans. For example; the Central American Parliament, also known by the abbreviation "Parlacen" (from the Spanish Parlamento Centroamericano). This  is a political institution devoted to the integration of the Central American countries. The Parlacen represents a modern version of the historic Federal Republic of Central America, though not including Costa Rica but it does include the Dominican Republic.  Panama used to be a member but left during the government of President Martinelli.PARLACEN Parlacen.org. Retrieved February 28, 2010.
In the past several unsuccessful attempts have been made to restore the 'Union' (1851, 1886, 1921)Republica Federal de Centroamerica Constituciones Hispanoamericanas. Retrieved March 4, 2010.
Morazán's legacy is also present in the arts. The first play of record in El Salvador is titled "La Tragedy of Morazán" written by Francisco Díaz (1812–45) and dramatizing the life of the Central American President.Banham, Martin (1995) The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. University press, Cambridge. P 325 The modern period of in Honduran theater began with Luis Andrés Zúñiga Portillo when he wrote "Los Conspiradores" (The Conspirators, 1916), a historic drama that honored the virtues of Francisco Morazán.Brubin, Don, (1996) The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre, The Americas. Routledge, London, Cambridge. In his book Canto General, Pablo Neruda also pays tribute to the 'Liberal Caudillo', with a poem to Central America.
Statues and busts of Francisco Morazán can be found in Chile, El Salvador, United States, Spain among others. The most famous and controversial of these, is the equestrian statue of Morazán located in Tegucigalpa's Central Park. On his book The Open Veins of Latin America, Uruguayan writer, Eduardo Galeano mentions, that this statue is that of French marshal Michel Ney. According to Galeano, the statue was bought at a flea market, because the persons entrusted to buy it, spent the money in binges.Escritor Eduardo Galeano rectifica error sobre estatua de Morazán elcastellano.org, October 3, 2005 Retrieved February 27, 2010.
