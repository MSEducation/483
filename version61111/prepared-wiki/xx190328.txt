==Career==

===1990s===

After sitting for early graduation exams at 17, Ledger left school to pursue an acting career. With Trevor DiCarlo, his best friend since he was three years old, Ledger drove across Australia from Perth to Sydney, returning to Perth to take a small role in Clowning Around (1992), the first part of a two-part television series, and to work on the TV series Sweat (1996), in which he played a gay cyclist. From 1993 to 1997, Ledger also had parts in the Perth television series Ship to Shore (1993); in the short-lived Fox Broadcasting Company fantasy-drama Roar (1997); in Home and Away (1997), one of Australia's most successful television shows; and in the Australian film Blackrock (1997), his feature film debut. In 1999, he starred in the teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You and in the acclaimed Australian crime film Two Hands, directed by Gregor Jordan.

===2000s===

From 2000 to 2005, he starred in supporting roles as Gabriel Martin, the eldest son of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), in The Patriot (2000), and as Sonny Grotowski, the son of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), in Monster's Ball (2000); and in leading or title roles in A Knight's Tale (2001), The Four Feathers (2002), The Order (2003), Ned Kelly (2003), Casanova (2005), The Brothers Grimm (2005), and Lords of Dogtown (2005).

In The New York Times review of the film, critic Stephen Holden writes: "Both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal make this anguished love story physically palpable. Mr. Ledger magically and mysteriously disappears beneath the skin of his lean, sinewy character. It is a great screen performance, as good as the best of Marlon Brando and Sean Penn."[tpl]cite news |author=Holden, Stephen|title=Film Review – Brokeback Mountain – Riding the High Country, Finding and Losing Love |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/movies/09brok.html |work=The New York Times |page=1 |date=9 December 2005 |accessdate=17 August 2007 |authorlink=Stephen Holden[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] In a review in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers states: "Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost."[tpl]cite news|author=Travers, Peter|title=Review: Brokeback Mountain |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6169704/review/8878365/brokeback_mountain |work=Rolling Stone |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |authorlink=Peter Travers[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]
After Brokeback Mountain, Ledger costarred with fellow Australian Abbie Cornish in the 2006 Australian film Candy, an adaptation of the 1998 novel Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction, as young heroin addicts in love attempting to break free of their addiction, whose mentor is played by Geoffrey Rush; for his performance as sometime poet Dan, Ledger was nominated for three "Best Actor" awards, including one of the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, which both Cornish and Rush won in their categories. Shortly after the release of Candy, Ledger was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[tpl]cite news |title=Academy of Motion Picture Arts, Sciences invites 120 new members |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-07-05-academy_x.htm |date=5 July 2006 |work=USA Today |accessdate=23 January 2009[/tpl] As one of six actors embodying different aspects of the life of Bob Dylan in the 2007 film I'm Not There, directed by Todd Haynes, Ledger "won praise for his portrayal of 'Robbie Clark,' a moody, counter-culture actor who represents the romanticist side of Dylan, but says accolades are never his motivation."[tpl]cite news|author=Honie Stevens|title=Squaring the Ledger |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22763328-5006011,00.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2008[/tpl] Posthumously, on 23 February 2008, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the film's ensemble cast, its director, and its casting director.
In his penultimate film performance, Ledger played the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight, released nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London, Ledger told Sarah Lyall in their New York Times interview that he viewed The Dark Knight's Joker as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy".[tpl]cite news |author=Lyall, Sarah |title=Movies: In Stetson or Wig, He's Hard to Pin Down |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/movies/moviesspecial/04lyal.html |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |authorlink=Sarah Lyall[/tpl] For his work on The Dark Knight, Ledger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor with his family accepting it on his behalf, as well as numerous other posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, which Christopher Nolan accepted for him.

==Press controversies==

Ledger's relationship with the press in Australia was sometimes turbulent, and it led to his abandonment of plans for his family to reside part-time in Sydney.[tpl]cite news |author=WENN (World Entertainment News Network)|title=Ledger Slams Spitting Claims |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=2527 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=12 January 2006 |accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/tale-of-an-untrained-homeboy/2008/01/23/1201024944702.html|title=Tale of an untrained homeboy|last=Hawley|first=Janet|date=23 January 2008|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=13 April 2009[/tpl] In 2004, he strongly denied press reports alleging that "he spat at journalists on the Sydney set of the film Candy," or that one of his relatives had done so later, outside Ledger's Sydney home.

==Health issues==

In their New York Times interview, published on 4 November 2007, Ledger told Sarah Lyall that his recently completed roles in I'm Not There (2007) and The Dark Knight (2008) had taken a toll on his ability to sleep: "Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. ... I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going."[tpl]cite news|author=Lyall, Sarah|title=In Stetson or Wig, He's Hard to Pin Down |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/movies/moviesspecial/04lyal.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|work=The New York Times (Arts & Leisure Desk) |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2008|authorlink=Sarah Lyall[/tpl] At that time, he told Lyall that he had taken two Ambien pills, after taking just one had not sufficed, and those left him in "a stupor, only to wake up an hour later, his mind still racing."
Prior to his return to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was apparently suffering from some kind of respiratory illness, he reportedly complained to his co-star from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Christopher Plummer, that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: "Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics.... I think what he did have was the walking pneumonia.' ... On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him.' "
In talking with Interview magazine, after his death Ledger's former fiancée Michelle Williams also confirmed reports the actor had experienced trouble sleeping. "For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia. He had too much energy. His mind was turning, turning, turning – always turning."[tpl]cite news |author=UPI |title=Williams Recalls Ledger As Vulnerable|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2008/03/13/williams_recalls_ledger_as_vulnerable/2025/ |work=NewsTrack/Entertainment |publisher=upi.com|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=16 March 2008 |authorlink=United Press International[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Death==

At about 2:45 pm (EST), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, and his masseuse, Diana Wolozin, in his fourth-floor loft apartment at 421 Broome Street in the SoHo neighbourhood of Manhattan.
According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00 pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger's friend, actress Mary-Kate Olsen, for help. Olsen, who was in California, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26 pm, "less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen", Wolozin telephoned 9-1-1 "to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing". At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered CPR, which was unsuccessful in reviving him.[tpl]cite news |author=Andy Newman and Al Baker|title=Autopsy on Actor Is Inconclusive As Calls for Help Are Revealed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/nyregion/24celeb.html |work=The New York Times |date=24 January 2008|accessdate=12 October 2013[/tpl]
Paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived seven minutes later, at 3:33 pm ("at almost exactly the same moment as a private security guard summoned by Ms. Olsen") but were also unable to revive him.[tpl]cite news|title=News: Housekeeper, Masseuse Found Ledger's Body |url=http://www.wnbc.com/news/15128669/detail.html |publisher=WNBC|date=24 January 2008|accessdate=7 August 2008[/tpl] (As updated 25 January 2008.) At 3:36 pm, Ledger was pronounced dead, and his body was removed from the apartment.

===Autopsy and toxicology report===

Two weeks later on 6 February 2008, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York released its conclusions, based on an initial autopsy of 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis.[tpl]cite news |title=Ledger's Death Caused by Accidental Overdose |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/06/heath.ledger/index.html |work=SHOWBIZ, Movies|publisher=CNN |date=6 February 2008|accessdate=7 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Larry King|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/02/06/lkl.heath.ledger.death.cnn |title=Video: Larry King Live: Ledger Death|work=Larry King Live |format=Video clip|publisher=CNN|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008|quote=CNN's Larry King talks to guests about the finding that actor Heath Ledger died from an accidental drug overdose.[/tpl] The report concludes, in part, "Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine." It states definitively: "We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications."
While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia, anxiety, pain, or common cold (doxylamine) symptoms, the vast majority of physicians in the US are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix of OxyContin and Vicodin.
