Hampstead Garden Suburb is a suburb, north of Hampstead, west of Highgate and east of Golders Green. It is an example of early twentieth-century domestic architecture and town planning located in the London Borough of Barnet in northwest London. The master plan was prepared by Barry Parker and Sir Raymond Unwin.
Despite the founders' original intentions, Hampstead Garden Suburb is now considered to be one of the wealthiest areas in the country.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Hampstead Garden Suburb was founded by Henrietta Barnett, who, with her husband Samuel, had started the Whitechapel Art Gallery and Toynbee Hall. In 1906, Barnett set up the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd, which purchased 243 acres of land from Eton College for the scheme and appointed Raymond Unwin as its architect.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gayler |first1=Hih J. |title=Geographical excursions in London |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5NQhXsuCCTgC&pg=PA176&dq=%22hampstead+garden+suburb+%22+shops%22|accessdate=24 August 2011 |year=1996 |publisher=University Press of America, |location=  |isbn=0-7618-0328-9 |page=176[/tpl]
Among the scheme's aims were the following:
This required a private bill before Parliament, as it was counter to local bylaws. The provisions of the new act allowed less land to be taken up by roads and more by gardens and open spaces.
The ideas for the "Garden Suburb" were clearly based on the ideas and experience of Parker and Unwin in the planning and development of Letchworth Garden City, the first development of its kind, inspired by the work of Ebenezer Howard. Other consultant architects involved with the Hampstead development include George Lister Sutcliffe and John Soutar.
However, with no industry, no public houses and few shops or services, the suburb, unlike the garden cities, made no attempt to be self-contained. In the 1930s the "Suburb" (as it is known by locals) expanded to the north of the A1. While more characterful than most other suburban housing, some of the housing to the north is considered, overall, of less architectural value.
On Central Square, laid out by Sir Edwin Lutyens, there are two large churches, St. Jude's Church and The Free Church, as well as a Quaker Meeting House. There are two mixed state primary schools in the Suburb, Garden Suburb and Brookland. There is also a state girls' grammar school, Henrietta Barnett School. The school used to house The Institute, an adult education centre, but most of The Institute has now moved to accommodation in East Finchley, opposite the tube station, with the opening of a new purpose-built arts centre.
Shops and other services are provided in the shopping parades of Market Place and Temple Fortune, with Golders Green and East Finchley within walking distance for those who live at either end.
Little Wood contains an open air arena, which is used for summer theatrical performances by a local amateur theatre society.
Despite the founders' intentions, the steep increases in house prices across London combined with the continual expansion of the Greater London area and the very small proportion of housing association housing means that Hampstead Garden Suburb is now considered to be one of the wealthiest areas in the country.

==Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust==

Freehold houses, flats and commercial premises within the Suburb are subject to a scheme of management approved pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 by an Order of the Chancery Division of the High Court, dated 17 January 1974, as amended by a further Order dated 17 February 1983.
The HGS Trust whose aim is to protect the character and amenity of the Suburb[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hgstrust.org/about/schemeofmanagement.html |title=Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust |publisher=Hgstrust.org |date=[/tpl] operates the scheme from an office in Finchley Road. Freeholders are required to get the prior approval of the Trust before altering the external appearance of their properties. Consent is also required for significant changes to gardens, erection of garden sheds and felling or pruning of trees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hgstrust.org/planning/index.html |title=Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust |publisher=Hgstrust.org |date=6 January 2012[/tpl] The Trust is also the freeholder of the majority of the remaining leasehold property in the Suburb which are mostly held on very long leases.
