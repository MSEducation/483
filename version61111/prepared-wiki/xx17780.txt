==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born in a Telugu Brahmin family [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] at a village near Thiruttani India, 84 km to the northwest of Madras (now Chennai). His father's name was Sarvepalli Veeraswami[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.teluguone.com/splevents/general/index.jsp?filename=srkrishna05.htm |title=TeluguOne |publisher=TeluguOne |accessdate=2011-08-31[/tpl] and his mother's was Sitamma. His early years were spent in Tiruttani and Tirupati. His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local zamindar (landlord). His primary education was at Primary Board High School at Tiruttani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheral Mission School in Tirupati.Sarvepalli Gopal: Radhakrishnan; a Biography (1989) p. 11

===Education===

Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined Voorhees College in Vellore but switched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He graduated from there in 1906 with a Master's degree in Philosophy, being one of its most distinguished alumni.Sarvepalli Gopal: Radhakrishnan; a Biography (1989) p.15
Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. Being a financially constrained student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy textbooks in to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academic course.The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1952) p.6Sarvepalli Gopal: Radhakrishnan; a Biography (1989) p.14
Radhakrishnan wrote his thesis for the M.A. degree on "The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical Presuppositions".Sarvepalli Gopal: Radhakrishnan; a Biography (1989) p.17 It "was intended to be a reply to the charge that the Vedanta system had no room for ethics."[tpl]sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112[/tpl] He was afraid that this M.A. thesis would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. Alfred George Hogg. Instead, Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on having done most excellent work.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Radhakrishnan's thesis was published when he was only 20. According to Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and other Christian teachers of Indian culture "disturbed my faith and shook the traditional props on which I leaned."[tpl]sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112[/tpl] Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,
[tpl]quote|The challenge of Christian critics impelled me to make a study of Hinduism and find out what is living and what is dead in it. My pride as a Hindu, roused by the enterprise and eloquence of Swami Vivekananda, was deeply hurt by the treatment accorded to Hinduism in missionary institutions.[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl][/tpl]
This led him to his critical study of Indian philosophy and religion,[tpl]sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112[/tpl] and a lifelong defense of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl]

===Marriage===

Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu,Radhakrishnan's wife's name is spelled differently in different sources. It is spelled Sivakamu by Sarvepalli Gopal (1989); Sivakamuamma by Mamta Anand (2006); and still differently by others.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] a distant cousin, at the age of 16.Sarvepalli Gopal: Radhakrishnan; a Biography (1989) p.12  As per tradition the marriage was arranged by the family. The couple had five daughters and a son, Sarvepalli Gopal. Sarvepalli Gopal went on to a notable career as a historian. Sivakamu died in 1956. They were married for over 51 years.

===Academic career===

In April 1909, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presidency College. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore, where he taught at its Maharaja's College, Mysore.

Professor at Mysore|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1401-0|pages=17–26[/tpl] By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book, The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit". His second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published in 1920.
In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert Lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Harris Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as An Idealist View of Life.
In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Harris Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in the June 1931 Birthday Honours,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33722/supplements/3624 |title=Viewing Page 3624 of Issue 33722 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=1931-06-02 |accessdate=2011-08-31[/tpl] and formally invested with his honour by the Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April 1932.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33816/pages/2398 |title=Viewing Page 2398 of Issue 33816 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=1932-04-12 |accessdate=2011-08-31[/tpl] However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence,[ref]
 [tpl]OCLC|28967355[/tpl]. Page 9 states: "In 1931.... He was knighted that year, but ceased to use the title after Independence."</ref>[tpl]rp|9[/tpl] preferring instead his academic title of 'Doctor'.
He was the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU).[tpl]sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=90[/tpl] He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

===Political career===

Radhakrishnan started his political career "rather late in life",[tpl]sfn|Bron|1970|p=152[/tpl] after his successful academic career.[tpl]sfn|Bron|1970|p=152[/tpl] His international authority preceded his political career.[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl] In 1931 he was nominated to the League of Nations Committee for International Cooperation, whereafter "in Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter of the role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society."[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl] When India became independent in 1947, Radhakrishnan represented India at UNESCO (1946–52) and was later Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union, from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of India. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice President of India in 1952,TeluguOne and elected as the second President of India (1962–1967).
Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active in the struggle against British rule.[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl] His motivation lay in his pride of Hindu culture, and the defence of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl] According to Brown,
[tpl]quote|He had always defended Hindu culture against uninformed Western criticism and had symbolized the pride of Indians in their own intellectual traditions.[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl][/tpl]

===Teacher's Day===

When he became President, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday, 5 September. He replied,  "Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if 5 September is observed as Teachers' Day."  His birthday has since been celebrated as Teachers' Day in India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/td/index.aspx |title=Teachers' Day |publisher=Festivalsofindia.in |accessdate=2012-10-02[/tpl]

===Charity===

Along with Ghanshyam Das Birla and some other social workers in the pre-independence era, Radhakrishnan formed the Krishnarpan Charity Trust.

==Philosophy==

Radhakrishnan tried to bridge eastern and western thought,[tpl]sfn|Schillp|1992[/tpl] defending Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism",[tpl]sfn|Brown|1970|p=153[/tpl] but also incorporationg Western philosophical and religious thought.[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl]

===Advaita Vedanta===

Radhakrishnan was one of the most prominent spokesman of Neo-Vedanta.[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hacker|1995|p=8[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fort|1998|p=179[/tpl] His metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for a contemporary understanding.Michael Hawley, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.[tpl]refn|group=note|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to Bhedabheda-Vedanta than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world. Nicholas F. Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K. Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists," a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his The Life Divine, declares that he has moved from Sankara's  "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term."[tpl]sfn|Gier|2013[/tpl][/tpl] Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of maya. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real."

===Intuition and religious experience===

"Intuition", or anubhava, synonymously called "religious experience", has a central place in Radhakrishnan's philosophy as a source of knowledge which is not mediated by conscious thought.[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl] His specific interest in experience can be traced back to the works of William James (1842–1910), Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924), Henri Bergson (1859–1941), and Friedrich von Hügel (1852–1925),[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl] and to Vivekananda,[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994[/tpl] who had a strong influence on Radhakrisnan's thought.[tpl]sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=179[/tpl] According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying character (svatassiddha), self-evidencing (svāsaṃvedya), and self-luminous (svayam-prakāsa). In his book An Idealist View of Life, he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought.[tpl]cite web |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/September/engpdf/1-4.pdf|title=The Great Indian Philosopher : Dr. Radhakrishnan|publisher=State Govt. Of Orissa |format=PDF |accessdate=Nov 2013 [/tpl]
According to Radhakrishnan, intuition plays a specific role in all kinds of experience. Radhakrishnan discernes five sorts of experience:

===Classification of religions===

For Radhakrishnan, theology and creeds are intellectual formulations, and symbols of religious experience or "religious intuitions". Radhakrishnan qualified the variety of religions hierarchically according to their apprehension of "religious experience", giving Advaita Vedanta the highest place:[tpl]refn|group=note|This qualification is not unique to Radhakrishnan. It was developed by nineteenth-century Indologists,[tpl]sfn|King|1999|p=169[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13[/tpl] and was highly influential in the understanding of Hinduism, both in the west and in India.[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Nicholson|2010[/tpl][/tpl]
Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious experience. According to Radhakrishnan, "if philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must become empirical and found itself on religious experience". He saw this empiricism exemplified in the Vedas:
To Radhakrishnan, Advaita Vedanta was the best representative of Hinduism, as being grounded in intuition, in contrast to the "intellectually mediated interpretations" of other religions.[tpl]refn|group=note|Anubhava is a central term in Shankara's writings. According to several modern interpretators, especially Radakrishnan, Shankara emphasizes the role of personal experience (anubhava) in ascertaining the validity of knowledge.[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14[/tpl] Yet, according to Rambacham himself, sruti, or textual authority, is the main source of knowledge for Shankara.[tpl]sfn|Rambachan|1994[/tpl][/tpl] He objected against charges of "quietism"[tpl]refn|group=note|Sweetman: "The supposed quietist and conservative nature of Vedantic thought"[tpl]sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13-14[/tpl][/tpl] and "world denial",[tpl]sfn|Fort|1998|p=179-181[/tpl] instead stressing the need and ethic of social service,[tpl]sfn|Fort|1998|p=179-181[/tpl] giving a modern interpretation of classical terms as tat-tvam-asi.[tpl]sfn|Fort|1998|p=180[/tpl] According to Radhakrishnan, Vedanta offers the most direct intuitive experience and inner realization, which makes it the highest form of religion:
Radhakrishnan saw other religions, "including what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism," as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby Hindusizing all religions.
Although Radhakrishnan was well-acquainted with western culture and philosophy, he was also critical of them. He stated that Western philosophers, despite all claims to objectivity, were influenced by theological influences of their own culture.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles Moore (eds.), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton: Princeton University Press 1989, 610–639

==Influence==

Radhakrishnan was one of India's best and most influential twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy,
Radhakrishnan's defense of the Hindu traditions has been highly influential,[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998|p=100[/tpl] both in India and the western world. In India, Radhakrishnan's ideas contributed to the formation of India as a nation-state.[tpl]sfn|Long|2007|p=173[/tpl] Radhakrishnan's writings contributed to the hegemonic status of Vedanta as "the essential worldview of Hinduism".[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199[/tpl] In the western world, Radhakrishnan's interpretations of the Hindu tradition, and his emphasis on "spiritual experience", made Hinduism more readily accessible for a western audience, and contributed to the influence Hinduism has on modern spirituality:
[tpl]quote|In figures such as Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan we witness Vedanta traveling to the West, were it nourished the spiritual hunger of Europeans and Americans in the early decades of the twentieth century.[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199[/tpl][/tpl]

===Appraisal===

Radhakrishnan has been highly appraised. According to Paul Artur Schillp:
[tpl]quote|Nor would it be possible to find a more excellent example of a living "bridge" between the East and the West than Professor Radhakrishnan. Steeped, as Radhakrishnan has been since his childhood, in the life, traditions, and philosophical heritage of his native India, he has also struck deep roots in Western philosophy, which he has been studying tirelessly ever since his undergraduate college-days in Madras Christian College, and in which he is as thoroughly at home as any Western philosopher.[tpl]sfn|Schillp|1992|p=ix[/tpl][/tpl]
And according to Hawley:

===Criticism and context===

Radhakrishnan's ideas have also received criticism and challenges, for their perennialist[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180[/tpl] and universalist claims,[tpl]sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl] and the use of an East-West dichotomy.

====Perennialism====

According to Radhakrishnan, there is not only an underlying "divine unity"[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180[/tpl] from the seers of the Upanishads up to modern Hindus like Tagore and Gandhi,[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180[/tpl] but also "an essential commonality between philosophical and religious traditions from widely disparate cultures."[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl] This is also a major theme in the works of Rene Guenon, the Theosophical Society, and the contemporary popularity of eastern religions in modern spirituality.[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sharf|2000[/tpl] Since the 1970s, the Perennialist position has been criticised for its essentialism.[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sharf|2000[/tpl] Social-constructionists give an alternative approach to religious experience, in which such "experiences" are seen as being determined and mediated by cultural determants:[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1998[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sharf|2000[/tpl]{{refn|group=note|See, especially, Steven T. Katz:
[tpl]quote|Religions, too, rely not so much on individual experiences or on innate feelings - like a sensus numinosus (Rudolf Otto) - but rather on behavioral patterns acquired and learned in childhood.[tpl]sfn|Michaels|2004|p=100[/tpl][/tpl]
Rinehart also points out that "perennialist claims notwithstanding, modern Hindu thought is a product of history",[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180[/tpl] which "has been worked out and expressed in a variety of historical contexts over the preceding two hundreds years."[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180[/tpl] This is also true for Radhakrishan, who was educated by missionaries[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195[/tpl] and, like other neo-Vedantins used the prevalent western understanding of India and its culture to present an alternative to the western critique.[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004[/tpl]

====Universalism, communalism and Hindu nationalism====

According to Richard King, the elevation of Vedanta as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta as the "paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion"[tpl]sfn|King|2002|p=128[/tpl] by colonial Indologists but also neo-Vedantins served well for the Hindu nationalists, who further popularised this notion of Advaita Vedanta as the pinnacle of Indian religions.[tpl]sfn|King|2002|p=129-130[/tpl] It
[tpl]quote|...provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression.[tpl]sfn|King|2002|p=133[/tpl][/tpl]
This "opportunity" has been criticised. According to Sucheta Mazumdar and Vasant Kaiwar,
[tpl]quote|... Indian nationalist leaders continued to operate within the categorical field generated by politicized religion ... Extravagant claims were made on behalf of Oriental civilization. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's statement - "the Vedanta is not a religion but religion itself in its "most universal and deepest significance" - is fairly typical.[tpl]sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36[/tpl][/tpl]
Rinehart also criticises the inclusivism of Radhakrishnan's approach, since it provides "a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of of Vedantic truth."[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Rinehart: "Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself."[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl][/tpl] According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is communalism,[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl] the idea that "all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion."Ram Puniyani, COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5 Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl] and that "the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda."[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197[/tpl] Yet Rinehart also points out that it is
[tpl]quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of ... militant Hindus.[tpl]sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's "use" of religion in the defense of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general. The complexities of Asian nationalism are to be seen and understood in the context of colonialism, modernization and nation-building. See, for example, Anagarika Dharmapala, for the role of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lankese struggle for independence,[tpl]sfn|McMahan|2008[/tpl] and D.T. Suzuki, who conjuncted Zen to Japanese nationalism and militarism, in defense against both western hegemony and the pressure on Japanese Zen during the Meiji Restoration to conform to Shinbutsu Bunri.[tpl]sfn|Sharf|1993[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sharf|1995-A[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl]

====Post-colonialism====

Colonialism left deep traces in the hearts and minds of the Indian people, influencing the way they understood and represented themselves.[tpl]sfn|King|2001[/tpl] The influences of "colonialist forms of knowledge" can also be found in the works of Radhakrishnan. According to Hawley, Radhakirshnan's division between East and West, the East being spiritual and mystical, and the West being rational and dogmatical,
Since the 1990s, the colonial influences on the 'construction' and 'representation' of Hinduism have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism[tpl]sfn|Sweetman|2004[/tpl] Western Indologists are trying to come to more neutral and better-informed representations of India and its culture, while Indian scholars are trying to establish forms of knowledge and understanding which are grounded in and informed by Indian traditions, instead of being dominated by western forms of knowledge and understanding.[tpl]sfn|Sweetman|2004[/tpl]
