[[Transport in Anguilla]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Anguilla

One of the British overseas territories, the Caribbean island of Anguilla measures only [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] wide, so transport is simpler than in many countries.  There is no public transport, such as bus or rail systems, since there isn't enough need.  However, Anguilla's roads are better maintained than on many Caribbean islands. 
Cars are the main means of transport, with driving on the left-hand side of the road, as in the United Kingdom.  Although speed limits rarely exceed [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] per hour and traffic moves slowly, with the island's small size it doesn't take long to get anywhere.  Taxi service is unmetered, with set rates published in tourist guides.  In addition to regular transport, taxis often offer island tours lasting several hours.  Fares must be paid in cash.  
Ferries offer transport from Anguilla to other islands.  The ferry from Blowing Point to Marigot, St. Martin, known to the locals as the Haddad Express, runs all day on the half hour, into the night time.  With no reservations required, taking the ferry is simple and inexpensive.  Ferries can also be chartered to other destinations. One such Charter Service is from Blowing Point, Anguilla to Princess Juliana Airport to make travel easier. 
Other means of transport include bikes, mopeds, motorcycles and walking.  Because off the territory's small land mass and flatter terrain, these methods make more sense on Anguilla than on many other Caribbean islands.
Cars, bikes,mopeds and motorcycles are all available for rental at reasonable prices.  Both well-known car rental agencies and local companies operate rental businesses.  Groups may also charter a private bus for excursions.
A railway was built to support phosphate mining on Sombrero Island.
