Khor Fakkan (or Khawr Fakkan) ([tpl]lang-ar|خورفكان[/tpl]) is a town located along the Gulf of Oman on the east coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The town, the second largest on the east coast after Fujairah,[tpl]cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Terry|last2=Dunston|first2=Lara|title=Dubai. Ediz. Inglese|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QscSeQp8hxMC&pg=PA162|year=2006|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-840-8|page=162[/tpl] is set on the picturesque bay of Khor Fakkan, which means "Creek of Two Jaws". Khor Fakkan belongs to the emirate of Sharjah but is geographically surrounded by the emirate of Fujairah. It is the site of Khor Fakkan Container Terminal, the only natural deep-sea port in the region and one of the major container ports in the Emirates.

==History==

Khor Fakkan has a long history of human settlement. There is evidence of the postholes from the wooden uprights of the traditional barasti huts known as arish, such as at Tell Abraq which dates from the 3rd to 1st millienium BC. Excavations by a team from the Sharjah Archaeological Museum have identified 34 graves and a settlement belonging to the early-mid 2nd millennium BC. These are clustered on rock outcrops overlooking the harbour.
Around 1500, Duarte Barbosa described it as a village “around which are gardens and farms in plenty”.[tpl]cite book|last=Agius|first=Dionisius A.|title=Seafaring in the Arabian Gulf and Oman: People of the Dhow|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DRtWm-UkS-oC&pg=PA66|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-20182-0|page=66[/tpl] In 1580 the Venetian jeweler Gasparo Balbi noted "Chorf" in a list of places on the east coast of the United Arab Emirates, which is considered by historians to indicate Khor Fakkan.[tpl]cite book|last1=Abed|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Hellyer|first2=Peter|title=United Arab Emirates: A New Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&pg=PA74|year=2001|publisher=Trident Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|page=74[/tpl] The Portuguese built a fort at Khor Fakkan that was a ruin by 1666. The log book of the Dutch vessel the Meerkat mentions this fort and another one, describing "Gorfacan" as a place on a small bay, with about 200 small houses built from date branches, near the beach.  It refers to a triangular Portuguese fortress on the northern side, in ruins, and a fortress on a hill on the southern side, also in ruins, without garrison or artillery.  As well as date palms, the Meerkat[tpl]'[/tpl]s log also mentions fig trees, melons, watermelons and myrrh.  It notes several wells with "good and fresh water" used for irrigation.
One reason suggested for the ruinous state of the forts is an invasion  in 1623 of the Persian navy under the control of Omani Sheikh Muhammad Suhari.  Suhari, facing a Portuguese counter-attack, withdrew to the Portuguese forts, including that of Khor Fakkan.  When the Persians were expelled, the Portuguese commander Rui Freire urged the people of Khor Fakkan to remain loyal to the Portuguese crown and established a Portuguese customs office as well.
In 1737, long after the Portuguese had been expelled from Arabia, the Persians again invaded Khor Fakkan, with some 5,000 men and 1,580 horses, with the help of the Dutch, during their intervention in the Omani civil war.[tpl]cite book|last=Hawley|first=Donald|title=The Trucial States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OnhCBuXmeWYC&pg=PA85|date=1 January 1970|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-04-953005-8|page=85[/tpl] In 1765 Khor Fakkan belonged to a sheikh of the Al Qasimi, Sharjah's ruling family, according to the German traveler Carsten Niebuhr. There is a map by the French cartographer Rigobert Bonne dating to about 1770 that shows the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf and shows Khor Fakkan.
From 1903 to 1952 Khor Fakkan was part of the cleaved emirate of Sharjah Kalba. German submarine U-533 sunk about [tpl]convert|25|mi[/tpl] off the coast on 16 October 1943 during World War II.

The modern Khor Fakkan Container Terminal was inaugurated in 1979, and is the only natural deep-sea port in the region, and one of the top ports in the Emirates for containers.[tpl]cite book|last=Peck|first=Malcolm C.|title=The A to Z of the Gulf Arab States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PguBHE07e6IC&pg=PA166|date=12 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3190-0|page=166[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=United Arab Emirates Yearboook 2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hXv2awRvNMUC&pg=PT217|year=2006|publisher=Trident Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-905486-05-2|page=217[/tpl] The Dh 300 million ($ 81.75 million) project involved reclaiming some [tpl]convert|150000|m2[/tpl] to increase the storage capacity and to facilitate large cranes, and [tpl]convert|16|m[/tpl] deep quays to accommodate for major vessels over [tpl]convert|400|m[/tpl] in length.

==Geography and climate==

Khor Fakkan lies on the east coast of the UAE, between the Arabian Sea and the Shumayliyah Mountains, rising to [tpl]convert|1023|m[/tpl] at Jebel al Hilqah. The bay of Khor Fakkan is north-east facing and is protected from prevailing winds by a jetty serving terminal for container ships. Tourism, despite the total ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol by the emirate of Sharjah, is well developed thanks to white sand beaches and coral reefs that attract many divers. Khor Fakkan Beach lies to the north of the centre of the town.
From November to April Khorfakkan is sunny and warm during the day; the evenings are cool and humidity low. Daytime temperatures range from 18°C to 30°C. One may expect rain and tropical storms between January and March. The climate warms from May to September with the high temperature at noon in July and August reaching 55°C. The nights too are warm, with the temperature reaching 42°C, with high humidity.[tpl]cn|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Landmarks==

Khor Fakkan has one 4 star holiday beach resort, the Oceanic Hotel.[tpl]cite book|title=Dubai: The Complete Residents' Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=II2bdl4gcIMC&pg=PA327|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Explorer Publishing & Distribution|isbn=978-976-8182-76-0|page=327[/tpl] The fish, fruit and vegetable souq is located at the southern end of the corniche and near the main highway. Al Wurrayah Falls is reachable by four-wheel-drive around 4.5 km north of the Oceanic hotel. One site of interest is the Rifaisa Dam, in the mountains of Khor Fakkan. This is believed to have been built over a village, and when the water is very still, the tops of the old houses are still visible. The town is served by Khor Fakkan Hospital.
