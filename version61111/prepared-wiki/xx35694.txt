[[Colesville]]

Colesville is the name of some places in the United States of America: 
Colesville is the accidental name Google Maps publish in 2009 for Canton, Ohio. Complaints were received on October 23, 2009 and were reported by major area news organizations on October 27, 2009. Google states they hope to have the error corrected within a few days. Some believe that it was a hacker (possibly "Cole") responsible for the mistake, others believe it may be a Massillon Tigers high school football team fan as the annual Massillon / McKinley game nears.
