Coronary artery disease (CAD) also known as atherosclerotic heart disease,[tpl]cite web |title=Coronary heart disease - causes, symptoms, prevention |url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/191/ |work=Southern Cross Healthcare Group |accessdate=15 September 2013[/tpl] coronary heart disease,[tpl]cite web |title=Coronary heart disease |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007115.htm |publisher=ADAM |accessdate=15 September 2013 [/tpl] or ischemic heart disease (IHD),[tpl]cite book |last=Bhatia |first=Sujata K. |title=Biomaterials for clinical applications |year=2010|publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=9781441969200 |page=23|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bXtaX468LRYC&pg=PA23 |edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl] is the most common type of heart disease and cause of heart attacks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/service-areas/heart/areas-of-care/heart-attack-coronary-artery-disease |title=Heart attack/coronary artery disease |publisher=Mount Sinai Hospital, New York [/tpl]  The disease is caused by plaque building up along the inner walls of the arteries of the heart, which narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to the heart.
While the symptoms and signs of coronary artery disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary artery disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a "sudden" heart attack, finally arises.  Symptoms of stable ischaemic heart disease include angina (characteristic chest pain on exertion) and decreased exercise tolerance. Unstable IHD presents itself as chest pain or other symptoms at rest, or rapidly worsening angina. The risk of artery narrowing increases with age, smoking, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, and is more common in men and those who have close relatives with CAD. Other causes include coronary vasospasm,[tpl]cite journal |author=Williams MJ, Restieaux NJ, Low CJ|title=Myocardial infarction in young people with normal coronary arteries |journal=Heart |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=191–4|date=February 1998 |pmid=9538315 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9538315 |pmc=1728590|doi=10.1136/hrt.79.2.191[/tpl] a spasm of the blood vessels of the heart, it is usually called Prinzmetal's angina.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rezkalla SH, Kloner RA |title=Cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction |journal=Clin Med Res |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=172–6 |date=October 2007 |pmid=18056026 |doi=10.3121/cmr.2007.759 |url=http://www.clinmedres.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18056026 |pmc=2111405[/tpl]
Diagnosis of IHD is with an electrocardiogram, blood tests (cardiac markers), cardiac stress testing or a coronary angiogram. Depending on the symptoms and risk, treatment may be with medication, percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
It was as of 2012 the most common cause of death in the world,[tpl]cite journal |last=Finegold |first=JA |coauthors=Asaria, P; Francis, DP |title=Mortality from ischaemic heart disease by country, region, and age: Statistics from World Health Organisation and United Nations |journal=International journal of cardiology|date=4 December 2012 |pmid=23218570|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.10.046|volume=168|issue=2|pages=934–45[/tpl] and a major cause of hospital admissions.[tpl]cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Health Statistics and Informatics in the Information, Evidence and Research Cluster |title=The global burden of disease 2004 update |publisher=WHO |location=Geneva |year=2004 |isbn=92-4-156371-0[/tpl] There is limited evidence for population screening, but prevention (with a healthy diet and sometimes medication for diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure) is used both to prevent IHD and to decrease the risk of complications.

==Signs and symptoms==

Angina (chest pain) that occurs regularly with activity, after heavy meals, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with high grade narrowings of the heart arteries.  The symptoms of angina are often treated with betablocker therapy such as metoprolol or atenolol.  Nitrate preparations such as nitroglycerin, which come in short-acting and long-acting forms are also effective in relieving symptoms but are not known to reduce the chances of future heart attacks. Many other more effective treatments, especially of the underlying atheromatous disease, have been developed.
Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction. About 80% of chest pains have nothing to do with the heart.

==Risk factors==

Risk factors can be classified as: fixed (such as age, sex, family history) and modifiable (such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.)
There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is Framingham Score, used in the Framingham Heart Study. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.framinghamheartstudy.org > Coronary Heart Disease (10-year risk)(based on Wilson, D'Agostino, Levy et al. 'Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease using Risk Factor Categories', Circulation 1998)
Coronary artery disease has a number of well determined risk factors. The most common risk factors include smoking, family history, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and hyperlipidemia.[tpl]cite web |title=Causes |date=29 June 2012 |id=DS00064 |work=Coronary artery disease |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/coronary-artery-disease/DS00064/DSECTION=causes[/tpl] Smoking is associated with about 54% of cases and obesity 20%.

===Indirect===

==Pathophysiology==

Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes ischemia (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells.  Myocardial cells may die from lack of oxygen and this is called a myocardial infarction (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to heart muscle damage, heart muscle death and later myocardial scarring without heart muscle regrowth. Chronic high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into ventricular fibrillation leading to death.
Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a coronary artery (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops atherosclerosis. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with all sorts of "gunge" - including calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory cells - to form a plaque. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only a significant role in stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary arteriosclerosis.  This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calcification as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis  (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large "pimples" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two plaques, or might have dozens distributed throughout their coronary arteries. However, there is a term in medicine called cardiac syndrome X, which describes chest pain (Angina pectoris) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger coronary arteries of their hearts when an angiogram (coronary angiogram) is being performed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lanza GA |title=Cardiac syndrome X: a critical overview and future perspectives |journal=Heart |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |date=February 2007 |pmid=16399854 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.067330 |url= |pmc=1861371[/tpl]
No one knows exactly what causes cardiac syndrome X. One explanation is microvascular dysfunction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jones|first=E|coauthors=Eteiba, W; Merz, NB|title=Cardiac syndrome X and microvascular coronary dysfunction|journal=Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine|date=August 2012 |volume=22 |issue=6|pages=161–8|pmid=23026403 |doi=10.1016/j.tcm.2012.07.014 |pmc=3490207[/tpl] It is not completely clear why women are more likely than men to have it however, hormones and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kaski JC |title=Pathophysiology and management of patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (cardiac syndrome X) |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=568–72 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14769677 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000116601.58103.62 |url=[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

For symptomatic patients, stress echocardiography can be used to make a diagnosis for obstructive coronary artery disease.[ref][tpl]Cite journal |author1 = American Society of Echocardiography |author1-link = American Society of Echocardiography |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Society of Echocardiography |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-echocardiography/ |accessdate=27 February 2013 |postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl], citing
CAD has always been a tough disease to diagnose without the use of invasive or stressful activities.  The development of the Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG) has changed the way CAD is diagnosed.  The MCG consists of a 2 lead resting EKG signal is transformed into a mathematical model and compared against tens of thousands of clinical trials to diagnose a patient with an objective severity score, as well as secondary and tertiary results about the patients condition.  The results from MCG tests have been validated in 8 clinical trials [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] which resulted in a database of over 50,000 patients where the system has demonstrated accuracy comparable to coronary angiography (90% overall sensitivity, 85% specificity).
This level of accuracy comes from the application of advanced techniques in signal processing and systems analysis combined with a large scale clinical database which allows MCG to provide quantitative, evidence-based results to assist physicians in reaching a diagnosis.  The MCG has also been awarded a Category III CPT code by the American Medical Association in the July 2009 CPT update [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl].
The diagnosis of "Cardiac Syndrome X" - the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, an "exclusion" diagnosis. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any patient with the suspicion of coronary artery disease:
The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), both for "stable" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An X-ray of the chest and blood tests may be performed.

===Stable angina===

In "stable" angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of cardiac stress tests may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), echocardiography (using ultrasound of the heart) or scintigraphy (using uptake of radionuclide by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, coronary angiography may be used to identify stenosis of the coronary arteries and suitability for angioplasty or bypass surgery.

===Acute coronary syndrome===

Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome generally takes place in the emergency department, where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify "evolving changes" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the "ST segment", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI), and is treated as an emergency with either urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent insertion) or with thrombolysis ("clot buster" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by cardiac markers (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage (infarction), the chest pain is attributed to a "non-ST elevation MI" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term "unstable angina" is used. This process usually necessitates admission to hospital, and close observation on a coronary care unit for possible complications (such as cardiac arrhythmias – irregularities in the heart rate).
Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.

===Heart failure===

In people with heart failure, stress testing or coronary angiography may be performed to identify and treat underlying coronary artery disease.

==Prevention==

Prevention involves: exercise, decreasing obesity, treating hypertension, a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.[tpl]cite journal|last=Naci|first=H.|coauthors=Ioannidis, J. P. A.|title=Comparative effectiveness of exercise and drug interventions on mortality outcomes: metaepidemiological study|journal=BMJ|date=1 October 2013|volume=347|issue=oct01 1|pages=f5577–f5577|doi=10.1136/bmj.f5577[/tpl]
In diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that very tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems like kidney failure and blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends "low to moderate alcohol intake" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease although this remains without scientific cause and effect proof.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html |title=5.

===Secondary prevention===

Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Regarding coronary artery disease, this can mean risk factor management that is carried out during cardiac rehabilitation, a 4-phase process beginning in hospital after MI, angioplasty or heart surgery and continuing for a minimum of three months. Exercise is a main component of cardiac rehabilitation along with diet, smoking cessation, and blood pressure and cholesterol management. Beta blockers may also be used for this purpose.[tpl]cite book |last=Awtry |first=Eric H. |coauthors=Joseph Loscalzo |title=Cecil Essentials of Medicine |pages=87–108 |chapter=Coronary Heart Disease |year=2004 |edition=6 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-7216-0147-2[/tpl]

===Lifestyle===

Lifestyle changes have been shown to be effective in reducing (and in the case of diet, reversing) coronary disease:
In people with coronary artery disease, aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of mortality.[tpl]cite journal |author=Swardfager W, Herrmann N, Cornish S, Mazereeuw G, Marzolini S, Sham L, Lanctôt KL |title=Exercise intervention and inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis |journal=Am Heart J |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=666–676 |year=2012 |pmid= 22520533 |url= http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(11)00899-4/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2011.12.017[/tpl] Separate to the question of the benefits of exercise; it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, found 'insufficient evidence' to recommend that doctors counsel patients on exercise, but "it did not review the evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity to reduce chronic disease, morbidity and mortality", it only examined the effectiveness of the counseling itself.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote physical activity: recommendation and rationale |journal=Ann.

===Medications===

====Aspirin====

In those with no other heart problems aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction in men but not women and increases the risk of bleeding, most of which is from the stomach. It does not affect the overall risk of death in either men or women.[tpl]cite journal |last=Wolff|first=T |coauthors=Miller, T; Ko, S |title=Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |journal=Annals of internal medicine |date=17 March 2009 |volume=150 |issue=6 |pages=405–10 |pmid=19293073 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-6-200903170-00009[/tpl]

More specifically, high-risk persons are 'those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3%'.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
