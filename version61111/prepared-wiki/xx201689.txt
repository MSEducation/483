==Career==

===Club===

Nicknamed Rifle, Pandolfi started his professional career with Vélez Sársfield. He was often compared to Uruguayan star Enzo Francescoli due to their similar characteristics on the field.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rock.com.ar/notas/0/323.shtml |title=El Rifle, de futbolista a rockero |date=2002-08-01 |publisher=Página/12 |language=Spanish|accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] Pandolfi played 104 games with the club between 1994 and 2000. He also made a short spell on loan in the Italian Serie A with Perugia in 1997.
Towards the end of his career, Pandolfi signed for Boca Juniors. As a Xeneize, he replicated the success once achieved with Vélez by winning the Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup, but this time in consecutive years. He left Boca without scoring a league goal, but scored five in international competitions. In 2002, while making his third spell with Vélez Sarsfield, Pandolfi announced his retirement from football at the age of 28.

Pandolfi played two friendly matches with the Argentine national team in 1999 during Marcelo Bielsa's coaching era.
