CATEGORIES: Islamic terms, Arabic words and phrases, Superlatives in religion

The Takbīr or Tekbir ([tpl]lang|ar|تَكْبِير[/tpl]) is the Arabic term for the phrase [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Allāhu Akbar[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ar|الله أكبر[/tpl]). It is usually translated as "God is the greatest," or "God is great".[tpl]cite web|title=Allahu Akbar|url=http://middleeast.about.com/od/a/g/allahu-akbar-definition.htm|accessdate=9 June 2013[/tpl] It is a common Islamic Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims; in formal prayer, in the call for prayer (adhān),[tpl]cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S. A. |title= Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana |isbn= 0-253-21627-3 |page=102[/tpl] as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress, to express celebration or victory, or to express resolute determination or defiance.
The form [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Allāhu[/tpl] is the nominative of Allah, meaning "God". The form [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|akbar[/tpl] is the elative of the adjective [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|kabīr[/tpl], meaning "great", from the Semitic root [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|k-b-r[/tpl]. As used in the [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Takbīr[/tpl] it is usually translated as "greatest", but some authors prefer "greater".E. W. Lane, Arabic English Lexicon, 1893, gives for kabir: "greater, and greatest, in body, or corporeal substance, and in estimation or rank or dignity, and more, or most, advanced in age, older, and oldest" (p. 2587). The translator [tpl]Who|date=January 2011[/tpl] of Ibn Qayyim's The Way to Patience and Gratitude into English opts for "Allah is Greater". In the Second Edition on page 463, an explanation is given: "...I preferred using 'the Greater' to 'the Greatest', as it is commonly used. Allahu Akbar literally means, "Allah is Greater" with the comparative mode. Yet, this does not mean that He (Glory be to Him) is not the Greatest, nor does it mean that there is anything that is put in comparison with Him. This is because when the Muslim says it, he means He is "Greater" than anything else, which, consequently, means He is the Greatest. This use gives more influence. This may be why it is used in Arabic this way, otherwise it should have been used as "Allahu al-Akbar", in the superlative mode. Surely, Allah knows best."[tpl]cite book|title=A Practical Arabic Grammar|page=66|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ex4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=akbar+arabic+grammar&source=bl&ots=uCjTxeHCPG&sig=icroi8vf4Valyx2IF4XUeFoDAcE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gnXuUeb_ItGx4APKrIH4Cw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&q=comparative&f=false|year=1887|author=A.O.Green|publisher=Clarendon Press[/tpl]
The term [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Takbīr[/tpl] itself is the stem II verbal noun ([tpl]transl|ar|DIN|tafʿīlun[/tpl]) of the triliteral root [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|k-b-r[/tpl], meaning "great".

==Usage==

This phrase is recited by Muslims in many different situations. For example, when they are very happy, to express approval, to prevent a Muslim from becoming prideful by reminding them that Allah is their source of success, or as a battle cry, during times of extreme stress.  In the Islamic world, instead of applause, often someone will shout "Takbīr" and the crowd will respond "Allahu Akbar" in response.

===In prayer===

The phrase is said during each stage of both obligatory prayers (performed five times a day), and supererogatory prayers (performed at will). The Muslim call to prayer (adhan) by the muezzin and to commence prayer (iqama) also contains the phrase.

===In times of distress===

This phrase is also used in times of distress.
Just before a Garuda Airbus A300B-4 crashed into the jungle near Medan, Indonesia, the pilot screamed "Aaaaaah! Allahu Akbar!" into his radio. According to a radio communication transcript, the pilot's conversation with the air controller had been in English, but his last words were this Arabic phrase as the plane crashed on September 26, 1997, killing all 235 people aboard in Indonesia's deadliest crash.  It was suspected that the crash may have been due to either disorientation or engine failure caused by local dense smog resulting from forest fires.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-leftright-confusion-led-to-smog-air-crash-1242039.html |title=Left-right confusion led to smog air crash |publisher=The Independent |date=September 30, 1997 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |location=London[/tpl]AP via Seattle Times: Indonesian Pilot Was Confused Before Crash, September 29, 1997

After 9/11, the FBI released a letter reportedly handwritten by the hijackers and found in three separate locations on September 11, 2001 — at Dulles International Airport, at the Pennsylvania crash site, and in hijacker Mohamed Atta's suitcase. It included a checklist of final reminders for the 9/11 hijackers.  An excerpt reads: "When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, 'Allahu Akbar,' because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers." Also, in the cockpit voice recorders found at the crash site of Flight 93, the hijackers are heard to be reciting the Takbīr repeatedly as the plane plummeted toward the ground and the passengers attempted to retake control of the plane.FBI Releases Copy of 4 Page Letter Linked to HijackersFBI, Press Conference national Press Release, September 28, 2001Instructions for the Last Night, PBS Frontline, "Inside the Terror Network, tracking their personal stories."Holy terrors: thinking about religion after September 11, p. 116, Bruce Lincoln, University of Chicago Press, 2006, ISBN 0-226-48203-0, comparing it to Quranic passage 8.12–14, accessed February 5, 2010[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10379952&pnum=0 |title=Tracey Barnett: Suicide bombers follow a morality of their own |author=Barnett, Tracey |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |date=May 3, 2006[/tpl]
