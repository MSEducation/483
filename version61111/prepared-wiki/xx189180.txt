==Notable Nigerians from Okija==

Okija is home to many notable Nigerians, including;

==Okija Shrine==

The shrine achieved notoriety in 2004 when Anambra state police raided it and found 50 decomposing or shrunken bodies and 20 human skulls in the compound; over 30 priests were arrested, and other nearby shrines were raided afterwards. Forensic tests established that the bodies were poisoned with chemicals, and that the priests had taken the property of the victims from their homes and shared in the loot. The shrine was subsequently rededicated to Jesus Christ as the only God for all Okija people.http://www.igbonews.co.uk/html/okija2.html
The shrine was also prominent as the location for the deal between Chris Ngige and Christian Uba, godfather of the People's Democratic Party (Nigeria), where Ngige's 2003 election to the governorship of Anambra state was arranged. Following the fraudulent election, Ngige took a more independent direction, resulting in Uba kidnapping him back to the site, and violently extracting a "letter of resignation". When this was presented to the state legislature, there followed a period of tit-for-tat media disclosures, and the undated letter was revoked. After three years of legal wranglings, matters were decided in the Nigerian Federal Court of Appeal,  with Peter Obi being declared the actual winner of the original election.
