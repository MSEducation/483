[[Illegality in English law]]

CATEGORIES: English contract law, English tort law, English trusts law

Illegality in English law is a potential ground in English contract law, tort or trusts for a court to refuse to enforce an obligation. The illegality of a transaction, either because of public policy under the common law, or because of legislation, potentially means no action directly concerning the deal will be heard by the courts. The doctrine is reminiscent of the Latin phrase "Ex turpi causa non oritur actio", meaning "no cause of action arises from a wrong". The primary problem arising when courts refuse to enforce an agreement is the extent to which an innocent party may recover any property already conveyed through the transaction. Hence illegality is raises important questions for English unjust enrichment law.

==Overview==

In the early case of Holman v Johnson(1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343 Lord Mansfield CJ set out the rationale for the illegality doctrine.

===Public policy===

===Statute===

===Restraint of trade===

==Tort==

In the law of tort, the principle would prevent a criminal from bringing a claim against (for example) a fellow criminal. In National Coal Board v England1954 AC 403 Lord Asquith said,
It is not absolute in effect. For example, in Revill v Newberry1996 1 All ER 291 an elderly allotment holder was sleeping in his shed with a shotgun, to deter burglars.  On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun through a hole in the shed, injuring the plaintiff.  At first instance, the defendant successfully raised the defence of ex turpi to avoid the claim.  However, the Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff's appeal, holding that the defendant was negligent to have shot blindly at body height, without shouting a warning or shooting a warning shot into the air, and that the response was out of all proportion to the threat.
The precise scope of the doctrine is not certain.  In some cases, it seems that the illegality prevents a duty of care arising in the first place.  For example, in Ashton v Turner1981 QB 137 the defendant crashed a car in the course of getting away from the scene of a burglary, injuring the plaintiff.  Ewbank J held that the court may not recognise a duty of care in such cases as a matter of public policy.  Similarly, in Pitts v Hunt,1990 3 All ER 344 Balcombe LJ of the Court of Appeal rationalised this approach, saying that it was impossible to decide the appropriate standard of care in cases where the parties were involved in illegality. However, the other two judges, although reached the same conclusion, took different approaches. Beldam LJ favoured a public conscience approach which considers whether the general public would be outraged or view the court as indirectly encouraging a criminal act if they were to award damages. Dillon LJ meanwhile provided little practical guidance in his approach where the defence of illegality is successful when a claimant's cause of action arises "directly ex turpi causa".

==Trusts==

The courts view ex turpi as a defence where otherwise a claim would lie, again on grounds of public policy.  In Tinsley v Milligan1992 Ch 310 Nicholls LJ in the Court of Appeal spoke of the court having to "weigh or balance the adverse consequences of granting relief against the adverse consequences of refusing relief". The plaintiff was ultimately successful in Tinsley v Milligan in the House of Lords, which allowed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff did not need to rely on the illegality.
The recent case of Gray v Thames Trains2009 3 WLR 167 upheld the basic rule of public policy that disallowed recovery of anything stemming from Plaintiff's own wrongdoing.
