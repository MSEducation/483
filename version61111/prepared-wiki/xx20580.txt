Roger Joseph Ebert ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|b|ər|t[/tpl]; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic, journalist and screenwriter. He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com |title=RogerEbert.com |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl] In 1975, he was the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. As of 2010, his reviews were syndicated to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad. Ebert also published more than 20 books and dozens of collections of reviews.
Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally-televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously-named At the Movies programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up," used when both hosts gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.
In 2005, Ebert became the first film critic to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[tpl]cite news|last=Rousseau|first=Caryn|title=Roger Ebert, first movie critic to win Pulitzer, dies at 70|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56107300-223/ebert-movie-siskel-chicago.html.csp|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=April 4, 2013[/tpl] Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ebert "was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic", Tom Van Riper of Forbes described him as "the most powerful pundit in America",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/09/21/pundit-americas-top-oped-cx_tvr_0924pundits.html|title=The Top Pundits in America|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=December 9, 2008|author=Riper, Tom Van|date=September 24, 2007|work=Forbes[/tpl] and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him "the best-known film critic in America".[tpl]cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Remembrance: Roger Ebert, film's hero to the end|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-ebert-appreciation-20130405,0,669989.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 4, 2013[/tpl]
Ebert lived with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands from 2002 that required treatments that necessitated his lower jaw being removed, thus costing him the ability to speak or eat normally. Regardless, his ability to write was unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print right up until his death on April 4, 2013.

Regarding his early influences in film criticism, Ebert wrote in the 1998 parody collection Mad About the Movies:
Ebert began taking classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an early-entrance student, completing his high-school courses while also taking his first university class.Ebert, Roger. Life Itself: A Memoir. New York: Grand Central Publishing, 2011. p. 91. After graduating from Urbana High School in 1960, Ebert then attended and received his undergraduate degree in 1964. While at the University of Illinois, Ebert worked as a reporter for the Daily Illini and then served as its editor during his senior year while also continuing to work as a reporter for the News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (he had begun at the News-Gazette at age 15 covering Urbana High School sports).Ebert, Roger.

New York: Grand Central Publishing,  2011. pp. 92, 96.  One of the first movie reviews he ever wrote was a review of La Dolce Vita, published in The Daily Illini in October 1961.La Dolce Vita @ rogerebert.com, October 4, 1961.
Ebert spent a semester as a master's student in the department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year.Ebert, Roger. Life Itself: A Memoir. New York: Grand Central Publishing, 2011. p.96. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966.Ebert, Roger. Life Itself: A Memoir. New York: Grand Central Publishing,  2011. p. 139. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert."Ebert named film critic." Chicago Sun-Times, April 5, 1967, p. 57. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.Ebert, Roger. Life Itself: A Memoir.

==Career==

Ebert began his career as a film critic in 1967, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times. He also met film critic Pauline Kael for the first time at the New York Film Festival in 1967. After he sent her some of his columns, she told him they were "the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today". That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the University of Illinois titled Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life, was published by the University's press. In 1969, his review of Night of the Living DeadEbert’s review of Night of the Living Dead January 5, 1967 was published in Reader's Digest.
Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1970 Russ Meyer film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and sometimes joked about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release but is now regarded as a cult classic.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19700101/REVIEWS/708110301/1023 |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com date=1980|author=Ebert, Roger|accessdate=September 3, 2012[/tpl] Ebert and Meyer also made Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens, Up!, and other films, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols movie Who Killed Bambi? (In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of Who Killed Bambi? aka Anarchy in the UK on his blog.)Ebert, Roger. "'Who Killed Bambi?' – A screenplay", ''Chicago Sun-Times, April 25, 2010
From the 1970s on, Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as a guest lecturer, teaching a night class on film. For example, his fall 2005 class was on the work of the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
In 1975, Ebert began co-hosting a weekly film review television show, Sneak Previews, which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. Three years later, Gene Siskel became a co-host when the show was picked up by PBS for national distribution. The duo became famous for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129634,00.html|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|title=Despite the Loss of Film-Critic Buddy Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert Gives Life a Thumbs-Up|newspaper=People|date= November 1, 1999[/tpl] Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up".
In 1982, they moved from PBS to launch a similar syndicated commercial television show named At The Movies With Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert. In 1986, they again moved the show to new ownership, creating Siskel & Ebert & The Movies through Buena Vista Television (part of the Walt Disney Company).
After Siskel's death in 1999, the producers retitled the show Roger Ebert & the Movies and used rotating co-hosts. In September 2000, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed At The Movies With Ebert & Roeper (and other later titles).
Ebert ended his association with the Disney-owned At The Movies in July 2008,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/22arts-EBERTANDROEP_BRF.html|title=Ebert and Roeper No Longer at the Movies |publisher=New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=Aug 30, 2013[/tpl] after the studio indicated it wished to take the program in a new direction.

On January 31, 2009, Ebert was made an honorary life member of the Directors Guild of America."Directors Guild to honor Roger Ebert" Yahoo! News/Reuters/The Hollywood Reporter; December 17, 2008 His final television series, Ebert Presents: At The Movies, premiered on January 21, 2011, with Ebert contributing a review voiced by Bill Kurtis in a brief segment called "Roger's Office",Roger Ebert returns with new PBS review show, Caryn Rousseau, Associated Press (via Deseret News), January 19, 2011.

===Critical style and personal taste===

Ebert described his critical approach to films as "relative, not absolute"; he reviewed a film for what he felt would be its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest, unless he considered the film to be "artistically inept" or "morally repugnant", in which case it received no stars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010315/1023|title=Death Wish II review by Roger Ebert|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl]
 When you ask a friend if Hellboy is any good, you're not asking if it's any good compared to Mystic River, you're asking if it's any good compared to The Punisher. And my answer would be, on a scale of one to four, if Superman is four, then Hellboy is three and The Punisher is two. In the same way, if American Beauty gets four stars, then The United States of Leland clocks in at about two.Ebert's review of Shaolin Soccer (April 23, 2004) 
Ebert emphasized that his star ratings had little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally (as in his review of Basic Instinct 2), Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged such cases, stating, "I cannot recommend the movie, but ... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason".Ebert's review of Basic Instinct 2 (March 21, 2006) In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve.King, Stephen, "The Four-Star Follies", August 20, 2004. Retrieved January 31, 2008. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050526/REVIEWS/50510003/1023 |title=Ebert's review of The Longest Yard (2005 version) at rogerebert.com; May 27, 2005 |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl] He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was "unsuited" to such a film: "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100505/REVIEWS/100509982|title=Ebert's review of The Human Centipede at rogerebert.com; May 5, 2010|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl]
Ebert reprinted his starred reviews in movie guides. In his appearances on The Howard Stern Show, he was frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception – when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given The Godfather Part II a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given The Godfather Part III three and a half stars. Ebert later added The Godfather Part II to his "Great Movies" list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his "worthlessness" but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review.[tpl]cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Godfather, Part II review|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 2, 2008|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/REVIEWS08/810020300/1023|accessdate=February 28, 2010 [/tpl] When reviewing the 2009 remake of The Last House on the Left, Ebert noted how he had given the controversial 1972 original three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: "I wrote that original "Last House" review 37 years ago. I am not the same person. I am uninterested in being 'consistent'".[tpl]cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090311/REVIEWS/903119984|title=Ebert's review of The Last House on the Left (2009)|date=March 11, 2009|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=January 21, 2013[/tpl]
Ebert occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, and the word "fascist" accompanied more than one of Ebert's reviews of the law-and-order films of the 1970s such as Dirty Harry. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against such films as The Night Porter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750210/REVIEWS/502100301/1023|title=Ebert's review of The Night Porter|date=February 10, 1975|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl]
Ebert's reviews could clash with the overall reception of movies, as evidenced by his one-star review of the celebrated 1986 David Lynch film Blue Velvet ("marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots ... in a way, Lynch's behavior is more sadistic than the Hopper character").[tpl]cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| title = Review of Blue Velvet| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023|accessdate= September 4, 2009| work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl] He was dismissive of the popular 1988 Bruce Willis action film Die Hard ("inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot"),[tpl]cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Review of Die Hard|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880715/REVIEWS/807150301/1023|accessdate=September 4, 2009|work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl] while his positive 3 out of 4 stars review of 1997's Speed 2: Cruise Control ("Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure") is one of only two positive reviews accounting for that film's [tpl]Rotten Tomatoes score|0120179|tomatometer[/tpl]% approval rating on the reviewer aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes (the other having been written by his At The Movies co-star Gene Siskel).[tpl]Rotten Tomatoes score|0120179|citation[/tpl]

Ebert was accused by some horror movie fans of elitism in his dismissal of what he calls "Dead Teenager Movies". Ebert clarified that he did not disparage horror movies as a whole, but that he drew a distinction between films like Nosferatu and The Silence of the Lambs, which he regarded as "masterpieces", and films which he felt consisted of nothing more than groups of teenagers being killed off with the exception of one survivor to populate a sequel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egebertsax2007.html|author=Gurnow, Michael|title=Roger Ebert's Bloody Ax: An Examination of the Film Critic's Elitist Dismissal of the Horror Film|publisher=The Horror Review|year=2007|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]

He made similar revaluations of 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1985's Ran.

Ebert was an admirer of director Werner Herzog, whom he supported through many years when Herzog's popularity had declined. He conducted an onstage public "conversation" with Herzog at the Telluride Film Festival in 2004, after a screening of Herzog's film Invincible at the Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival. Herzog dedicated his 2008 film Encounters at the End of the World to Ebert, and Ebert responded with a heartfelt public letter of gratitude.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071117/PEOPLE/71117002 |title=Roger Ebert.

In 2005, Ebert opined that video games are not art, and are inferior to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful", but "the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art".Ebert, Roger (November 27, 2005).

===Views on the film industry===

Ebert was an outspoken opponent of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, repeatedly criticizing its decisions regarding which movies are suitable for children.[tpl]cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296.html |title=Roger Ebert on Movie Ratings — WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=December 11, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2013[/tpl] An example of this was his review of The Exorcist, where he criticized the 'R' rating and suggested an 'X' rating instead. He wrote several articles making a case for the X rating to be replaced with a new 'A' rating, which would allow for serious, well-made films with adults-only content to avoid the pornographic stigma that the X brought.
He also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are "booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes", making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.Ebert, Roger (January 29, 2004). "They got it right". Chicago Sun-Times.
Ebert was a strong advocate for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060219/ANSWERMAN/602190302/1023 |title=Ebert's "Movie Answer Man column", February 19, 2006|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.[tpl]cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/08/dminus_for_3d.html|title=D-minus for 3-D|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times: Blogs|date=August 16, 2008|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]

They also used to appear on the post-awards show entitled An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Winners, produced and aired by the ABC-owned KABC-TV in Los Angeles.
Ebert was one of the principal critics featured in Gerald Peary's 2009 documentary film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism. He is shown discussing the dynamics of appearing with Gene Siskel on the 1970s show Coming to a Theatre Near You, which was the predecessor of Sneak Previews on Chicago PBS station WTTW. He also expressed his approval of the proliferation of young people writing film reviews today on the Internet.For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism. TCM Movie Database.

Though not making a personal appearance, an honorary effigy of Ebert co-starred in the 1998 reimagining version of Godzilla, played by actor Michael Lerner as New York City Mayor Ebert. The trademark image of the glasses, build and hair make the resemblance almost uncanny.
