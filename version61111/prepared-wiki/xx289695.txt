CATEGORIES: Polish Jews, Polish bankers, 1773 births, 1826 deaths

Samuel Eleazer Kronenberg (born as Lejzor Hirszowicz Kronenberg; 1773–1826) was a Polish-Jewish banker and industrialist.  His father's first name was Hirsh, his mother's name is unknown, and one sister was Anna Maria Breslauer (1781-1853).
Originally from Wyszogród, he later moved to Warsaw and founded the S. L. Kronenberg Bank.  He had thirteen children with his wife Tekla Teresa Lewy (1775-1848).  Eight of their children survived, including five sons, among them Leopold Stanisław Kronenberg (1812-1878).  At least three of his sons became bankers and important figures in Polish politics, and several of his children married into other aristocratic families.  Only his eldest son, Ludwik Kronenberg (1783–1882), remained Jewish, and the rest eventually converted to various forms of Christianity.
