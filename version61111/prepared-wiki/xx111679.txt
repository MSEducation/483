"The writing on the wall", or "the handwriting on the wall", or "the writing is on the wall" or "''Mene Mene''", is an idiom for "the future is predetermined", and is generally implied that a bad event is imminent.
The expression originates from the Book of Daniel (Old Testament), Chapter 5, from the handwriting on the wall that was witnessed at a banquet hosted by King Belshazzar. As those at the feast profaned the sacred vessels pillaged from the Jerusalem Temple, a disembodied hand appeared and wrote on the palace wall the words, "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin". The visionary Daniel was summoned and interpreted this message as the imminent end for the Babylonian kingdom. That night, Belshazzar was killed and the Persians sacked the capital city.[tpl]cite book|last=Elwell|first=Philip Comfort, Walter A.|title=The complete book of who's who in the Bible|year=2004|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|location=Wheaton, Ill.|isbn=0842383697|page=113[/tpl]

==Inscription==

During the drunken feast, Belshazzar uses the holy golden and silver vessels, from Solomon's Temple, to praise "the gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone". Soon afterwards, disembodied fingers appear and write on the wall of the royal palace the words:

The advisers attempt to interpret the meaning. However, their natural denotations of weights and measures were superficially meaningless: "two minas, a shekel and two parts". Therefore, the King sends for Daniel, an exiled Israelite taken from Jerusalem, who had served in high office under Nebuchadnezzar. Rejecting offers of reward, Daniel warns the king of the folly of his arrogant blasphemy before reading the text. The meaning that Daniel decrypts from these words is based on passive verbs corresponding to the measure names, "numbered, weighed, divided."
Although usually left untranslated in English translations of Daniel, these words are known Aramaic names of measures of currency: MENE, a mina (from the root meaning "to count"), TEKEL, a spelling of shekel (from the root meaning "to weigh"), PERES, half a mina (from the root meaning "to divide", but additionally resembling the word for "Persia").note to Daniel 5:25, The New American Bible, November 11, 2002, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops The last word (prs) he read as peres not parsin. His free choice of interpretation and decoding revealed the menacing subtext: "Thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting." The divine menace against the dissolute Belshazzar, whose kingdom was to be divided between the Medes and Persians, was swiftly realized. That very night King Belshazzar is slain, and Darius the Mede becomes King.

==Historicity==

Historical reconstruction of the fall of Babylon to Persia (539 BC) has been problematic due to the inconsistencies between the various source documents. Both the Babylonian Chronicle and the Cyrus Cylinder describe Babylon being taken "without battle" whereas the Greek historians, Herodotus, Xenophon,Histories I.191; Cyropaedia VI.5.15–16; [tpl]Harvnb|Gaston|2009|pp=88–89[/tpl]. report that the city was besieged. The Book of Daniel implies that Babylon was taken in one night and that Belshazzar was killed. 
The cuneiform texts – the Chronicle of Nabonidus, the Cyrus Cylinder and the so-called Verse Account of Nabonidus – were written after the Persian victory. They shed unfavourable light on the Babylonian king and present Cyrus II as the liberator of Babylon, the defender of the Babylonian gods and consequently as the legitimate successor to the Babylonian throne.[tpl]cite book|last=IsIAO|first=edited by A.

Herodotus, though writing long after the events, had traveled in Mesopotamia and spoken to Babylonians. 
Tolini has proposed a plausible reconstruction of how Babylon fell. A receipt for reconstruction work on the Enlil Gate demonstrates that there was a forced entry into Babylon. Tolini proposes that a portion of the Persian army under the command of the general Ugbaru, penetrated the Enlil Gate, which is on the West side of the Euphrates, then crossed the river to take the eastern districts of Babylon. This may be source of the story, recorded by Herodotus, that the Persian army entered Babylon along the riverbed, having diverted the Euphrates.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tolini|first=Gauthier|title=Quelques elements concernant la prise de Babylone par Cyrus|journal=ARTA|year=2005[/tpl] This surprise capture of Babylon is consistent with the story recorded in Daniel 5.[tpl]cite book|last=Gaston|first=Thomas|title=Historical Issues in the Book of Daniel|year=2009|publisher=Taanathshiloh|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-9561540-0-2|pages=86–105[/tpl]
The success of Ugbaru's strategy may owe something to the timing of his attack. Herodotus, Xenophon and Daniel 5 all record that Babylon was in the midst of a festival on the night it was taken. The Babylonian Chronicle records that Babylon was captured on 16th Tašrîtu, which was the night before the akitu festival in honour of Sin, the moon-god.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wolters|first=A|title=Belshazzar's Feast and the Cult of the Moon God Sin|journal=Bulletin of Biblical Research|year=1995|volume=4|pages=199–206[/tpl] 
Xenophon describes how Gobryas (probably a Greek form of Ugbaru) led a detachment of men in the capture of Babylon and that it was he who slew the king of Babylon. Xenophon is the only source, outside Daniel 5, to describe the demise of Belshazzar.[tpl]cite book|last=Gaston|first=Thomas|title=Historical Issues in the Book of Daniel|year=2009|publisher=Taanathshiloh|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-9561540-0-2|pages=81–84[/tpl]
Babylon found itself under a foreign rule for the first time. A new system of government was put in place and the Persian multi-national-state was developed. This system of government reached its peak after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses during the reign of Darius I, thereafter receiving its ideological foundation in the inscription of the Persian kings.Melammu Symposia Vol.3, Ideologies, p.143

==Jewish interpretations==

Some Rabbinic interpretations (see especially Sanhedrin 22a in the Babylonian Talmud), seek to explain why Daniel could read the writing when no one else could, and suggest that the words were written in code. One possibility offered is that it was an atbash cipher, another being that the written Aramaic and Hebrew looked very different, even though they were pronounced similarly. Another idea given is that gematriyatic equivalents for the words were written. Others offered the opinion that the words were written backwards or vertically in classic Jewish tradition.
