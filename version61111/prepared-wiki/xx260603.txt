==Politics==

With the ending of his military career, Applin entered politics. After making two unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament with minor parties, he became the Conservative MP for Enfield.

===Dartford by-election 1920===

Applin was originally a member of the National Party, a xenophobic party that broke away from the Conservatives in 1917. He stood at the parliamentary by-election at Dartford in April 1920. The party came in a poor fourth place, with Applin losing his deposit. The intervention of the National Party and an Independent candidate split the Conservative vote and allowed John Edmund Mills of the Labour Party to secure an unexpected victory.[tpl]cite news |title=By-Election Results.

===Abbey by-election 1921===

In August 1921 a parliamentary byelection was held for the constituency of Westminster Abbey. Applin stood as the candidate of Anti-Waste League, a right-wing party formed by Lord Rothermere in opposition to the spending plans of the Lloyd George Coalition government. Such was the unpopularity of the government that all three candidates, including the winner Brigadier-General John Nicholson of the Conservative Party (who formed part of the coalition), claimed to be "anti-waste". Applin finished in second place, receiving 34.9% of the votes cast.[tpl]cite book |title=By-elections in British politics |first1=Chris |last1=Cook |first2=John |last2=Ramsden |page=44 |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-85728-535-2  |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=MQGAXGB4GLkC&lpg=PA44&ots=2WD9KP0CVR&dq=r%20v%20k%20applin&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q=r%20v%20k%20applin&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=MWeSdpr2zJ8C&lpg=PA245&dq=r%20v%20k%20applin&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q=r%20v%20k%20applin&f=false |page=245 |title=Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |first=Kenneth O |last=Morgan[/tpl]
