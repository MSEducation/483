==Controversy==

Suder was key in orchestrating a $500,000 grant in the 2013-2015 Wisconsin state budget. The grant was steered towards, and eventually granted to United Sportsmen. It was later discovered that the group had no experience in the type of work the grant was intended to provide. United Sportsmen had political ties to Wisconsin republicans. The group also had stated they had non-profit status, which was not accurate. They had applied for non-profit status, but it was still under review and had not been granted. The grant, as written in the Wisconsin budget, may have violated rules for federal funding and caused Wisconsin to lose $28 million in federal funds. This was avoid when Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, used his Line-item veto power to make the grant fully funded by Wisconsin, removing federal funds. When the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the issues, Governor Walker rescinded the grant.[tpl]cite news|last=Marley|first=Patrick|title=Walker ignored Suder's handling of sportsmen grant in PSC appointment|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-did-not-consider-suders-handling-of-grant-in-psc-appointment-b99101393z1-224287041.html|accessdate=6 October 2013|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinal|date=18 September 2013[/tpl]
