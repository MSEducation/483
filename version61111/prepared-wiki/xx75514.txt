==History==

In the 3rd month of the 6th year of the Wadō era (713),  the land of Tango Province was administratively separated from Tamba Province.  In that same year, Empress Gemmei's Daijō-kan continued to organize other cadastral changes in the provincial map of the Nara period.
In Wadō 6, Mimasaka Province was sundered from Bizen Province, and Hyūga Province was divided from Ōsumi Province.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [tpl]Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 64.|page=64[/tpl]  In Wadō 5 (712), Mutsu Province had been severed from Dewa Province.
Maps of Japan and Tango Province were reformed in the 1870s when the prefecture system was introduced.Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at p. 780.  At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes.  For example, Tango is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.US Department of State. (1906). A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759.
This area is still known as Tango Peninsula, some parts of it are in Tango Quasi-National Park. 
A town in this region was likewise named Tango. It is now defunct and part of Kyōtango (Kyō + Tango) since 2004.
