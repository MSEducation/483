==History==

===Origins===

The origins of Lloyds Bank date from 1765, when button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II set up a private banking business in Dale End, Birmingham. The first branch office opened in Oldbury, some six miles (10 km) west of Birmingham, in 1864. The symbol adopted by Taylors and Lloyds was the beehive, representing industry and hard work. The black horse device dates from 1677, when Humphrey Stokes adopted it as sign for his shop. Stokes was a goldsmith and "keeper of the running cashes" (an early term for banker) and the business became part of Barnett, Hoares & Co. When the bank took over that bank in 1884, it retained the black horse as its symbol.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_heritage/Timeline/1851_1900.asp |title=Timeline 1851 - 1900 |year=2013 |publisher=Lloyds Banking Group |accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
The association with the Taylor family ended in 1852 and, in 1865, Lloyds & Co. converted into a joint-stock company known as Lloyds Banking Company Ltd. Two sons of the original partners followed in their footsteps by joining the established merchant bank Barnett, Hoares & Co. which later became Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury and Lloyd— based in Lombard Street, London. Eventually, this became absorbed into the original Lloyds Banking Company, which became Lloyds, Barnetts and Bosenquets Bank Ltd. in 1884, and, finally, Lloyds Bank Limited in 1889.

===Expansion===

Through a series of mergers, including Cunliffe, Brooks in 1900, the Wilts. and Dorset Bank in 1914 and, by far the largest, the Capital and Counties Bank in 1918, Lloyds emerged to become one of the "Big Four" clearing banks in the United Kingdom. By 1923, Lloyds Bank had made some 50 takeovers, one of which was the last private firm to issue its own banknotes—Fox, Fowler and Company of Wellington, Somerset. Today, the Bank of England has a monopoly of banknote issue in England and Wales.A brief history of banknotes Bank of England (retrieved 11 October 2008) In 2011, the company founded SGH Martineau LLP.
In 1968, a failed attempt at merger with Barclays and Martins Bank was deemed to be against the public interest by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Barclays finally acquired Martins the following year.Roskill QC, Sir Ashton (chairman) Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank and Martins Bank: a report on the proposed merger (Chapter 1, Chapter 2 and Appendices) Presented to Parliament in pursuance of section 9 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948 (as applied by section 6(5) of the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965) London: HMSO, 15 July 1968 In 1972, Lloyds Bank was a founding member of the Joint Credit Card Company (with National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank) which launched the Access credit card (now MasterCard). That same year it introduced Cashpoint, the first online cash machine to use plastic cards with a magnetic stripe. In popular use, the Cashpoint trademark has become a generic term for an ATM in the United Kingdom.
Under the leadership of Sir Brian Pitman between 1984 and 1997, the bank's business focus was narrowed and it reacted to disastrous lending to South American states by trimming its overseas businesses and seeking growth through mergers with other UK banks. During this period, Pitman tried unsuccessfully to acquire The Royal Bank of Scotland in 1984, Standard Chartered in 1986,Offer Sweetened By Lloyds Bank The New York Times, 28 June 1986 and Midland Bank in 1992. Lloyds Bank International merged into Lloyds Bank in 1986, since there was no longer an advantage in operating separately.Lloyds Bank (Merger) Act 1985 (cap. 9) In 1988, Lloyds merged five of its businesses with the Abbey Life Insurance Company to create Lloyds Abbey Life.

===Lloyds TSB===

The bank merged first with the newly demutualised Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society (C&G), then with the TSB Group in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7430780/Sir-Brian-Pitman.html |title=Obituary: Sir Brian Pitman |work=The Telegraph |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Roger Cowe |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/11/sir-brian-pitman-obituary |title=Obituary: Sir Brian Pitman |work=The Guardian |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl] The C&G acquisition gave Lloyds a large stake in the UK mortgage lending market.About C&G Cheltenham and Gloucester (retrieved 11 October 2008) The TSB merger was structured as a reverse takeover; Lloyds Bank Plc was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and TSB Group plc was renamed Lloyds TSB Group plc on 28 December, with former Lloyds Bank shareholders owning a 70% equity interest in the share capital. The new bank commenced trading in 1999, after the statutory process of integration was completed.Lloyds TSB Act 1998 (cap. 5) On 28 June, TSB Bank plc transferred engagements to Lloyds Bank Plc which then changed its name to Lloyds TSB Bank plc; at the same time, TSB Bank Scotland plc absorbed Lloyds' three Scottish branches becoming Lloyds TSB Scotland plc. The combined business formed the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest to Midland Bank (now HSBC) by market capitalisation.
Lloyds Abbey Life became a wholly owned subsidiary of the group in 1996, absorbing Hill Samuel in 1997, before closing to new business in 2000. In 2007, Abbey Life was sold to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[tpl]cite news |title=Lloyds sells Abbey Life for £977m |last=Blackden |first=Richard |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2813187/Lloyds-sells-Abbey-Life-for-977m.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]

===Bank of London and South America===

A strong connection with South America began in 1918 with the acquisition of the London and River Plate Bank. The later merger with the London and Brazilian Bank resulted in the Bank of London and South America. The Bank of London and Montreal was a joint venture between the Bank of London and South America and the Bank of Montreal. In 1971, Lloyds Bank bought the controlling interest in BOLSA and merged it with Lloyds Bank Europe to form Lloyds and Bolsa International Bank. This became Lloyds Bank International in 1974 and was merged into Lloyds Bank in 1986.

===National Bank of New Zealand===

In 1872, the National Bank of New Zealand was founded in London as an overseas bank and shared many directors with Lloyds Bank. In 1919, Lloyds Bank acquired a small interest in the National Bank and in 1966, purchased it outright. In 1978, the National Bank moved its head office from London to Wellington.National Bank of New Zealand About ANZ National (retrieved 11 October 2008)
An already commanding presence as the National Bank of New Zealand was further strengthened in 1994 by the takeover of the Rural Bank, the former New Zealand government owned bank, from Fletcher Challenge, making it the leading provider of agricultural finance in the country.
In 2003, Lloyds TSB sold the National Bank to the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In 2013, ANZ announced that the National Bank brand (including the black horse and colour green) would be phased out.

Lloyds Bank of Canada was formed in 1986, when the bank purchased the Continental Bank of Canada. In 1990, after several years of losses, Lloyds Bank sold its Canadian operations to the Hong Kong Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc.

==Controversies==

===Payment protection insurance===

In November 2005 an investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) highlighted a lack of compliance controls surrounding payment protection insurance (PPI). A second investigation in October 2006 identified further evidence of poor compliance and major PPI providers including Lloyds were fined for not treating customers fairly. In January 2011 a High Court case began which in the following April ruled against the banks, on 5 May 2011 Lloyds withdrew from the legal challenge. In 2012, Lloyds announced that they had set aside £3.6 billion to cover the cost of compensating customers who were mis-sold PPI.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpaclaims.co.uk/lloyds-tsb-counting-the-cost-of-the-ppi-scandal/ |title=Lloyds TSB counting the cost of the PPI scandal |publisher=DPA Claims |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]
In March 2014 it was reported that Lloyds had been reducing the compensation they offered by using a regulatory provision called "alternative redress" to assume that customers wrongly sold single-premium PPI policies would have bought a cheaper, regular premium PPI policy instead.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26715982 | title=Lloyds accused of short-changing PPI claimants | publisher=BBC News | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Robinson, Michael[/tpl]

===Links to arms trade===

In December 2008 the British anti-poverty charity War on Want released a report documenting the extent to which the UK high street banks invest in, provide banking services for and lend to arms companies. The report stated that Lloyds TSB is the only high street bank whose corporate social responsibility policy does not mention the arms industry, yet is that industry's second largest shareholder among high street banks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/attachments/Banking%20on%20Bloodshed.pdf |title=Banking on Bloodshed: UK high street banks' complicity in the arms trade |author = Anna Morser | format = PDF |publisher = War on Want |date = October 2008 |accessdate = 2 November 2012[/tpl]

===Tax evasion===

In 2009, the BBC's Panorama alleged that Lloyds TSB Offshore in Jersey, Channel Islands was encouraging wealthy customers to evade tax.  An employee of Lloyds was filmed telling a customer how several mechanisms could be used to make their transactions invisible to the UK tax authorities.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8261000/8261135.stm|title=Tax inquiry into Lloyds off-shore |publisher=BBC |date=21 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|first=John|last=Sweeney[/tpl]  This action is also in breach of money laundering regulations in Jersey.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8267000/8267455.stm|title=Q&A: Panorama on Lloyds offshore|publisher=BBC News|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009[/tpl] Lloyds subsequently claimed that this was an isolated incident which they were investigating.[tpl]cite news|title=Lloyds under fire after BBC tax revelation|last=Farndon |first=Lucy|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-1680648/Lloyds-under-fire-after-BBC-tax-revelation.html |newspaper=Daily Mail|date=22 September 2009|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]

===Retail conduct failings===

In December 2013, Lloyds Banking Group had been fined £28m for "serious failings" in relation to bonus schemes for sales staff. The Financial Conduct Authority said it was the largest fine that it or the former Financial Services Authority had imposed for retail conduct failings. The bonus scheme pressured staff to hit sales targets or risk being demoted and have their pay cut, the FCA said. Lloyds Bank has accepted the regulator's findings and apologised to its customers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25330366|title=Lloyds bank fined record £28m for 'serious failings'|publisher=BBC News|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013[/tpl]
In February 2014, the Twitter profile @LloydsBankHell began tracking disquiet with consumers towards the bank. 

===Divestment of government-owned shares===

Based on figures from the National Audit Office, George Osborne's sale of a 6% tranche of Lloyds shares in autumn 2013—despite his claims that the sale had netted a profit—worked out at a loss of at least £230m for UK taxpayers.[tpl]Cite news |date= 19 December 2013 |title=  '£230m taxpayer blow over Lloyds'  |url= http://money.uk.msn.com/news/%C2%A3230m-taxpayer-blow-over-lloyds-2 |agency= Press Association |accessdate= 23 December 2013 [/tpl]
