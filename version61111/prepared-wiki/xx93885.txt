==Career==

===Acting===

Douglas portrayed a younger version of his father's character in flashback scenes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3K5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cY0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5022,361983&dq=eric+douglas+kirk+douglas&hl=en|title=Actor's next role is close to his heart|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=1982-12-01|work=Boca Raton News|page=6C|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl] He appeared in several films in the 1980s including The Flamingo Kid (1985), Tomboy (1985), The Golden Child (1986), and Honor Bound (1988). In the late 1980s, Douglas performed off-Broadway at the Village Gate Theater with the critically acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe Noo Yawk Tawk .Where Audiences Participate In Improvisional Comedy, by Stephen Holden He also appeared in a production of Dale Wasserman's Shakespeare and The Indians at the Music Theatre Conference for the Eugene O' Neill Theatre Center in 1981.

In 1991, Douglas appeared with his father (in the senior Douglas' Emmy-nominated performance) in "Yellow", the Season 3 finale of the television series Tales from the Crypt.  The father and son acting duo portrayed father and son characters with Eric a young officer in World War I brought up on charges of cowardice by his commanding general who is also his cold-hearted father.

===Stand-up comedy===

In the early 1990s, Douglas attempted a career as a stand-up comedian. He performed in New York City comedy clubs with much of his self-deprecating material coming from his status as the black sheep of the Douglas dynasty.
Douglas entered British comedy folklore when, during a stand-up performance at The Comedy Store, London, he became angry by the audience's reaction to his stand-up routine. This led to him shouting out, "You can't do this to me, I'm Kirk Douglas's son!" A member of the audience stood up and shouted "No, I'm Kirk Douglas' son," referring to the iconic "I'm Spartacus" scene of the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas. This ended up with the majority of the audience standing up and repeating the line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8089000/8089652.stm|title=The Comedy Store at 30|date=2009-06-09|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl]

===Drug issues===

In 2000, Douglas revealed in an interview that he went into an eight-day coma in 1999 after accidentally overdosing on Xanax. Douglas recalled, "I was in L.A. sitting around my breakfast table with my dad and I choked on a piece of sausage. But because the pills had taken effect, I was not able to dislodge the sausage from my throat." After the Douglas' maid attempted the Heimlich maneuver, Douglas was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he fell into a coma. Due to a lack of oxygen, his speech became slurred and gait was altered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-03-12/gossip/18133804_1_speech-youngest-son-duff-life|title=Coma Woe Unites Eric & Kirk|last=Rush|first=George|coauthors=Molloy, Joanna; Baker, K.C.|date=2000-03-12|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl]
In May 2001, Douglas sued his former psychiatrist, Dr. William Leader, claiming that Leader prescribed him a combination of prescription drugs that are lethal when combined with alcohol. Douglas asserted that Leader, who had been treating Douglas for his drug addictions for ten years, failed to consider his alcohol problem when he prescribed Vicodin, Klonopin, and Xanax. Douglas claimed the drugs caused him to feel suicidal and also caused an episode of cardiac arrest which led him to require constant care and hospitalization. Douglas sought $50,000 in damages from Leader.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6KU2AAAAIBAJ&sjid=hSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=566,50225563&dq=eric+douglas+kirk+douglas&hl=en|title=Kirk Douglas son sues psychiatrist|date=2001-05-30|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|page=A31|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl]
