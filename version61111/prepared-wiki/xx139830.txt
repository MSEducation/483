Psychic Detectives or Psychic Investigators is a television program produced by StoryHouse Productions for Court TV, as of 2006 in its 5th season. The program documents real-life cases of situations in which police departments have enlisted the aid of psychics in solving difficult cases. The series production does not investigate the claims of the psychics showcased or confirm their claims.  For entertainment it instead recreates some of the atmosphere surrounding psychic claims using a selection of well recognized intuitives, crime psychics, psychic detectives and supporters of paranormal beliefs.  A cross section of paranormal psychics are profiled though most are women who typically are engaged as self-described psychic mediums communicating with the dead.

==Criticism==

The series has often been controversial in its portrayal of events with little scientific skepticism about whether events actually happened as re-created. Critics[tpl]Who|date=August 2011[/tpl] have also charged that several psychics have exaggerated or fantasized events or claims that did not actually occur.  Viewers are encouraged to expand their search about specific psychics profiled for a broader range of information.  There is no evidence that any psychic detective has ever provided significant assistance in a criminal State Police case using paranormal abilities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Generally fewer psychics are now involved with law enforcement agencies than in the past as historical data[tpl]Which|date=August 2011[/tpl] has confirmed that psychic involvement has not improved the resolution of criminal and missing person cases.
August 2007 Psychic Detectives was awarded The Truly Terrible Television (TTTV) Award for peddling pseudoscience and superstition to its audience by the Independent Investigative Group IIG.  Other winners have been Montel Williams for every episode that has showcased Sylvia Browne, Paranormal State and SciFi's Ghost Hunters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2006/index.html |title=IIG | The IIG Awards |publisher=Iigwest.com |date=2010-08-21 |accessdate=2011-07-01[/tpl]
