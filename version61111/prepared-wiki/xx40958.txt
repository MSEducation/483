Tracey Emin, CBE, RA (born 3 July 1963)[tpl]cite web|last=Tate|title=The Perfect Place to Grow  2001|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=81057|accessdate=5 September 2011[/tpl] is an English artist. She is part of the group known as Britartists or YBAs (Young British Artists).
In 1997, her work Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, a tent appliquéd with names, was shown at Charles Saatchi's Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London. The same year, she gained considerable media exposure when she appeared drunk and swearing on a live Channel 4 TV discussion.
In 1999, Emin had her first solo exhibition in the United States at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, entitled "Every Part of Me's Bleeding". Later that year, she was a Turner Prize nominee and exhibited My Bed — an installation, consisting of her own unmade dirty bed with used condoms and blood-stained underwear.
In 2004, her tent artwork was destroyed in the Momart warehouse fire. In March 2007 Emin was chosen to join the Royal Academy of Arts in London as a Royal Academician. She represented Britain at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Her first major retrospective 20 Years was held in Edinburgh 2008, and toured Europe until 2009.
In May 2011, Emin's largest major solo exhibition in a public space was held at Hayward Gallery, London titled Love Is What You Want.
In April 2011, she opened the Turner Contemporary art gallery in Margate with Jools Holland and between May and September 2012 she is holding her first exhibition there, entitled "She Lay Down Deep Beneath The Sea".
