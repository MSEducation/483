==History==

===Grammar schools===

The Retford High School for Girls was a girls' grammar school, also known as Retford County High School for Girls in the 1950s. The analogous boys' school was the King Edward VI Grammar School, Retford (now part of Retford Oaks Academy). In 1940, 180 girls from Great Yarmouth High School for Girls were evacuated to Retford, and joined the school. They stayed until September 1944. The school on Pelham Road had around 400 girls in the 1950s and 1960s. The former site is to become a Nottingham County Council property.Nottingham County Council planning application It was off Queen Street, the road leading from the A620 Babworth Road to Retford railway station, in the area known as West Field close to the East Coast Main Line.

===Comprehensive===

The Elizabethan High School was first created in September 1979, following a reorganisation of the secondary schools in Retford. At this time the former Hallcroft Girls' secondary modern school on Hallcroft Road became the new school's Lower Site and the Retford Girls' High School became the school's Upper Site, next to the Chesterfield Canal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elizabethan.notts.sch.uk/about/history|title=History of the Elizabethan High School| accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=The Elizabethan High School[/tpl]Building change of use application
Whilst split across two sites, years 7 and 8 were taught at the Lower Site and years 9 through 13 at the Upper Site. To facilitate this arrangement, staff travelled between the sites during the school day, although the students remained on a single site.

===New building===

As part of the Bassetlaw PFI project, the school buildings in Retford were replaced. This project culminated in 2006 with the school being relocated to a purpose built building, not far from the former Lower Site, on the school's playing fields. This new building replaced the split site arrangement with a single site and moved the Post 16 provisions to new Sixth Form centre jointly run with other schools.

===Academy===

The school became an academy in April 2012, and was renamed The Elizabethan Academy. The school is no longer directly funded or operated by Nottinghamshire County Council, but still coordinates with the council in regards to admissions.

==Facilities==

Modern facilities were provided for the school as part of the PFI scheme which saw the rebuilding of secondary schools across Bassetlaw. PE facilities are largely provided as part of the new site, in contrast to former provisions at the previous sites. Modern ICT facilities including building-wide wireless coverage, mobile laptop trolleys, six permanent ICT teaching rooms and interactive white boards.

==Academic performance==

GCSE results have improved steadily over recent years and, as of 2010, 80% of GCSE students achieve 5A* to C grades, with 53% achieving 5A*-C grades including English and Mathematics, exceeding the national average of 48.9%. The school's Post 16 centre, run jointly with Retford Oaks Academy achieves results above the average for England.
In terms of academic performance, the Elizabethan is the highest performing of the two schools in Retford, with above average GCSEs.
