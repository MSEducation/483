==Origin==

In David Bowman's book This Must Be the Place: The Adventures of Talking Heads in the Twentieth Century, Byrne is quoted as describing the genesis of the song: "I wrote this in my loft on Seventh and Avenue A." And later, "I was thinking about Baader-Meinhof. Patty Hearst. Tompkins Square. This a song about living in Alphabet City."[tpl]cite book|last=Bowman|first=David |title=This Must Be the Place: The Adventures of Talking Heads in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=10 East 53rd Street, 10022|date=November 26, 2001|edition=1st |isbn=0-380-97846-6 |accessdate=May 10, 2010[/tpl]

==Lyrics==

The line "This ain't no Mudd Club or CBGB" refers to two New York music venues at which the band performed in the 1970s. [tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
"The line 'This ain't no disco' sure stuck!" remarks Byrne in the liner notes of Once in a Lifetime: The Best of Talking Heads. "Remember when they would build bonfires of Donna Summer records? Well, we liked some disco music! It's called 'dance music' now. Some of it was radical, camp, silly, transcendent and disposable. So it was funny that we were sometimes seen as the flag-bearers of the anti-disco movement."

During their 1997 Popmart Tour, the band U2 would often inject portions of the song into performances of "Discotheque."
