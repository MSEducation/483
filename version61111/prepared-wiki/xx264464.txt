==Morning Musume member color==

First, Erina Ikuta was assigned the color purple. In July 2012, it was changed to yellow-green, the color of Risa Niigaki, who had graduated from Morning Musume on May 18. Erina very much wanted Risa's color, so her official color was changed to yellow-green.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/deview/2014954/|title=モーニング娘。13枚目ニューアルバム9月発売、そしてメンバー・飯窪春菜から重大(!?)発表|author=De View|publisher=Oricon|date=2012-07-28|accessdate=2012-07-29|language=Japanese[/tpl]
