The widemouth blindcat (Satan eurystomus) is a species of North American freshwater catfish endemic to Texas in the United States.  It is the only representative of the genus Satan.
The widemouth blindcat's closest relative is the flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris.[tpl]cite journal|title=Morphological Adaptations of the Texas Blind Catfishes Trogloglanis pattersoni and Satan eurystomus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) to Their Underground Environment|first=Thomas G.|last=Langecker|coauthors=Longley, Glenn|journal=Copeia|year=1993|pages=976–986|doi=10.2307/1447075|volume=1993|jstor=1447075|issue=4|publisher=Copeia, Vol. 1993, No. 4[/tpl]
It was first discovered inhabiting a well, and is adapted for a lightless underground environment. This species is distributed in five artesian wells penetrating the San Antonio Pool of the Edwards Aquifer in and near San Antonio, Texas. These fish have been found with crustacean exoskeletons in their stomachs, and may be the top carnivore in their habitat.
The widemouth blindcat lacks pigmentation and has no externally visible eyes. The eye remnants are extremely reduced in size with very little or no trace of a retina or lens; the optic tract is present, but always regresses before reaching the brain. The swim bladder in these fish is reduced, and the skull is mostly cartilaginous and not well-ossified, unlike the adults of most larger ictalurids. The lateral line is fragmentary and never reaches past the anterior part of the anal fin. This species also has a few paedomorphic traits (indicated by small size, kidney morphology, and weak ossification of the skeleton). This species grows to about 13.7 cm (5.4 in) TL.[tpl]FishBase species|genus=Satan|species=eurystomus|year=2011|month=December[/tpl]
The widemouth blindcat is a vulnerable species; it is threatened by groundwater pollution.
