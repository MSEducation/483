[[Seed (sculpture)]]

CATEGORIES: Digital rights management

A Seed is a sculpture or object that contains digital data that is sold for the purpose of keeping the information out of the hands of pirates for as long as possible, in addition to associating the transitory digital information (music, literature, movies, software) with the perceived permanence of the medium of sculpture. Additionally, the data sold in sculpture form is kept free from amendment, deletion, or corruption.  This allows for the curation of virtual data in the same way that books, albums, or DVDs are collected.  Additionally, a seed is one solution to the problem of how you "gift" a virtual product.
The name is derived from the BitTorrent term for a peer who has a complete copy of a torrent and still offers it for upload.  The name and philosophy behind the concept comes from an article by Miracle Jones called "Wunderkammer Seeds: A Fantasia"http://www.fictioncircus.com/news.php?id=407&mode=one published in The Fiction Circus.
