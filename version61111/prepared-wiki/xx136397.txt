[[Civil Service cricket team]]

CATEGORIES: Former first-class cricket clubs

A Civil Service cricket team made just one appearance in first-class cricket, when they played the touring New Zealanders, who were on their first tour of England, at the Civil Service Sports Ground in Chiswick in 1927. The New Zealanders proved too strong for their hosts, winning by an innings and 15 runs, although the result might have been different had Jackie Mills (104*) and Cyril Allcott (102*) not shared an unbroken stand of 190 for the eighth wicket to allow the New Zealanders to declare at 421/7.CricketArchive scorecard
For the Civil Service, the best performer with the bat was Edwin Bennett, who hit 73 and 60, while the best bowling came from Allinson Chapman, playing his one and only first-class match, who claimed 3-73 from his 21 overs.
The team also played the touring Australians in 1926 and the West Indians in 1928, both matches being of two days' duration and not first-class.CricketArchive
