Russia, defeated in the First World War, lost territory as the Baltics and Poland made good their independence. The region was the main battlefield in the Second World War (1939–45), with German and Soviet armies sweeping back and forth, with millions of Jews killed by the Nazis, and millions of others killed by disease, starvation, and military action, or executed after being deemed as politically dangerous.Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin (2011)  excerpt and text search  During the final stages of WWII the future of Eastern Europe was decided by the overwhelming power of the Soviet Red Army, as it swept the Germans aside. It did not reach Yugoslavia, Albania, and Greece, however. Finland was free but forced to be neutral in the upcoming Cold War. The region fell to Soviet control and Communist governments were imposed. Yugoslavia and Albania had their own Communist regimes; after a civil war the Communists lost in Greece. The Eastern Bloc with the onset of the Cold War in 1947 was mostly behind the Western European countries in economic rebuilding and progress.
Winston Churchill, in his famous "Sinews of Peace" address of March 5, 1946 at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, stressed the geopolitical impact of the "iron curtain":

====Eastern Bloc during the Cold War to 1989====

The Soviet secret police, the NKVD, working in collaboration with local communists, created secret police forces using leadership trained in Moscow.  As soon as the Red Army had expelled the Germans,  this new secret police arrived to arrest political enemies according to prepared lists. The national Communists then took power in a normally gradualist manner, backed by the Soviets in many, but not all, cases. They took control of the Interior Ministries, which controlled the local police.  They confiscated and redistributed farmland.  Next the Soviets and their agents took control of the mass media, especially radio, as well as the education system.  Third the communists seized control of or replaced the organizations of civil society, such as church groups, sports, youth groups, trade unions, farmers organizations, and civic organizations.  Finally they engaged in large scale ethnic cleansing, moving ethnic minorities far away, often with high loss of life.  After a year or two, the communists took control of private businesses and monitored the media and churches.  For a while, cooperative non-Communist parties were tolerated.  The communists had a natural reservoir of popularity in that they had destroyed Hitler and the Nazi invaders.  Their goal was to guarantee long-term working-class solidarity.[tpl]cite book|author=Anne Applebaum|title=Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DoSGzXQln_oC&pg=PP31|year=2012|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=31–33|isbn=9780385536431[/tpl]Also Anne Applebaum, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944–1956 introduction,  pp xxix–xxxi online at Amazon.com
Eastern Europe after 1945 usually meant all the European countries liberated and then occupied by the Soviet army. It included the German Democratic Republic (also known as East Germany), formed by the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. All the countries in Eastern Europe adopted communist modes of control. These countries were officially independent from the Soviet Union, but the practical extent of this independence – except in Yugoslavia, Albania, and to some extent Romania – was quite limited.
Under pressure from Stalin these nations rejected grants from the American Marshall plan. Instead they participated in the Molotov Plan which later evolved into the Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). When NATO was created in 1949, most countries of Eastern Europe became members of the opposing Warsaw Pact, forming a geopolitical concept that became known as the Eastern Bloc.

===Since 1989===

With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the political landscape of the Eastern Bloc, and indeed the world, changed. In the German reunification, the Federal Republic of Germany peacefully absorbed the German Democratic Republic in 1990. In 1991, COMECON, the Warsaw Pact, and the Soviet Union were dissolved.
Many European nations which had been part of the Soviet Union regained their independence (Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, as well as the Baltic States of  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia).
Czechoslovakia peacefully separated into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. Many countries of this region joined the European Union, namely Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
