[[Turbo cooking]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking techniques

Turbo cooking is a hybrid way of quickly preparing food that may taste better than simply warming something in a microwave. For instance microwave something then place it under the broiler to be browned as a finish. Another way to turbo cook is to use near-boiling water from an instant-hot tap when starting soup or pasta.

==Recipes==

Turbo cookies are half baked cookie dough that is warmed in a microwave for about 30 seconds or so, just enough to melt the chocolate. This is much faster than waiting for the oven.
