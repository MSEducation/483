==History==

Masonite was founded by engineer and inventor William H. Mason after he discovered a more effective way to use wood in building materials. The result was the material known as Masonite.
Masonite was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). While under KKR's stewardship, the company went into bankruptcy. Masonite completed a financial restructuring and emerged from both Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States and CCAA protection in Canada, 85 days after the initial filings on March 16, 2009.http://www.masonite.com/press/Emergence_Release0609.php Nearly four years after its emergence from bankruptcy, in 2013 Masonite filed a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to once again become a public company.http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/893691/000119312513222751/d489642ds1a.htm
