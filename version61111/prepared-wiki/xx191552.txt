[[Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star]]

CATEGORIES: Marian hymns

"Hail, Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star" is a Marian hymn written by Father John Lingard (1771â€“1851), a Catholic priest and historian who, through the works of William Cobbett, helped to smooth the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act in England. Loosely based on the medieval Latin plainchant Ave Maris Stella, the hymn is generally sung to a specially modified traditional English melody.

 Hail, Queen of heaven, the ocean star,  
Guide of the wanderer here below,  
Thrown on life's surge, we claim thy care,  
Save us from peril and from woe.  
 
Mother of Christ, Star of the sea  
Pray for the wanderer, pray for me.   
 
O gentle, chaste, and spotless Maid,  
We sinners make our prayers through thee;  
Remind thy Son that He has paid  
The price of our iniquity.  
 
Virgin most pure, Star of the sea,  
Pray for the sinner, pray for me.    
 
Sojourners in this vale of tears,  
Blest advocate, to thee we cry,  
Assuage our sorrows, calm our fears,  
And soothe with hope our misery.  
 
Refuge in grief, Star of the sea 
Pray for the mourner, pray for me. 
 
And while to Him Who reigns above   
In Godhead one, in Persons three,   
The Source of life, of grace, of love, 
Homage we pay on bended knee:  
 
Do thou, bright Queen, Star of the sea,  
Pray for thy children, pray for me.
