[[Sleeper hit]]

CATEGORIES: Pop-culture neologisms

A sleeper hit is a term used in the entertainment industry for a film that plays successfully for a long period and becomes a big success, despite having relatively little promotion or lacking a successful opening.[tpl]sfn|Berra|2008|p=68[/tpl] It is also used in a similar sense for music releases.

==In film==

Some sleeper hits in the film industry are strategically marketed for audiences subtly, such as with sneak previews a couple of weeks prior to release, without making them feel obliged to see a heavily promoted film. This alternative form of marketing strategy has been used in sleeper hits such as Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Forrest Gump (1994), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), The Sixth Sense (1999),  and There's Something About Mary (1998).[tpl]sfn|Berra|2008|p=68[/tpl]
Screenings for these films are held in an area conducive to the film's demographic. In the case of Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy, screenings were held at suburban shopping malls where romantic couples in their mid 20s to early 30s spent Saturday afternoons before seeing a new film. In theory, a successful screening leads to word-of-mouth marketing, as it compels viewers to discuss an interesting, low-key film with co-workers when they return to work after their weekend.[tpl]sfn|Berra|2008|p=68[/tpl]
Easy Rider, which was created on a budget of less than $400,000, became a sleeper hit by earning $50 million and garnering attention from younger audiences with its combination of drugs, violence, motorcycles, counter-culture stance, and rock music.[tpl]sfn|Ganeri|Bergan|2006|p=458[/tpl]
