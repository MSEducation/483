Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=2004|title=Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-83525-9[/tpl] Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Physical non-verbal communication such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention differ from gestures, which communicate specific messages. Gestures are     culture-specific and can convey very different meanings in different social or cultural settings.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|last2=Collett|first2=Peter|last3=Marsh|first3=Peter|last4=O'Shaughnessy|first4=Marie|year=1979|title=Gestures, Their Origins and Distribution|location=London|publisher=Cape|isbn=0-224-01570-2[/tpl] Gesture is distinct from sign language. Although some gestures, such as the ubiquitous act of pointing, differ little from one place to another, most gestures do not have invariable or universal meanings but connote specific meanings in particular cultures. A single emblematic gesture can have very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=1994|chapter=Human gestures|editor=K.R.
