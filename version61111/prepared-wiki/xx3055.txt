[[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Diophantine equations, Disproved conjectures

Euler's conjecture is a disproved conjecture in mathematics related to Fermat's last theorem which was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769. It states that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n kth powers of positive integers is itself a kth power, then n is greater than or equal to k.
In symbols, if
Although the conjecture holds for the case of k = 3 (which follows from Fermat's last theorem for the third powers), it was disproved for k = 4 and k = 5. It still remains unknown if the conjecture fails or holds for any value k ≥ 6.

===k = 5===

The conjecture was disproven by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin in 1966 when, through a direct computer search on a CDC 6600, they found the following counterexample for k = 5:[tpl]cite journal |author=L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin |title=Counterexample to Euler's conjecture on sums of like powers |journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=72 |year=1966 |pages=1079 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3[/tpl]
Yet another counterexample 852825 + 289695 + 31835 + 555 = 853595 was found by Jim Frye in 2004.

===k = 4===

In 1986, Noam Elkies found a method to construct an infinite series of counterexamples for the k = 4 case.[tpl]cite journal |author=Noam Elkies |title=On A4 + B4 + C4 = D4 |journal=Mathematics of Computation |year=1988 |volume=51 |issue=184 |pages=825–835 |doi=10.2307/2008781 |mr=0930224 |jstor=2008781[/tpl] His smallest counterexample was the following:
A particular case of Elkies' solutions can be reduced to the identity:[tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math/browse_thread/thread/15beef75eaddcb1b?hl=en#|title=Elkies' a^4+b^4+c^4 = d^4[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/tpiezas/014|title=Sums of Three Fourth Powers[/tpl]
where
This is an elliptic curve with a rational point with v1 = −31/467. From this initial rational point, one can further compute an infinite number of vi. Substituting v1 into the identity and removing common factors gives the numerical example cited above.
In 1988, Roger Frye subsequently found the smallest possible counterexample for k = 4 by a direct computer search using techniques[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] suggested by Elkies:
Moreover, this solution is the only one with values of the variables below 1,000,000.

==Generalizations==

This would imply as a special case that if 
(under the conditions given above) then n ≥ k−1.
