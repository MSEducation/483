[[Yanba Dam]]

CATEGORIES: Dams in Gunma Prefecture

[tpl]nihongo|Yanba Dam|八ッ場ダム|Yanba damu[/tpl] is a dam project that is under construction in Naganohara, Agatsuma District, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. The project is currently frozen pending further action by the government. Planning for the dam began in 1947, and it was planned to be completed by 2015. The dam's construction has seen sustained local opposition and a ballooning budget.
In September 2009, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) announced the cancellation of the dam construction, keeping to their campaign promise for the 2009 general election. However, discussions with local residents and leaders are still ongoing, and relocation of residents who would be affected by the dam continues.Maehara visits Yamba Dam site
