[[Akademi Fantasia (season 2)]]

CATEGORIES: Akademi Fantasia seasons

Akademi Fantasia, Season 2 is the second season of Akademi Fantasia to be aired in Astro Ria. It premiered on June 7, 2004. Unlike previous season which was solely opened for people from Peninsular Malaysia, this season was eligible for contestants from East Malaysia. The final 12 contestants were revealed in Tirai Akademi Fantasia which was aired at the end of May and early June.
A new format this season was introduced which enabled a student who was eliminated to be re-entered into the competition through a voting line called AFMASUK. Using this voting line, audience would vote any students who were eliminated throughout the season and the one student who received the highest votes would be re-entered into the competition. This new format is subsequently used in seasons 4, 7 and 8.
The winner was 23 year old Ahmad Zahid Baharuddin from Kuala Lumpur. This entire season holds the highest reception of votes in the history of Akademi Fantasia with 15 million votes being cast.[tpl]cite web|last=Haswari |first=Ali |date=May 25, 2008 |url=http://www.murai.com.my/article/default.asp?article_id=1267&c=11&s=42 |title=Apakah AF7 Masih Relevan? |publisher=Murai.com |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Wahida |first=Asrani |date=May 26, 2008 |url=http://mstar.com.my/hiburan/cerita.asp?file=/2008/5/26/HIBURAN/m_Aduh/AF7_tetap_menyusul&sec=mstar_hiburan |title=AF7 tetap menyusul |publisher=mStar Online |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]
