Plugged In is a 1994 album by Welsh rock musician Dave Edmunds. The album, as of 2008, is the last completely new studio album released by Edmunds.
On Plugged In, Edmunds returned to the "one man band" approach of his early solo records; all of the instruments and vocals on the album are performed by him via overdubbing. 
The album includes a remake of Khachaturian's "Sabre Dance", which was a #5 UK hit in 1968 for Edmunds' band, Love Sculpture.
