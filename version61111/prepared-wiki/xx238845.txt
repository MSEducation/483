The Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center is a pipe organ built by Schoenstein & Co., San Francisco, California located in the Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The organ was completed in 2003. It is composed of 160 speaking stops spread over five manuals and pedals. Along with the nearby Salt Lake Tabernacle organ, it is typically used to accompany the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
The Conference Center organ is heard at the Church’s semi-annual General Conference, and at other performances throughout the year.
The organ is about two-thirds the size of the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ in terms of the number of pipes. Former Tabernacle organist John Longhurst described it as a “project of immense proportion.”
Longhurst described his reaction to the announcement in 1996 of the building of the Conference Center and his involvement in the building of the Conference Center organ as follows:
