CATEGORIES: Korean soups and stews

Miyeok guk is a Korean soup made from the sea vegetable known as wakame or "sea mustard" in English. It comprises two words: miyeok, the Korean word for wakame; and guk, meaning "soup"."
Miyeok guk is typically consumed by women after giving birth as wakame contains a high content of calcium and iodine, nutrients that are important for nursing mothers.[tpl]ko[/tpl] Miyeokguk at Doosan Encyclopedia Many women consume it during the pregnancy phase as well. It is also traditionally eaten on birthdays for this reason, a reminder of the first food that the mother has eaten and passed on to her newborn through her milk, thus bringing good fortune for the rest of the year.
Because it is known as a highly nutritious soup, it is widely consumed in homes and restaurants in Korea.
There are various methods of making miyeok guk, but it is usually made by soaking dried wakame in water until it softens and adding the seaweed in soup stock. The stock may be made from beef and/or seafood such as mussels, clams and dried fish. The soup is seasoned with soy sauce or salt, additional flavoring added with minced garlic and sesame oil.
