The Dendermonde–Puurs Steam Railway (Stoomspoorlijn Dendermonde-Puurs) is a heritage railway situated in the Belgian provinces of East Flanders (Oost-Vlaanderen) and Antwerp (Antwerpen). 
It runs from the town of Dendermonde to the town of Puurs over about 14 km of [tpl]RailGauge|sg[/tpl] (standard gauge) track. The railway is maintained by BVS, a non-profit historical railway society. BVS, which stands for Belgische Vrienden van de Stoomlocomotief, or Belgian Friends of the Steam Locomotive, has a depot at the railway station in Baasrode-Noord. The trains are pulled by both steam and diesel locomotives.
The railway has been used occasionally by various film and television production companies to shoot movie scenes that are too elaborate to be filmed on the Belgian national railway network because of the potential disruption to traffic. The best known example of a movie that includes several scenes shot on the railway is Toto le Héros.
