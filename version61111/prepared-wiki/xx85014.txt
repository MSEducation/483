==Factual discrepancies==

The film, while following the basic facts of Caruso's life, is largely fictional. The Caruso family successfully sued MGM for damages because of this. Here are a few of the factual discrepancies:

==Reception==

===Box Office===

The Great Caruso was a massive commercial success. According to MGM records it made $4,309,000 in the US and Canada and $4,960,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $3,977,000. It was the studio's biggest success of the year and the most popular movie at the British box office in 1951.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63397098 |title=Vivien Leigh Actress Of The Year. |newspaper=Townsville Daily Bulletin (Qld. : 1885–1954) |location=Qld. |date=29 December 1951 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]

===Critics===

Newsweek wrote that, "Lanza brings to the role not only a fine, natural and remarkably powerful voice, but a physique and personal mannerisms reminiscent of the immortal Caruso."[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]  According to Bosley Crowther, the film is "perhaps the most elaborate 'pops' concert ever played upon the screen"; Blyth's voice is "reedy"  but "Lanza has an excellent young tenor voice and...uses it in his many numbers with impressive dramatic power. Likewise, Miss Kirsten and Miss Thebom are ladies who can rock the welkin, too, and their contributions to the concert maintain it at a musical high."  Crowther says "All of the silliest, sappiest clichés of musical biography have been written by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig into the script. And Richard Thorpe has directed in a comparably mawkish, bathetic style."[tpl]cite web| url= http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E1DC153DEF3BBC4952DFB366838A649EDE | title= Great Caruso Makes Its Debut | date= May 11, 1951 | first= Bosley | last= Crowther | publisher= The New York Times | accessdate= 2012-01-04[/tpl]
Nearly 40 years after its release, Caruso's son, Enrico Jr. reminisced that, "Vocally and musically The Great Caruso ...has helped many young people discover opera and even become singers themselves."[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]He added that, "I can think of no other tenor, before or since Mario Lanza, who could have risen with comparable success to the challenge of playing Caruso in a screen biography."[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]  The film has also been cited by tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras as having been an inspiration for them when they were growing up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
