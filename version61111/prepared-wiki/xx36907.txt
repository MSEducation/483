CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Penology

In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes.[tpl]cite book |author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|year=2008|publisher=Sage|ISBN=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=1[/tpl] These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation.Bryan A.

A correctional system, also known as a penal system, thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;[ref]Correctional system is defined as "a network of governmental agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and parole system" in Bryan A. Garner, editor, Black's Law Dictionary, 9th ed., West Group, 2009, ISBN 0-314-19949-7, p. 396, which does not define "penal system". 
The post-1940 US penal system is described as "[tpl]sic|hide=y|comprised| of[/tpl] prisons, reformatories, parole, probation, juvenile courts ?, local jails, and a declining number of workhouses", and with added detail that "However the main focus of the system was on expanding and differentiating prisons, parole and probation" in [tpl]cite book |author1=Thomas G.

Stohr et al., p. 1 distinguish prisons from community-based correctional programs like parole and probation.[/ref] this system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts.[tpl]cite book |author1=Michael Cavadino|author2=James Dignan|title=The Penal System: An Introduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CTbLquL1bYYC&pg=PA1|year=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|ISBN=978-1-4129-2946-2|page=1[/tpl] Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly named agencies.
Corrections is also the name of a field of academic study concerned with the theories, policies, and programs pertaining to the practice of corrections. Its object of study includes personnel training and management as well as the experiences of those on the other side of the fence — the unwilling subjects of the correctional process. Stohr and colleagues write that "Earlier scholars were more honest, calling what we now call corrections by the name penology, which means the study of punishment for crime."[tpl]cite book |author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|year=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=2[/tpl]
The terminology change in US academia from "penology" to "corrections" occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and it was driven by a new philosophy emphasizing rehabilitation. It was accompanied by concrete changes in some prisons, like giving more privileges to inmates, and attempting to instill a more communal atmosphere. At least nominally, most prisons became correctional institutions, and guards became correctional officers.[tpl]cite book |author1=John T. Whitehead|author2=Mark Jones|author3=Michael Braswell|title=Exploring Corrections in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HXAspHay2RUC&pg=PA8|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-59345-512-5|page=8|edition=2[/tpl] Although the corrections-related terminology continued thereafter in US correctional practice, the philosophical view on offenders' treatment took an opposite turn in the 1980s, when the "get tough" program was labeled by academics as "The New Penology".[tpl]cite book |author1=John T.

==Sentences==

Sentences imposed upon offenders range from probation to serving time in prison. At one time, corporal punishment was also added as a condition of a sentence. In Canada, until 1972, the Criminal Code legislated that courts could impose a form of whipping on male offenders, to be administered on up to three occasions, but did not limit the number of strokes. Whipping of female offenders was not allowed. The whipping could be inflicted using a strap, cat-o'-nine-tails, or a paddle unless specified by the court.Abolition of Corporal Punishment 1972, Correctional Service of Canada The move to abolish corporal punishment in the Canadian penal system coincided with several reforms and a change from the Reform Institutions label to Corrections or Correctional.
Intermediate sanctions include sentences to a halfway house or community service program, home confinement, and electronic monitoring, but also financial sanctions like fines, forfeiture, and restitution; these are sometimes applied in combination.[tpl]cite book |author=Gail A. Caputo|title=Intermediate sanctions in corrections|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lctP2rtSOooC&pg=PA28|year=2004|publisher=University of North Texas Press|isbn=978-1-57441-186-7|page=28[/tpl]

==Theories==

The use of sanctions, which can be either positive (rewarding) or negative (punishment) is the basis of all criminal theory, along with the main goals of social control, and deterrence of deviant behavior.
Many facilities operating in the United States adhere to particular correctional theories. Although often heavily modified, these theories determine the nature of the facilities' design and security operations. The two primary theories used today are the more traditional Remote Supervision[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] and the more contemporary direct supervision model.[tpl]cite book |author1=Peter M. Carlson|author2=Judith Simon Garrett|title=Prison and Jail Administration: Practice and Theory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SPwgJWOS4CIC&pg=PA46|year=2008|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2862-5|pages=46–47[/tpl] In the Remote Supervision Model, officers observe the inmate population from remote positions, e.g., towers or secure desk areas. The Direct Supervision Model positions prison officers within the inmate population, creating a more pronounced presence.
