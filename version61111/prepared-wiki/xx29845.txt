The Time Lords are an ancient extraterrestrial civilisation of a humanoid species known as Gallifreyans in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, of which the series' protagonist, the Doctor, is a member. Time Lords receive their name for their non-linear perception of time, which allows them to see everything that was, is, or could be at the same time, as shown in the 1996 movie Doctor Who. They developed a culture of custodianship and time-related technologies based on this perception which includes strictly controlled space/time travel machines (known as "TARDISes") and monitoring devices to travel through time and to prevent time from being subverted or abusedâ€”although actual action was described as rare in practice due to their  traditional policy of strict non-interference and neutrality. They can act to manipulate timelines of a wide range of events and individuals, so long as they do not cross back into their own timeline.
Originally they were described as a powerful and wise race from the planet Gallifrey, from which the Doctor was a renegade; details beyond this were very limited for the first decade of the series. They later became integral to many episodes and stories as their role in the fictional universe developed. Over subsequent episodes their history, their development of time manipulation, and their internal politics were touched upon, with Time Lord society portrayed as a stagnated ceremony-bound oligarchy and their past having descended into myth and legend. The Doctor became at times an ally, being appointed their president during his fourth incarnation and assisting them on many occasions. After the series resumed in 2005, the Time Lords were presented as no longer existing, having been destroyed by the Doctor at some intervening point during the Last Great Time War in which they became corrupted, led by a tyrannical Lord President Rassilon willing to sacrifice the entirety of time and space for survival. The Time Lords made a subsequent appearance as a race in 2010 when they schemed to escape the resulting time lock and resume their plan, as well as in the appearance of individuals such as the Master, and at times, inadvertent human-time lord hybrids.

==Overview==

At the start of the series, the Doctor was identified only as an alien; his home planet and race were not identified. After six years, in The War Games, other aliens from his world appeared and were known as the Time Lords,[tpl]cite serial|title=The War Games|series=Doctor Who|credits=Writers Malcolm Hulke and Terrance Dicks, Director David Maloney, Producer Derrick Sherwin|network=BBC|station=BBC1|city=London|began=19 April 1969|ended=21 June 1969[/tpl] and it was a further five years before the name of his home planet (Gallifrey) was revealed in The Time Warrior.[tpl]cite serial|title=The Time Warrior|episode=Part Two|series=Doctor Who|credits=WriterRobert Holmes, Director Alan Bromly, Producer Barry Letts|network=BBC|station=BBC1|station=BBC1|city=London|airdate=22 December 1973[/tpl] The nature and history of the Time Lords were gradually revealed as the television programme progressed.
The Time Lords are considered one of the oldest and most technologically powerful races in the Doctor Who universe. The small number of beings that are more powerful than the Time Lords include the (now extinct) Osirians and higher powers of the universe such as the Black and White Guardians, and possibly the Eternals.[tpl]cite serial|title=Enlightenment|series=Doctor Who|credits=Writer Barbara Clegg, Director Fiona Cumming, Producer John Nathan-Turner|network=BBC|station=BBC1|city=London|began=1 March 1983|ended=9 March 1983[/tpl] Additionally, The People from the spin-off novels (which are of uncertain canonicity) had a non-aggression treaty with the Time Lords.[ref]
