==History of Hope Church==

Hope started in 1997, a "small band of people dreaming about what the church could be if we are honest, relevant, and authentic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://hopecentral.com/about-hope/ |title=About Hope | Hope Church - Richmond, VA |publisher=Hopecentral.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl]  According to the website, "We believe the Bible and we’re grateful for it’s stability and guidance in the midst of a world of change. At the same time we kind of like things on the creative side."
For the first two years the church met at Ruby Carver Elementary School, then moved to Godwin High School. Hope bought its current property in 2001 and moved into the building in September 2008.

==Arts and Hope Church==

A distinctive element of Hope Church is their commitment to the arts.  This value stems from the Christian idea that God as Creator made humans in His image, thereby making them creative and their creations (the arts) a domain of beauty and sacred expression.  Hope has a Worship Arts department, whose stated mission is "to expand the worship of God by empowering a community of artists" toward the end of seeing "a movement of redemptive art" in Richmond, Virginia.  They attempt to empower local artists by hosting an art gallery and visual art show series, by helping songwriters and musicians capture their art in their on-site recording studio, and by creating, producing, and releasing original films through their affiliate, Check The Gate Films.  In addition, they host a summer program of art classes for children and adults alike.
