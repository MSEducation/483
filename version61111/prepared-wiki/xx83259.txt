Thomas "Tom" or "Tommy" Simpson (30 November 1937 – 13 July 1967) was one of Britain's most successful professional cyclists. He was born in Haswell, County Durham and later moved to Harworth, Nottinghamshire. Simpson began road cycling as a teenager before taking up track cycling, specialising in pursuit races. He won a bronze medal for track cycling at the 1956 Summer Olympics and a silver at the 1958 Commonwealth Games.
In 1959 at age 21, Simpson was signed by the French professional road-racing team St. Raphaël-Géminiani. He advanced to their first team (Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop) the following year, and won the 1961 Tour of Flanders. Simpson then joined Gitane-Leroux-Dunlop; in the 1962 Tour de France he became the first British rider to wear the yellow jersey, finishing sixth overall.
In 1963 Simpson moved to Peugeot-BP-Englebert, winning Bordeaux–Paris that year and Milan – San Remo in 1964. In 1965 he became Britain's first world road race champion and won the Giro di Lombardia; this made him the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the first cyclist to win the award. Injuries hampered much of Simpson's 1966 season. He won two stages of the 1967 Vuelta a España before taking the general classification of Paris–Nice that year.
During the 13th stage of the 1967 Tour de France, Simpson collapsed and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. Despite this, he is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.

Simpson was born on 30 November 1937 in Haswell, County Durham, the youngest of six children of coal miner Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (née Cheetham).[tpl]cite web|title=Index entry|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=5Zh%2BA5fY2GgCz9TqtJBGHQ&scan=1|work=FreeBMD|publisher=Office for National Statistics|location=Newport, UK|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=MacLeary|first=John|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/8789063/Britains-world-champions-head-to-head-Mark-Cavendish-v-Tom-Simpson.html|title=Britain's world champions head-to-head: Mark Cavendish v Tom Simpson|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|location=London|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl] His father had been a semi-professional sprinter in athletics.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=45[/tpl] The family lived modestly in a small terraced house[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=15[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=45[/tpl] until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village's working men's club and lived above it.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=16[/tpl] In 1950 the Simpsons moved to Harworth on the Nottinghamshire-Yorkshire border, where young Simpson's maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry (by now, the only children left at home).[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=17[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pascoe|1997|loc=7 minutes in[/tpl] Simpson rode his first bike (his brother-in-law's) at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for time trials around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth and District CC.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=18[/tpl] To upgrade his bike, he delivered groceries in the Bassetlaw district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better road bike.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=18[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=9–11[/tpl] He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him "four-stone Coppi" (after Italian rider Fausto Coppi), due to his small stature.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=9–11[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pascoe|1997|loc=9 minutes in[/tpl]
Simpson began winning club time trials at his club, but sensed resentment of his boasting from senior members.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=12–13[/tpl] He left Harworth and District and joined Rotherham's Scala Wheelers.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=22–23[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=48[/tpl] Simpson's first road race was as a junior at the Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham.[tpl]cite journal|title=Remembering Tom Simpson|magazine=Cycling|location=London|pages=20–21|date=1 January 1977[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=24[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=14–15[/tpl] After leaving school he was an apprentice draughtsman at an engineering company in Retford (about [tpl]convert|10|mi[/tpl] from his home in Harworth), commuting by bike as training.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=24[/tpl] He placed well in the [tpl]convert|0.5|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] races on grass and cement, but decided to concentrate on road racing.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=24[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=14–15[/tpl] In May 1955 Simpson won the National Cyclists' Union (NCU) South Yorkshire individual pursuit as a junior; the same year, he won the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) junior hill climb championship and placed third in the senior event. His first race as a senior was a second-place finish in the semi-professional Circuit des Grimpeurs in Derbyshire.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=29[/tpl]
Simpson immersed himself in the world of cycling; he wrote to naturalised Austrian rider George Berger, who helped him with his riding position.[tpl]sfn|Pascoe|1997|loc=11 minutes in[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=50–51[/tpl] In late 1955, Simpson was suspended from racing after a dispute between the two governing bodies of cycling in Britain (the NCU and the BLRC); both bodies agreed that if any rider committed an offence under the Road Traffic Act, they would incur a suspension. Simpson was caught by police failing to stop at a stop sign, and was banned for six months. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford the new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=32–34[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=18–19[/tpl]

===Track years: Olympics, Commonwealths and amateur worlds===

Berger told Simpson that if he wanted to be a successful road cyclist, he needed experience in track cycling (particularly the 4000 m individual pursuit).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=36[/tpl] Simpson competed regularly at Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist Cyril Cartwright (who thought Simpson had a chance of winning that year's national pursuit championship). Cartwright gave him diet advice, lent him a track bike and developed his technique. Reg Harris, a 1948 Olympic silver medallist, was brought in to train with Simpson.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=37–38[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pascoe|1997|loc=17 minutes in[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=20–23[/tpl] At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion Norman Sheil before losing to Mike Gambrill.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=39–41[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=22–23[/tpl]
Simpson began working with his father as a draughtsman at the glass factory in Harworth.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=42–43[/tpl] He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur world championships, he made the 4,000-metre team pursuit squad for the 1956 Olympics.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=43–44[/tpl] In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in the Soviet Union against Russian and Italian teams to prepare for the Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began in Leningrad, continuing to Moscow before finishing in Sofia. He was nicknamed "the Sparrow" by the Soviet press because of his slender build.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=43–44[/tpl] The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, qualifying for the team-pursuit semifinals against Italy; the team was confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss, pushing too hard on a turn and unable to recover for the next.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=49–50[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=25–35[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tom Simpson|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/si/tom-simpson-1.html|work=Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[/tpl]
[tpl]Quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=There was one name on everyone's lips on that day: "Tom Simpson". There was a buzz in the crowd as he began to climb, you could feel it, and I remember this lad with a shock of hair thundering up the hill past me, carried on a solid wave of excitement. The overall feeling that day was that this was the future, this was the man to watch – Tom Simpson.|source=Spectator Gordon Hill, remembering the 1957 BLRC national hill climb championships[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=54–55[/tpl]|quoted=1[/tpl]
After the Olympics, Simpson trained throughout his winter break into 1957.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=51–52[/tpl] In May, he rode the national 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working for a month and struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|p=38[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=52–54[/tpl] After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill-climbing championship in October[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=38–39[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hilton|2005|p=367[/tpl] before taking a short break from racing.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=55[/tpl] In spring 1958 he raced in the Daily Herald Trophy at the White Monday Meeting at Fallowfield before racing in Sofia with Sheil for two weeks and winning the national pursuit championship at Herne Hill. In July Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=40–43[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=56–59[/tpl]
In September 1958, Simpson competed at the amateur world championships in Paris. Against reigning world champion Carlo Simonigh of Italy in the opening round of the individual pursuit, his wheel got caught in the guttering tyre at the end of the race; when he bunny hopped his bike out, his tyre burst as it hit a crack in the concrete track. Simpson was briefly knocked unconscious and sustained a dislocated jaw; however, he won the race since he crashed after the finish line. Although he was in pain, team manager Benny Foster forced him to race in the quarterfinal against New Zealand's Warwick Dalton as a strategic move favouring Simpson's teammate Sheil (who won the gold medal). Simpson felt that if he had not crashed, the world championship would have been his.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=60–61[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=60–61[/tpl] He wanted to turn professional, but needed to prove himself first.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=44–47[/tpl] Simpson set his sights on the world amateur indoor hour record, and Reg Harris arranged for an attempt at the Oerlikon velodrome in Zürich on 30 November (Simpson's birthday). He failed by 300 m, covering a distance of [tpl]convert|43.995|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] and blaming his failure on the low temperature generated by an ice rink in the center of the velodrome.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=51–52[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=47–48[/tpl][tpl]cite interview|last=Simpson|first=Tom|interviewer=Ken Evans|title= 'I'll get the hour – before the others try' |magazine=Cycling|publisher=Longacre Press|location=London|pages=4–5|date=1 April 1967[/tpl]
After Simpson's failed hour-record attempt, he was invited to a race in East Berlin as part of a British team; upon his return, he decided to move to the continent for a better chance at success.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=64[/tpl] He contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy (whom he met while racing in Manchester and the Isle of Man), and they agreed that he could stay with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=50–51[/tpl] His final event in Britain was the Good Friday meeting at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races against opponents who included reigning world champion Lothar Meister. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=65–66[/tpl]

===Move to Brittany===

In April 1959, Simpson left for France with two Carlton bikes (one road and one track) and £100 from Carlton in appreciation of his help promoting the company. His last words to his mother before the move were, "I don't want to be sitting here in 20 years' time, wondering what would have happened if I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he later avoided conscription.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=47–48[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=64–67[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=58–59[/tpl] When settled with the Murphy family, Simpson began winning local races and attracting attention in criteriums. He was invited to race in the Route de France (an eight-day amateur stage race) by the St. Raphaël-sponsored VC 12 club, who were behind the professional team St. Raphaël-Géminiani. Simpson won the final stage, breaking away from the peloton and holding on for the victory.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=69–74[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=64–67[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=62[/tpl] After this win, he declined an offer to ride in the Tour de France on an international team.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=61[/tpl] Simpson had contract offers from two professional teams, [tpl]ct|Mercier|1959[/tpl] and Rapha (which already had a British cyclist, Brian Robinson); opting for the latter team, on 29 June he signed a contract for 80,000 francs (£80 a month).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=74[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=61[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|p=67[/tpl]

==Professional career==

===1959: Foundations===

Simpson's first race as a professional was the Tour de l'Ouest in July. In the opening stage he finished in a breakaway group with teammate Pierre Everaert, who took the leader's jersey. In stage four, a break formed; Simpson tried to bridge the gap for Everaert (who could not mange the pace), winning a sprint finish and taking the leader's jersey. He won the next stage, a [tpl]convert|41.6|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial, increasing his lead to about three minutes.[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|p=70[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tour de l'Ouest 1959|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/voorloopfiche.php?wedstrijdvoorloopid=5003|work=Cycling Archives|publisher=de Wielersite|accessdate=26 May 2013[/tpl] He lost the lead on the next stage with a puncture,[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=77[/tpl] finishing the race in 14th place overall.
In August Simpson competed at the world championships in the 5000 m individual pursuit at Amsterdam's large, open-air velodrome and the road race on the nearby Circuit Park Zandvoort motor-racing track. He placed fourth in the individual pursuit, losing by 0.3 seconds in the quarterfinals. He expected to progress further, and prepared for the [tpl]convert|180|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] road race (eight laps of the track, Simpson's first professional one-day race). After [tpl]convert|45|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] a ten-rider breakaway formed; at [tpl]convert|63|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl], Simpson bridged the gap. As the peloton began to close in, he tried to attack. Although he was brought back each time, Simpson placed fourth in a sprint for the best finish to date by a British rider. He was praised by the winner, André Darrigade of France, who thought that without Simpson's work on the front the breakaway would have been caught. Darrigade helped him enter criteriums for extra money.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=78–81[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=73–75[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The first big wins|series=Remembering Tom Simpson|magazine=Cycling|publisher=IPC Media|location=London|pages=16–17|date=8 January 1977[/tpl]
Simpson moved up to St. Raphaël-Géminiani's first team, Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop, for the end-of-season classic races. He rode in Paris–Tours, finishing 16th after a bunch sprint,[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=83[/tpl] and retired from the Giro di Lombardia with a puncture while in the lead group (his first appearance in one of the five "monuments" of cycling).[tpl]cite news|title=Volatone a Milano e vittoria di Van Looy|trans_title=Volatone in Milan and win Van Looy|url=http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&file=/archivio/uni_1959_10/19591019_0006.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=l'Unità|date=19 October 1959|page=6|language=Italian|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Mannini|first=Paul|title=53a edizione Giro di Lombardia (1959)|language=Italian|trans_title=53rd Tour of Lombardy (1959)|url=http://www.museociclismo.it/content/corse/edizione.php?cod=598|work=Museo del Ciclismo|accessdate=26 May 2013[/tpl] In Simpson's last race of the season, he finished fourth in the Trofeo Baracchi (a two-man team time trial with Gérard Saint) against his boyhood idol, Fausto Coppi; it was Coppi's final race before his death.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=83–84[/tpl] Simpson finished the season with 28 wins.

===1960: Tour debut===

Simpson's first major race of the 1960 season was Milan – San Remo on 19 March, in which the organisers introduced the now-famous Poggio climb to keep the race from finishing with a bunch sprint. Simpson broke clear from a breakaway group over the first climb (the Turchino), leading the race for [tpl]convert|45|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] before being caught. He lost contact over Poggio, finishing in 38th place.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=86–87[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The 1960 Milan–San Remo|url=http://www.milansanremo.co.uk/1960/1960story.htm|work=The Milan–San Remo Cycle Race|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The 1960 Milan–San Remo result|url=http://www.milansanremo.co.uk/1960result.htm|work=The Milan–San Remo Cycle Race|accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl] Simpson rode in Paris–Roubaix (the first race to be shown live on Eurovision),[tpl]cite web|last=Jones|first=Graham|title=The Flanders Lion Tamer|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/Apr06/cover_apr_Lion.htm|work=CyclingRevealed|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=April 2006[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=99[/tpl] launching an attack as an early break was caught. He rode at the front on his own for [tpl]convert|40|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] before being caught with [tpl]convert|5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to go and finishing ninth. In the Roubaix Velodrome, Simpson rode a lap of honour after the race at the request of the emotional crowd. His televised effort launched his career, and he was now known throughout Europe.[tpl]sfn|Bouvet|2007|p=103[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=88–91[/tpl] Simpson won the Mont Faron hill climb and finished sixth in the five-day Genoa-Rome race, winning King of the Mountains.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=251[/tpl] He rode the Ardennes classics, placing seventh in La Flèche Wallonne and eleventh in Liège–Bastogne–Liège.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=91[/tpl] In May he won the general classification of the Tour du Sud-Est, his first overall victory in a professional stage race.[tpl]cite web|title=Tour du Sud-Est 1960|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=59811&wedstrijdvoorloopid=5012|work=Cycling Archives|publisher=de Wielersite|accessdate=27 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=92[/tpl]
In June, Simpson made his Grand Tour debut at the Tour de France at age 22. Rapha team manager Raymond Louviot opposed his participation, but since the race was contested by national teams Simpson accepted the invitation from the British squad.[tpl]cite journal|title=Tackling his first Tour|series=Remembering Tom Simpson|magazine=Cycling|publisher=IPC Media|location=London|pages=18–19|date=15 January 1977[/tpl] During the first stage, he was part of a 13-rider breakaway which finished over two minutes in front of the field; he finished 13th after crashing on the cinder track at the finish in Brussels, but received the same time as the winner.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=94[/tpl] Later that day he finished ninth in the time trial, covering [tpl]convert|27.8|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] one minute 23 seconds slower than the winner (Roger Rivière of France) and moving up to fifth place overall.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=94[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=1960 Tour de France|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1960.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl] During the third stage Simpson was part of a breakaway with two French riders who repeatedly attacked, forcing him to chase and use energy needed for the finish; he finished third, missing the 30-second bonus for a first-place finish (which would have put him in the yellow jersey).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=94–95[/tpl] He dropped to ninth overall by the end of the first week. During stage ten, Simpson crashed descending the Col d'Aubisque in the Pyrenees but finished the stage in 14th place.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=95–96[/tpl] In the following stage (from Pau to Luchon) he was dropped, exhausted, from a chasing group; failing to recover, he finished in 29th place overall. Simpson lost [tpl]convert|2|st|kg lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in weight over the three-week race.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=190[/tpl]
After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until crashing in central France; he returned home to Paris and checked himself into a hospital.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=129–130[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=97–98[/tpl] Following a week's bedrest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes on the right side of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=98[/tpl] He struggled in the last of the classics,[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=100[/tpl] finishing 84th in the Giro di Lombardia.

===1961: Tour of Flanders and injury===

Simpson's first major event of the 1961 season was the Paris–Nice stage race in March. During stage three his team won the team time trial, giving him the leader's jersey and the GC lead by three seconds; however, he lost it in the next stage. In the final stages of the race Simpson's attacks were thwarted, and he finished fifth overall. In his next race (Milan – San Remo), teammate Jean-Claude Annaert was part of a breakaway. Simpson helped prevent other riders from bridging the gap and finished 25th. The next day, he rode the opening stage of the short Menton–Rome race. Simpson placed second in two stages, finishing second overall to teammate Albertus Geldermans.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=102–104[/tpl]
On 26 March, Simpson rode the Tour of Flanders. With Carpano's Nino Defilippis, he chased down an early break that included 1959 winner (and world champion) Rik Van Looy of [tpl]ct|FLA|1961[/tpl] and Simpson's teammate Jo de Haan. Simpson worked with the group; with about [tpl]convert|8|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to go he attacked, followed by Defilippis. The finish, three circuits around the town of Wetteren, was flat; Defilippis (unlike Simpson) was a sprinter and was expected to win. One kilometre from the finish, Simpson launched a sprint; he eased off with 300 m to go, tricking Defilippis into thinking he was exhausted. As Defilippis passed on his right, Simpson jumped again; Defilippis looked left to see Simpson lunge ahead, becoming the first Briton to win a "monument" classic.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=105–107[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lion|first=Jan|title=Tom Simpson won in 1961|language=Dutch|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=BLJLI_20110327_001|newspaper=Het Nieuwsblad|publisher=Corelio|accessdate=29 May 2013|location=Brussels|date=27 March 2011[/tpl] Defilippis protested that the finishing banner had been blown down, and he did not know where the finish was; however, the judges noted that the finish line was clearly marked on the road itself.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=107[/tpl]
A week later, Simpson rode in Paris–Roubaix in the hope of bettering his previous year's ninth place. As the race reached the paved section, he went on a solo attack and was told that [tpl]ct|Mercier|1961|nolink=yes[/tpl] rider Raymond Poulidor was chasing him down. Simpson increased his speed, catching the vehicles in front. A press car swerved to avoid a pothole; this forced him into a roadside ditch. Simpson fell, damaging his front wheel and injuring his knee. He found his team car and retrieved a replacement wheel, but by then the front of the race had passed. Back in the race he crashed twice more, finishing 88th (about 30 minutes behind winner Van Looy).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=108–109[/tpl]
At Simpson's next race, the G.P. Eibar, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but was forced to quit during the following stage. His injury had not healed; after seeing several specialists, for financial reasons he rode the Tour de France with the British team.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=110–111[/tpl] Simpson abandoned on stage three because pedaling was a struggle.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=110–111[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=65[/tpl] Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris, who diagnosed the problem as arthritis. He gave Simpson 16 knee injections, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarterfinals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a 17-rider break that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=111–113[/tpl]

===1962: Yellow jersey===

Simpson moved to Ghent, Belgium, and was earning money in one-day races around the country.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=114[/tpl] His contract with Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop had ended with the 1961 season. Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil signed with them for 1962, but Simpson wanted to lead a team and signed with Gitane-Leroux-Dunlop (a new team for the 1962 season).[tpl]sfn|Simpson|2009|p=110[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=114[/tpl] After training camp at Lodeve in southern France, he rode in Paris–Nice.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=115[/tpl] Simpson helped his team win the stage-three team time trial and finished second overall, behind [tpl]ct|FLA|1962|nolink=yes[/tpl]'s Jef Planckaert.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=115[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=252[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The Yellow Jersey|series=Remembering Tom Simpson|magazine=Cycling|publisher=IPC Media|location=London|pages=22–23|date=22 January 1977[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The starters|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1962/partants.html|work=The history of the Tour de France|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|location=Issy-les-Moulineaux, France|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130705041514/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1962/partants.html|archivedate=2 November 2012|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl] He was unable to ride Milan – San Remo when its organisers limited the race to Italian-based teams;[tpl]#tag:ref|The organisers of the 1962 Milan – San Remo only allowed Italian teams to participate as an attempt to get an Italian winner, as the last one was in 1953.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=115[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Past winners|url=http://www.milansanremo.co.uk/palmares.htm|work=The Milan-San Remo Cycle Race|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl]|group="n"|name="1962ms"[/tpl] instead he rode in Gent–Wevelgem, finishing sixth,[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=115[/tpl] and defended his Tour of Flanders title. As the race ended, Simpson was in a select group of riders at the front. Although he led over each of the final climbs, at the finish he finished fifth behind Van Looy and won the King of the Mountains prize.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=116–117[/tpl] A week later Simpson finished 37th in Paris–Roubaix, delayed by a crash.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=117[/tpl] In May he crashed during the opening stage of the Four Days of Dunkirk, losing over six minutes; although this removed him from contention for overall victory he finished 20th, using the race for training. Simpson's next races were the Tour de Luxembourg and the Manx Trophy.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=119–121[/tpl]
Coming into the Tour de France, Simpson was leader of the Gitane-Leroux-Dunlop team;[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=122[/tpl] it was the first time since 1929 that company teams were allowed to compete.[tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=253[/tpl] He finished ninth in the first stage (from Nancy to Spa),[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=122[/tpl] in a group of 22 riders who finished over eight minutes ahead of the rest. Simpson's team finished second to [tpl]ct|FLA|1962|nolink=yes[/tpl] in the stage-2b team time trial; he was in seventh place overall,[tpl]cite web|title=1962 Tour de France|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1962.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] remaining in the top ten the rest of the first week.

A group of three broke away over the next two climbs, but were caught at the finish. Simpson finished the stage in 18th place, 30 seconds ahead of Geldermans (St. Raphaël-Helyett-Hutchinson) on GC and the first British rider to wear the leader's yellow jersey (a feat unmatched for 32 years, until Chris Boardman won the prologue of the 1994 Tour).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=123–125[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stage 12 Pau > Saint-Gaudens|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1962/1200/etape.html|work=The history of the Tour de France|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|location=Issy-les-Moulineaux, France|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100819060544/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1962/1200/etape.html|archivedate=19 August 2010|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]
Simpson lost the lead on the following stage, an [tpl]convert|18.5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] time trial ending with a steep uphill finish at Superbagnères. He finished 31st, five minutes and 40 seconds behind winner Federico Bahamontes of Margnat-Paloma-D'Alessandro and dropped to sixth overall.[tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=253[/tpl] In the first Alpine stage (stage 18 from Juan-les-Pins to Briançon, the highest town in Europe) Simpson finished ninth and moved up to third overall, behind Planckaert and Anquetil. He advanced recklessly descending the Col de Porte in the next stage, crashing on a bend and only saved from falling over the edge by a tree. Simpson finished the stage in 32nd place, slipping back to third, and the crash left him with a broken left middle finger. He lost almost 11 minutes to winner of the next stage's time trial (and eventual overall winner) Anquetil, finishing the Tour at Paris' Parc des Princes 17 minutes and nine seconds behind in sixth place.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=126–128[/tpl] He rode criteriums before the road world championships in Salò, Italy, where he retired with [tpl]convert|25|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to go after missing a large breakaway. He began six-day racing into his winter break, training in Ghent; in early October he finished third in the Six Days of Madrid with his partner, Australian John Tresidder.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=130–131[/tpl]

===1963: Bordeaux–Paris===

Leroux withdrew its sponsorship of the Gitane team for the 1963 season. Simpson was contracted to their manager, Raymond Louviot; Louviot was rejoining St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani and Simpson could follow, but he saw that as a step backwards. Peugeot-BP-Englebert bought the contract (which ran until the end of the season) from Louviot.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=134[/tpl] Simpson's season opened with Paris–Nice; he fell out of contention after a series of punctures in the opening stages, and withdrew from the race on the final stage. After breaking away by himself he stopped beside the road, which annoyed his fellow riders.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=137–138[/tpl] At Milan – San Remo, Simpson was in a four-rider break that gained about three minutes; his tyre then punctured, and although he got back to the front, he finished 19th.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=138[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=1963 Milano – San Remo|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/classics/Milan-San%20Remo/1963-milan-san-remo.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] In late March he rode in Gent–Wevelgem, finishing second to Wiel's-Groene Leeuw rider Benoni Beheyt by one centimetre. The three-day Tour de Var followed; Simpson won the first stage in an uphill sprint, and finished second overall.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=139–141[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The starters|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1963/partants.html|work=The history of the Tour de France|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|location=Issy-les-Moulineaux, France|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130705041507/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1963/partants.html|archivedate=2 November 2012|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl] He placed third in the Tour of Flanders in a three-rider sprint.[tpl]cite web|title=1963 Tour of Flanders|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/classics/Tour%20of%20Flanders/1963-tour-of-flanders.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] In Paris–Roubaix Simpson worked for teammate (and winner) Emile Daems, finishing ninth. In the one-day Paris–Brussels he was in a breakaway near the Belgian border; with [tpl]convert|50|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] remaining he was left with world champion Jean Stablinski (St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani), who attacked on a cobbled climb in Alsemberg outside Brussels. Simpson's bike slipped a gear, and Stablinski stayed away for the victory. After his second-place finish, Simpson led the Super Prestige Pernod International season-long competition for world's best cyclist. The following week he raced the Ardennes classics, placing seventh in la Flèche Wallonne and 33rd in Liège–Bastogne–Liège; in the latter, he rode alone for about [tpl]convert|100|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] before being caught in the final [tpl]convert|5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=139–144[/tpl]

Simpson broke away with a group of three riders including 1962 winner Jo de Roo (St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani) and Peter Post (Dr. Mann-Labo). Simpson's pacer, Fernand Wambst, increased his speed, and Simpson dropped the other two. He caught the lead group, 13 minutes ahead, over a distance of [tpl]convert|161|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. Simpson attacked, and with [tpl]convert|36|km|abbr=on[/tpl] remaining opened a margin of two minutes.

Simpson announced that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. He won the Manx Trophy, a one-day race on the Isle of Man, in treacherous conditions where only 16 out of 70 riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, Simpson was favoured with Van Looy (although Simpson had only three teammates, compared to Van Looy's ten). The Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Seamus Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson.[tpl]#tag:ref|Seamus Elliott rode for St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani, the rival team of Simpson's Peugeot-BP-Englebert, and would not work with Simpson and risk him winning.

Simpson placed second at the Critérium des As in Paris to Anquetil, and in Paris–Tours to Jo de Roo (St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani). He was tenth in the Giro di Lombardia, finishing the Super Prestige Pernod International in second place behind Anquetil.

François Mahé (Pelforth-Sauvage-Lejeune) went on a lone break; Simpson attacked in pursuit of Mahé, followed by Jean Stablinski. Simpson's derny broke down, and he was delayed changing motorbikes. He caught Stablinski, and was joined by Anquetil. Outside Paris Mahé was caught and dropped, after [tpl]convert|200|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] on his own.

In the stage-1b team time trial, his team finished second to Ford-France-Gitane. During stage nine he injured his hand crashing on the descent of the Col d'Aubisque in the Pyrenees, finishing tenth in the stage and seventh in GC. Sinpson developed bronchitis after stage 15 and cracked on the next stage (from Gap to Briançon), losing nearly 19 minutes. His hand became infected, but he rode the next three stages before the Tour doctor stopped him from racing.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=193–196[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=1965 Tour de France|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1965.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=13 June 2013[/tpl] He was taken to hospital and treated for blood poisoning and a kidney infection.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=190[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=196[/tpl]
After ten days off his bike, Simpson rode three contracted post-Tour criteriums (which were all he was offered). His training for the road world championships included kermesse races. Simpson's last race before the world championships was the Paris–Luxembourg stage race, riding as a super-domestique.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=197–198[/tpl] On 5 September, Simpson rode in the road race at the world championships in San Sebastián, Spain.[tpl]cite web|title=World Championship, Road, Profs 1965|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=10987|work=Cycling Archives|publisher=de Wielersite|accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl] The race was a [tpl]convert|267.4|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] hilly circuit of 14 laps.

As his lead stretched to one minute Simpson and teammates Vin Denson and Alan Ramsbottom bridged the gap, followed by Germany's Rudi Altig. Hoban kept the pace high enough to prevent any of the favourites from joining. Simpson and Altig broke clear over Hernani Hill, with two-and-a-half laps remaining. They stayed together until the final kilometre, when Simpson launched his sprint; he held off Altig for victory by three bike lengths, becoming the first British world road race champion.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=200–202[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Simpson Champion|magazine=Cycling|publisher=Go Magazine|location=London|pages=16–17|date=11 September 1965|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/501524/tom-simpson-britain-s-first-pro-road-champion.html|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl] Simpson would be the only British world road race champion for 46 years, until Mark Cavendish won in 2011.
Simpson's next major race was Paris–Tours; he had two lone breaks, but was caught by the peloton with over [tpl]convert|2|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to go.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=204[/tpl] On 16 October Simpson rode the Giro di Lombardia, which featured five mountain passes. He escaped with Motta, and dropped him [tpl]convert|6|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] before the finish in Como to win his third "monument" classic three minutes 11 seconds ahead of the rest.

For the next three weeks he rode contract races, partnering with Post for victory in the six-day race at Brussels. He ended the year second to Anquetil in Super Prestige Pernod International, winning the Daily Express Sportsman of the Year, the Sports Journalists' Association Sportsman of the Year and the BBC Sports Personality of the Year (with Formula One world champion Jim Clark finishing second).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=207–210[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Past winners of the SJA British Sports Awards|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/sja-sport-awards/past-winners-of-the-sja-sports-awards/|work=Sports Journalists' Association|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sports Personality of the Year|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/spoty.shtml|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 July 2013|location=London|date=3 July 2013[/tpl] In British cycling Simpson won the Bidlake Memorial Prize in 1965,[tpl]cite web|title=Recipients|url=http://www.bidlakememorial.org.uk/Recipients.htm|work=The F.

===1966: An injury ridden season===

As he did the previous winter, Simpson went on a skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, breaking his right tibia, and his leg was in a plaster cast until the end of February. He missed contract races, crucial training and most of the spring classics. Simpson began riding in March; within two weeks he rode his first road race (a criterium in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium), followed by an omnium track event in Antwerp. He rode a derny-paced race at the Good Friday Meeting at Herne Hill, defeating other British pros. In late April he started (but did not finish) Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and in early May he finished 20th in the Four Days of Dunkirk.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=211–216[/tpl]
Simpson's injury did not stop the press from naming him a favourite for the Tour de France.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=211–216[/tpl] He was quiet in the race until stage 12, when he forced a breakaway with Altig (Molteni-Hutchinson) and finished second to the German.[tpl]cite web|title=1966 Tour de France|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1966.html|work=BikeRaceInfo|publisher=McGann Publishing|location=Cherokee Village, AR|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The starters|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1966/partants.html|work=The history of the Tour de France|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|location=Issy-les-Moulineaux, France|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130704010426/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1966/partants.html|archivedate=19 August 2010|accessdate=4 July 2013[/tpl] Simpson again finished second in the next stage, jumping clear of the peloton with Molteni-Hutchinson's Georges Vandenberghe and Smith's Guido De Rosso with [tpl]convert|7|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to go. After the stage he was 18th overall, seven minutes 35 seconds down.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=220–221[/tpl] Simpson moved up to 16th after finishing fifth in stage 14b – a [tpl]convert|20|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] time trial – 20 seconds behind the winner, Poulidor ([tpl]ct|Mercier|1966|nolink=yes[/tpl]). As the race reached the Alps, Simpson decided to make his move. During stage 16 (from Le Bourg-d'Oisans to Briançon) Simpson attacked on the descent of the first of three mountains, the Col de la Croix de Fer. He crashed but continued, attacking again. Simpson was joined by Ford France-Hutchinson's Julio Jiménez on the climb of the Col du Télégraphe to the Col du Galibier. Simpson was caught by a chase group descending the Galibier before he crashed again, knocked off his bike by a press motorcycle. The crash required five stitches in his arm.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=222–225[/tpl][tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=253[/tpl][tpl]cite interview|last=Simpson|first=Tom|interviewer=Ken Evans|title= 'We can win the Tour' |magazine=Cycling|publisher=Longacre Press|location=London|pages=14–15|date=8 April 1967[/tpl] The next day he struggled to hold the handlebars and could not use the brake lever with his injured arm, forcing him to abandon. His answer to journalists asking about his future was, "I don't know. I'm heartbroken. My season is ruined."[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=175[/tpl]
After recovering from his injury Simpson rode 40 criteriums in 40 days, capitalising on his world championship and his attacks in the Tour.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=226[/tpl] He retired from the road world championships, and his road season ended with retirements from autumn classics Paris–Tours and the Giro di Lombardia. He rode six-day races, finishing 14th in the winter rankings.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=227–228[/tpl] The misfortune he endured during the year made him one of the first riders named as a victim of the "curse of the rainbow jersey".[tpl]sfn|Wilcockson|2009|p=159[/tpl]

===1967: Paris–Nice and Vuelta stages===

Simpson's primary objective for 1967 was overall victory in the Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national (rather than corporate) teams.[tpl]cite web|last=Sidwells|first=Chris|title=Paris–Nice 1967 – Part 1|url=http://www.chrissidwells.com/archive/Paris-Nice-1967-1.html|work=ChrisSidwells.com|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The national team format was used in the 1967 Tour de France after tour organiser, Félix Lévitan, believed the team sponsors were behind the riders strike in the previous year's Tour.[tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=24[/tpl]|group="n"|name="teams"[/tpl] He would lead the British team, which – although one of the weakest – would support him totally (unlike his corporate team, Peugeot-BP-Michelin).[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=238[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Brendan|title=Tom Simpson haunts Tour 40 years on|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/brendangallagher/2316933/Tom-Simpson-haunts-Tour-40-years-on.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=30 April 2013|location=London|date=13 July 2007[/tpl] During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=176[/tpl] Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=228[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=130[/tpl] He planned to attempt the one-hour record after the Tour.
Simpson's first victory of the season was in the Giro di Sardegna in late February, where he also took the fifth stage.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=230[/tpl] On 8 March he started his next race, Paris–Nice. After stage two his 23-year-old teammate, Eddy Merckx, took the overall lead.[tpl]cite web|last=Sidwells|first=Chris|title=Paris–Nice 1967 – Part 2|url=http://www.chrissidwells.com/archive/Paris-Nice-1967-2.html|work=ChrisSidwells.com|accessdate=6 July 2013|date=March 2012[/tpl] Simpson moved into the lead the next day as part of a breakaway (missed by Merckx) which finished nearly 20 minutes ahead.

In late April Simpson rode for Great Britain in his first Vuelta a España, using the race to prepare for the Tour. During stage two a breakaway gained over 13 minutes, dashing his hopes for a high placing. Simpson nearly quit the race before the fifth stage (from Salamanca to Madrid), but rode it because it was easier to get home by air from Madrid. He won the stage, attacking from a breakaway, and finished second in stage seven. Simpson won stage 16 (from Vitoria to San Sebastian, where he became world champion), his second stage victory, and finished the Vuelta 33rd overall.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=233–234[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Año 1967|trans_title=Year 1967|url=http://historia.lavuelta.com/es/anio.asp?a=1967|work=Vuelta a España|publisher=Unipublic|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=Madrid|language=Spanish[/tpl]
Simpson was determined to make an impact in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement.[tpl]sfn|Watts|2011|loc=2 minutes in[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|pp=237–238[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=130–131[/tpl] His plan was to finish in the top three or wear the yellow jersey, targeting three key stages (one of which was the 13th, over Mont Ventoux) and riding conservatively until the race reached the mountains.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=239[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=28–29[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Laurence|2005|loc=5 minutes in[/tpl][tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=27–28[/tpl] In the prologue, Simpson finished 13th.

The 13th stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France measured [tpl]convert|211.5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl]; it started in Marseille, crossing [tpl]convert|1910|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]-high Mont Ventoux (the "Giant of Provence") before finishing in Carpentras.[tpl]sfn|Rosen|2008|p=32[/tpl] As the race reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson (still ill) was seen washing pills down with brandy.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=30–31[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Dimeo|2007|p=61[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Alcohol was used as a stimulant and to dull pain.[tpl]sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=vi[/tpl] At the time, the Tour de France  organisers limited each rider to four bottles (bidons) of water (about two litres) two on the bike and two more given at feeding stations – the effects of dehydration being poorly understood.

Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop ("Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished"), but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" They got him on his bike and pushed him off.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=34–35[/tpl] Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were "On, on, on."

==Riding style and legacy==

Simpson looked for any advantage over his opponents. He made his own saddle, a design which is now standard.

==Personal life==

Soon after moving to France in 1959 the 21-year-old Simpson met 19-year-old Helen Sherburn, an au pair from Sutton, Yorkshire.[tpl]sfn|Sidwells|2000|p=69[/tpl] They married on 1 January 1961 and had two daughters, Jane and Joanne. After his death, Helen Simpson married Barry Hoban in December 1969.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=85[/tpl] Simpson is the maternal uncle of Belgian cyclist Matthew Gilmore.
He was interested in vintage cars, and his driving and riding styles were similar; Helen remembered, "Driving through the West End of London at [tpl]convert|60|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl], was nothing."[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|pp=72–73[/tpl] On 31 January 1966, Simpson was a guest "castaway" on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs; his favourite musical piece was "Ari's Theme" from Exodus by the London Festival Orchestra, his book choice was The Pickwick Papers and his luxury item was golf equipment.[tpl]cite episode|last=Plomley|first=Roy (host)|title=Castaway: Tommy Simpson|series=Desert Island Discs|date=31 January 1966|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/44bdbb24|station=BBC Radio 4|network=BBC|accessdate=17 June 2013[/tpl] Helen said that she chose his records for the show, since he was not interested in music.[tpl]sfn|Fotheringham|2007|p=79[/tpl]
