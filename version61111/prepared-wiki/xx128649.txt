"Die Sommermelodie" (English translation: "The Summer Melody") was the West-German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, performed in German by Cindy & Bert. Lyrics were by Kurt Feltz, while the composer, Werner Scharfenberger, also took care of conducting the orchestra for this entry - his only appearance in Eurovision.
The song was performed fourteenth on the night (following Ireland's Tina Reynolds with "Cross Your Heart" and preceding Switzerland's Piera Martell with "Mein Ruf nach dir"). At the close of voting, it had received 3 points, placing 14th in a field of 17.
The song is a duet, with both singers describing a brief romance over summer. They explain to each other that, while each still has feelings for the other, the relationship must end. Cindy & Bert also recorded the song in English, as "Our Summersong of Love".
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1975 Contest by Joy Fleming with "Ein Lied kann eine Br√ºcke sein".
