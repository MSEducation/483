The existence of a Sotadic Zone was an hypothesis of the British Orientalist and explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890). He asserted that there exists a geographic zone in which pederasty (romantic-sexual intimacy between a boy and a man) is prevalent and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants.[tpl]cite journal|last=Waitt|first=Gordon|coauthors=Kevin Markwell|title=The Lure of the "Sotadic Zone"’|journal=Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2008|volume=15|issue=2[/tpl] The name derives from Sotades, a 3rd-century BC Greek poet who was the chief representative of a group of writers of obscene, and sometimes pederastic, satirical poetry. (These homoerotic verses are preserved in the Greek Anthology, a collection of poems spanning the Classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature.)
Burton first advanced his Sotadic Zone concept in the "Terminal Essay" (§1., D) contained in Volume 10 of his translation of The Arabian Nights — which he called The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night — in 1886.[tpl]cite book|title=The Book of the Thousand Nights and A Night|year=1886|publisher=Burton Society (Private printing)|location=s.l.[/tpl]
