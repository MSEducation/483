CATEGORIES: Lists of countries, Rugby union-related lists, Rugby union records and statistics

This list shows each country to have a union affiliated to the International Rugby Board (IRB), the world organisation that manages the game of rugby union. As well as listing the countries, it also shows the number of registered clubs playing in each country, official referees and the number of registered players broken down by gender and age group. 
From the information supplied to the IRB by its union members, there are a total of 4,504,188 people who played organised rugby, though several countries have failed to supply details, and of this total only 852,866 are senior players. England alone claims 1,834,656 junior and youth players, almost 40 percent of the world's player total.
