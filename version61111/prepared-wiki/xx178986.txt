==History==

===1923-1933===

Since 1923, there had been Scout groups within the International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT) in Germany. There was a strong influence from the Neupfadfinder. The Neupfadfinder was a group of German and Austrian Scouters and Scouts, who tried to modernize Scouting under the influence of the Wandervogel movement and of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. They founded among other things a publishing house and published the translation of the books of John Hargrave in their Verlag Der Weiße Ritter. The Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder continued the traditions and style of the Neupfadfinder, after the Neupfadfinder and other groups of the German Youth Movement founded the Deutsche Freischar.
In 1927 there were three Scout groups which formed the District Sturmtrupp Süd:
In the following years, Scout groups of the association were founded all over the German Reich, and groups of the Wandervogel and other Scout associations joined.
In 1929, Erich Mönch (Scout name: Schnauz) and Helmuth Hövetborn (Scout name: Doktor) founded the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder-die Reichspfadfinderschaft im Deutschen Guttemplerorden (IOGT).[ref]
