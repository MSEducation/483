David Walsh (11 August 1945 â€“ 4 June 1998) was a Canadian businessman in the oil and gas and mining industries. Walsh was founder and CEO of the Canadian mining company Bre-X, which was involved in one of the largest stock market scandals in Canadian history.  Although Walsh had been oblivious to or dismissive of warning signs before the outbreak of the scandal, he called in RCMP investigators once the fraud was identified, and assisted the RCMP in their criminal investigation.  Prior to the Bre-X fraud, Walsh had run several successful oil and gas companies with properties throughout the United States and Canada, and been a stock broker and trust company officer and portfolio manager.  In 1998 he died of an apparent aneurysm suffered at his luxurious home in the Bahamas.Reuters (5 June 1998). "Bre-X scandal haunts former president even at death", CNN.com.
