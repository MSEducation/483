The LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owns most of the property and Larry Silverstein leased the World Trade Center's office space in July 2001. But the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.[ref]

===Early proposals for redesign===

In the months following the attacks, architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site.[tpl]cite news |title=Up From The Ashes |publisher=Newsweek |date=November 12, 2001 |author=McGuigan, Cathleen[/tpl] In January 2002, New York City art dealer Max Protetch solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his Chelsea art gallery.[tpl]cite news |title=Everyone Weighs In With Rebuilding Ideas |first=Edward |last=Wyatt |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/nyregion/ground-zero-the-proposals-everyone-weighs-in-with-rebuilding-ideas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 11, 2002 |accessdate=2010-07-31[/tpl]
In April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected Beyer Blinder Belle as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.[tpl]cite news |title=An Appraisal; Marginal Role for Architecture at Ground Zero |first=Herbert |last=Muschamp |authorlink=Herbert Muschamp |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDB1E38F930A15756C0A9649C8B63 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=2010-07-31[/tpl]
On July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site.[ref]
</ref> All six designs were voted "poor" by the roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback, so the LDMC announced a new, international, open-design study.<ref>
</ref>

===2002 World Trade Center site design competition===

In an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site.[ref]
</ref> The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions – a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations – announced seven semifinalists. The following seven architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:
Peterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist.[tpl]cite press release  | title = Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Six Teams of Architects and Planners to Participate in Design Study of World Trade Center Site  | publisher = www.RenewNYC.org  | date = September 26, 2002  | url = http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=655798f4-b8ee-4583-bf27-b3b9a9c29f1f  | accessdate = 2008-06-16[/tpl]
The seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.[tpl]cite news |title=Beauty Contest: Two Firms Vie At W.T.C.

Days before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair John Whitehead to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists' designs. As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as his master planner for the site.[tpl]cite book  | last = Libeskind  | first = Daniel  | title = Breaking Ground  | publisher = Riverhead Books  | location = New York  | year = 2004  | pages = 164, 166, 181, 183  | isbn = 1-57322-292-5 [/tpl]
On February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Viñoly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, Roland Betts, a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision. On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.
Libeskind's original proposal, which is titled Memory Foundations, underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whom Silverstein hired.http://www.renewnyc.com/plan_des_dev/wtc_site/new_design_plans/Sept_2003_refined_design.asp Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes.  As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding.http://www.wtc.com/news/Silversteins-Army  The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the "swap" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial.http://www.americanlawyer-digital.com/americanlawyer/tal200709/?pg=5  The "swap" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.[tpl]cite news|first=Scott|last=Raab|title=Construction of World Trade Center|publisher=Esquire|date=May 24, 2007[/tpl]

===Towers===

One World Trade Center (previously coined the "Freedom Tower" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Libeskind's design. The building will rise to [tpl]convert|1368|ft|m[/tpl], the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its antenna will rise to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). The antenna's height refers to 1776, the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed.
The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect David Childs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wtc.com/about/freedom-tower|title=Freedom Tower: About the Building|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=Silverstein Properties[/tpl] Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design.[tpl]cite news |title=Libeskind and Silverstein reach an agreement for WTC site |first=Kevin |last=Lerner |magazine=Architectural Record |date=August 2003[/tpl] According to a NY1 article on March 8, 2011, a plan to build a restaurant on top of One World Trade Center (to duplicate the Windows on the World restaurant of old) was scrapped entirely because of potential risk of rising costs to build and maintain the establishment over the benefits of having one at all.[tpl]cite web |url=http://manhattan.ny1.com/content/top_stories/135170/port-authority-scraps-plans-for-one-world-trade-center-restaurant |title=Port Authority Scraps Plans For One World Trade Center Restaurant |work=NY1 |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-08[/tpl] Also, one of the main tenants of this tower to be confirmed is the Condé Nast Publications company, once it officially opens.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/nyregion/conde-nast-to-anchor-1-world-trade-center.html?_r=2&hp |title=Condé Nast Will Be Anchor of 1 World Trade Center |work=The New York Times |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |date=May 17, 2011| accessdate=2011-05-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ny1.com/content/special_reports/911_a_decade_later/139715/9-11-a-decade-later--conde-nast-to-occupy-1-world-trade-center| title=9/11 A Decade Later: Conde Nast To Occupy 1 World Trade Center| work=NY1| first=Bobby| last=Cuza| date=May 25, 2011| accessdate=2011-05-29[/tpl]
British architect Norman Foster designed Tower Two, also known as 200 Greenwich Street. The building's distinctive slanted, diamond-shaped roof echoes Libeskind's original sketches for the building.

The project company also announced that all of the towers will be completed even with the effects of the late 2000s recession at the worst case before 2020.

===Memorial===

A memorial called "Reflecting Absence" honors the victims of the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.ny1.com/content/special_reports/911_a_decade_later/142578/9-11-a-decade-later--the-9-11-memorial-from-all-sides| title=9/11 A Decade Later: The 9/11 Memorial From All Sides| work=NY1| first=Bobby| last=Cuza| date=July 8, 2011| accessdate=2011-07-10[/tpl] The memorial, designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad, consists of a field of trees interrupted by the footprints of the twin towers. Pools of water fill the footprints, underneath which sits a memorial space whose walls bear the names of the victims. The slurry wall, which holds back the Hudson River in the west and was an integral part of Libeskind's proposal, remains exposed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wtcsitememorial.org/fin7.html |title=Reflecting Absence |publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation |year=2004[/tpl]

In early December 2013, Australian retail corporation Westfield announced that it will invest US$800 million for complete control of the retail space at the rebuilt center.

===Criticism of progress===

An episode of CBS's 60 Minutes in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, 1 World Trade Center (previously known as the Freedom Tower)'s having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved.  Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero "is still a hole in the ground". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: "I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6220282.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody|title=Developer: Ground Zero a National Disgrace - 60 Minutes: Eight Years and Billions of Dollars Later, Part of 9/11 Site is Still Just a Big Hole|publisher=CBS News|date=2010-02-18|page=1[/tpl]  However, it was noted that in early 2011, all five office towers of the World Trade Center are under construction with significant progress being made.  All of the towers will be opened between 2012–2016, with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum already completed on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2011.  Criticism of progress and calls for redesigns were mostly made in 2008 and 2009, when progress at the site was clearly not being made.
The social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th Floor, called Windows on the World, and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers.http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/09/wotw.php[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/world-trade-center-observatory-views-photos_n_3001052.html | work=Huffington Post | title=PHOTOS: The Stunning Views Atop One World Trade Center | date=April 2, 2013[/tpl] This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called "Windows on the World Wine School", run by wine personality Kevin Zraly.http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/windows-on-the-world-september-11 Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt,http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20010917/SUB/109170715# the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.[tpl]cite news|journal=Gothamist|date=March 8, 2011|title=WTC Scraps Windows on the World Plan|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php[/tpl]
