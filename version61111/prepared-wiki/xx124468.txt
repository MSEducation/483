==History==

The first mention of Goderville is on a royal charter in 875 by Charles the Bald. It dealt with the value and number of properties belonging to the chapter of Rouen.  The town got its name from the family of Godard of Vaulx, first known lord of the manor. In 1492, they allied themselves by marriage to the Roussel family. In March 1651, Goderville was elevated to a barony by letters patent. 
Until the French revolution, the town was governed as a ‘sergenterie’.  
The market, notable for linen, has existed since the 16th century.  Goderville absorbed the commune of Crétot in 1825.
