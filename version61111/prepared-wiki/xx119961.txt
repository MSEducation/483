CATEGORIES: Co-Bo locomotives, Locomotives by wheel arrangement

Co-Bo or Co′Bo′ is a wheel arrangement in the UIC classification system for railway locomotives. It features two uncoupled bogies. The "Co" bogie has three driven axles and the "Bo" bogie has two. 

==Examples==

===Diesel===

The British Rail Class 28 is the first (and only) UK locomotive with a Co-Bo wheel arrangement. Other examples worldwide include the class DE10 and DE11 diesel-hydraulic locomotives in Japan.

===Steam===

Some Engerth steam locomotives were built to the Fink system, with the four trailing wheels driven by a crankshaft and connecting rods, thus making them 0-6-4-0Ts instead of 0-6-4Ts.
