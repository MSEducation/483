Cracked  is a Scottish comedy drama, which was broadcast on STV. Created and written by Clare Hemphill and Kate Donnelly, the drama series is set in a Scottish countryside residential rehab clinic, a place where people with various mental and emotional problems check themselves in for some professional tender loving care. Over six episodes, the series deals with issues that are difficult and dark, but also more light hearted and comical situations.
Cracked was produced by STV Productions in 2005, but due to the lack of appropriate regional time-slots,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] the series was not broadcast until 2008, where it was shown on Thursday nights at 10:40pm, taking the place of popular comedy-drama High Times.
