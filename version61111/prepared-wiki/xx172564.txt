The leopard chimaera, Chimaera panthera, is a species of fish in the Chimaeridae family endemic to New Zealand. Its natural habitat is open seas. 
It is large chimaeroid endemic to New Zealand waters. It is known from very few specimens from three localised areas at depths of 327 to 1,020 m. May have a wider distribution than is known. Nothing is known of its biology. It is vulnerable to bottom longlines and possibly bottom trawling in the upper part of its depth range but there is little fishing effort throughout most of its known distribution. Not enough information is available to assess the species beyond "Data Deficient".
