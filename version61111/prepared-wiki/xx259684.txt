In 1965–66, as Barça won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Montesinos appeared more in that competition (eight games) than in the domestic league (six). In 1967, he signed for neighbouring CE Sabadell FC where he would remain for the rest of his professional career, his first five seasons being played in the top flight – this included the 1968–69 campaign where he played all the matches and minutes as the team finished in a best-ever fourth position;Muere el ex jugador del CE Sabadell Ramon Montesinos (Former CE Sabadell player Ramon Montesinos dies); Sabadell's official website, 30 December 2010 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] at the time of his retirement, he was the Arlequinats' joint-second player with the most appearances in the category, at 141.
