CATEGORIES: Passports by country, New Zealand law

New Zealand passports (in Māori: Uruwhenua Aotearoa) are issued to New Zealand citizens for the purpose of international travel by the Department of Internal Affairs. New Zealand has a passport possession rate of around 75% of the populationhttp://www.ppt.gc.ca/consultations/apropos/compare.aspx?lang=eng[tpl]Dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] and there are around 1.5 million New Zealand biometric passports in circulation.New Zealand Customs Service: About ePassports
New Zealand participates in the Five Nations Passport Group, an international forum for cooperation between the passport issuing authorities in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to "share best practices and discuss innovations related to the development of passport policies, products and practices".

==History==

In 1948, following the creation of New Zealand citizenship with the passing of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act, the Department of Internal Affairs began issuing New Zealand passports for the first time. Between 1948 and 1977, New Zealand passports bore the words 'New Zealand citizen and British subject'.http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/2/3
Starting on 1 July 1981, the Fraser Government announced that New Zealand citizens could no longer travel to Australia without passports, as it was felt that too many people who were not entitled to travel without passports to Australia were passing themselves off as New Zealanders.http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/anzcerta/documents/02ttta.pdfhttp://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n1/goff.pdf
In 1992, the Department of Internal Affairs started issuing machine-readable passports in New Zealand, whilst New Zealand overseas posts continued to issue manual passports. Since 24 February 1992, children's names have no longer been endorsed in the passports of their parents. In February 1997, the New Zealand High Commission in London began issuing machine readable passports.Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1996-1997
In December 2000, French was removed from the biodata page of the New Zealand passport and replaced with Māori - this change was brought about by the Department of Internal Affairs to reflect the status of Te Reo Māori as an official language of New Zealand and to give "New Zealanders travelling abroad a passport that more accurately reflects their national identity".Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 2000-2001
In 2001, the Department of Internal Affairs took over responsibility for the London Passport Office from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1999-2000
By 2003, only around 4% of all New Zealand passport holders still held a non-machine readable version.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3522762
All passports issued on or after 24 April 2005 - both adult and child - have a maximum validity of five years as a result of the Passports Amendment Act (2005). Passports that were issued prior to this date continue to remain valid until the date of expiry as stated on the biodata page. On the same day, New Zealand passports were no longer endorsed with name changes, which meant that, for example, changing to a married name required applying for a new passport.
On 26 October 2004, New Zealand diplomatic posts stopped issuing manual passports and, on the same day, began issuing short-term machine-readable emergency travel documents for New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently.http://www.nzembassy.com/china/nzers-overseas/nz-documents/issuing-renewing-and-extending-passportshttp://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/c021d9ab485d28b3cc256ab800742a8e/84d6d40ee50f1869cc25719c005fecb9!OpenDocument One of the reasons for reducing the number of non-machine readable passports in circulation was to increase the security of New Zealand passports; another was that, starting on this day, New Zealanders travelling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program were required to enter on a machine readable passport.http://www.nzembassy.com/canada/new-zealanders-overseas/new-zealand-documents/machine-readable-passports From this date onwards, all New Zealand citizens applying for a passport overseas have had to send their application to the Passport Office in New Zealand, Sydney or London. It has also meant that all New Zealand passports issued on or after 26 October 2004 are machine-readable. Remaining non-machine readable New Zealand passports (M series) are still valid and will expire by 25 October 2014 at the latest (only around 2% of New Zealand passport holders still have a non-machine readable version).http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/ad46619e19fa042bcc256a8a0001c7b4/316a11c6cb57d307cc256e1600147a21!OpenDocument
On 4 November 2005, the Department of Internal Affairs began issuing New Zealand biometric passports (EA series).TVNZ: Government introduces e-passport In order to cover the higher costs associated with the production of biometric passports (compared with the previous machine readable passports), the application cost increased from NZ$71 to NZ$150 for adults and from NZ$36 to NZ$80 for children.NZ Herald: Microchips in passports double price
On 23 November 2009, the Department of Internal Affairs launched a new (and the current) version of the biometric passport (LA series), supplied under a contract with the Canadian Bank Note Company at a cost of just under $100 million over five years. One of the motivations for a new passport design was to ensure that it would remain difficult to produce counterfeit New Zealand passports.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0911/S00319.htm Unlike the previous biometric passport, photographs on the biodata page are now laser engraved in black and white for extra security.http://tvnz.co.nz/travel-news/kiwi-passport-gets-makeover-3174084
The Department of Internal Affairs plans to have a new passport design within five years of the last launch (i.e. before November 2014) in order to keep ahead of fraudsters who seek to counterfeit New Zealand passports.

==Entitlement to a passport==

Only New Zealand citizens are entitled to be issued New Zealand passports. Other travel documents are available from the Department of Internal Affairs for New Zealand refugees or residents who are unable to obtain passports from their home countries but need to travel; see New Zealand Refugee Travel Document and New Zealand Certificate of Identity for details.

==Types==

Holders of a diplomatic or official passport must use their regular passport instead if their travel is for private reasons.Ministerial Office Handbook; see

==Obtaining a passport==

===Application procedure===

The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for issuing New Zealand passports. The Department of Internal Affairs issues passports from its offices in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington in New Zealand, as well as overseas offices in Sydney and London. New Zealand embassies, High Commissions and consulates outside of Sydney and London are not able to issue passports, although diplomatic officers may be able to provide application forms and assist in communicating with an issuing office.
Renewals are able to processed for Adults if you still have your current passport and there are no changes to the name. Processing time is 10 working days plus delivery, unless an urgent or call-out service is requested. There are online fees for Australia and UK.

===Urgent travel===

In emergencies, some New Zealand embassies, High Commissions and consulates may be able to issue an Emergency Travel Document with a validity of only one year intended to assist New Zealand citizens who do not have the time to obtain a passport in time to travel. An application for a New Zealand Emergency Travel Document (ETD) costs NZ$350 and includes the fee for a full replacement passport before the expiration of the ETD.Fees and charges - emergency travel documents In countries where there is no New Zealand diplomatic post, New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or been stolen can be issued with an Emergency Travel Document at a cost of £95 by a British foreign mission as long as this has been cleared with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Foreign & Commonwealth Office: The new UK Emergency Passport

===Endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship===

As an alternative to obtaining a New Zealand passport, New Zealand citizens with another nationality and a foreign passport/travel document can apply for an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship from Immigration New Zealand (INZ). The endorsement can either be physically affixed inside the foreign passport/travel document or can be electronically linked in INZ's database to the foreign passport/travel document. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship is valid for the duration of the foreign passport/travel document it is endorsed in or electronically linked to. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship costs NZ$130 for first time applications and NZ$80 for subsequent applications, which means that it is cheaper than obtaining a regular adult New Zealand passport. The fee for the endorsement is completely waived if electronically linked to or affixed inside a passport issued by Austria, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy or Turkey.Immigration New Zealand: Fees Guide (Note that although Japan is listed, in practice in most cases this will not apply as Japan has restrictive rules relating to dual nationality.) Given that the maximum validity of New Zealand passports is 5 years (for both adults and children), an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship may work out to be an even more economic option if affixed inside or linked electronically to a foreign passport/travel document which has a longer validity (e.g. 10 years). It is also easier to obtain an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship than a New Zealand passport overseas, since an endorsement can be issued at INZ offices in Apia, Bangkok, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Nuku’alofa, Pretoria, Shanghai, Singapore, Suva, Sydney and Taipei, whilst New Zealand passports are only issued overseas by the Department of Internal Affairs in Sydney and London.  However, New Zealand citizens with dual/multiple nationality travelling on a passport/travel document issued by another country may be unable to access New Zealand consular assistance whilst overseas and may not be able to enjoy as many visa exemptions. For example, a dual New Zealand and Samoan citizen travelling only on a Samoan passport with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship affixed inside is unable to obtain a Special Category Visa (SCV) upon arrival in Australia and must obtain an Australian visitor visa before travelling, since to obtain an SCV a New Zealand citizen must present a valid New Zealand passport.

===Return travel to New Zealand without a passport===

In general, to establish his/her right to enter New Zealand, a New Zealand citizen is required to present a valid New Zealand passport or a passport issued by another country that is electronically linked or physically affixed with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship.
However, a New Zealand embassy, high commission or consulate or an Immigration New Zealand branch can request that the immigration officer at a port of entry in New Zealand not demand to see a passport of a New Zealand citizen in urgent or compassionate circumstances (e.g. death or serious illness) where there is not enough time for a New Zealand passport to be issued.http://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/i35031.htm

==Physical appearance==

===Cover===

The current version of New Zealand passports issued since November 2009 are black, with the New Zealand coat of arms emblazoned in silver in the centre of the front cover. The words "NEW ZEALAND PASSPORT" and "URUWHENUA AOTEAROA" are inscribed above the coat of arms in silver. The standard biometric symbol appears at the bottom of the front cover. Both the front and back covers have silver ferns embossed on the outside edge.
Regular passports issued prior to November 2009 had a navy blue cover.

===Passport note===

Passports contain a note from the issuing state that is addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that state and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside New Zealand passports states:

==Incidents==

===Israeli spies (2004)===

In 2004, two Israeli intelligence agents working for Mossad, Eli Cara and Uriel Kelman, were convicted and jailed for attempting to obtain New Zealand passports through submitting fraudulent applications. A third suspected Mossad agent, Zev William Barkan, who was a former Israeli diplomat based in Europe was involved in stealing the identity of a tetraplegic Aucklander to obtain a passport fraudulently in his name.http://www.3news.co.nz/NZs-recent-history-with-Israel---overview/tabid/419/articleID/219432/Default.aspx It was not until a year later that the Israeli Government formally apologised to the New Zealand Government for its actions.

===Israeli spies (2011)===

Following the death of an Israeli, Ofer Mizrahi, in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the New Zealand Government investigated whether he and his companions had links to Mossad. There were concerns that the travellers may have been trying to infiltrate the police national computer system to gain access to information which could be used to clone New Zealand passports,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/8649237/Neutral-New-Zealand-passports-highly-prized-by-overseas-intelligence.html
Mizrahi, who died in the earthquake after being crushed by falling masonry in a parked van, was found in possession of more than one foreign passport.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2017071/Christchurch-earthquake-unmasked-team-Israeli-spies-New-Zealand.html His travelling companions, Michal Fraidman, Liron Sade and Guy Jordan, met with Israeli officials and left New Zealand within twelve hours of the earthquake.http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/spy-claims-investigation-found-no-links-4313751 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key four times to enquire about the four Israelis. However, no conclusive evidence could be found to implicate the backpackers.
