[[Leonardo number]]

CATEGORIES: Integer sequences, Fibonacci numbers

The Leonardo numbers are a sequence of numbers given by the recurrence:
Edsger W. DijkstraEWD797 used them as an integral part of his smoothsort algorithm,[tpl]Cite EWD|796a|Smoothsort â€“ an alternative to sorting in situ[/tpl]  and also analyzed them in some detail.EWD796a
Computing a second-order recurrence relation recursively and without memoization requires L(n) computations for the n-th item of the series.

==Relation to Fibonacci numbers==

From this relation it is straightforward to derive a closed-form expression for the Leonardo numbers, analogous to Binet's formula for the Fibonacci numbers:
The first few Leonardo numbers are
