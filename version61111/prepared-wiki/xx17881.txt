Agritourism, as it is defined most broadly, involves any agriculturally based operation or activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch. Agritourism has different definitions in different parts of the world, and sometimes refers specifically to farm stays, as in Italy. Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a corn maze, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a B&B on a farm.

==Agritourism in the United States==

Agritourism is widespread in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ruralbounty.com/ |title=Find a farm, orchard, ranch, winery, csa, & family fun |publisher=Rural Bounty |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04[/tpl] Agritourists can choose from a wide range of activities that include picking fruits and vegetables, riding horses, tasting honey, learning about wine and cheesemaking, or shopping in farm gift shops and farm stands for local and regional produce or hand-crafted gifts.
According the USDA Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service, "Tourism is becoming increasingly important to the U.S. economy. A conservative estimate from the Federal Reserve Board in Kansas, based on 2000 data, shows that basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.6 percent of all U.S. employment. Even more telling, data from the Travel Industry Association of America indicate that 1 out of every 18 people in the U.S. has a job directly resulting from travel expenditures".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/economics/in_focus/small_business_if_tourism.html |title=Rural Tourism February 2008 |publisher=USDA Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service |accessdate= December 30, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/Pdf/3q03wilk.pdf |format=PDF |last=Wilkerson |first=Chad |year=2003 |title=Travel and Tourism: An Overlooked Industry in the U.S. and Tenth District Economic Review, Third Quarter 2003 Federal Reserve Board in Kansas |publisher=Kc.frb.org |accessdate=December 30, 2008[/tpl]"Economic Research: Economic Impact of Travel and Tourism" (2004).

==Public awareness==

People have become more interested in how their food is produced. They want to meet farmers and processors and talk with them about what goes into food production. For many people who visit farms, especially children, the visit marks the first time they see the source of their food, be it a dairy cow, an ear of corn growing in a field, or an apple they can pick right off a tree.[tpl]cite web|title=Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/knowyourfarmer?navid=KNOWYOURFARMER|publisher=USDA|accessdate=2 April 2013[/tpl]
