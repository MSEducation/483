The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA) fellowship panel commented on Samson's work, "The panel saw this applicant's 53 page poem Galilee as an ambitious and serious work, which one panelist described as a "tour de force." This portrait of a time and place told in a narrative, confessional style was compared to Paterson by William Carlos Williams. The panel spoke of the poem's voluptuous language, its heart, emotion, and incredible imagery. They commented that the reader has to make a real commitment to be with this work and, like Dylan Thomas, the writing is very satisfying to read aloud. The writer demonstrates an extraordinarily high level of craftsmanship and panelists could feel the work infested in each line. The panel remarked that this work could have a real presence in the world of poetry."
