HMS ''Ocean'' of the Royal Navy is an amphibious assault ship (or landing platform helicopter) and is the sole member of her class.  She is designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of Commander UK Amphibious Force and Commander UK Landing Force. She was constructed in the mid-1990s by Kvaerner Govan Ltd on the Clyde and fitted out by VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness prior to first of class trials and subsequent acceptance in service.  She was commissioned in September 1998 at her home port HMNB Devonport, Plymouth.

==Background==

An invitation to tender for a new helicopter carrier was issued in February 1992.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Fairhill |title=£500 million to be spent on new assault vessels |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |page=15 |date=1992-02-14 |accessdate=2007-07-27[/tpl] In February 1993 The Times reported that the carrier faced cancellation due to budgetary constraints.[tpl]cite news |first=Michael|last=Evans|title=Spending axe falls on £170m carrier |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=1993-02-03 |accessdate=2007-07-27 [/tpl] However, at approximately the same time, British forces were engaged in operations in the Balkans, which saw the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's aviation training ship RFA Argus pressed into service as an Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH). Argus proved totally unsuitable in terms of accommodation and facilities needed for a large Embarked Military Force (EMF), which emphasised the need for a purpose built platform.[tpl]cite web |url=http://navy-matters.beedall.com/ocean.htm |title=HMS Ocean |accessdate=2008-10-07 |work= |publisher= navy-matters.beedall.com|date=2001-05-07[/tpl] On 29 March 1993 the defence procurement minister announced that development of the new LPH was proceeding.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=White |coauthors=Tighe, Chris |title=MoD revives £170m helicopter carrier plan |work=Financial Times| page=15| date=1993-03-30 |accessdate=2007-07-27[/tpl] Two shipbuilders competed for the contract - Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (VSEL) and Swan Hunter. On 11 May 1993 the government announced VSEL had won the contract.[tpl]cite news |first=Richard |last=Duce|title=Barrow ship order dismays Tyneside |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=1993-05-12 |accessdate=2007-07-27[/tpl] The build was to commercial standards, reducing costs significantly and leading to a construction spend of £154 million (£[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|UK|154000000|1993|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-4[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]),[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl], comparable to that of a Type 23 frigate. VSEL, a warship manufacturer, sub-contracted the build phase to the commercial Kværner yard in Govan, Glasgow.
The fact that VSEL's bid was £71 million lower than Swan Hunter's was the source of political controversy and led to a National Audit Office investigation to determine whether the competition was fair. The report, published on 29 July 1993, stated that although VSEL did subsidise its bid the MoD was right to award the contract to VSEL because the subsidy was much smaller than the difference between the two bids; VSEL's bid was £139.5 million compared to Swan Hunter's £210.6 million. The Times also suggested that the subsidy was as little as £10 million.[tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Tighe |coauthors=Green, Daniel |title=VSEL subsidised Navy ship bid |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |page=7|date=1993-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-27 [/tpl] In anticipation of the report the Financial Times described the different philosophies adopted by the two bidders; While Swan Hunter viewed the ships as entirely military, "VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on." VSEL's decision to sub-contract the build phase took advantage of lower overheads at a civilian yard as well as efficiency drives by its parent, Kværner.[tpl]cite news |first=Daniel |last=Green |title=Strategy to win a sea battle: How a civilian shipyard helped VSEL cut costs and gain a Royal Navy order|work=Financial Times |date=1993-07-21 |accessdate=2007-07-27 [/tpl] The cut-price build to commercial standards means that Ocean has a projected operational life of just 20 years, significantly less than that of other warships.
Launched on 11 October 1995, she was subsequently named at Barrow by Her Majesty the Queen on 20 February 1998, prior to delivery to Devonport. In her sea trial she managed to reach a top speed of [tpl]convert|20.6|kn[/tpl], however her usual top speed is [tpl]convert|18|kn[/tpl] now totally fitted out and with the addition of new equipment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/weapon/2007/dec07_weapon.html.print.html?Status=1 |title=cyberpioneer - Weapon - Ruling over the oceans (Dec 07) |publisher=Mindef.gov.sg |accessdate=2012-12-27[/tpl]

==Role==

Ocean was designed to provide the amphibious assault capabilities last offered by Albion and Bulwark whilst in the Commando role.  She can deploy an Embarked Military Force (EMF) of a Royal Marines Commando Group from 3 Commando Brigade supported by aviation and landing craft assets. The ships company includes 9 Assault Squadron from 1 Assault Group Royal Marines. HMS Ocean is also capable of limited anti-submarine warfare activities, supporting afloat training and acting as a base facility for other embarked forces including counter-terrorism units.
The air group of up to 6 Sea King HC4 medium-lift helicopters, six Lynx AH7 light-lift/anti-tank helicopters are provided by the Commando Helicopter Force, 4-6 Apache AH1 operated by the Army Air Corps and helicopters of the Royal Air Force including the Chinook. Prior to their retirement, Ocean could transport up to 15 fixed wing HarrierBBC News 30 September 1998, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/183577.stm aircraft of Joint Force Harrier in the ferry role, but was unable to operate as a fixed wing aircraft carrier due to her lack of the 'ski jump' that is needed to launch a fully loaded Harrier.
For the 2012 London Olympics she carried an air arm of eight Army Air Corps and Fleet Air Arm Super Lynx helicopters, four from each service, to deploy special forces and conduct other missions in relation to her security role.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/near-miss-as-hms-ocean-squeezes-through-thames-barrier-7715349.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Rob | last=Williams | title=Near miss as HMS Ocean squeezes through Thames Barrier | date=2012-05-04[/tpl]
4 Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs) are permanently embarked and manned by 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines.http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/assault-ships/hms-ocean/ship-s-departments/9-assault-squadron-rm/

==Operational history==

Just weeks after being commissioned, Ocean was undertaking the warm water element of her first-of-class trials when she was deployed on short notice to the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua to provide humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.[tpl]cite news|title=UK Navy saves Nicaraguans|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/212149.stm|date=11 November 1998|publisher=BBC[/tpl] In early 1999 Ocean was scheduled to take part in an exercise in the Atlantic but was diverted to the Mediterranean in readiness for possible deployment to Kosovo.[tpl]cite news|title=UK Navy's biggest ship prepares for action|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/333584.stm|publisher=BBC|date=2 May 1999[/tpl]

On 17 February 2002, a unit of Royal Marines from Ocean accidentally landed in the San Felipe beach in the Spanish town of La Linea instead of Gibraltar causing a minor diplomatic incident as various media outlets labelled the mistake as an "invasion".[tpl]cite news|title=Tell it to the marines... we've invaded the wrong country|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/feb/19/gibraltar.world|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 February 2002[/tpl]
Ocean was part of a large Royal Navy task force deployed for Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, for which she was awarded a new battle honour "Al Faw 2003".[tpl]cite hansard|house=House of Lords|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050609/text/50609-25.htm|date=9 June 2005[/tpl] In the helicopter assault role she was accompanied by Ark Royal.
In the summer of 2006, she was deployed as part of the task force involved in the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States.
In 2007, Ocean began her first long refit period. This was carried out by Devonport Management Limited at their Devonport Royal Dockyard facility and lasted around twelve months, during which period, Ark Royal took over the LPH role. Ocean sailed from Plymouth on Wednesday 24 September 2008 to start sea trials, following this major period of maintenance and upgrading work.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] As part of that upgrade a PyTEC pyrolysising waste recycling unit was fitted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8290130.stm|title=Energy from waste powers US army|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 October 2009 | date=2009-10-05|first=Jason|last=Palmer[/tpl]
On 18 February 2009, Ocean sailed from Devonport as part of the Taurus 09 deployment under Commander UK Amphibious Task Group, Commodore Peter Hudson. She was joined on this deployment by landing platform dock Bulwark, as Hudson's flagship, Type 23 Frigates Argyll and Somerset and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.Royal Navy Website This exercise was filmed for the second series of the Channel 5 documentary Warship.
