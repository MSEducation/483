==Overview==

===Origins and etymology===

[tpl]lang|ga|Tánaiste[/tpl] was originally the Irish word for the heir of the chief ([tpl]lang|ga|taoiseach[/tpl]) or king ([tpl]lang|ga|rí[/tpl]), under the Gaelic system of tanistry. Before independence, the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland or Viceroy was sometimes referred to in the Irish language as [tpl]lang|ga|An Tánaiste-Rí[/tpl], literally 'the deputy king'.

===Modern office===

The office was created in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, replacing the previous office of Vice-President of the Executive Council that had existed under the Free State constitution. This office was first held by Kevin O'Higgins of Cumann na nGaedheal from 1922 to 1927, and then by Ernest Blythe from 1927 to 1932.
The Taoiseach nominates a member of Dáil Éireann,Article 28.7.1° of the Constitution of Ireland. who will also be a member of the government, to the office. The nominee then receives his seal of office from the President of Ireland in recognition of his appointment. The Tánaiste acts in the place of the Taoiseach during his or her temporary absence. In the event of the Taoiseach's death or permanent incapacitation, the Tánaiste acts in his stead until another Taoiseach is appointed.Article 28.6.2° and 28.6.3° of the Constitution of Ireland. http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20IrelandNov2004.pdf The Tánaiste is, ex officio, a member of the Council of State. The Tánaiste chairs meetings of the government in the Taoiseach's absence and may take questions on his behalf in the Dáil or Seanad.
Aside from these duties, the title is largely honorific as the Constitution does not confer any additional powers on the office holder. Under a coalition government the position is commonly held by the leader of the second-largest party who in this situation is free to head any department he or she wants. Recent office-holders, such as Michael McDowell, Mary Harney and Dick Spring, have been leaders of smaller parties. The incumbent, Eamon Gilmore, is the leader of the second largest party in the Dáil as part of a coalition government.
