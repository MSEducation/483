Medisave (Chinese: 保健储蓄) was introduced in April 1984 as a national medical savings system in Singapore.  The system allows Singaporeans to put aside part of their income into a Medisave account to meet future personal or immediate family's hospitalization, day surgery and for certain outpatient expenses.
