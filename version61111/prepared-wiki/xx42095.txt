[[Humpty Doo]]

CATEGORIES: Towns in the Northern Territory

Humpty Doo is a small town in Australia's Northern Territory, situated just south of the Arnhem Highway, approximately 40 km from Darwin. At the 2006 census, Humpty Doo had a population of 5,413. Its local government area is Litchfield Municipality. The town is a popular stopping point for tourists travelling between Darwin and Kakadu National Park, and boasts many attractions of its own. The main industries are agriculture and tourism; however, most residents commute to Darwin or Palmerston for work, and many regard the town more as an outer suburb.
The locality of Humpty Doo is named after the station originally called ‘Umpity Doo’; however, origins of the name are uncertain.  Three derivations have been suggested:

==History==

The Djerimanga (also known as Woolner) people are recognised as the traditional owners and first inhabitants of an area from the present day site of Humpty Doo east into the Adelaide River wetlands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.litchfield.nt.gov.au/index.php?page=aboriginal-people |title=Litchfield Council - Aboriginal People |publisher=Litchfield.nt.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl] Their way of life remained unchanged until first contact with European explorers in the 19th Century, likely during the 1864 expedition led by Boyle Travers Finniss to explore the areas surrounding the Adelaide River.
In September 1869, Surveyor-General of South Australia George Goyder completed work to divide the hinterland surrounding the present day Litchfield Shire into 10sq mi parcels. These parcels were subsequently divided into smaller allotments and made available to settlers as pastoral leases and freehold titles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.litchfield.nt.gov.au/index.php?page=goyder-s-hundreds |title=Litchfield Council - Goyder's Hundreds |publisher=Litchfield.nt.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]
Following the discovery of gold near Pine Creek during the 1880s, the subsequent influx of Chinese miners to the Northern Territory led to a high demand for food crops such as rice. Rice crops planted on the floodplains near Humpty Doo were used to meet this demand with some success."Humpty Doo","The Sydney Morning Herald", Sydney, 8 February 2004 Experiments with other tropical crops including sugar cane, coffee and rubber were attempted, most of these planted in the vicinity of Beatrice Hill to the east of the present day town. Experiments were made with livestock too and it was hoped that the banks of the Adelaide River could be developed to include loading facilities for live cattle export. By 1887, plantations on the floodplains had been abandoned due to the land owners financial difficulties. Despite this, rubber trees and coffee bushes showed particular potential. A single harvest of 10 tons of coffee beans was exported to Melbourne during the short lived experiment.Litchfield Council "Agriculture at Beatrice Hill"
In 1910, the name "Umpity Doo" first appeared to describe buildings and improvements on a survey plan of Agricultural Lease No. 28. This lease was held by Oscar Herbert. Herbert died in 1974 at nearby Koolpinyah.http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=2047 
In 1954, after some experimentation by CSIRO and based on previous successful rice crops, a joint Australia-U.S. company called Territory Rice Ltd. was formed with a plan to irrigate the subcoastal plain of the Adelaide River in order to commercially produce rice. The plan was a complete failure due to several factors, including an invasion of geese, soil that was too saline and an insufficient amount of drainage, all combined with poor management.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Humpty-Doo/2005/02/17/1108500201628.html |title=Travel article in the Age |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl] They gave up the land to the government in 1962. The Rice Project was 20 km east of the present town on part of the Humpty Doo Station where the name "Humpty Doo" was first used. The irrigation dam, called Fogg Dam, is still there and an attraction for bird watching.
Local resident, Neville Skewes opened a small store on Mount Bundey Road (now the Arnhem Highway) in 1967. At this time, there was very little development, with most of the surrounding area being bushland. On 11 September 1971, after being granted a liquor licence, Skewes and his wife Helen opened the Humpty Doo Hotel-Motel. The opening of the Hotel coincided with further improvements to the road east to Kakadu and Arhnem Land, and encouraged further urbanisation of the area around Humpty Doo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.litchfield.nt.gov.au/index.php?page=humpty-doo-hotel |title=Litchfield Council - Humpty Doo Hotel |publisher=Litchfield.nt.gov.au |date=1971-09-11 |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]
The Royal Australian Navy opened a transmitting station, known as the Humpty Doo Transmitting Station in 1982. This replaced a facility at Coonawarra East that was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. The station supports the naval base [tpl]HMAS|Coonawarra[/tpl], located in Darwin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/establishments/hmas-coonawarra |title=HMAS Coonawarra - Royal Australian Navy |publisher=Navy.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]
On 21 July 2007, the town played host to the first of the 'Triple J goes AWOL' concerts, sponsored and organised by the national youth radio station Triple J.

==Climate==

Humpty Doo, like the rest of the outer Darwin area, experiences a tropical savannah climate (Köppen Aw), with two distinct seasons. The wet season is when the highest rainfall occurs and runs from November–December through until April. During these months the area is subject to the effects of monsoon troughs and there is the threat of tropical cyclones. The wet season is characterised by higher average temperatures, high humidity and a greater proportion of rainy days and often associated thunderstorms.
The dry season from May to October brings lower humidity, significantly cooler overnight temperatures and minimal rainfall. It is characterised by sunny days with clear skies. 

==Economy==

The town is known for agriculture experiments that have occurred, including the failed rice crops of the 1950s.
A more successful agricultural experiment was the growing of mangos. Top quality fruit from Humpty Doo is picked earlier than Queensland mangos and fetches a top price in southern markets. 
There is a honey farm located in outer Humpty Doo, Humpty Doo Apiaries.

==Notable residents==

The World Wrestling Entertainment character Ouback Jack—portrayed by Peter Stilsbury between 1986 and 1988—was billed as coming from Humpty Doo. The character was an outback bushman in the vein of Crocodile Dundee. To date he is the only Australian to get a full-time WWE contract.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

==Trivia==

The 9th Fighter Squadron of the 49th Fighter Group attached to the United States' 5th Air Force gained the nickname "Humpty Doo Fighters" while stationed in the area in 1942. The squadron was accommodated in a camp referred to by Lucien Hubbard as Humpty Doo after the cattle station with the same name while acting as a publicity correspondent. The actual campsite location was further south than the township of Humpty Doo, to the east of Noonamah.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flyingknights.net/humptydoo.htm |title=Fighters at Humpty Doo |publisher=Flyingknights.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]
