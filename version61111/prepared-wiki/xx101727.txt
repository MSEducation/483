====Mirror-image phage display====

Phage display is a technique to screen large libraries of peptides for binding to a target protein.  In phage display,
the DNA sequence that codes the potential drug-peptide is fusioned to the gene of the protein coat of bacteriophages and introduced into a vector.  Diversity can be introduced to the peptide by mutagenesis.  The protein coats peptides are 
then expressed and purified, and applied to a surface of immobilized protein targets.  The surface is then washed away to remove non-binding 
peptides, while the remaining binding peptides are eluted.

Mirror-image phage display is a similar method that can be used to screen large libraries of D-peptides that bind to target L-proteins.  More precisely,
since D-peptides can not be expressed in bacteriophages, mirror-image phage display screens L-peptides that bind to immobilized D-proteins that are 
previously chemically synthesized.  Because of the mirror properties of D-peptides, the D-enantiomer of an L-peptide that binds to a D-protein 
will bind to the L-protein.
Mirror-image phage display, however, has two disadvantages when compared to phage display.  
Target D-proteins must be chemically synthesized, which is normally an expensive and time consuming process.  Also, 
the target protein must not require a cofactor or a chaperone to fold, otherwise the chemically synthesized D-protein
will not fold to the target, mirror structure.
