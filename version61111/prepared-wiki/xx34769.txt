[[Variable bitrate]]

CATEGORIES: Codecs, Data transmission

Variable bitrate (VBR) is a term used in telecommunications and computing that relates to the bitrate used in sound or video encoding.  As opposed to constant bitrate (CBR), VBR files vary the amount of output data per time segment.  VBR allows a higher bitrate (and therefore requires more storage space) to be allocated to the more complex segments of media files while less space is allocated to less complex segments.  The average of these rates can be calculated to produce an average bitrate for the file.
MP3, Opus, WMA, Vorbis, and AAC audio files can optionally be encoded in VBR.[ref]
