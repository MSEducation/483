Giordano had an astonishing facility, which often lead to an impression of superficiality of his works. He left many works in Rome, and far more in Naples. Of the latter, his Christ expelling the Traders from the Temple in the church of the Padri Girolamini, a colossal work, full of expressive "lazzaroni" or beggars from Naples; also the frescoes of the Triumph of Judith at [[Certosa di San Martino|San 
Martino]]http://www.wga.hu/html/g/giordano/triumph.html, and those in the Tesoro della Certosa, including the subject of Moses and the Brazen Serpent; and the cupola paintings in the Church of Santa Brigida. This church contains the artist's own tomb. Other notable examples are the Judgment of Paris in the Berlin Museum, and Christ with the Doctors in the Temple, in the Corsini Gallery of Rome. In later years, he painted influential frescoes for the Cappella Corsini, the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi and other works.
Giordano died in Naples in 1705.

==Influence==

His best pupil in painting was Paolo de Matteis. However, his influence, like his travels and career, were broad and prolific. For example, he is said to have influenced in Venice, Giovan Battista Langetti, Giovanni Coli, and Filippo Gherardi.R. Wittkower pages 346, 348. Other pupils included Juan Antonio Boujas, Nunzio Ferraiuoli (Nunzio degli Afflitti), Ansel Fiammingo (il Franceschitto), Giovanni Battista Lama, Andrea Miglionico, Giuseppe Simonelli, Andrea Vicenti, Andrea Viso,J. R. Hobbes, page 104-105.

As a young  man, Giordano engraved works with considerable skill some of his own  paintings, such as the Slaughter of the Priests of Baal. He also painted much on the crystal borderings of looking-glasses, cabinets and others seen in many Italian palaces, and was, in this form of art, the master of Pietro Garofalo.[tpl]Cite EB1911|title=Luca Giordano[/tpl]

==Critical reputation==

Giordano has been criticized as being a prolific trader of all styles, and master of none. Michael Levey remarks of him "Giordano was the ideal rococo painter, speedy, prolific, dazzling in colour, assured in draughtsmanship, ever-talented and never touching the fringe of genius."Levey, Micheal. Rococo to Revolution: MajorTrends in Eighteenth-Century Painting, 1985:24. He has been viewed as a proto-Tiepolo, reanimating that grand  manner of Cortona in a style that would brighten with Tiepolo.
