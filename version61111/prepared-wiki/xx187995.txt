[[I Believe in You (Paul Haig song)]]

CATEGORIES: Paul Haig songs

"I Believe in You" was the first single from Paul Haig's proposed second album on Circa Records, Right on Line.  Ultimately, the lack of success with this single and its follow-up, "Flight X", persuaded Circa to drop Haig and shelve the album.  This was a real shame[tpl]Says who|date=May 2011[/tpl] as Right on Line contained some pin-sharp tracks and had producer credits including James Locke (of The Chimes), Lil Louis and Mantronik.
The album did eventually surface three years later on Les Disques Du Crepuscule, retitled as Coincidence vs Fate.  LTM re-released a remastered version of the album, with a raft of extra tracks in 2003.
