Shawn Fanning (born November 22, 1980) is an American computer programmer, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor. He  developed Napster, one of the first popular peer-to-peer ("P2P") file sharing platforms, in 1998. The popularity of Napster was widespread and Fanning was featured on the cover of Time magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20001002,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Shawn Fanning - Oct. 2, 2000|publisher=TIME magazine|accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]
The site in its initial free P2P incarnation was shut down in 2001 after the company's unsuccessful appeal of court orders arising from its encouraging the illegal sharing of copyrighted material. A paid subscription version of the site followed, and was purchased by Rhapsody on December 1, 2011.  Following his involvement with Napster, he joined, and invested in, a number of early-stage technology startup companies.

==Early life==

Fanning was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, the son of Coleen Fanning and Joe Rando.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/napster-inc-history/ He then moved to Harwich, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, and graduated from Harwich High School in 1998. During his time in high school and after he graduated, he spent most of his time at his uncle's oceanside Internet business called Chess.net, overlooking Nantasket Beach in Hull, Massachusetts. He spent summers with his uncle in Hull, sleeping on his couch, and spent much of his time experimenting and programming computers in his free time, which eventually led to his development of Napster. During his childhood and adolescence, Shawn had lived in tough, blue-collar, urban towns like Rockland, Massachusetts and Brockton, Massachusetts before moving to the more quiet and small oceanside town of Harwich.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
After graduation, Fanning attended Northeastern University on scholarship. Fanning quickly learned that he already knew all of the material being taught to him in classes and was even placed in higher classes he was not qualified to be in. Even then, Fanning became frustrated because he had already learned all the material being taught to him by professors and tutors and eventually dropped out of Northeastern in 1999. During this time at Northeastern, Shawn had begun the developmental stages of Napster and word had spread fast at Northeastern of his invention. Fanning dropped out of college to dedicate his full-time to the Napster program.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Computer career==

===Napster===

On June 1, 1999, Fanning released a preliminary beta program of Napster and soon, hundreds of college students at Northeastern were up and trading music furiously. Soon after he uploaded the beta program of Napster, Shawn moved his company from his headquarters in Hull, Massachusetts to a more spacious location in San Mateo, California and hired additional workers to improve on the Napster Program.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Snocap===

In 2002, Fanning was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=251 |title=2002 Young Innovators Under 35: Shawn Fanning, 21 |publisher=Technology Review | year=2002 | accessdate=August 14, 2011[/tpl] In 2003, he opened a new company, Snocap, along with Jordan Mendelson (Napster's Chief Architect), and Ron Conway. The company aspired to be a legitimate marketplace for digital media. However, their partners and the public did not respond well. Customer support was poor, and technical issues were numerous. One of their primary partners, CD Baby, wrote a scathing account of their relationship.[tpl]cite news|publisher=CD Baby|url=http://cdbaby.org/stories/07/10/19/0126457.html|date=2007-10-19| title=What happened with CD Baby and Snocap[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=Penny Distribution|url=http://pennydistribution.wordpress.com/2007/12/18/the-rise-fall-of-snocap-what-did-we-learn/|date=2007-12-18| title=The Rise & Fall of Snocap – What Did We Learn?[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] In late 2007, Snocap laid off 60% of its workforce. ValleyWag wrote an article that Fanning had long left Snocap and began to work on another venture, Rupture. The ValleyWag article stated that the failure was largely due to Snocap's CEO Rusty Rueff and that of former CTO Dave Rowley, who "made a mess of engineering before he was fired".[tpl]cite news|publisher=ValleyWag|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/310362/shawn-fanning-leaves-his-snocap-baby-an-orphan|title=Shawn Fanning leaves his Snocap baby an orphan[/tpl] Snocap was looking to sell itself and fast.[tpl]cite news|publisher=CNET News|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9796327-7.html|date=2007-10-11| title=Shawn Fanning's Snocap lays off 60 percent of workforce|author=Greg Sandoval[/tpl]  In 2008, they found a buyer; imeem acquired Snocap in a fire sale.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The New York Times|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/shawn-fannings-snocap-prepares-for-fire-sale/|date=2007-10-12|title=Shawn Fanning’s Snocap Prepares for Fire Sale | first=Saul | last=Hansell[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Orlowski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/07/imeem_acquires_snocap/ |title=Right idea, wrong time: Snocap's corpse washes up at Imeem |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2012-08-21[/tpl]
