Tele Rebelde is Cuba's second national television network, founded in 1968.

==History==

Tele Rebelde signed on July 22, 1968, in the city of Santiago de Cuba. It broadcast its signal to the Oriente province and aimed to reflect the region in which it was based. It broadcast a wide variety of programs for six hours a day from Monday through Saturday and on Sunday afternoons.
In 1979, Tele Rebelde from Santiago de Cuba and channel 2 in Havana were combined; the new network retained most of the programming and the name of the Santiago de Cuba station while also opening a new studio facility.

==Programming==

Tele Rebelde's programming includes popular shows imported from the United States and sports programming. Output also includes the morning news program Buenos DÃ­as, telenovelas and telecourses aimed at high school students.
Tele Rebelde's sports output includes the rights to the World Cup, Olympic Games and Paralympic Games; during these events, Tele Rebelde goes from its normal 16-hour day to a 24-hour schedule. Other sports featured on the channel are the Cuban National Series of baseball, basketball (in the Vale 3 series) and other international soccer action.
