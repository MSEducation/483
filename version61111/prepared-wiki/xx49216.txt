==Biography==

Murray was born in Oakland, California, USA.  He was initially influenced by  free jazz musicians such as  Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp. He gradually evolved a more diverse style in his playing and compositions. Murray set himself apart from most tenor players of his generation by not taking John Coltrane as his model, choosing instead to incorporate elements of mainstream players Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Paul Gonsalves into his mature style.[tpl] cite news | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFD8123BF934A15753C1A964948260 | title = The Pop Life; David Murray Comes Into His Own | author = Robert Palmer | date = October 27, 1982 | accessdate= 2006-06-29 | publisher= New York Times [/tpl]  Despite this, he recorded a tribute to Coltrane, Octet Plays Trane, in 1999. He played a set with the Grateful Dead at a show on September 22, 1993, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His 1996 tribute to the Grateful Dead, Dark Star, was also critically well received.[tpl] cite web | url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/dm-dark.html | title = Dark Star: The Music of the Grateful Dead | author = John Metzger | accessdate= 2006-06-29 | publisher = The Music Box Online [/tpl]
