CATEGORIES: Villages in the Vale of Glamorgan

Aberthaw ([tpl]lang-cy|Aberddawan[/tpl]) is an area consisting of the villages of East Aberthaw and West Aberthaw and Aberthaw Cement Works, Aberthaw Lime Works, and Aberthaw Power Station, a coal power station plant that was linked to the South Wales Valleys via railway in nearby Fontygary on the coast of South Wales. It is located historically within the parish of Penmark in the Vale of Glamorgan, west of Barry. The two villages of West and East Aberthaw are separated by the River Thaw. The village of East Aberthaw, near Rhoose, has a notable pub and local church. 

==Geography==

Aberthaw is nearly opposite to Minehead in Somerset, England. The village of East Aberthaw is situated approximately [tpl]convert|0.25|mi[/tpl] inland from the sea.  The River Thaw, a stream which meets the sea at Aberthaw is very small, and as its current has not created a channel, there is instead a swamp.[tpl]cite book|last1=Ayton|first1=Richard|last2=Daniell|first2=William|title=A voyage round Great-Britain, undertaken in the summer of 1813 ... with a series of views ... engraved by William Daniell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c1VJAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57|accessdate=18 April 2012|year=1814|publisher=Longmann|pages=57–[/tpl] From Dunraven to Aberthaw, the coastal cliffs feature blue and brown argillaceous limestones, shales, and marls. As far as East Aberthaw, the cliffs are under [tpl]convert|100|ft[/tpl], and in some places not more than [tpl]convert|50|ft[/tpl]. For a short distance east of Pleasant Harbour in East Aberthaw, there are wooded cliffs about 300 yards from the high-water mark of ordinary tides. West of the port of Aberthaw there is an expanse of alluvial ground protected by embankments. This is bordered by hillocks of blown sand, and these rise about [tpl]convert|20|ft[/tpl] above the shingle beach. Bordering the blown sand, there is a ridge of thick shingle, and beyond this, between tide-marks, is an expanse of shingle on mud. There are no cliffs to the west of Aberthaw until Summerhouse Point.[tpl]cite book|author=British Association for the Advancement of Science. Meeting|title=Report of the ...

The beach in front of the power station, The Leys, is near Gileston and West Aberthaw; it is well known for its sea fishing.World Sea Fishing article The East Aberthaw Coast Conservation Area covers the whole of the East Aberthaw village and contains a lagoon on The Leys. Breaksea Point, at the edge of Limpert Bay at Aberthaw, is the southernmost point of Wales, although contested with Rhoose Point.

==History==

===Ancient to medieval times===

Aberthaw derives its name from the Welsh word ‘aber’, meaning estuary or river mouth, of the river Thaw. The existence of a safe, natural harbour provided an early impetus for the area's development and trade.[tpl]cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:n4F_vLS90GwJ:www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/idoc.ashx?docid%3D87f638de-a728-4a89-91b5-02734cddeea8%26version%3D-1+listed+buildings+Marsh+House+aberthaw&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESj11_mnRx3fGKy3QoyVSJy_uZQPOaQCPYr1kTYGRkbV4Bl6gi-raMnSp2yDF1EZrtW67EWi_hlAXGR1Ml-dYqfU8823czLRf4ZzrxatYz0-J2K2CCF6tcME7Y2wkAO7cYpomM_c&sig=AHIEtbRbBaVlF_MKaeGLzFJyt4S_xrl53w|title=East Aberthaw Conservation Area Draft Appraisal|publisher=Vale of Glamorgan County Council|accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl] There were settlements in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, substantiated by Roman pottery, shells and tiles that were discovered when a new pipeline was laid through East Aberthaw in the 1950s.[tpl]cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Glamorgan: Pre-Norman. pt.1.

The Shrunken Village at West Aberthaw, considered an Ancient Monument in Glamorgan, consisted of a shrunken hamlet within a narrow strip of St. Athan parish which extended to the Bristol Channel.[tpl]cite book|author=Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Glamorgan: The iron age and Roman occupation. pt. 3.

A small village centred around the intersection of two roads had developed by the medieval period. To the east, what is now Port Road led towards Fonmon and Penmark, whilst to the west, the present Well Road (previously known as Marshe Way) led towards the marshland and a ford across the estuary. The road leading north- south connected the coast with the settlements inland, and as Aberthaw trade flourished, the roads were used for moving imported goods to the markets at St. Athan and Cowbridge.
Of the buildings grouped around the crossroads, the original fabric of Lower Farm House and the once- thatched Rose Cottage and Marsh Cottages can all be dated to the medieval era. The Blue Anchor Inn is likewise of medieval origin, and appears to have been erected in 1380.[tpl]cite book|title=The Commercial Motor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PiIjAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=February 1966|publisher=Temple Press Ltd.|page=51[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Davies|first=John|title=Chester to Chepstow|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rNUIcZAWDSgC&pg=PA188|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=August 2007|publisher=Pneuma Springs Publishing|isbn=978-1-905809-25-7|page=188[/tpl] The village, which came within the parish of Penmark,[tpl]cite book|title=Bradshaw's railway manual, shareholders' guide and official directory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bnjXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1893|publisher=Henry Blacklock & Co.|page=66[/tpl] is also known to have included a small chapel which was possibly located towards the south of the settlement, as suggested by the marking of ‘Chapplefeld’ on the Evans Mouse map of 1622. This was to serve as a place of worship until being converted to a house at the turn of the 17th century.

===1500-1800===

In the 16th century, the Aberthaw port, situated to the south east of the village proper, had emerged as a small but thriving harbour.[tpl]cite book|title=Cylchgrawn Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru: The National Library of Wales journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nWcaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1960|publisher=Council of the National Library of Wales|page=347[/tpl] The ships took wool and foodstuffs from Wales and returned with wine, salt, dried fruit and leather from the towns of northern France. Aberthaw port's importance was furthered by the loss of Porthkerry harbour to a 1584 storm, rendering Aberthaw the principal calling- point within South Wales between Cardiff and Swansea. 
By the first half of the 17th century, boats were departing for not only England and France, but also Spain and Ireland. A similarly flourishing trade with the West Indies, chiefly in sugar and tobacco, did not, however, survive the disruption caused by the outbreak of the English Civil War. Within the context of the village, the port played a significant role in the livelihoods of many residents in the 17th century, though not always in a legal manner: smuggling was rife within the Bristol Channel. Buildings such as the fortified Marsh House, built just to the west of the village in 1636, appear to have been used for storage of illegally imported goods, especially tobacco.[tpl]cite book|author=Cambrian Archaeological Association|title=Archaeologia cambrensis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-EBsAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=W. Pickering|pages=127–34[/tpl] During the reign of George II, the Master of Fonmon sent soldiers to Aberthaw to try and capture the ringleaders of the smuggling gang.[tpl]cite book|last=Rhys|first=Ernest|title=The South Wales coast from Chepstow to Aberystwyth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PTgGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1911|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|page=97[/tpl] Beyond the business of the harbour, agriculture was also of central importance to the settlement, the land to the east of the village, between East Aberthaw and Fonmon, being marked by windmills and orchards.[tpl]cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Walter|author2=B|title=General view of the agriculture and domestic economy of South Wales|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MxJLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1815|publisher=Board of Agriculture (Great Britain), Sherwood, Neely & Jones|page=10[/tpl] To the west, the marsh lands were suitable for grazing.

===1800-present===

Aberthaw's maritime trade continued throughout the 18th century, but by the 1840s, its role as a port declined: the harbour ‘is resorted to by a few coasting-vessels of inferior burthen’, as the Topographical Dictionary of Wales in 1849 reported. In 1851, Aberthaw had a population of 495 people.[tpl]cite book|last=Knight|first=Charles|title=Geography: or, First division of "The English encyclopædia"|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kwhQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT8|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1867|publisher=Bradbury, Evans & Co.|page=8[/tpl] The principle material then being exported, however, was the local lias limestone, called Aberthaw tarras, which was used to make hydraulic lime, which sets under water and was therefore very useful for building light houses (including the Eddystone Lighthouse) and canal locks. This limestone, considered to be of high quality,[tpl]cite book|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IsU_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PT42|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1833|publisher=S. Lewis|page=42[/tpl] was to play a key role in the local economy during the ensuing years, beginning with the opening of Aberthaw Lime Works in January 1888.[tpl]cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Richard|title=The Entrepreneurial Society of the Rhondda Valleys 1840-1920: Power and Influence in the Porth-Pontypridd Region|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1LsqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=30 September 2010|publisher=University of Wales Press|page=177[/tpl] From December 1897, the area was served by the newly constructed Vale of Glamorgan Railway,[tpl]cite book|title=The Railway Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V8bNAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=January 1923|publisher=IPC Business Press|page=448[/tpl] and a second plant, the Aberthaw and Bristol Channel Portland Cement Works, began production to the north of the village in 1916.[tpl]cite book|title=The Statist: a journal of practical finance and trade|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CGJOAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1919|publisher=Published at "The Statist" Office|page=187[/tpl] Today, the Vale of Glamorgan line remains open. This provides a link to the power station and cement works, and has recently been reopened for passenger traffic.
The establishment of these industries in close proximity to Aberthaw was to result in an increased demand for residential accommodation, and by 1919, two new communities had been added at the northern and southern edges of the village. The community, by this time, had gained a Methodist Chapel and a Mission Room,[tpl]cite book|author=National Library of Wales|title=Cylchgrawn Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru: The National Library of Wales journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=umYaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1956|publisher=Council of the National Library of Wales|page=222[/tpl] the latter erected in an Arts and Crafts style on Station Road. Services such as a post office and village shop were also established.
In 1966, Aberthaw Power Station opened, which saw the Thaw river diverted and the remnants of the old port effectively diminished.[tpl]cite book|author=Great Britain. National Coal Board|title=Report and Accounts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7z8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|year=1975|publisher=H.M.S.O.|page=8[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Civil Engineering and Public Works Review|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2cFEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=July 1963|publisher=Lomax, Erskine & Company Ltd.|page=3[/tpl] Beyond the conversion of the former mission hall and a number of former agricultural buildings to residential use, East Aberthaw itself, however, has undergone little development.

==Notable landmarks==

The principal building is the popular Grade II* listed Blue Anchor Inn, a long low building with walls and low timber beams dated to 1380, with a thatched roof.[tpl]cite book|last=Aird|first=Alisdair|title=Good Guide to Dog Friendly Pubs, Hotels and B&Bs, 4th Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sZ3dFXRENqEC&pg=PA367|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=16 March 2009|publisher=Random House UK|isbn=978-0-09-192692-2|page=368[/tpl] The inn was used as a tobacco drying shed during the smuggling days. The inn caught fire in 1922, 2004, and again in 2009, the last fire burning about 30% of the thatched roof.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7985050.stm|title=Historic inn struck by fire again|publisher=BBC News|date=6 April 2009|accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl]  
Close by is the Grade II listed Marsh House, an 18th century building with a symmetrical front and a slated catslide roof. The house was of major importance to local trade and smuggling operations, used as a storehouse, especially for tobacco. The Granary is a Grade II listed building dated to the early 19th century and includes stables, a hayloft and granary. The building is now used as a private residence. Also listed is 1 and 2 Marsh Cottage and The Haven. Several other unlisted cottages and houses are of note, such as Upper House Farm within the Conservation Area, and several converted barns. St Athan Boys' Village was a holiday camp located in West Aberthaw, which operated from 1925 through 1991.

==Transport==

Originally a station on the Barry Railway, and a junction for its connection to the Cowbridge and Aberthaw railway,Website the station closed together with the rest of the line to passengers in the early 1980s. Although the line reopened to passengers in 2002, Aberthaw remains closed except for its signal box, which controls access to Aberthaw Power Station. One kilometre to the north is the B4265 road which connects Barry to Bridgend, via Llantwit Major and St Brides Major. Cardiff Airport is just three kilometres to the north east. From the crossroads, a lane (Well Road) drops down the hill to a tunnel underneath the railway lines. To the east, a similarly narrow lane leads up the slight hill to a farm group (Upper House Farm) and then into open countryside and woodland, beyond which, is the very large limestone quarry.
