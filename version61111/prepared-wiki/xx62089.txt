The lake formed a focal point of the 1814 celebrations which marked a century of Hanoverian rule and re-enacted the British victory at Trafalgar nine years previously,[tpl]cite web|title=Glorious Peace|url=http://www.georgianindex.net/G_peace/GJulbile.html|publisher=Georgian Index|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] and of the 1851 Great Exhibition, with the Crystal Palace standing on its southern shore. Following the introduction of more stringent regulations to protect the environment in the park, the relocation of the Crystal Palace, and the construction of the nearby Albertopolis complex of museums and exhibitions, large-scale events ceased to take place on the banks of the Serpentine. However, it was the location for the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations, and a venue for the 2012 Olympics.[ref]

In the 1820s, the park was extensively redesigned by Decimus Burton. At the same time, John Rennie built the Serpentine Bridge to carry the newly built West Carriage Drive along the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, dividing the lake into the Serpentine (east) and the Long Water (west).
In 2011, The Royal Park embarked on the restoration of The Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water and the quality of the aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lakes remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 – June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012. The restoration project was always about the long term, and the measures are designed to ensure The Serpentine remains a high quality feature within Hyde Park.

==Recreation==

===Swimming===

A rectangular swimming area on the southern bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned off from the rest of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants of the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.[tpl]cite web | title=Serpentine Swimming Club | url=http://www.serpentineswimmingclub.com/[/tpl]
The Serpentine was used as the venue for the swimming portion of the triathlon and for the marathon swimming events at the 2012 Olympic Games.

===Peter Pan Cup===

Since 1864, the Serpentine has hosted a 100-yard (91.4 m) swimming competition every Christmas morning at 9 am. In 1904, author J. M. Barrie awarded the Peter Pan Cup to the winner of the race, a tradition which has continued ever since. Owing to the hazards of swimming in freezing water, the race is open only to members of the Serpentine Swimming Club.[tpl]cite web |title =The Peter Pan Cup Christmas Morning Handicap Swim |publisher=Serpentine Swimming Club |url=http://www.serpentineswimmingclub.com/christmas_day_race.htm |accessdate=5 September 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070813052925/http://www.serpentineswimmingclub.com/christmas_day_race.htm |archivedate=13 August 2007[/tpl]

===Boating===

Rowing boats are available for hire. In 2002 the Serpentine hosted the World Rowing Sprints, in which several international crews raced over 547 yards (500 m).[tpl]cite web |title=Serpentine Boating Lake, London |url=http://www.tourist-information-uk.com/serpentine-boating-lake.htm |publisher=Tourist Information UK |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]

===Solarshuttle===

In the summer months, the Solarshuttle solar powered boat ferries passengers between the northern and southern banks of the Serpentine. At 48 feet (14 m) long and carrying 42 passengers, it is the largest wholly solar-powered passenger boat operating in the UK.[ref]

==Landmarks==

London's Holocaust Memorial is situated at the eastern end of the Serpentine, immediately beyond the dam. A memorial on the northern shore of the lake was erected by Norwegian seamen in 1978 in thanks for the safe haven they were given in Britain after their country surrendered to the Germans in 1940, during the Second World War.[tpl]sfn|Baker|2002|p=68[/tpl]
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is sited on the southern shore of the Serpentine near West Carriage Drive. Although it was beset by early problems and had to be closed for a month three weeks after it opened, it has become one of the UK's most popular attractions, with 800,000 visitors a year.[tpl]cite web |title=Diana fountain 'poorly managed' |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4826020.stm |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] The Serpentine Gallery nearby is also on the south bank.[tpl]cite web |title=Queen unveils new Diana fountain |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3866863.stm |date=6 July 2004 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
On the northern side of the lake, opposite The Lido, is a grass amphitheatre known as The Cockpit. A disused gravel pit,[tpl]cite web |title=The Cockpit |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=903324&sort=4&search=all&criteria=cheesecake%20house&rational=q&recordsperpage=10 |publisher=PastScape |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl] it was the scene of the The Rolling Stones' "Stones in the Park" concert in 1969. This area can also be seen in the 1953 film Genevieve, as the starting point for the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.[tpl]cite web |title=The Park is the star |url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/about-hyde-park/the-park-is-the-star |publisher=The Royal Parks |accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl]
