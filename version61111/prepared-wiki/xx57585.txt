Monoenergism ([tpl]lang-el|μονοενεργητισμός[/tpl]) is a Christian heresy related to and often paired with Monophysitism.
In the 7th century, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius attempted to solve the schism between Chalcedonians and Monophysites, and suggested the compromise of Monoenergism. This compromise adopted the Chalcedonian belief that Christ had two natures, but tried to address Monophysite misgivings by the view that Christ had one "energy" (energeia), a term whose definition was left deliberately vague. Monoenergism was accepted by the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, as well as by the Armenians and was not criticized by Pope Honorius I. However, the strong opposition of Patriarch Sophronius of Jerusalem won wide support. This led Heraclius to abandon the teaching in 638 and to attempt to enforce instead the doctrine of Monothelitism. This too failed to solve the schism.
Both Monoenergism as well as Monotheletism were condemned as heresies by the Sixth Ecumenical Council, held in Constantinople in 680.
