Martin Dillon (b. Portsmouth, Ohio, June 17, 1957 - d. Randolph, Vermont August 21, 2005) was a United States born musician, operatic tenor, and professor of music at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
Dillon was very successfully active in attempting to revive German-Jewish composer and pianist, Robert Kahn's lost music. His efforts were internationally recognised by the musical and academic community. He made two acclaimed recordings dedicated to Kahn's music, Jungbrunnen (Fountain of Youth) and Der Liebe Macht (The Power of Love). Both recordings were world premiers. Dillon died before the recording of the third CD which was near completion.
Dillon was a world renowned lyric tenor and musician who had performed several times at the Carnegie Hall in New York. He performed over 40 roles in the United States, Europe and Asia.
He was given the title of Honorary Captain of Police by the New Jersey Police Department in 2001 for his service to the community.
Dillon died about 12 hours after his August 20, 2005 concert at the Central Vermont Chamber Music Festival, unexpectedly, due to cardiac arrest. 
He is survived by his domestic partner, parents, two brothers and a sister.
