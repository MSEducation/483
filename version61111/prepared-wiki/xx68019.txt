The Eight Principles of ''Yong ([tpl]zh|c=永字八法|p=Yǒngzì Bā Fǎ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ja|永字八法/えいじはっぽう[/tpl], eiji happō; [tpl]lang-ko|영자팔법[/tpl], Yeongjapalbeop''; [tpl]lang-vi|Vĩnh Tự Bát Pháp/Tám Phương Pháp viết Chữ Vĩnh[/tpl]) explain how to write eight common strokes in regular script which are found all in the one character, [tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|永[/tpl][/tpl] ([tpl]zh|p=yǒng[/tpl], "forever", "permanence"). It was traditionally believed that the frequent practice of these principles as a beginning calligrapher could ensure beauty in one's writing.
The Eight Principles are influenced by the earlier Seven Powers ([tpl]lang|zh|七勢[/tpl])  by Lady Wei Shuo ([tpl]lang|zh|衛鑠[/tpl]) of Eastern Jin. Publications on the Principles include:
