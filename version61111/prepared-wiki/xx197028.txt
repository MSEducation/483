Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients is a computer game developed by Angelsoft released by Mindscape in 1987, for the Apple II and PC DOS computer platforms.
Based on the Indiana Jones series, this is a text adventure game that is not based on any of the films; it is rather a whole new adventure, which in terms of the franchise's storyline, takes place in 1932. As in other text adventures, the player must type the action he wants to execute when prompted, in order to advance the storyline.
The storyline involves the eponymous character traveling to the Mexican jungle and explore the Tepotzteco Pyramid, with the purpose of getting the Mazatec Power Key before the Nazi forces, under the command of Plebinheim, get to it first.
