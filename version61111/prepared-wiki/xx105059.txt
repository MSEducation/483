[[Sci-Fi SKANE]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish musical groups

Sci-Fi SKANE is a musical collaboration of Swedish musicians Thomas Öberg and Jonas Jonasson, members of Swedish rock groups bob hund and Bergman Rock.
 Sci-Fi SKANE was started in 2005, and the goal was stated as being to "create stupidity and dance". 
The word SKANE in the name is regarded as an ironic anglification of Skåne, the area the band originates from.
Sci-fi SKANE's musical style is of the same nature as bob hund's and Bergman Rock's style, but without live drums, and dominated by keyboards and programmed sounds. However, the somewhat ironic tone known from bob hund and Bergman Rock is present both in the music and in the lyrics.
So far Sci-Fi SKANE has released two singles: a cover of Canned Heat's "Going Up The Country" called "Jag har aldrig bott vid en landsväg" and another song called "Vi kommer försent till bluesen". 
The duo's debut album Känslan av att jorden krymper växer (roughly translated: The feeling that the Earth is shrinking is growing/increases) was to be released in Sweden by Silence Records on November 16, 2005, but due to errors in the printing of its phosphorescent cover, the release was delayed.
