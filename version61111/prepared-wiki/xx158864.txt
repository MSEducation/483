==Plot==

9-year-old Eva Gregory longs for a pet to call her own, but her mother Amy does not think she is responsible enough, and her stepfather Tom is allergic to fur. She cannot keep the pet at her father Peter's house because he is a pilot and travels a lot.
One day, a Capuchin monkey runs away from his drunken master, gypsy thief Azro, who blames him for his domestic woes. He meets Eva in the park, and she names him Dodger. At home, she finds that keeping him a secret is trouble. She only allows her little half-brother Jack, who cannot speak yet, into her room with him.
At a grocery store, Dodger steals food and hides it in Eva's backpack but she returns it. When she returns home, she discovers he has also stolen golden jewelry and wallets. So she teaches him not to steal.
Azro (who has been looking for him all this time) kidnaps him at a pet shop where Eva had left him while she was at school. He discovers that he does not steal anymore. Angry, he confronts Eva while Amy, Peter, Tom, and his fellow police officers look for her. Dodger saves her and Azro is arrested by Tom. Azro's son Mark tries taking him back but fails. He ends up living with Eva, after she shows her mother that she is responsible and her stepfather discovers that he is not allergic to the fur of monkeys.
