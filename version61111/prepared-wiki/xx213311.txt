[[Water treader]]

CATEGORIES: Gerromorpha

Water treaders, the superfamily Mesovelioidea are insects in the order Hemiptera, the true bugs. They are semi-aquatic insects that live in moist and wet habitat and on wet plant matter in several types of aquatic habitat.Yang, C. M. and D. H. Murphy. (2011). Guide to the aquatic Heteroptera of Singapore and peninsular Malaysia. 6. Mesoveliidae, with description of a new Nereivelia species from Singapore. Raffles Bulletin of Zoology 59, 53-60.
These insects are no more than 3.5 millimeters long. They have elongated heads, long antennae, and large eyes, with the exception of Cryptovelia, which have vestigial eyes. Females are larger than the males of their species and have well developed ovipositors.
The type genus, Mesovelia, contains about 27 species, many of which are common and widespread.Andersen, N. M. and D. A. Polhemus. (2003). A new genus of terrestial Mesovellidae from the Seychelles (Hemiptera: Gerromorpha). Journal of the New York Entomological Society (111), 12-21. The other genera are small or even monotypic, and are less common. 
One species is known for its unique specific name, Cavaticovelia aaa, sometimes called the aaa water treader. It is a legitimate binomial name featuring aaa, the Hawaiian word for "lava tube".Yanega, D. Scientific Names Curious Scientific Names. University of California, Riverside. 2013.
According to some treatments, there are two families in the Mesovelioidea.Mesovelioidea Douglas & Scott, 1867. Biolib.cz In others, the family Madeoveliidae is treated as a subfamily of Mesoveliidae.Damgaard, J., et al. (2012).
