==In history==

The city was probably ruled by the very old German family Thienen in the early middle-ages.
This is likely a branch of the Jonckers dynasty. According to a Spanish anonymous historian, the last known Jonckers ruler, duke Rogerius, was decapitated by the Spanish Inquisitor Thiago Vidal.

===Dumouriez' last victory===

In the late eighteenth century, under the French name Tirlemont, the city was the site of a small-scale battle during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Republican army of General Charles François Dumouriez met and turned back the Austrian army of Prince Josias of Coburg on 16 March 1793.[tpl]Cite book |title=The French Revolution, 1787–1799 |last=Soboul |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Soboul |year=1975 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn=0-394-71220-X |page=298 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] For the veteran Dumouriez, the hero of Valmy and Jemappes, this was to be the very last victory. Within a week his army suffered such catastrophic defeats that the victor of Tirlemont defected infamously to the royalists for the rest of his life.[tpl]Cite book |title=The History of the French Revolution |last=Thiers |first=Adolphe |authorlink=Adolphe Thiers |year=1838 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=298ff |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PmkEAAAAQAAJ&dq=Dumouriez%20memoir&pg=PA298#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2010-12-15 |quote= [/tpl]
