[[River Anker]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Staffordshire, Rivers of Warwickshire

The River Anker is a river in England that flows through the centre of Nuneaton towards Tamworth in Staffordshire, then continues on and merges with the River Tame in Tamworth. The Anker is popular with anglers and is known to contain some large pike and chub. Also there are barbel present with fish over 15Â lb being reported.
The River Anker has flooded Nuneaton several times in the past until a storm burst flood relief in Weddington made sure that the river would not flood Nuneaton Town Centre.
In 2007 the river flooded Liberty Way, forcing Nuneaton Borough and Nuneaton RFC to cancel matches while the river water was cleared up. 
The river's name is used for Anker Radio, a radio station in Nuneaton which broadcasts within George Eliot Hospital in the town.
