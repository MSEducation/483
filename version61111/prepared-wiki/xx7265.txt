A minimum wage is the lowest hourly, daily or monthly remuneration that employers may legally pay to workers. Equivalently, it is the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, boosts morale and forces businesses to be more efficient.[tpl]cite web|url=http://robertnielsen21.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/the-advantage-of-the-minimum-wage/ |title=The Advantage Of The Minimum Wage | Robert Nielsen |publisher=Robertnielsen21.wordpress.com |accessdate=2013-03-30[/tpl] In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among low productivity workers) and is damaging to businesses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2210&context=ilrreview |title=Minimum Wages. by David Neumark and William L.
