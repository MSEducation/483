==Life and education==

Arthur Foxton Ferguson was born 3 January 1866 at 25 Albion Street, Leeds,Yorkshire to Emma and William Ferguson, a bank manager.[tpl]cite book|title=West Yorkshire England Births and Baptisms 1813–1910|year=1866|publisher=The Parish of S. Georges, Leeds, the County of York|page=page 78[/tpl]  He had six siblings including William Harold Ferguson (1874–1950).
As a child he began at Coatham and progressed to Leeds Grammar School.[tpl]cite book|title=Leeds Grammar School Admission Books: from 1820 to 1900|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CttAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=leeds+grammar+school+admission+books+foxton+ferguson&source=bl&ots=H79BqT-1xi&sig=HbUIPWwgL8iEDCLLRJsN98kJrk8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dSQKUqHJA4my2QXf-oDwCg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=leeds%20grammar%20school%20admission%20books%20foxton%20ferguson&f=false|publisher=Leeds Grammar School|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]  He then went on in 1880 to Sedbergh School whose register reports that as librarian he, “re-catalogued the library with E. L. Crawhall” (another student). Foxton Ferguson continued on to New College Oxford in 1885 and proceeded to get an Academic Clerkship at Magdalen College in 1887 receiving his B.A. in 1890.[tpl]cite web|title=The Sedbergh school register, 1546 to 1895: Privately printed|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_BMOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=foxton+ferguson+sedbergh+school&source=bl&ots=8LVInBs3O1&sig=3MEeWWgnsjCU-gt4M4_zHLVOh-Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=q00JUprFKc7U2QW4wYD4DQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=foxton%20ferguson%20sedbergh%20school&f=false|work=Pg. 287|publisher=The Sedbergh School|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] This is confirmed by an entry on 14 February 1887 when then Magdalen President Herbert Warren reported in his notebook that, "Arthur Foxton Ferguson, a Commoner of New College," was elected to an Academical Clerkship at Magdalen College to "sing bass." The baritone had been one of nine students competing for the post. It was very unusual to switch colleges in the day and was only permitted in special situations like his.
On 26 October 1897 he married Susanne Alexandrine Delphine Engel, the daughter of a merchant Carl Albert Engel in the Parish Church, Pinner, Middlesex. A German of Bohemian extraction from Hamburg, she was a spinster and pianist who had studied at the Hamburg Conservatory but gave up her career as a concert pianist and moved to Scarborough to live with her aunt Ida Holt. It was there she met Foxton Ferguson.

==Vocal training and repertoire==

Foxton Ferguson's vocal training is not well documented prior to his study in Germany but, most likely, his voice was honed in school music programs and choirs. As an Academic Clerk at Magdalen his duties included services with the esteemed organist John Varley Roberts. Foxton Ferguson's talent for solo singing became apparent in his college years at which time he appeared with the "Magdalen Vagabonds".[tpl]cite news|title=The Magdalen "Vagabonds"|newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post|date=13 January 1893[/tpl]
His post-university musical studies took him to London and then Leipzig, though he was not enrolled at the Königliches Konservatorium der Musik zu Leipzig.[tpl]cite book|title=The Sedbergh school register, 1546 to 1895: Privately printed|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_BMOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=foxton+ferguson+sedbergh+school&source=bl&ots=8LVInBs3O1&sig=3MEeWWgnsjCU-gt4M4_zHLVOh-Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=q00JUprFKc7U2QW4wYD4DQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=foxton%20ferguson%20sedbergh%20school&f=false|publisher=The Sedbergh School[/tpl] Later he studied with the famous German baritone Julius Stockhausen who had founded his own school of singing in 1880.[tpl]cite web|title=The Sedbergh school register, 1546 to 1895: Privately printed|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_BMOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=foxton+ferguson+sedbergh+school&source=bl&ots=8LVInBs3O1&sig=3MEeWWgnsjCU-gt4M4_zHLVOh-Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=q00JUprFKc7U2QW4wYD4DQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=foxton%20ferguson%20sedbergh%20school&f=false|work=Pg. 286|publisher=The Sedbergh School|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Stockhausen's diverse repertoire included opera, oratorio and, most of all, German Lieder. Foxton Ferguson's own repertoire was of a similar breadth and scope.
While he sang bass in ensembles he was called a baritone when singing as a soloist. His concert repertoire included an abundance of Lieder by Schubert and Schumann as well as folk song arrangements and original compositions by contemporary English composers. In opera Foxton Ferguson performed in such diverse repertoire as Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro[tpl]cite news|title=Music in London|newspaper=The Manchester Guardian|date=14 December 1904[/tpl] and Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg[tpl]cite web|last=Proms Archive, 1902|title=Proms 56 – Monday 27, October 1902|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/1900s/1902/october-27/1065|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] though opera didn't play as large a role in his career as concerts did.

In 1907, Daniel Mayer arranged a German tour for the group which started in Hamburg and toured to Berlin.[tpl]cite news|title=The Folk-Song Quartet in Germany|newspaper=The Aberdeen Daily Journal|date=23 January 1907[/tpl] The reception was warm and enthusiastic and Foxton Ferguson was disappointed that the tour couldn't be extended.[tpl]cite news|title=The "Folk-Song Quartet" in Berlin|newspaper=The Aberdeen Daily Journal|date=1 February 1907[/tpl]
Background: On 3 June 1901, The Western Daily Press reported that a vocal quartet had been formed in London by Foxton Ferguson with a two-fold purpose; firstly, to have a well-practiced solo quartet ready for performances of the Choral Symphony, and secondly to study the large and ever increasing body of quartet repertoire.[tpl]cite news|title=Musical Notes: "A vocal quartet has been lately formed"|newspaper=The Western Daily Press|date=3 June 1901[/tpl]  The members of this ensemble, which was singing together as early as 1900 on Ernest Walker's Balliol Sunday concert series,[tpl]cite book|title=The Musical Gazette, Balliol College, Oxford, Dec. 1900|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9ZMrAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Miss+Evelyn+Downes&source=bl&ots=B8oN9aAsmY&sig=Z76TUt35ggCHv24WLyP32EjP65I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EeoLUt_iOefM2AW8ooCYAg&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Miss%20Evelyn%20Downes&f=false|publisher=Joseph Williams|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]  were the famous Austrian soprano Miss Marie Fillunger, Miss Evelyn Downes, mezzo-soprano, Mr. Seth Hughes, tenor, and Foxton Ferguson. One Year prior, a Foxton Ferguson concert in Steinway Hall featured a different quartet composed of Miss Fillunger, Miss Florence Shaw, Mr. Walter Ford and Foxton Ferguson with Ernest Walker as accompanist.[tpl]cite web|title=The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, Vol 40, No. 681 pg. 766|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3367819|publisher=The Musical Times|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl]  By December 1900, Florence Christie had become the mezzo-soprano of the quartet, which the public regarded as Miss Fillunger's quartet and, in 1903, a fatal chamber concert at Bechstein Hall sealed any hopes of the Wagnerian Cicely Gleeson-White[tpl]cite book|title=The Musical Times, Vol. 39, August 1, 1898, The Royal College of Music pg. 535|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f0Ke4i1XJNgC&pg=PA535&dq=cicely+gleeson-white&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lEQMUqLICojC2AXJ-IDoDw&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=cicely%20gleeson-white&f=false|publisher=The Musical Times|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl]  taking over the soprano role.[tpl]cite news|title=Concerts|newspaper=The Times|date=18 June 1903[/tpl]  By 1904, Foxton Ferguson's group was billing itself regularly as the "Folk-Song Quartet" (it was sometimes also called "The Foxton Ferguson Vocal Quartet" and The "Folk-Singers" Quartet)[tpl]cite news|title=The Foxton Ferguson Quartet|newspaper=The Newcastle Daily Journal|date=23 July 1915[/tpl]  and his longtime duet partner Beatrice Spencer had assumed the soprano role solidifying a stable and permanent ensemble for the next fifteen years.

==Lectures and teaching==

Known for his wit, exuberance, and pithiness onstage, Foxton Ferguson was an expert lecturer on English folk song and gave presentations (where he both spoke and sang) in England, Germany, and on extensive tours of the United States in the years 1909–1914.

Once at a high school in Dallas, TX in March 1913, he gave a two hour lecture (both singing and speaking) on "Vagabondia, or Songs of the Open Road." In that lecture he said the following, "Vagabondage does not mean to me simply long hair and filth. It means being one's self. Every true vagabond is himself. It is of the greatest importance to be one's self."[tpl]cite news|title=A.

An obituary in the Eton College Chronicle of 5 November 1920 reads, "His face was irresistibly humorous; you could not see him without feeling a keen interest in him. His singing (how often and how gladly we have heard him sing) was a constant joy, and abides, thought we shall never hear him sing again, a joy forever. ... you could not meet him without feeling some influence for good: always he lived in harmony with the best and in peace with all. ... to love others first, with or without return, is what matters most; ... he came to us already knowing it, it was in this spirit that he lived and died."[tpl]cite web|last=Archives|first=Eton College|title=Eton Chronicle November 5, 1920|url=http://www.etoncollege.com/CollegeArchives.aspx|publisher=Eton College|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
