The Cathedral of Saint Peter the Apostle ([tpl]lang-it|Duomo di Mantova[/tpl]) in Mantua, Lombardy (northern Italy), is the seat of the Diocese of Mantua.
An initial structure probably existed on the site in the Early Christian era, which was followed by an edifice destroyed by a fire in 894. The current church was rebuilt in 1395-1401 with the addition of side chapels and a magnificent Gothic facade, which can still be seen in a sketch by Domenico Morone, which is preserved in the Palazzo Ducale of the city. The belltower has seven bells tuned in the scale of Bb.
After another fire in the 16th century, Giulio Romano remade the interior but saved the facade. The latter was however replaced in 1756-1761 by the current one in the Baroque style, done in Carrara marble. Of the Renaissance edifice, its characteristics are the cusps, decorated with rose windows on the right side, which end with the Gothic bell tower.
