(3 November 1801 – 23 September 1835) was an Italian opera composer.Vincenzo Bellini (Italian composer). britannica.com A native of Catania, Sicily, his greatest works are considered to be I Capuleti ed i Montecchi (1830), La sonnambula (1831), Norma (1831), Beatrice di Tenda (1833), and I puritani (1835).[tpl]by whom|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Known for his long-flowing melodic lines, for which he was named "the Swan of Catania", Bellini was the quintessential composer of bel canto opera; his work has been summed up by the London critic Tim Ashley as:
He died in Puteaux, France at the age of 33 from tuberculosis, nine months after the premiere of his last opera, I Puritani.

==Musical education==

Born in Catania, at the time part of the Kingdom of Sicily, Bellini was a child prodigy from a highly musical family and legend has it he could sing an aria of Valentino Fioravanti at eighteen months. He began studying music theory at two, the piano at three, and by the age of five could apparently play well. Bellini's first five pieces were composed when he was just six years old. Regardless of the veracity of these claims, it is certain that Bellini grew up in a musical household and that his career as a musician was never in doubt.
Having learned from his grandfather, Bellini left provincial Catania in June 1819 to study at the conservatory in Naples, with a stipend from the municipal government of Catania. By 1822 he was a class taught by the director, Nicolò Zingarelli, studying the masters of the Neapolitan school and the orchestral works of Haydn and Mozart.
It was the custom at the Conservatory to introduce a promising student to the public with a dramatic work. The result was Bellini's first opera Adelson e Salvini an opera semiseria (half-serious) that was presented at the Conservatory's theatre in February 1825.

==Career in music==

===Early success in Naples===

Bellini's next opera Bianca e Gernando met with some success at the Teatro San Carlo in May 1826, leading to a commission from the San Carlo impresario Domenico Barbaja for an opera to be presented in the autumn of 1827 at La Scala in Milan (which, between 1821 and 1832, Barbaja also ran.)Galatopoulos 2002, pp. 57—58

===The Northern Italian years===

In Milan, where he spent 1827 to 1833, the composer enjoyed a lively social life, being regarded in public as a dandy.[tpl]citation-needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]. 
However, his first opera for La Scala, Il pirata, was an immediate success when it opened on 27 October 1827. It began Bellini's fruitful collaboration with the librettist and poet Felice Romani, and it cemented his friendship with his favourite tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini, who had sung in Bianca e Gernando. Sparking controversy in the press for its new style and its restless harmonic shifts into remote keys, La straniera in 1828 was a greater success[tpl]citation-needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] than Il pirata had been, and it allowed Bellini to support himself solely by his opera commissions.
The opening of his Zaira at the newly-built Teatro Ducale (now the Teatro Regio) in Parma in 1829  was a failure. But, in the following year, in Venice success returned with the premiere at La Fenice of I Capuleti e i Montecchi, an opera which was based on the same Italian source as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
Included in these triumphant five years in Milan were two major successes, La sonnambula, which was presented in March 1831, and Norma, which was given at La Scala in December of that year.

===1835 in Paris===

It has been noted that towards the autumn of 1835, Bellini had become "the darling of the French capital.....His I Puritani had caused a sensation at its first performance at the 
Théâtre-Italien the previous January." It was during this time that he met Heinrich Heine who, in his literary portrait of Bellini which became part of his unfinished novel Florentinische Nächte (Florentine Nights) of 1837, emphasized the less-appealing aspects of the composer's personality: " 'You are a genius, Bellini,' Heine remarked maliciously, ' but you will pay for your great gift with a premature death. All the great geniuses die young, like Raphael and like Mozart.' "[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Heine's comments were prophetic because, just nine months after the premiere of I Puritani, Bellini died in Puteaux, near Paris of acute inflammation of the intestine, and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris; his remains were removed to the cathedral of Catania in 1876. The Museo Belliniano housed in the Gravina Cruyllas Palace in Catania preserves memorabilia and scores.

===Personal life===

Bellini had a sequence of affairs with married women, including Giuditta Turina. But he resisted any emotional commitment, and never married. When Turina proposed to leave her husband, Bellini bridled: "with so many commitments, such a relationship would be fatal to me". 
An important friendship stemming from his student days at the Naples Conservatory was with Francesco Florimo, who came from a village close to Catania, and the two shared a close correspondence.Libby 1998, in Sadie, p. 242.
