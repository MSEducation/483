==Origins==

The term "skid road" dates back to the 17th century, when it referred to a log road, used to skid or drag logs through woods and bog.[tpl]cite news|title=A Clash Over Aid Effort on the First 'Skid Row'|last=Turner|first=Wallace|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 2, 1986|accessdate=2007-12-31|page=A20[/tpl]. Convenience link on Proquest (requires account - This resource requires a valid Seattle Public Library card.). The term was in common usage in the mid-19th century and came to refer not just to the corduroy roads themselves, but to logging camps and mills all along the Pacific Coast.When a logger was fired he was "sent down the skid road."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=286|title=Yesler, Henry L.

The source of the term "skid road" as an urban district is heavily debated, and is generally identified as originating in either Seattle or Vancouver.

==Seattle==

The name "Skid Road" was in use in Seattle by 1865 when the city's historic Pioneer Square neighborhood began to expand from its commercial core.[tpl]cite book|last=Keniston-Longrie|first=Joy|title=Seattle's Pioneer Square|year=2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Chicago, San Francisco, & Charleston, SC|isbn=978-0-7385-7144-7|pages=128[/tpl] The district centered near the end of what is now Yesler Way, often said to have been the original "Skid Road" in the literal sense serving a saw mill owned by Henry Yesler. [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Henry Yesler acquired land from Doc Maynard at a small point of land at what is today near the intersection of 1st Ave and Yesler Way.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] He also acquired a swath of land 450 feet wide from his property up First Hill to a box of land about 10 acres in size full of timber spanning what is today 20th to 30th Avenues.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] His steam-powered logging mill was built in 1853 on the point of land that looked south towards a small island (Denny's Island, part of his land purchase from Doc Maynard) that has since been filled in around and is the heart of today's Pioneer Square. The mill operated seven days a week, 24 hours per day on the waterfront. The street's end near the mill, attracted cookhouses and inexpensive hotels for itinerant workers, along with several establishments that served beer and liquor.
The Skid Road was built on that 450 foot wide slice of land from the top of First Hill to the logging mill on the point.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Timber cut in nearby forests was greased and skidded down a long, steeply sloping dirt road. Since the building of the mill much of what is today's Seattle is the result of extensive terra-forming by the local people to make the hilly landscape of Seattle habitable. At the time of the building of the mill it was some of the only flat land available. The Skid Road became the demarcation line between the affluent members of Seattle and the mill workers and more rowdy portion of the population.William C. Speidel, "Sons of the Profits, The Seattle Story 1851 to 1901" The road became Mill Street, and eventually Yesler Way, but the nickname "Skid Road" was permanently associated with the district at the street's end.

==Vancouver==

The 100-block of East Hastings Street in Vancouver, British Columbia, the heart of that city's "skid road" neighborhood, lies on a historical skid road. The Vancouver Skid Road was part of a complex of such roads in the dense forests surrounding the Hastings Mill and adjacent to the settlement of Granville, Burrard Inlet (Gastown).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virtualvancouver.com/gastown.html|title=Gastown|publisher=Virtual Vancouver|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl]
The city began as a sawmill settlement called Granville, in the early 1870s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/aboutvan.htm|title=About Vancouver|publisher=City of Vancouver|year=2007|accessdate=2007-01-27[/tpl] By at least the 1950s, "Skid Road" was commonly used to describe the more dilapidated areas in the city's Downtown Eastside,"Demolish City's Skid Road, Murder Protest Demands." Vancouver Sun. April 6, 1962. p. 1. which is focused on the original "strip" along East Hastings Street due to a concentration of single room occupancy hotels (SROs) and associated drinking establishments in the area. The area's seedy origins date back to the early concentration of saloons in pre-Canadian Prohibition (1915–1919) and its popularity with loggers, miners and fishermen whose work was seasonal and who spent their salaries in the area's cheap accommodations and public houses.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Opium and heroin use became popular early on; Vancouver was for many years the main port-of-entry for the North American opium supply. During the Great Depression, the railway rights-of-way and other vacant lots in the area were thronged by the unemployed and poor, and the pattern of social decay became well-established. In the 1970s, the endemic alcohol and poverty problems in the area were exacerbated by the expansion of the drug trade, with crack cocaine becoming high-profile in the 1980s as well as a reconcentration of the prostitution trade in the area because of the relocation of hooker strolls in conjunction with city policy for Expo 86.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
A portion of Vancouver's Skid Row, Gastown, has also been gentrified; however it is in a difficult coexistence with the nearby impoverished Downtown Eastside along East Hastings Street.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The poorest urban area in Canada,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/909|title=The Poorest Postal Code Vancouver's Downtown Eastside in Photos|last=Kalache|first=Stefan|publisher=The Dominion|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-15[/tpl] it is wedged between Downtown, Chinatown and Gastown. These areas are frequented by tourists, and East Hastings Street is a major thoroughfare. These avenues of exposure make the Downtown Eastside a highly visible example of a skid row. The Downtown Eastside (sometimes abbreviated D.T.E.S.) is also home to Insite, the only legal intravenous drug safe injection site in North America, part of a harm reduction policy aimed at helping the area's drug addicted residents.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Los Angeles==

Local homeless count estimates have ranged from 3,668 to 5,131. In 2011, the homeless population estimate for Los Angeles' Skid Row was 4,316.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theycountwillyou.org/Docs/HC11-Detailed-Geography-Report-FINAL.PDF |title=2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count (page 38 -- Skid Row section) |publisher=Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority |accessdate=2011-11-16[/tpl] L.A.'s Skid Row is sometimes called "the Nickel", referring to a section of Fifth Street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103214505 |title=For Some, L.A.'s Skid Row Is For Beginnings |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl]
Several of the city's homeless and social-service providers (such as Weingart Center Association, Volunteers of America, Frontline Foundation, Midnight Mission, Union Rescue Mission and Downtown Women's Center) are based in Skid Row. Between 2005 and 2007, several local hospitals and suburban law-enforcement agencies were accused by Los Angeles Police Department and other officials of transporting those homeless people in their care to Skid Row.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2005/10/03/news/news01.txt |title=LA Downtown News Online |publisher=Downtownnews.com |accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-homeless24mar24,0,2261615.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=A Plan to Spread Homeless Countywide - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2006-03-24 |archivedate=15 July 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060615120210/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-homeless24mar24,0,2261615.story?coll=la-home-headlines[/tpl]

During the 1960s, when development interests and the Redevelopment Agency were using eminent domain to clear out a large area populated by retired men in the South of Market area, that area was termed "Skid Row" in the media. The City's convention center was built after the clearing of long term low-income residents.Hartman, Chester. 1984. The Transformation of San Francisco.
