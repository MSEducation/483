Derek Sanderson Jeter ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|t|ər[/tpl]; born June 26, 1974) is an American baseball shortstop who has played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. A five-time World Series champion, Jeter is regarded as a central figure of the Yankees during their success of the late 1990s and early 2000s due to his hitting ability, baserunning, fielding, and leadership. He is the Yankees' all-time career leader in hits (3,337), games played (2,621), stolen bases (348), and at bats (10,686). His accolades include thirteen All-Star selections, five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger Awards, two Hank Aaron Awards, and a Roberto Clemente Award. Jeter is the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop, and the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits.
The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in 1992, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1995. The following year, he became the Yankees' starting shortstop, won the Rookie of the Year Award, and helped the team win the 1996 World Series. Jeter continued to contribute during the team's championship seasons of 1998–2000; he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999, and won both the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in 2000. He has consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored for the past ten years, and since 2003 has served as the Yankees' team captain. Throughout his career, Jeter has contributed reliably to the Yankees' franchise successes. He holds many postseason records, and has a .351 batting average in the World Series. Jeter has earned the titles of "Captain Clutch" and "Mr. November" due to his postseason heroics.
Jeter has been one of the most heavily marketed athletes of his generation and is involved in several product endorsements. His personal life and relationships with celebrities have drawn the attention of the media throughout his career. Teammates and opponents alike regard Jeter as a consummate professional and one of the best players of his generation.New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter's greatness goes beyond the numbers - ESPN The Magazine - ESPN

===High school===

Jeter attended Kalamazoo Central High School, where he played baseball and basketball.

==Professional career==

===Draft===

As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser evaluated Jeter extensively prior to the 1992 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. The Astros held the first overall pick in the draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select Jeter.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=olney_buster&id=1863947|title=Jeter: Dynasty's child|last=Olney|first=Buster|publisher=ESPN.com|date=August 23, 2004|accessdate=July 13, 2009[/tpl] However, the Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Consequently, the Astros passed on him in the draft, instead choosing Cal-State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.[tpl]cite news|last=Olney|first=Buster|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/sports/baseball-what-can-we-do-next-just-watch-jeter-play.html|title=Baseball – What Can We Do Next?

The Yankees, who selected sixth, also rated Jeter highly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/sports/baseball/one-hit-for-derek-jeter-and-little-else-for-the-yankees.html|title=Rays 5, Yankees 1: Jeter Moves a Hit Closer as the Yanks Fall Again|first=Sam|last=Borden|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011[/tpl] Yankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/zimmer-salutes-jeter-as-all-time-great-1.3011680|title=Zimmer salutes Jeter as all-time great|newspaper=Newsday|first=Barbara|last=Baker|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=April 24, 2012[/tpl] Though Yankees officials were concerned that Jeter would attend college and forgo the opportunity to sign a professional contract, Groch convinced them to select him. Regarding the possibility that Jeter would attend Michigan, Groch said "the only place Derek Jeter's going is to Cooperstown", referring to the home city of the Baseball Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/joe_lemire/07/07/derek.jeter/index.html#ixzz1SxfZCzux|first=Joe|last=Lemire|title=Jeter not defined by number 3,000|work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl] The second through fifth picks were Paul Shuey, B.

===Minor leagues (1992–1995)===

Jeter played four seasons in minor league baseball, then known as the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL). Jeter began the 1992 season with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, based in Tampa, Florida. In his first professional game, Jeter failed to get a hit in seven at-bats, going 0-for-7, while striking out five times. Jeter continued to struggle during the rest of the season, batting .202 in 47 games. Manager Gary Denbo benched Jeter in the season's final game to ensure his average would not drop below .200, known in baseball as the Mendoza Line.[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110504&content_id=18638298&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_milb|title='Captain' Jeter developed in Minors: Gangly, homesick kid turned into a legend in O'Connor's book|first=Benjamin|last=Hill|work=MiLB.com|date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2011[/tpl] Frustrated by his lack of success and homesick, Jeter accrued $400-per-month phone bills from daily calls to his parents.
The Yankees promoted Jeter to the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to allow him the opportunity to accrue more at-bats. He batted .247 in his first 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine errors in 48 chances. Weighing [tpl]convert|156|lbs|kg[/tpl], Jeter's scrawny appearance did not match his reputation as the Yankees' future leader. Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, who played for the Hornets that season, at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent and poise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/sports/baseball/13jeter.html?_r=1|title=Even in Class A, Posada and Pettitte Sensed What Was to Come With Jeter|first=Jack|last=Curry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2012[/tpl]
Jeter spent the next offseason focusing on improving his fielding. Baseball America rated Jeter among the top 100 prospects in baseball prior to the 1993 season, ranking him 44th.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/top-100-prospects/all-time.html|title=All-Time Top 100 Prospects|work=Baseball America|accessdate=April 23, 2012[/tpl] Returning to the Hornets in 1993, his first full season of professional baseball, Jeter hit .295 with five home runs, 71 RBI and 18 stolen bases; SAL managers voted him the "Most Outstanding Major League Prospect" in the league.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V91HAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vP8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3679,4921919&dq=derek-jeter+albany&hl=en|title=Jeter Fits in Yankees' Near Future|page=D2|newspaper=Record-Journal|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=April 9, 2012[/tpl] He finished second in the SAL in triples (11), third in hits (152), and eleventh in batting average, as he was named to the postseason All-Star team. However, Jeter committed 56 errors, a SAL record. Despite this, he was voted the SAL's Best Defensive Shortstop, Most Exciting Player, and Best Infield Arm by Baseball America.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/jeterderekadd.html|title=Jeter always in position to win|accessdate=September 8, 2008|last=Acocella|first=Nick|date=June 21, 2004|publisher=ESPN Classic[/tpl]
Coming off his strong 1993 season, Baseball America rated Jeter as the 16th-best prospect in baseball. Jeter played for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL), the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League, and the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League during the 1994 season,[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77941605.html?dids=77941605:77941605&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+28%2C+1994&author=Gordon+Edes%2C+Fort+Lauderdale+Sun-Sentinel&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=YANKS+THINK+JETER+CLOSE+TO+MAJORS&pqatl=google|title=Yanks Think Jeter Close to Majors|newspaper=Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel|first=Gordon|last=Edes|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=April 9, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required|date=April 2012[/tpl] combining to hit .344 with five home runs, 68 RBI, and steal 50 bases across the three levels.  He was honored with the Minor League Player of the Year Award by Baseball America, The Sporting News, USA Today, and Topps/NAPBL. He was also named the most valuable player of the FSL.
Considered the fourth-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America heading into the 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. However, he suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after the conclusion of the 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/28/sports/baseball-top-prospect-s-bottom-line-is-no-replacement-games.html|title=Baseball; Top Prospect's Bottom Line Is No Replacement Games|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Jack|last=Curry|date=February 28, 1995|accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl] During 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training prior to the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the picket line.

Early in the 1995 season, Fernández and infielder Pat Kelly were injured.

After Fernández batted a disappointing .245 and appeared in only 108 games due to injuries that season, newly hired Yankees manager Joe Torre asserted that Jeter would be the starting shortstop for the 1996 season,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/13/sports/baseball-torre-is-sure-of-only-one-thing-jeter-is-his-shortstop.html |title=Baseball: Torre Is Sure Of Only One Thing: Jeter Is His Shortstop |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Jack |last=Curry |date=December 13, 1995 |accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.courant.com/1996-03-19/sports/9603190402_1_yankees-season-opener-fielding-pat-kelly |title=Fernandez Fields Move to Second Well: Injury to Kelly Creates Another Chance |newspaper=Hartford Courant |first=Jack |last=O'Connell |date=March 19, 1996 |page=C.2 |accessdate=December 5, 2011[/tpl] indicating that he hoped Jeter could bat .250 and be dependable defensively. However, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, often skeptical of younger players, was not convinced. Clyde King, a close Steinbrenner advisor, observed Jeter for two days in spring training in 1996, and came away with the impression that Jeter was not yet ready. To provide depth to the team at the shortstop position after an injury to Fernández, Steinbrenner approved a trade that would have sent pitcher Mariano Rivera to the Seattle Mariners for shortstop Félix Fermín, but Michael, now the vice president of scouting, and assistant general manager Brian Cashman convinced Steinbrenner to give Jeter an opportunity.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/yankees/2009-10-06-yankees-quartet_N.htm |title=For Yanks quartet, winning a fifth title would add to a legacy |date=October 7, 2009 |first=Mel |last=Antonen |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=December 5, 2011[/tpl]

Jeter, who for part of the year hit third in the batting order, also drove in 102 runs, becoming only the second Yankee shortstop to do so, following Lyn Lary's 107 RBI in 1931. In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the ALDS, .350 in the ALCS, and .353 in the World Series, as the Yankees defeated the Braves to win another championship, Jeter's third.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1999_WS.shtml|title=1999 World Series|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=November 25, 2011[/tpl]
During the 1999–2000 offseason, the Yankees negotiated with Jeter, tentatively agreeing to a seven-year, $118.5 million  contract. Steinbrenner did not want set a record for the largest contract, and delayed a response while Juan González and the Detroit Tigers negotiated on a reported eight-year, $143 million contract extension. When that agreement fell through, so did Jeter's tentative deal. To avoid arbitration, Jeter and the Yankees agreed to a one-year deal worth $10 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/68846006.html?dids=68846006:68846006&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+04%2C+2000&author=TOM+KEEGAN&pub=New+York+Post&desc=JETER%2C+YANKS+%2410M+DEAL%2CAVOID+HEARING&pqatl=google|title=Jeter, Yankes $10M Deal, Avoid Hearing|newspaper=New York Post|first=Tom|last=Keegan|date=February 4, 2000|accessdate=November 25, 2011|page=107[/tpl] [tpl]Subscription required|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Jeter batted a team-best .339 in the 2000 regular season and added 15 home runs, 73 RBI, 119 runs scored, and 22 stolen bases.

With one year remaining until he would become eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189 million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/02/09/yankees_jeter_ap/|title=Derek's dollars: Yankees, Jeter finalize 10-year, $189 million deal|work=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|date=February 9, 2001|accessdate=July 13, 2009[/tpl] Rodriguez signed a ten-year, $252 million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9 million average annual value of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2 million) and Manny Ramirez ($20 million).
In 2001, Jeter posted another strong season, batting .311 with 21 home runs, 74 RBI, 110 runs scored, and 27 stolen bases, making his fourth All-Star appearance. Jeter made a notable defensive assist in Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics. With Jeremy Giambi on first base, Oakland right fielder Terrence Long hit a double off Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina into the right-field corner. As Giambi rounded third base and headed for home plate, Yankees right fielder Shane Spencer retrieved the ball and made a wild throw that missed cut-off man Tino Martinez and dribbled down the first-base line. Jeter ran from shortstop to grab the ball and flipped it backhanded to catcher Jorge Posada, rather than throwing it overhand. Posada tagged Giambi out on the leg just before he crossed home plate, preserving the Yankees' one-run lead. Facing elimination, the Yankees eventually won the game, as well as the series.

As a result of the September 11 attacks, the start of the playoffs was delayed and the season's end was extended past the usual October timeframe. The Yankees advanced to the 2001 World Series to face the Arizona Diamondbacks. Game 4 marked the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the month of November. In extra innings, Jeter hit a game-winning home run off of Byung-Hyun Kim. The words "Mr. November" flashed on the scoreboard, in reference to former Yankee Reggie Jackson's nickname, "Mr. October". Despite the home run, Jeter slumped at the plate; he denied injuries were a factor, though a fall into a photographer's box trying to catch a foul ball may have aggravated an earlier hamstring injury.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/87197366.html?dids=87197366:87197366&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+31%2C+2001&author=Mike+Dodd&pub=USA+TODAY&desc=Jeter+struggling+to+reverse+slump+%3B+Yankees+shortstop+feels+good+at+plate%2C+confident+hits+will+come&pqatl=google|title=Jeter struggling to reverse slump; Yankees shortstop feels good at plate, confident hits will come|newspaper=USA Today|first=Mike|last=Dodd|date=October 31, 2001|page=C.06|accessdate=November 25, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required|date=November 2011[/tpl] Jeter batted .148 in the World Series, as the Yankees lost in seven games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_WS.shtml|title=2001 World Series|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=November 25, 2011[/tpl]

Jeter committed 18 errors in 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and his staff saw Jeter's defense as an area that needed to be addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness.[tpl]cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/How-will-Cubs%252C-Mets-GMs-turn-things-around%253F|title=How will Cubs, Mets GMs Turn Things Around?|last=Rosenthal|first=Ken|publisher=Fox Sports|date=August 25, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uI5SGasJ|archivedate=November 16, 2010|accessdate=November 16, 2010[/tpl] Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090727&content_id=6094262&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy&partnerId=rss_nyy|title=Jeter making long strides at shortstop|last=Hoch|first=Bryan|publisher=MLB.com|date=July 28, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uI75F4kn|archivedate=November 16, 2010|accessdate=November 16, 2010[/tpl]
