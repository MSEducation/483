</ref> There was also inundation on the New York side, but no communities were affected. The creation of the seaway also led to the introduction of [[invasive species]] of aquatic animals, most notably the [[zebra mussel]], into the [[Great Lakes Basin]]. 
The seaway provides significant entertainment and recreation such as boating, camping, fishing, and scuba diving. Of note, The Old Power House near Lock 23 (near Morrisburg, ON) became an attractive site for scuba divers, the submerged stone building covered with barnacles and home to an abundance of underwater life.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.morrisburg.ca/history |title=A Glimpse of Morrisburg’s History[/tpl] 
The Seaway also provides a number of divable shipwrecks within recreational scuba limits (shallower than [tpl]convert|130|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]) The region also offers technical diving with some wrecks lying at [tpl]convert|240|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Surprisingly, the water temperature can be as warm as [tpl]convert|75|F|0[/tpl] during the mid to late summer months. The first [tpl]convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of Lake Ontario is warmed and enters the St. Lawrence river as the fast moving water body has no thermocline circulation.
On 12 July 2010, Richelieu (owned by Canada Steamship Lines) ran aground after losing power near the Côte-Sainte-Catherine lock. The grounding punctured a fuel tank, spilling an estimated 200 tonnes of diesel fuel, covering approximately 500 m2. The seaway and the lock were shut down to help contain the spill.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/07/13/tanker-spill-montreal.html |title=Ship's fuel leaks into St. Lawrence Seaway |author=CBC News |publisher=CBC |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2010 |authorlink=CBC News[/tpl]

==International trade and tourism==

The seaway is important for American and Canadian international trade. The seaway handles 40 to 50 million annual tons of cargo. About 50% of the cargo carried travels to and from international ports in Europe, Middle East and Africa.  The rest comprises coastal trade, or short sea shipping, between various American and Canadian ports.[tpl]cite web|title=Introducing the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway System|url=http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/pdf/overview_brochure.pdf|publisher=Saint Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation[/tpl] Among international shippers are found:
