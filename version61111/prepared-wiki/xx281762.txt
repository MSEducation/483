Typhoon Utor (international designation: 1311, JTWC designation: 11W, PAGASA name: Labuyo, VNCHMF designation: Bão số 7), is the 15th depression and the 2nd typhoon in the 2013 typhoon season.
It was a powerful tropical cyclone which struck the Philippines and southern China. Developing into a tropical storm on August 9, Utor soon underwent explosive intensification and became a typhoon within a half of day. After making landfall over Luzon late on August 11, the typhoon re-emerged in the South China Sea, and it ultimately made its second landfall over Guangdong, China on August 14.

==Meteorological history==

Early on August 8, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed north of Yap.[tpl]cite web|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans August 8, 2013 06z|date=August 8, 2013|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abpwweb.txt|accessdate=August 11, 2013|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IjnpieGe|archivedate=August 9, 2013|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force[/tpl] During that day, the system moved westwards and consolidated within a favourable environment of weak vertical wind shear and strong outflow, which was enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to the northwest of the disturbance.[tpl]cite web|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans August 8, 2013 13z|date=August 8, 2013|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abpwweb.txt|accessdate=August 11, 2013|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IjnpdC1p|archivedate=August 9, 2013|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert August 8, 2013 16z|date=August 8, 2013|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abpwweb.txt|accessdate=August 11, 2013|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ijo3PU5C|archivedate=August 9, 2013|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force[/tpl] As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression north of Palau, with the latter naming it Labuyo as it approached the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/warning/2013/09/10/typhoon-best-track-2013-09-10t060000z/|type=RSMC Tropical Cyclone Best Track|title=Typhoon Utor|author=RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|accessdate=September 10, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Jeb1QL7J|archivedate=September 15, 2013|deadurl=no|date=September 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2013|title=Prognostic Reasoning for Tropical Depression 11W Warning NR 001 August 8, 2013 21z|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url=http://www.webcitation.org/6IjolJf8W[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Alert: Tropical Depression "Labuyo" August 8, 21z|url=http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/wb/tcupdate.shtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IjoLkukx|archivedate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration[/tpl] During the next day, JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Utor.[tpl]cite web|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|date=August 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2013|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IlKHpY2u|archivedate=August 9, 2013|title=Prognostic Reasoning for Tropical Storm 11W Warning NR 005 August 9, 2013 21z[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, Utor began undergoing explosive intensification, achieving typhoon status early on August 10, as an eye developed.[tpl]cite web|title=Prognostic Reasoning for Typhoon 11W (Utor) Warning Nr 07|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=August 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ImqV4Kt9|archivedate=August 10, 2013[/tpl]
On August 11, under the influence of low vertical wind shear, very favourable poleward and westward outflow, and warm sea surface temperature, Utor began to intensify more and formed a clear eye.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 11|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=16 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IoLpsbTl|archivedate=11 August 2013[/tpl] At 12:00 UTC, Typhoon Utor attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 105 knots (195 km/h, 105 mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to [tpl]convert|925|hPa|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. The system became exceptionally symmetrical, as the convective bands had further deepened and wrapped tighter around a [tpl]convert|13|nmi[/tpl] pin-hole eye, prompting JTWC upgrading Utor to a super typhoon.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR SUPER TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 12|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=16 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IoLpnsTI|archivedate=11 August 2013[/tpl] Due to land interaction with Luzon, the pin-hole eye filled in quickly; as a result, JTWC downgraded Utor to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 13|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=16 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IoLpjUmz|archivedate=11 August 2013[/tpl] Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north, Utor made landfall over northern Luzon around 19:00 UTC (03:00 PHT on August 12).[tpl]cite news|title=23 missing as Typhoon Utor hits Philippines|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10911533|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=August 12, 2013[/tpl]
Owing to peaks of western Luzon, Utor significantly weakened as the deep convection became disorganised. Early on August 12, Utor arrived at the South China Sea, where the environment southwest of an anticyclone was favourable with diffluence aloft, light vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 14|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=15 September 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IoLpe3Zy|archivedate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Although a ragged eye had formed later that day, the typhoon did not restrengthen further when tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 16|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=15 September 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IptHdLNP|archivedate=12 August 2013[/tpl] On August 13, the eye of Utor had become well-defined on the visible satellite imagery, but the intensity and structure remained when the system was tracking northwestward.[tpl]cite web|title=PROGNOSTIC REASONING FOR TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 19|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=15 September 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IrSSyyzW|archivedate=13 August 2013[/tpl] At 07:50 UTC (15:50 CST) on August 14, Utor made landfall over Yangjiang in Guangdong, China as a minimal typhoon.[tpl]cite web|title=强台风“尤特”在广东阳江登陆 海南风雨逐渐减弱|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2013-08/14/c_116945250.htm|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=15 September 2013|language=Chinese|date=14 August 2013[/tpl] At 12:00 UTC, JMA downgraded Utor to a severe tropical storm, shortly before JTWC issued a final warning to the rapidly weakening system due to land interaction.[tpl]cite web|title=TYPHOON 11W (UTOR) WARNING NR 024|url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/wt/wtpn31.pgtw..txt|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|accessdate=15 September 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IsvakhaO|archivedate=14 August 2013[/tpl] Later, Utor weakened into a tropical storm overland, and JMA downgraded the system into a tropical depression at noon on August 15. However, the remnants began tracking very slowly in Guangxi, until the tropical depression finally dissipated on August 18.

==Preparations and impact==

===Philippines===

Ahead of Utor affecting the Philippines, PAGASA issued various tropical cyclone signals for Luzon and Visayas, including signal 3 for the provinces of Aurora and Isabela and signal 1 for Metro Manila.

Under the anticipation of a direct hit, the local Pangasinan government placed the entire province on red alert. On August 11, the governor announced the suspension of classes from pre-school to tertiary level. Government and private offices were also suspended. Rescue equipment and rubber boats had also been placed in the disaster risk area of the province.[tpl]cite web|title=Pangasinan braces for typhoon ‘Labuyo’|url=http://www.pia.gov.ph/news/index.php?article=411376275196|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] In the said regions, the government advised all to not engage on water sports or rough seas due to the anticipated rough seas.

Utor made its landfall in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications went down and many houses were destroyed.[tpl]cite web|title=One dead, 23 missing as typhoon Labuyo hits Luzon|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/36231-missing-as-typhoon-labuyo-hits-luzon|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some residents in the said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died on Baguio City after he had been buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province.[tpl]cite news|title=23 Fishermen Missing as Typhoon Batters Philippines|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/08/11/world/asia/ap-as-asia-typhoon.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly impossible to see. Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low lying areas. The major river on the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flood is expected to get higher as high tide is expected in the morning.[tpl]cite web|title=Typhoon ‘Labuyo’ batters Aurora town|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/nation/regions/08/12/13/typhoon-labuyo-batters-aurora-town|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar.
