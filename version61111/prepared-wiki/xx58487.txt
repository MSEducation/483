CATEGORIES: Salicaceae, Malpighiales families

Salicaceae or the willow family (although they contain more than just the willow genus, Salix) is a family of flowering plants. Recent genetic studies summarized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has greatly expanded the circumscription of the family to contain 55 genera.Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, June 2008 (and more or less continuously updated since).
In the Cronquist system, the Salicaceae were treated in their own order Salicales, and contained only three genera (Salix, Populus and Chosenia), but APG includes it in Malpighiales. The additional genera were previously treated in Flacourtiaceae, but had a mixed history before that and have been treated in Bembiciaceae, Caseariaceae, Homaliaceae, Poliothyrsidaceae, Prockiaceae, Samydaceae, and Scyphostegiaceae. The Samydaceae (including Caseariaceae) appear rather distinct and might be a valid family however[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl].
Gerrardina is now considered the sole genus of a separate family, Gerrardinaceae.[tpl]cite journal |first=M.
