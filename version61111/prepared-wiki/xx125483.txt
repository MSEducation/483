CATEGORIES: Villages in North Yorkshire, Wensleydale

Sedbusk is a hamlet near Hawes and Hardraw Force within the Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire, England.
Sedbusk is an attractive, small Upper Wensleydale village situated halfway up a fell on the south facing side of the beautiful, broad sweeping valley that comprises Wensleydale. Forming its backdrop this fell climbs to over 2000 feet, part craggy and part moorland at its summit. 
Served by a narrow, twisting and fairly steep road which comes to an abrupt halt at the end of the village there is no through traffic and a peaceful, relaxing, almost sleepy atmosphere abounds. There are around 30 houses, cottages and converted barns in the village, all stone built, dating mostly from the 18th Century, and spread higgledly-piggledly over its confines. 
Indeed hardly any two front doors face the same direction, a modern day planners nightmare perhaps, but for those who appreciate a more traditional and less regimented village development, Sedbusk has a deal of character and charm to recommend it. The panoramic view from Sedbusk is over Upper Wensleydale. Perched overlooking the valley bottom you can follow the River Ure as it winds its way through green, drystone meadows where cows and sheep peacefully graze, down the Dale towards Aysgarth Falls. On the fellside pastures above the river thickets of woods, stone barns, farms and isolated houses are dotted here and there which become barer as they lead up to the moorland summit of Weather Fell. Completing the scene are the confluence of hills around Hawes that give rise to its name ("Haas" - ancient Norse dialect for pass through the mountains).
