CATEGORIES: Former local government areas of Victoria (Australia)

The City of Heidelberg was a local government area about [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0[/tpl] northeast of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia. The city covered an area of [tpl]convert|34.08|km2|sqmi|2[/tpl], and existed from 1840 until 1994.

==History==

Heidelberg was first incorporated as a trust in 1840, making it one of the earliest local government formations in Australia. On 12 October 1860 it became a road district, administered by a Roads Board. It became a shire on 27 January 1871 and was proclaimed a city on 11 April 1934. In the 1960s it lost significant sections of its territory; on 1 October 1962, the neighbouring City of Northcote annexed its South Ward, and on 30 September 1964, the Shire of Diamond Valley was created out of its mostly rural North Ward.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=397–398[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
On 15 December 1994, the City of Heidelberg was abolished, and, along with parts of the Shires of Diamond Valley and Eltham, was merged into the newly City of Banyule. A small area near La Trobe University was transferred to the City of Darebin.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|pages=4–5|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl]
