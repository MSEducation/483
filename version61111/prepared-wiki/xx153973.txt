==Stabiles==

Although Calder is better known for his mobile sculptures often called mobiles, in the later years of his life he produced stationary sculptures (also called stabiles). In 1975, Calder produced a series of Flying Dragon sculptures, one of which sold at auction at Sotheby's New York: Wednesday, May 10, 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/Artists/LotDetailPage.aspx?lot_id=6AA013E7D230389AC459FE2EDA2363B2|title=Alexander Calder - Past Auction Results|publisher=artnet|year=2007[/tpl] Completed in 1975, the Flying Dragon is thought to be the final stabile that Calder personally created. He died less than a year later at the age of seventy-eight [tpl]Cite web  | last = Chicago Park District  | title = Grant Park: Flying Dragon  | url= http://www.cpdit01.com/resources/planning-and-development.fountains-monuments-and-sculptures/Grant%20Park/Flying%20Dragon.pdf  | accessdate = 10 November 2010 [/tpl]
