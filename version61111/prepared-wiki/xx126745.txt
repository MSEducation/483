The Ducati 749 is a 90-degree L Twin Desmodromic valve actuated engine sport bike built by Ducati Motor Holding between 2003 and 2006.  Designed by Pierre Terblanche, the 749 was available as the 749, 749 Dark, 749S, and 749R. It shared many of its parts with the 999, with the exception of a slightly smaller 180/55 profile rear tire, smaller cylinders, and different cylinder heads, giving it a smaller displacement of 748 cc.  This smaller engine is higher revving and produces a lower peak horsepower than the larger engine used in the 999.  The 749S model, like the 999, incorporates features rarely found on production motorcycles, including adjustable rake (23.5° or 24.5°) and five-position adjustable rearset mounts.
A limited number of the 749 were manufactured as a race version — the 749R — each with their production number stamped on the triple clamp.  This race model was lighter, had a shorter stroke, increased bore and larger valves which allowed it to run more efficiently at higher RPM, and hence, produced more torque and power than the 749/S models.  The 749R also came with a larger fuel tank ([tpl]convert|18.3|L|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]); slipper clutch; Öhlins forks, shock and steering damper; racing cams; titanium valves, valve guides, and connecting rods; magnesium head covers, and carbon fiber belt covers.  Its 2004 model had carbon fiber fairings.
The 749 was replaced by the Ducati 848 for the 2008 model year.
