[[Newtonian fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Viscosity, Fluid dynamics

In continum mechanics, a fluid is said to be Newtonian if the viscous stresses that arise from its flow, at every point, are proportional to the local strain rate â€” the rate of change of its deformation over time.[tpl]cite book | author=G.

More precisely, a fluid is Newtonian only if the tensors that describe the viscous stress and the strain rate are related by a constant viscosity tensor that does not depend on the stress state and velocity of the flow.  If the fluid is also isotropic (that is, its mechanical properties are the same along any direction), the viscosity tensor reduces to two real coefficients, describing the fluid's resistance to continuous shear deformation and continuous compression or expansion, respectively.
Newtonian fluids are the simplest mathematical models of fluids that account for viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, can be assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions. However, non-Newtonian fluids are relatively common, and include oobleck (which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared), or non-drip paint (which becomes thinner when sheared). Other examples include many polymer solutions (which exhibit the Weissenberg effect), molten polymers, many solid suspensions, blood, and most highly viscous fluids.
Newtonian fluids are named after Isaac Newton, who first derived the relation between the rate of shear strain rate and shear stress for such fluids in differential form.

==Definition==

===Incompressible isotropic case===

For an incompressible and isotropic Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress is related to the strain rate by the simpler equation
where
If the fluid is incompressible and viscosity is constant across the fluid, this equation can be written in terms of an arbitrary coordinate system as
where

===For anisotropic fluids===

There is general formula for friction force in a liquid: The vector differential of friction force is equal the viscosity tensor increased on vector product differential of the area vector of adjoining a liquid layers and rotor of velocity:

==Examples==

Water, air and thin motor oil are examples of (practically) Newtonian fluids that have different density properties, which allows a different shear stress and rate flow graphs within a given interval.
