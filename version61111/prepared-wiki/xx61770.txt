[[Ğ]]

CATEGORIES: Specific letter-diacritic combinations, Turkish language

Ğ, or ğ, is a letter, known as g-breve in English, used in Turkish, Azerbaijani, and Laz. 

==Turkish use==

In  Turkish, the ğ [tpl]IPAslink|ɰ[/tpl] is known as yumuşak ge [tpl]IPA-tr|jumuʃak ɟe|[/tpl] (soft g) and is the ninth letter of the Turkish alphabet. It is very similar to the blødt g 'soft g' in Danish and comparable to the '-gh'sound in the Arabic letter ghayn. It lengthens the preceding vowel, which is normally short in Turkish without the ğ. For example, dağ (mountain) is pronounced like [tpl]IPA-tr|daː|[/tpl], and yağ (oil) is pronounced like [tpl]IPA-tr|jaː|[/tpl]. The ğ must be located after a vowel and thus cannot be the initial letter of a word. Its exact function varies throughout Turkey and with regard to the particular vowel with which it is used: it adds a rising of the back of the tongue (as for g or k) to a and ı, a [tpl]IPAslink|j[/tpl] glide to e or i, and a [tpl]IPAslink|β[/tpl] glide to the rounded vowels: o, u, ö, and ü.
The letter provides a smooth transition between vowels since they do not occur consecutively in native Turkish words (in loanwords they are separated by a glottal stop). Sometimes g is used incorrectly instead of ğ. In the case of Turkish words borrowed into other languages, the letter may become a [tpl]IPAblink|ɡ[/tpl], as in yogurt (also spelled yoghurt; Turkish yoğurt). In rare cases, the phonetic [tpl]unicode|ɣ[/tpl] (gamma) or the Greek letter γ is used. Some webpages may also use Ð and ð because of improper encoding; see Turkish characters for the reasons of this.

==Azeri use==

In Azeri, the ğ represents [tpl]IPAslink|ɣ[/tpl], the voiced velar fricative.

==Laz use==

Laz is written using two alphabets: the Georgian alphabet and an extended Turkish Latin alphabet. In the Latin alphabet, ğ represents [tpl]IPAslink|ɣ[/tpl], the voiced velar fricative. It corresponds to the Georgian letter ღ.
