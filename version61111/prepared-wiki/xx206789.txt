The show has recently branched out into areas that include more than just music, for instance, the show has a number of editors and photography students working behind the scenes.
The Welcome To The Gun Show website states that their philosophy is -
 
 By providing an outlet for these young people to showcase their talents, we validate who they are as individuals and their passion and energy for what they are doing. We support them to grow in their autonomy and empower them by encouraging them to develop a sense of ownership over their own style and creativity. Hence the name of our show: we believe they are all our nationâ€™s young guns.
