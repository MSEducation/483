The Castro Theatre is a popular San Francisco movie palace which became San Francisco Historic Landmark #100 in September 1976.[tpl]citation |title=San Francisco Preservation Bulletin No. 9 |url=http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/planning/preservation/PresBulletin09LANDMARKS.PDF |date=January 2003[/tpl]  Located at 429 Castro Street, in the Castro district, it was built in 1922 with a Spanish Colonial Baroque façade that pays homage—in its great arched central window surmounted by a scrolling pediment framing a niche—to the recently rebuilt basilica of Mission Dolores nearby. Its designer, Timothy L. Pflueger, also designed Oakland's Paramount Theater and other movie theaters in California in that period. The theater has 1407 seats.[tpl]citation |title=The History Of The Castro Theatre |url=http://www.castrotheatre.com/history.html[/tpl][tpl]citation |title=Film-Noir-Alley.com - The Castro Theater |url=http://www.film-noir-alley.com/castro-theater.html[/tpl]

==History==

The Castro Theatre originally opened at 479 Castro Street in 1910.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/22/DD53438.DTL |title=Longtime owners to take over Castro Theatre |periodical=San Francisco Chronicle |date=22 May 2001 |first=Peter |last=Stack |accessdate=2008-10-28 [/tpl][tpl]citation |title=Cliff's Variety: The 4th Store |url=http://www.cliffsvariety.com/about4.html |accessdate=2008-10-28 [/tpl] It was subsequently remodeled into a retail store (currently occupied by Cliff's Variety, since 1971) in the mid-1920s after the larger Castro Theater was built at 429 Castro Street, its current location, only a few doors up from the original theatre. 
The New Castro Theatre opened on June 22, 1922 for an invitation-only screening, with local luminaries such as Mayor James "Sunny Jim" Rolph in attendance, of the Paramount Pictures release Across the Continent (1922), starring Wallace Reid. The new Castro Theater opened the following day to the general public.

==Description==

The Nasser brothers, who built the theater and still own it, also owned several movie houses in the San Francisco area. The interior is luxurious and ornate, with subtly convex and concave walls and ceiling and a dramatic "Mighty Wurlitzer" pipe organ that is played before films and events. The large neon "Castro" sign is emblematic of both the theatre and the Castro District.
Today, the Castro Theatre hosts repertory movies, film festivals, and special events, including gay and multicultural focus, such as the San Francisco International Film Festival, Frameline: the SF International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Noir City: The Film Noir Festival, the SF International Asian American Film Festival, the SF International South Asian Film Festival, Berlin and Beyond: German Film Festival, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, SF Indiefest, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, Midnites for Maniacs, and the Shock It To Me! Classic Horror Film Festival. In recent years, the Castro has been the site for gala tributes to many legendary Hollywood stars including Tony Curtis, Ann-Margret, Debbie Reynolds, Jane Russell, and Sandra Dee—many of the events produced by local impresario Marc Huestis.Wiegand, David: "Marc Huestis grew up wanting to be either and actor or president. Now the filmmaker and camp impresario is using his showmanship to promote peace" , San Francisco Chronicle, July 16, 2003http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/07/16/DD9536.DTL  
In January 2008, for the filming of the Gus Van Sant biopic Milk, restorations were made to the neon on the theater's marquee and blade sign, and the facade was repainted.[tpl]citation |periodical=Cinema Treasures |title="Milk" Filming Benefits the Castro |first=Bryan |last=Krefft |date=4 February 2008 |url=http://cinematreasures.org/news/18419_0_1_0_C/ |accessdate=2008-10-28 [/tpl] The movie about the life and times of Harvey Milk, the San Francisco city Supervisor who was America's first openly gay elected official (portrayed by actor Sean Penn, who won an Academy Award for his performance), had its world premiere at the theater in November 2008.
