Nim can be played as a misère game, in which the player to take the last object loses.  Nim can also be played as a normal play game, which means that the person who makes the last move (i.e., who takes the last object) wins.  This is called normal play because most games follow this convention, even though Nim usually does not.
Normal play Nim (or more precisely the system of nimbers) is fundamental to the Sprague–Grundy theorem, which essentially says that in normal play every impartial game is equivalent to a Nim heap that yields the same outcome when played in parallel with other normal play impartial games (see disjunctive sum).
While all normal play impartial games can be assigned a nim value, that is not the case under the misère convention. Only tame games can be played using the same strategy as misère nim.
A version of Nim is played—and has symbolic importance—in the French New Wave film Last Year at Marienbad (1961).[ref]
