The introduction of family orientated concerts to the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]], which is broadcast live on Radio 3, helped the station to introduce itself to a younger audience.

Radio 3 is currently having to undergo further changes as a result of recent findings from the BBC Trust. In the station's latest service review, carried out in 2010, the Trust recommended the station become more accessible to new audiences, easier to navigate through the different genres and to review the output of the BBC's orchestras and singers.[tpl]cite web|title=BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 7 –  BBC Trust Service Review Summary|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/service_reviews/radio_347/radio_347_summary.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl] Soon after this verdict, the license fee was capped and the BBC given more services to pay for with the same level of income. As a result the corporation had to reduce its costs. In the proposal entitled Delivering Quality First, the BBC proposed that Radio 3 contribute by broadcasting 25% fewer live or specially recorded lunchtime concerts and reducing the number of specially recorded evening concerts.[tpl]cite web|title=Final Conclusions|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/dqf/final_conclusions.pdf|work=Delivering Quality First|publisher=BBC Trust|accessdate=8 July 2012|pages=17[/tpl] The Trust did recognise however that "Radio 3 plays a vital role in the cultural and creative life of the UK" and as a result, the report did agree to reinvest in the Proms, to retain the long dramas found on the station and to continue to broadcast a new concert live each evening.

==Operation==

BBC Radio 3 broadcasts from studios inside the 1930s wing of Broadcasting House in central London. However, in addition to these studios, certain programmes and performances are broadcast from other BBC bases including from BBC Cymru Wales' Cardiff headquarters and BBC North's headquarters at MediaCityUK, Salford.[tpl]cite web|title=Contact BBC Radio 3|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/?ref=/radio3/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl] The BBC also has recording facilities at the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and the Queen Elizabeth Hall which can be used to record and broadcast performances at these venues.[tpl]cite web|last=van der Woude|first=Julie|title=RFI20110939|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/foi/classes/disclosure_logs/rfi20110939_property_portfolio.pdf|work=Freedom of Information Request|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012|pages=6[/tpl]
BBC Radio 3 is broadcast on the FM band between 90.2 and 92.6 MHz as well as on DAB Digital Radio, the digital television services Freeview, Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk TV and UPC Ireland. Radio 3 programmes can also be listened to live on the Radio 3 Website through the RadioPlayer and BBC iPlayer services; the latter of these services also allows Radio 3 programmes to be heard for a week after broadcast.
On its FM frequencies, the station uses less dynamic range compression of the volume of music than rival station Classic FM. On DAB it uses dynamic range control (DRC) which allows compression to be defined by the user.Acoustics & Audio Systems: Dynamic range and compression (Microsoft Word document) "Since in-car listeners are a major audience, ... Classic FM uses it.  BBC Radio 3 (in deference to hi-fi listeners) does not use it in the evening.  Rock/pop/etc-music stations use it all the time." and regarding DAB "Classic FM apply some processing to their audio signal, which may vary from programme to programme.  BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4 do not apply processing but, in the digital signal, offer dynamic range control (DRC) which gives the listener the option of switching to a compressed form of the audio at the receiver."BBC Internet blog (search that page for "dynamic range" to find several people have observed some compression being applied to Radio 3's FM signal even in the evenings, but not as much as Classic FM)BBC Radio Labs "The FM signal has dynamic range compression applied via an Optimod processor"  (note this discussion is about The Proms, which are broadcast during the evening, so the source above which said it isn't applied in the evening doesn't appear to be correct)The Guardian: Ask Jack (BBC) "The BBC's online iPlayer gives the best quality with Radio 3 for two reasons. First, it uses a higher-quality codec than the other digital systems. Second, it and does not have any dynamic range compression (DRC) ... On FM, Radio 3 uses DRC to reduce the dynamic range ... People vary in their sensitivity to ... the effects of DRC, so I'm sympathetic to those who prefer FM to iPlayer, or vinyl to CD, or vice versa. However, an iPlayer signal should sound better if reproduced via the same hi-fi system."
The station also uses a BBC designed NICAM style digitisation technique called pulse code modulation, which is used for outside broadcasts running through a telephone line, which runs at a sample rate of 14,000 per second per channel.[tpl]fact|date=September 2013[/tpl] A similar technique was later used for recording at the same rate. In September 2010, for the final week of the Proms broadcasts, the BBC trialled XHQ (Extra High Quality), a live internet stream transmitted at a rate of 320kbit/s, instead of Radio 3's usual 192kbit/s, using its AAC-LC 'Coyopa' coding technology.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/09/bbc_proms_extra_high_quality_audio.html |publisher=BBC Internet Blog, 3 September 2010 |title=Listening to the Proms in Extra High Quality |accessdate=5 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908004158/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/09/bbc_proms_extra_high_quality_audio.html| archivedate= 8 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This technology was later developed so that Radio 3 is now the first BBC Radio station to be broadcasting permanently in this High Definition Sound (as it has been termed) format.[tpl]cite web|title=Radio 3 – Help – HD Sound|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/help/hd-sound.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Notable programmes==

===Choral Evensong===

The Anglican service of sung Evening Prayer is broadcast weekly on Radio 3 live from cathedrals, university college chapels and churches throughout the UK.[tpl]cite web|title=Choral Evensong|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp7r|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl] On occasion, it carries Choral Vespers from Catholic cathedrals, such as Westminster Cathedral, or a recorded service from choral foundations abroad. Choral Evensong is the BBC’s longest-running outside broadcast programme, the first edition having been relayed from Westminster Abbey on 7 October 1926. Its 80th anniversary was celebrated, also live from Westminster Abbey, with a service on 11 October 2006.[tpl]cite web|title=Choral Evensong 80th Anniversary|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/choralevensong/pip/mi0rz/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl]
The programme has a strong following,[tpl]cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article659914.ece |title=Paul Donovan, Radio Waves: Praise Be |publisher=Sunday Times, 8 October 2006 |accessdate=3 November 2008 | location=London  | date=8 October 2006[/tpl] revealed by various unpopular attempts in the past to change the broadcast arrangements. When the programme was moved from Radio 4 to Radio 3 in 1970 it became a monthly broadcast but vigorous protests resulted in a return of the weekly transmission on Wednesday afternoons.[tpl]rp|262–263[/tpl]
More recently, in 2007 the live broadcast was switched to Sundays which again resulted in protests.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=29081 | title=Protests at move for radio evensong |publisher=Church Times, 17 November 2006 |accessdate=3 November 2008[/tpl] The live transmission was returned to Wednesdays in September 2008 with a recorded repeat on Sunday afternoons. Choral Evensong forms part of Radio 3's remit on religious programming though the musical performance and repertoire holds interest for a wider audience.

===Composer of the Week===

Composer of the Week is claimed as the longest-running classical music programme in Britain, having been launched in August 1943.Paul Donovan, Roll over, Beethoven, Sunday Times, Culture supplement, 10 August 2003, pp. 14–15 It was first broadcast on the Third Programme, under its original title of This Week’s Composer, in 1964 when the station’s daytime broadcasting began.[tpl]rp|231[/tpl] Each week, in five daily programmes, the work of a particular composer is studied in detail and illustrated with musical excerpts. Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Handel  have all featured once most years, a different aspect of their work being chosen for study each time. However, the programme also covers more 'difficult' or less-widely known composers, with weeks devoted to Rubbra, Medtner, Havergal Brian and the Minimalists among others. The regular presenter is currently Donald Macleod. In 2 August 2013, in honour of its 70th year, listeners were asked to nominate a composer, who had never before been featured, for a special broadcast at Christmas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio3/posts/Composer-of-the-Week-at-70 |title=Composer of the Week at 70 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]

===CD Review===

CD Review is a Saturday morning programme dealing with new classical music releases, topical issues and interviews. The programme title is an update of Record Review which was broadcast on Network Three occasionally from 1949, then weekly from 1957. It includes the feature Building a Library which surveys and recommends available recordings of specific works. In 2006 Building a Library was attacked as 'elitist' for including such composers as Karl Amadeus Hartmann and Elliott Carter and lesser-known works of great composers, at the expense of well-known mainstream works.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/15/broadcasting.arts |title=Martin Kettle, Hijacked by specialists |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=3 November 2008 | location=London | date=15 February 2006[/tpl] However, the charge was rebutted by the programme's producer, Mark Lowther, who said that Radio 3 audiences wanted programmes that challenged and inspired.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/21/broadcasting.arts  |title=Mark Lowther, Radio 3 audiences want the standard repertoire – and more |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=3 November 2008 | location=London | date=21 February 2006[/tpl] The regular presenter of CD Review is Andrew McGregor.[tpl]cite web|title=CD Review – Andrew McGregor|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tmtz/profiles/andrewmcgregor|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl]

===Jazz Record Requests===

Jazz Record Requests was the first weekly jazz programme on the Third Programme. First presented by the jazz musician Humphrey Lyttelton, the 30-minute programme was launched in December 1964 and is still running. Now an hour long, it is still broadcast on Saturday, usually in the late afternoon. Presenters on Radio 3 have included Steve Race, Peter Clayton, Charles Fox and Geoffrey Smith. The current presenter, since May 2012, is Alyn Shipton.Jazz Record Requests programme page

===Pied Piper===

Pied Piper was an iconic children’s programme, presented by the 29-year-old early music specialist, David Munrow, it had the sub-title Tales and Music for Younger Listeners[tpl]rp|265[/tpl] and ran from August 1971 until 1976. Lively and varied, it was aimed at the 6–12 age group, though  much older children and adults also listened.[tpl]rp|266[/tpl] The programme ran for five series and a total of 655 episodes until it was brought to an end by Munrow’s untimely death in May 1976.

==News broadcasts==

BBC Radio 3's remit focuses mainly on music and the arts and news is therefore a minor part of its output. However the station still provides short news bulletins through the Breakfast programme, at 1 pm and in the early evening on weekdays to give listeners the chance to switch to another station, for example BBC Radio 4 or BBC Radio 5 Live, should a news item interest or affect them in any way.[tpl]cite web|title=No answers|url=http://www.for3.org/news/for3news/for3news.html#Oct11No|publisher=Friends of Radio 3|accessdate=10 July 2012|quote=What’s very important is just to give them when they come to Radio 3, to give them a sense if there is something they would actually want to develop further on Radio 4, on 5Live or on a BBC local radio service, then they can go elsewhere and get that news.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Feedback – 07/10/2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015ctwb|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl] Following the Delivering Quality First proposals, it was suggested that Radio 3 share bulletins with Radio 4, so that the same bulletins would be prepared and announced on both channels.
The newsreading team includes Catriona Young, Vaughan Savidge, Jill Anderson, Ian Skelly, David McNeil, Alison Rooper, John Shea and Susan Rae. Paul Guinery has been described as "an exemplary reader".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/gillian-reynolds/8804758/Yet-more-witless-wittering-on-Radio-3-review.html |title=Yet more witless wittering on Radio 3: review |author=Gillian Reynolds |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2013[/tpl]

==Performing Groups==

Much of Radio 3's orchestral output is sourced from the BBC's Orchestras and Singers. These groups are:
In addition to the BBC's own orchestras it also has broadcast commitments to the BBC Big Band, which is externally managed, and also broadcasts some works of the Ulster Orchestra, which it part funds.[tpl]cite web|title=About Us – Thanks|url=http://www.ulsterorchestra.com/aboutus/thanks.php|publisher=Ulster Orchestra|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl]

==Controllers==

==Controversy==

Controller Nicholas Kenyon summed up[tpl]when|date=August 2013[/tpl] the perennial problem of Radio 3 as "the tension between highbrow culture and popular appeal …the cost of what we do and the number of people who make use of it":[tpl]rp|364[/tpl] elitism versus populism (or 'dumbing down') and the question of cost per listener. This argument has included members of the BBC, listeners and several different protest groups.
In 1969, two hundred members of the BBC staff protested to the director general at changes which would ‘emasculate’ Radio 3, while managing director of radio Ian Trethowan described the station in a memorandum as "a private playground for elitists to indulge in cerebral masturbation".[tpl]rp|255[/tpl] Later, former Radio 3 controller John Drummond complained that the senior ranks of the BBC took no interest in what he was doing.Drummond (2001), p.365
The Gambaccini issue arose in 1995/6 as listeners and press critics protested the introduction into a slot formerly used for Composer of the Week of a program presented by Paul Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 and Classic FM presenter. This was seen as part of a wider move towards popularisation, to compete with Classic FM and to increase ratings.[tpl]rp|357–358[/tpl] Gambaccini is quoted as saying: “I had a specific mission to invite 4’s Today listeners to stay with the BBC rather than go to Classic FM.”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960215/debtext/60215-21.htm |title=Parliamentary Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport|date=15 February 1996 |at= column 1194 |accessdate=27 December 2008[/tpl]
Several groups have been formed in the past to protest against any changes to the station. These have included:
