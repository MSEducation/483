[[1973 Acropolis Rally]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 World Rally Championship season, Acropolis Rally, 1973 in Greek sport

The 1973 Acropolis Rally was the 21st running of the Acropolis Rally, and the fifth round of the inaugural World Rally Championship season.  Run in late-May on the punishing hot gravel roads of central Greece, the Acropolis is a long-standing event on the WRC calendar.
In 1973, and for several years afterward, only manufacturers were given points for finishes in WRC events.  In Greece, the Alpine Renault team had another strong showing, with their fourth win of the year.  Driver Jean-Luc Th√©rier became the first driver to win two WRC rallies with his victory here.
