Yanchep is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), [tpl]convert|42|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Perth. The park is noted for its caves, native bush and koala colonies. It also offers cultural educational programmes offered in partnership with the local Nyoongar aboriginal people.

==History==

The area was inhabited and was a noted hunting site for thousands of years by Indigenous Australians prior to the arrival of Europeans. The tribal name for the park is Nyanyi-Yandjip named after the reeds and lake which were thought to resemble the hairy mane of the dreamtime creature the Waugul.
The word Yanchep is derived from Yandjip or Yanget which is the aboriginal name for the local bulrush reed found fringing the lakes in the area.[tpl]cite web|title=Philosophy of National Parks|url=http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2008.0012/02Venn,%20Darren_ch.1-4.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2010[/tpl]
The first European visitor arrived in 1834 when John Butler, a farmer, came in search of his lost cattle and noted the presence of the lakes, wetlands and plentiful game.[tpl]cite web|title=Yanchep National Park Management Plan 1989-1999|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/nature/management/yanchep_np.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl] While in the area Butler was greeted by the  men of the Yellagonga peoples who inhabited the area.

The first settler to arrive in the area was Henry White who arrived in 1901 and built his house near the north west shore of Yonderup Lake, he was later appointed as a caretaker and guide in 1903.
