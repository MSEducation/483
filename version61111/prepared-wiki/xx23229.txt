The Adventures of Robin Hood is a 1938 American swashbuckler film directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, and Claude Rains. Written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller, the film is about a Saxon knight who, in King Richard's absence in the [[Holy Land[[ on Crusade, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed in Technicolor.

==Plot==

When Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter), the King of England, is taken captive by Leopold of Austria while returning from the Crusades, his brother John (Claude Rains) takes power and proceeds to oppress the Saxon commoners. Prince John raises their taxes, supposedly to raise Richard's ransom, but in reality to secure his own position on the throne.
One man stands in his way, a minor Saxon knight, Sir Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn). Robin acquires a loyal follower when he saves Much (Herbert Mundin) from being arrested by  Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) for poaching in Sherwood Forest, having killed one of the king's deer to feed his family. Robin goes alone to see Prince John at Gisbourne's castle in Nottingham and announces to John's assembled supporters and a contemptuous Lady Marian Fitzwalter known as Maid Marian (Olivia DeHavilland) that he will do all in his power to oppose John warning him that he will "exact a death for a death" and restore Richard to his rightful place.  John's nobles attempt to capture him but, in spite of their efforts, Robin escapes.
With his lands and castle now forfeit and with a price on his head, Robin flees with his friend Will Ã  Gamwell (Patric Knowles) who, due to his red clothing, is known as Will Scarlet. They take refuge in Sherwood where they meet John Little whom they merriily nickname Little John (Alan Hale, Sr.), recruited by Robin after John trounces him in a bruising quarterstaff bout. Throughout the north of England men join their growing band, the Merry Men. During this time Robin meets and provokes the rotund Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette) into a swordfight. When the friar shows that he can give as good as he gets Robin persuades him to join his band of outlaws to provide them with spiritual comfort. 
Now known as the outlaw Robin Hood, he binds his men by an oath, to fight for a free England till King Richard returns. They are to rob the rich only to give to the poor, and to treat all women with courtesy, "rich or poor, Norman or Saxon." In a short time Prince John's Norman and Angevin cronies find themselves harassed beyond endurance with many of their troops receiving swift and deadly retribution for their abuses, courtesy of the Merry Men's black arrows, the sign of their rebellion.
One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting taxes through Sherwood. Among Robin's "guests" are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper), and Lady Marian. Robin and his men "liberate" the tax money, swearing to a man to contribute it towards King Richard's ransom. Marian is at first disdainful of Robin and his "band of cut-throats" but, seeing his beneficence in caring for hunted, maimed and dispossessed Saxon families, she becomes convinced of his good intentions and begins to see the reality of the Norman brutality. Noting that among the men being cared for is a Norman she wonders that Robin has assisted him. Robin readily replies, "Norman or Saxon, what's that matter? It's injustice I hate, not the Normans." Marian now admires Robin for his goodness and bravery. Eventually Robin allows the humiliated Gisbourne and sheriff to depart Sherwood on foot, dressed in rags, "a lesson in humility, if not in mercy," telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for his sparing their lives.
Incensed at the loss of 50,000 golden marks with which he planned to pay off supporters Prince John furiously blames the Sheriff and Sir Guy of nincompoopery. Hoping on a return to favor the Sheriff comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin ny announcing an archery tournament. With the grand prize being a golden arrow to be presented by the Lady Marian, the Sheriff is sure that Robin will be unable to resist the challenge. All goes as planned; Robin identifies himself by winning the competition and is taken prisoner. Gisbourne sentences him to be hanged.  Marian, however, finds Robin's men to plan an escape. The Merry Men manage to rescue Robin on his way to the gallows. Later, in dark of night, the outlaw sneaks into the castle to thank Marion. She and Robin pledge their love for each other. Robin wants her to come away with him to Sherwood but Marian refuses, convincing Robin she can be of more service by remaining near Gisbourne and the Sheriff so she can warn him of further treachery.
Meanwhile, disguised as a band of merchants, King Richard and a few of his loyal knights return to England. Dining at an inn the king is recognized by the villainous Bishop of the Black Canons (Montague Love) who overhears one of Richard's men call him "sire".  The traitorous bishop hurries to inform Prince John. Upon receiving the news, John and Gisbourne plot to dispose of Richard quietly before he can raise an army. Dickon Malbete (Harry Cording), a disgraced former knight and Gisbourne's chief henchman, is sent to assassinate the king in return for the restoration of his rank and Robin's manor and estate. Marian overhears them and writes a note warning Robin, but Gisbourne finds it and has her arrested. Although she is a royal ward whom only the king can condemn to death for treason John assures her that the law will be observed for, in 48 hours, after he is crowned, he will order her death for treason. Marian's nurse, Bess (Una O'Connor), has been keeping company with Much at the Saracen's Head tavern. She anxiously informs him of Richard's reappearance and begs him to find Robin to save Marian. Much hastens off, intercepts and, after a desperate struggle, kills Dickon. 
Seeking Robin, King Richard and his escort disguise themselves as wealthy monks and journey to Sherwood Forest. Accosted by Robin who seeks the monks' money for the poor Richard assures him that he is traveling on the king's business. Robin happily invites him to dine in the forest. Will comes across the injured Much and takes him back to the outlaws. Much explains that Richard has returned and that Dickon has been sent to do away with him. He dissuades Robin from sending men out to intercept Dickon. There is no need, says Much since, "He ain't gonna murder no one no more."  Much tells Robin how John intends to have himself crowned king in Nottingham the next day by the Bishop of the Black Canons. He has no idea where the king is. Robin, anxious to protect Richard, dispatches his men to find him. Certain now of Robin's loyalty Richard and his men remove their monks' robes and receive the Merry Men's homage. 
Knowing that the castle is too strong to take by force, Robin uses guile. He and the king visit the bishop and "persuading" him to include in his entourage the outlaw band and Richard's knights, all disguised as monks. Through this ruse they gain entry to the castle and interrupt John's coronation. A melee breaks out during which Robin and Gisbourne engage in a prolonged fight with broadswords. Gisbourne is finally slain and Robin rescues Marian from her cell where she has been praying while awaiting rescue or death.
Richard is restored to the throne; he exiles his brother, the sheriff and the bishop, pardons the outlaws and ennobles Robin as Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. He then 'orders' him to marry the Lady Marian who accepts, "with all my heart." Robin and Marian sneak to the door of the great hall. With a twinkle in his eye the former outlaw  exclaims, "May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire!"

==Production==

The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed on location in various areas of California and in Union, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. Don Beckman, the set director built a replica of the set in Union, Washington. Today twohttp://www.robinhoodvillageresort.com/ of five original cottages are still in use.
Bidwell Park in Chico stood in for Sherwood Forest,The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations by Tony Reeves. The Titan Publishing Group. Pg.14 http://www.movie-locations.com/films.html although one major scene was filmed at the California locations "Lake Sherwood" and "Sherwood Forest", so named because they were the location sites for the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of Robin Hood. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at Busch Gardens in Pasadena.
James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his contract with Warner Bros., paving the way for Flynn, although filming was postponed three years.Tony Thomas, Rudy Behlmer * Clifford McCarty, The Films of Errol Flynn, Citadel Press, 1969 p 62-67

Stunt men and bit players, padded with balsa wood on metal plates, were paid $150 per arrow for being shot by professional archer Howard Hill, although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, was cast as Owen the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham castle and, later, defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. An examination of the film images in slow motion led to speculation[tpl]who|date=December 2012[/tpl] that the arrow split may have been made of bamboo and had been previously split, the parts being held together with small rings. Buster Wiles - a stuntman and close friend of Errol Flynn - maintains that the arrow splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, My Days With Errol Flynn.

==Reception==

==Legacy==

Due to the movie's popularity, Errol Flynn's name and image became inextricably linked with that of Robin Hood in the public eye, even more so than Douglas Fairbanks, who had played the role previously in 1922.[tpl]cite news|title= Classic Hollywood: 100 years of Robin Hood movies|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=May 12, 2010|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/12/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood-20100512|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=Susan|last=King[/tpl]
This was the third film to pair Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (after Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade).  They would ultimately star together in eight films.
Scenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly.  For instance, in the Bugs Bunny animated short film, Rabbit Hood, Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John that "Robin Hood will soon be here." When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, "It couldn't be him!"). Other parodies were Daffy Duck and Porky Pig in Robin Hood Daffy and Goofy and Black Pete in Goof Troop's Goofin' Hood & His Melancholy Men.
A fragment of one of the film's sword fighting scenes was converted to sprites by Jordan Mechner and used for his 1989 platform game Prince of Persia.[tpl]cite speech|title=Classic Game Postmortem: PRINCE OF PERSIA|first=Jordan|last=Mechner|authorlink=Jordan Mechner|event=Game Developers Conference|location=San Francisco, California|date=2011|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014634/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PRINCE-OF|accessdate=30 May 2013|time=38:35[/tpl]
