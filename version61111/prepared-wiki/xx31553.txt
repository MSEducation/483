</ref>  A little-used railway line even crossed the main concourse on the level and passed through an archway in the station building to connect to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]]'s smaller station, now [[Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]], whose tracks lie almost perpendicular to those of Waterloo. Passengers were, not surprisingly, confused by the layout and by the two adjacent stations called 'Waterloo'.
From 1897 there had also been the adjacent Necropolis Company station.[ref]

This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics for many years in the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat (see below).

===Rebuilding===

In 1898 the company opened the Waterloo & City line, a 'tube' underground railway that ran directly between Waterloo and the City. This gave the company the direct commuter service it had long desired (albeit with the need to change from surface to underground lines at Waterloo). With Waterloo now destined to remain a terminus station, and with the old station becoming a source of increasingly bad will and publicity amongst the travelling public, the L&SWR decided on total rebuilding.
Legal powers to carry out the work were granted in 1899, and extensive groundwork and slum clearance were carried out until 1904, when construction on the terminus proper began. The new station was opened in stages, the first five new platforms opening in 1910. Construction continued sporadically throughout the First World War, and the new station finally opened in 1922 with 21 platforms and a concourse nearly [tpl]convert|800|ft|m|0[/tpl] long. The new station included a large stained glass window depicting the L&SWR's company crest over the main road entrance, surrounded by a frieze listing the counties served by the railway (the latter still survives today). These features were retained in the design despite the fact that by the time the station opened the 1921 Railway Act had been passed which spelt the end of the L&SWR as an independent concern. The main pedestrian entrance, the Victory Arch (known as Exit 5), is a memorial to company staff who were killed during the two world wars. Damage to the station in World War II required considerable repair but entailed no significant changes of layout.
A past curiosity of Waterloo was that a spur led to the adjoining dedicated London Necropolis railway station of the London Necropolis Company, from which funeral trains, at one time daily, ran to Brookwood Cemetery bearing coffins at 2/6 each. This station was destroyed during World War II.HistoryPlace.com[tpl]dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Ownership of Waterloo underwent a succession, broadly typical of many British stations. Under the 1923 Grouping it passed to the Southern Railway (SR), then in the 1948 nationalisation to British Railways. Following the privatisation of British Rail, ownership and management passed to Railtrack in April 1994 and finally in 2002 to Network Rail.

===Eurostar===

Platforms 20 and 21 were lost to the Waterloo International railway station site, which from November 1994 to November 2007 was the London terminus of Eurostar international trains to Paris and Brussels. Construction necessitated the removal of decorative masonry forming two arches from that side of the station, bearing the legend "Southern Railway". This was re-erected at the private Fawley Hill Museum of Sir William McAlpine, whose company built Waterloo International. Waterloo International closed when the Eurostar service transferred to the new St Pancras railway station with the opening of the second phase of "HS1", High Speed route 1, also known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link or CTRL. Ownership of the former Waterloo International terminal then passed to BRB (Residuary) Ltd.

==Station facilities==

The major transport interchange at Waterloo comprises London Waterloo, Waterloo East, the Underground station (which includes the Waterloo and City line to Bank, known informally as 'The Drain'), and several bus stops. There are over 130 automated ticket gates on the station concourse, plus another 27 in the subway below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bprarchitects.com/projects/transport/waterloo_station_atg_installation.html|title=Waterloo Station ATG Installation|publisher=BPR Architects|quote=over 130 automated ticket gates on the concourse and an additional 27 in the subway below[/tpl]
Waterloo station connects to Waterloo East railway station, across Waterloo Road, by a high-level walkway, constructed mostly above the previous walkway which used the bridge of the former connecting curve.

===Retail balcony===

Network Rail has constructed a balcony along almost the whole width of the concourse at the first-floor level. The project's aims were to provide 18 new retail spaces and a champagne bar, reduce congestion on the concourse, and improve access to Waterloo East station by providing additional escalators leading to the high-level walkway between Waterloo and Waterloo East. Retail and catering outlets have been removed from the concourse to make more circulation space. First-floor offices have been converted into replacement and additional retail and catering spaces. Work was completed in July 2012, at a cost of Â£25 million.[tpl]cite press release |title= Work starts at Waterloo Station to create 20,000 sq ft of new retail space |url= http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Press-Releases/WORK-STARTS-AT-WATERLOO-STATION-TO-CREATE-20-000-SQ-FT-OF-NEW-RETAIL-SPACE-171b.aspx |publisher =Network Rail |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Press-Releases/MORE-SPACE-FOR-WATERLOO-COMMUTERS-AS-FIRST-STAGE-OF-REDEVELOPMENT-COMPLETES-1aac.aspx|title=More space for Waterloo commuters as first stage of redevelopment completes |publisher=Network Rail |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Press-Releases/WATERLOO-STATION-S-NEW-220m-BALCONY-OPENS-TO-REDUCE-CONGESTION-IN-TIME-FOR-OLYMPIC-GAMES-1b1a.aspx |title=Waterloo Station's new 220m balcony opens to reduce congestion in time for Olympic Games |publisher=Network Rail |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl]

===Police station===

For many years there was a British Transport Police police station at Waterloo by the Victory Arch, with a custody suite of three cells. Although it was relatively cramped, until the late 1990s over 40 police officers operated from it.[ref]
