CATEGORIES: Districts of Lambeth, Areas of London

West Norwood is a largely residential area of South London within the London Borough of Lambeth. It borders the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark. It is located is 5.4 miles (8.7 km) south south-east of Charing Cross.
The centre of West Norwood sits in a bowl surrounded by hillsides on its east, west and south sides.  From many places in the area, distant views can be seen, including glimpses of the City, Canary Wharf, Crystal Palace, Dulwich and the ridge at Leigham Court Road.
The main shopping area is in Norwood Road which is characterised by the high percentage of independent shops with a modest number of major retailers.  A new facility, Norwood Hall, is due to open in 2014.  It will offer leisure facilities including swimming, gym, dance studio and community space as well as health resources, both GP and dental.
At the focus of the shopping parades on Norwood Road and Knights Hill is St Luke’s church and gardens.  Consecrated in 1825, St Luke's is one of the so-called "Waterloo" churches.  To its eastern side is West Norwood Cemetery, one of the “Magnificent Seven” which has the greatest number of Listed cemetery monuments of any in England, attracting many visitors.
The area is well served by public transport with London National Rail stations at each end of the main shopping area: West Norwood and Tulse Hill from which there are frequent services to Victoria and London Bridge, as well as surrounding locations.  There are eight daytime bus routes and two nighttime.  The South Circular A205 passes close-by at Tulse Hill with A23 Streatham High Road to the west.
West Norwood includes some or all of three Wards of the London Borough of Lambeth - Gipsy Hill, Knights Hill and Thurlow Park. Each of these wards is represented on Lambeth Council by three councillors.[tpl]cite web|title=Lambeth Councillors by Ward|url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/moderngov/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&J=3|accessdate=2013-02-11[/tpl]

==History==

"Norwood" recalls the "Great North Wood", a name that was formerly used for the hilly and wooded area to the north of Croydon. Before 1885 West Norwood station and the surrounding area was known as Lower Norwood, reflecting its being at a lower altitude than Upper Norwood.
John Rocque's 1745 map of London and the surrounding area includes the Horns Tavern at Knight's Hill, opposite what is now the main entrance to West Norwood station, with a largely undeveloped valley stretching to 'Island Green' in the north, approximately where Herne Hill railway station stands now. The enclosure map of 50 years later show that little of the original woodland remained by then, other than a few coppices.
The future development of West Norwood was assisted by the Lambeth Manor Enclosure Act of 1806. Much of the land covered by this Act was owned either by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by Lord Thurlow, who died in the same year.
Most of the current main roads were either ancient or laid out in accordance with the provisions of the enclosure award. The River Effra ran alongside the current Elder Road, in a northerly direction, and was prone to flooding.
The area was over a mile from the nearest parish church (at St Leonard, Streatham), so St. Luke's was provided under the Waterloo church scheme and completed in 1825. The houses in the parish at that period consisted largely of substantial villas along the main roads and more humble cottages mainly situated between Knights Hill and the High Street. The South Metropolitan Cemetery was laid out in 1837 to provide burial facilities largely for the population of crowded areas that were closer to the centre of London.
The railway line from London to the Crystal Palace was opened in 1856 with a station at Lower Norwood (since renamed West Norwood). These improved communications heralded major changes. Many of the larger houses and gardens were demolished and replaced with predominantly more modest housing over the next four decades.
Norwood High Street contained the earliest group of shops in the area but never developed into a major shopping centre, as the main shopping parades were built during the decades around 1900 along Norwood Rd between York Hill and West Norwood station. Horse-drawn trams shuttled passengers along this road from the terminus in front of St Luke's Church towards the middle of London.
Extensive anecdotal and other historical material from the 19th and early 20th centuries has been written up by Mr J B Wilson, a local undertaker.J.B. Wilson & H.A. Wilson The Story of Norwood ISBN 0-9515384-1-1
The two world wars witnessed fatalities and bomb damage to many buildings in the area, with York Hill and the areas around the railway suffering particularly badly. Chatsworth Baptist church had to be rebuilt after a direct hit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark_fullsize&id=126 |title=Chatsworth Way, West Norwood: World War II Incident |publisher=Landmark.lambeth.gov.uk |date=1944-09-18 |accessdate=2012-06-01[/tpl] Many of the post-war estates were built on bomb sites or replaced areas which had experienced damage.
An Art Deco cinema, named The Regal, was built at 304 Norwood Road in the late 1920s. It was designed by architect F Edward Jones (who also designed Madame Tussaud's) and opened on 16 January 1930. The cinema sat 2,010 and was equipped with a Christie Manual organ. The cinema closed on 8 February 1964 with a double screening of Peter Sellers' I'm Alright Jack and Two Way Stretch. Following its closure, the building became a Top Rank Bingo Club a few months later and remained open until 1978. The building was demolished in November 1981 and a B&Q store can be seen today on the site.http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark&id=12160
After the Second World War, a considerable amount of council housing was constructed in West Norwood. The York Hill, Fern Lodge, Portobello and Holderness Estates arose during the late 1940s and the 1950s on the sites of houses with large gardens that had been destroyed by bombing or were simply demolished. Later houses and flats, such as in the Dunbar Street area, took the place of Victorian dwellings that were cleared away as slums or, alternatively, to achieve a higher density of development. The Woodvale Estate in Elder Road was erected on the site of the "Lambeth New Schools", which had been part of the local Workhouse and that had been renamed as "Wood Vale" before demolition.[tpl]cite web|title=Lambeth Workhouse|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Lambeth/|accessdate=2013-02-11[/tpl]
Parts of West Norwood have been declared conservation areas including the area around the cemetery, Lancaster Avenue and Rosendale Road. Local landmarks such as St Luke's Church, the late Victorian fire station (now the South London Theatre) on Norwood High Street, by the architect Robert Pearsall.,[tpl]cite web|title=London’s Oldest Operational Fire Station|url=http://e-shootershill.co.uk/closure-threat-for-londons-oldest-operational-fire-station/|work=e-shootershill.co.uk|accessdate=23 December 2013[/tpl] the present-day fire station at Norwood Road and the original public library at Knights Hill are Grade II listed buildings.

===Knights Hill===

Confusingly, there are two areas called Knight's Hill nearby; the names of both areas have similar origins, both belonging to Thomas Knyght in 1545, and in the south was known as Knight's Hill Common while the hill to the north was known as Knight's Hill Farm.
The southern Knight's Hill Common originally formed part of Lambeth Manor, and contained land called Julian's, which is remembered through the street name of St Julian's Farm Road.
The hill formed the nucleus of the vast estate in Lambeth and Streatham that Lord Thurlow acquired during the 18th Century,Norwood: Introduction Survey of London: volume 26: Lambeth: Southern area (1956) 17 March 2008]

===The Jewish Orphanage===

The main building of the Norwood Home for Jewish Children ("The Jewish Orphanage") was completed in 1862. It was a three storey edifice, with the appearance of a Jacobean palace[tpl]cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark_fullsize&id=8622 |title=landmark.lambeth.gov.uk |publisher=Landmark.lambeth.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01[/tpl] This structure was demolished in 1963, after the children had moved in groups to live in nine houses supervised by house parents in a less institutional environment, meeting for communal activities at a new synagogue built on the original site. In the 1970s, the charity started to move out of the area entirely and the main site was sold to Lambeth Council, which developed much of it for a housing estate, keeping only a small area beside the railway line as open space. An account of a boy's experiences of living at the Orphanage between 1928 and 1933 can found online.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story249/story249.htm?identifier=stories/story249/story249.htm&ProjectNo=9 |title=Reminiscences of a Childhood in the Jewish Orphanage |accessdate=2013-02-09[/tpl]
Of the original buildings only the porter's lodge off Knights Hill now remains, its curving Dutch-gables, red brick with black diaperwork and mullioned windows echoing the design of the main 3-storey institution. The Arnold & Jane Gabriel Home was built on the Wolfington Road frontage of the orphanage in 1910; it was converted into a primary school in 2012, with extensions still under construction in February 2013.
The charity that operated the orphanage in West Norwood retains an echo of its previous location in its current name Norwood.
