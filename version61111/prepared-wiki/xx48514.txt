Rhyme Pays is the debut album of Ice-T, released in 1987.
The album, especially tracks like "6 'N the Mornin'," is considered to have defined the gangsta genre, and was the first hip hop album to carry a Parental Advisory warning label, although it was years before the industry-standard explicit-lyrics sticker was developed.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |author=Ice T |coauthors=Sigmund, Heidi |editor= |others= |title=The Ice Opinion |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1994 |publisher=Pan/St. Martin's Press/Macmillan Books |location= |language= |isbn=0-330-33629-0 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=163 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] The 1988 CD release included four bonus tracks.
