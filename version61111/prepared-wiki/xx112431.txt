The Arizona Rhinos are a basketball team in the American Basketball Association set to begin play in 2008-09. Based in Prescott Valley, the Rhinos will play their home games at Tim's Toyota Center.  The Rhinos' stated goal is to "bring integrity and tradition back to the court," with on-and-off-court policies that mirror Christian values.  The Rhinos will compete for talent and fans with fellow Arizona ABA team, the Phoenix Fury.
A previous team called the Arizona Rhinos was a proposed expansion team scheduled to join the ABA for the 2005 season, to play in or around Phoenix, Arizona. After consideration, it was decided that they no longer wished to be affiliated with the ABA.  No word has been heard from them since.
