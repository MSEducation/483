[[Goldbach's weak conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Additive number theory, Analytic number theory, Conjectures about prime numbers

In number theory, Goldbach's weak conjecture, also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture, the ternary Goldbach problem, or the 3-primes problem, states that:
Some state the conjecture as:
This version excludes 7 = 2+2+3 because this requires the even prime 2. Helfgott's claim covers both versions of the conjecture.

In 1923, Hardy and Littlewood showed that, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, the odd Goldbach conjecture is true for all sufficiently large odd numbers. In 1937, Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov eliminated the dependency on the generalised Riemann hypothesis and proved directly (see Vinogradov's theorem) that all sufficiently large odd numbers can be expressed as the sum of three primes. Vinogradov's original proof, as it used the ineffective Siegel–Walfisz theorem, did not give a bound for "sufficiently large"; his student K. Borozdin proved that 3315 is large enough.Golomb gives the date of Borozdin's proof as 1956; in contrast, Tao states that it was "soon after" Vinogradov's 1937 proof.

In 1997, Deshouillers, Effinger, te Riele and Zinoviev published a result showing[tpl]cite journal|title=A complete Vinogradov 3-primes theorem under the Riemann hypothesis|author=Deshouillers, Effinger, Te Riele and Zinoviev|journal=Electronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society|volume=3|pages=99–104|year=1997|url=http://www.ams.org/era/1997-03-15/S1079-6762-97-00031-0/S1079-6762-97-00031-0.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1090/S1079-6762-97-00031-0|issue=15[/tpl] that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies Goldbach's weak conjecture for all numbers. This result combines a general statement valid for numbers greater than 1020 with an extensive computer search of the small cases.  Saouter also conducted a computer search covering the same cases at approximately the same time.[tpl]cite journal|title=Checking the odd Goldbach Conjecture up to 1020|author=Yannick Saouter|journal=Mathematics of Computation|volume=67|pages=863–866|year=1998|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1998-67-222/S0025-5718-98-00928-4/S0025-5718-98-00928-4.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-98-00928-4 |issue=222[/tpl]
Olivier Ramaré in 1995 showed that every even number n ≥ 4 is in fact the sum of at most six primes, from which it follows that every odd number n ≥ 5 is the sum of at most seven primes. Leszek Kaniecki showed every odd integer is a sum of at most five primes, under the Riemann Hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal|title=On Šnirelman's constant under the Riemann hypothesis|last=Kaniecki|first=Leszek|journal=Acta Arithmetica|volume=72|year=1995|pages=361–374|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa72/aa7246.pdf[/tpl] In 2012, Terence Tao proved this without the Riemann Hypothesis; this improves both results.[tpl]Cite arXiv|last=Tao |first=Terence|title=Every odd number greater than 1 is the sum of at most five primes |eprint=1201.6656v4 |year=2012 |bibcode=2012arXiv1201.6656T |class=math.NT[/tpl]
