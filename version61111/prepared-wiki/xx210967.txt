==Disputes==

Since June 2003 the company (together with sister company United Uranium) had a dispute with Shore Gold over ownership of 25 groups of mineral claims totaling over 35,000 hectares in the Fort à la Corne area of Saskatchewan. The issue was all about who was first in line at the Department of Mineral Resources of the Government of Saskatchewan to register mineral deposit claims.
On March 1, 2007 a Saskatchewan court ruled in favor of Star Uranium but on March 30, 2007 Shore Gold appealed the court ruling. On July 9, 2008, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ruled that Star Uranium and United Uranium were entitled to register mineral claims to 25 blocks of land in the Fort à la Corne area.
