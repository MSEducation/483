==Biography==

Barfoot was born on June 15, 1919, in Edinburg, Mississippi.Edinburg (ZIP Code 39051) is a small, unincorporated community in Leake County, Mississippi, about [tpl]Convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] east of Carthage. ([tpl]Coord|32.799|-89.336[/tpl]) His grandmother was Choctaw, but Barfoot himself was not an official member of the Choctaw Nation; although he was eligible, his parents had never enrolled him.[tpl]Cite book |last=Collier |first=Peter |title=Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty |publisher=Workman Publishing Company |location=New York |year=2006 |page=16 |isbn=978-1-57965-314-9[/tpl]
After enlisting in the Army from Carthage, Mississippi, in 1940 and completing his training, Barfoot served with the 1st Infantry Division in Louisiana and Puerto Rico. In December 1941, he was promoted to sergeant and re-assigned to the Headquarters Amphibious Force Atlantic Fleet in Quantico, Virginia, where he served until the unit was deactivated in 1943. He next joined the 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division, and was shipped to Europe.
During the Italian Campaign Barfoot participated in a series of amphibious landings: the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno in September, and finally the landings at Anzio in late January 1944. His unit pushed inland from Anzio, and by May 1944 had reached the town of Carano. They set up defensive positions and Barfoot conducted patrols to scout the German lines. When his company was ordered to attack on the morning of May 23, Barfoot, now a technical sergeant, asked for permission to lead a squad. Because of the patrols he had made, he knew the terrain and the minefield which lay in front of the German position. He advanced alone through the minefield, following ditches and depressions, until he came within a few yards of a machine gun on the German flank. After taking out the gun with a hand grenade, he entered the German trench and advanced on a second machine gun, killing two soldiers and capturing three others. When he reached a third gun, the entire crew surrendered to him. Others also surrendered and Barfoot captured a total of seventeen German soldiers and killed eight.
When the Germans launched an armored counterattack later in the day, Barfoot disabled one tank with a bazooka, then advanced into enemy-held territory and destroyed an abandoned German artillery piece. He returned to his own lines and helped two wounded soldiers from his squad to the rear.
Barfoot was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant. His division moved into France and by September was serving  in the Rhone valley. Barfoot learned he would be awarded the Medal of Honor and chose to have the presentation ceremony in the field, so that his soldiers could attend. He was formally presented with the medal on September 28, 1944, in Épinal, France, by Lieutenant General Alexander Patch.
Having grown up in the strictly segregated south, Barfoot was noted for a comment he made in 1945 regarding African-Americans.  Mississippi senator and Ku Klux Klan member Theodore G. Bilbo asked Barfoot if he had much trouble with the African-American soldiers he had served with during the war.  To Bilbo's embarrassment, Barfoot responded, "I found out after I did some fighting in this war that the colored boys fight just as good as the white boys...I've changed my idea a lot about colored people since I got into this war and so have a lot of other boys from the south".[tpl]cite book | last = Cobb | first = James C. | title = World War II and the Mind of the Modern South | work = Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1997 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=80-wXu1rIWMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]

He reached the rank of colonel before retiring from the Army.[tpl]Cite web |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |title = Full List of Living Recipients |url = http://www.cmohs.org/recipients/living_list_full.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-02[/tpl] In retirement he lived in Amelia County, Virginia and later, Henrico County, Virginia, near his daughter.

==Flag controversy==

In December 2009, the homeowners' association (HOA) of the Sussex Square, where Barfoot lived in Henrico County, Virginia, ordered him to remove the flagpole from which he flew the US flag. This news story first became public when Barfoot's son-in-law reported the story on local talk radio show, Elliot in the Morning. Fox News and several other national news networks picked up the story. The HOA retained Coates & Davenport to help enforce their order.http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2009/12/03/Decorated-vet-in-flagpole-row/UPI-42921259879937/ The association's bylaws do not forbid flagpoles, but the HOA ruled Barfoot, then aged 90, would not be allowed to use it "for aesthetic reasons." Barfoot contested the order,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/local/article/POLEGAT02_20091202-091201/309031/P10/ |title=Henrico Medal of Honor recipient, 90, ordered to remove flagpole |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |author=Bill McKelway |date=December 2, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=WWII Medal of Honor winner Faces Suit Over Flag-Flying |last=Chen Sampson|first=Zinie |date=December 3, 2009 |work=The Associated Press |publisher=The Virginian-Pilot |page=1 |accessdate=December 3, 2009[/tpl] and received support from politicians, including Virginia Senators Mark Warner and Jim Webb, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2009/12/ap_army_moh_recipient_flagpole_120809/ |title=Obama spokesman: MoH flagpole dispute absurd |date=Dec 8, 2009   |work=The Associated Press |publisher=Marine Corps Times |accessdate=December 8, 2009[/tpl]
