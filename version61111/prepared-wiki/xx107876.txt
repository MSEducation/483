CATEGORIES: Sydney localities

East Sydney is a small inner-city locality in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is situated immediately east of the Sydney central business district, adjacent to Hyde Park.
East Sydney is a locality within the suburbs of Darlinghurst and Woolloomooloo in the City of Sydney. With the exception of William Street, the suburb remains primarily a residential area, and council proposals for street closures in 2005 indicate that it will probably stay that way. Stanley Street and Crown Street feature many restaurants with different cuisines.
