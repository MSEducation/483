German and French were the official languages at the Eurocorps till August 2002. English is now the working language.Directive No. 2 pour le Général commandant le Corps européen from 14 November 1994: Langues au Corps européen.

===Subordinate units===

====Operational Command====

The Franco-German Brigade, with 5000 troops is the only military formation permanently under operational command of Eurocoprs, is stationed at Müllheim, Donaueschingen, Immendingen, Sigmaringen, Meßstetten, Stetten am kalten Markt, Villingen-Schwenningen in Germany and Illkirch-Grafenstaden in France.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.df-brigade.de/site_de/gesch.htm |title= History of the Franco-German Brigade (in German)|accessdate=2008-02-23 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212214138/http://www.df-brigade.de/site_de/gesch.htm  |archivedate = 12 December 2007[/tpl] Additional affiliated formations could be placed under command of Eurocorps HQ for specific operations, for example in support of EU or NATO rapid-response missions.www.info-france-usa.org. 
The five framework countries have earmarked the following units and formations to the Eurocorps:

====Affiliated units and formations====

In addition to the Franco-German Brigade a number of nations have earmarked units or formations that they have affiliated to the Eurocorps HQ. These do not come under the permanent command of Eurocorps but rather can be provided to the corps for specific operations. For example,
Except for the Franco-German Brigade and the staff of the Multinational Command Support Brigade (MNCS Bde) that are permanently under operational command of HQ Eurocorps, these national contributions remain under national command in peacetime. They become fully subordinated after Transfer of Authority has been decided by member states.
The size and type of Eurocorps units required in operations will depend on the nature and scope of assigned missions, likely employment, and the expected operational outcome. In the case that all earmarked national contributions are committed, the corps would theoretically comprise approximately 60,000.

==Deployments==

The Eurocorps participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and led KFOR III in Kosovo from 18 April 2000 to October 2000 and led the ISAF6 Force in Afghanistan from 9 August 2004 to 11 February 2005.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eurocorps.net/mission/isaf_vi_20042005/|title= International Security Assistance Force - ISAF VI on Eurocorps' official website|accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112052845/http://www.eurocorps.net/mission/isaf_vi_20042005/  |archivedate = 12 January 2008[/tpl] From 1 July 2006, to 10 January 2007, HQ Eurocorps was the land component stand by element of the NATO Response Force 7.
