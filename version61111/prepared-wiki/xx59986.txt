==History==

Suntory was started by Torii Shinjiro, who first opened his store Torii Shoten in Osaka on February 1, 1899, to sell imported wines. In 1907, the store began selling a sweet tasting red wine called Akadama Port Wine. The store became the Kotobukiya company in 1921 to further expand its business and in 1923, Torii Shinjiro built Japan’s first malt whisky distillery Yamazaki Distillery. Production began in December 1924 and five years later Suntory Whisky Sirofuda (White Label), the first single malt whisky made in Japan, was sold.
Due to wartime shortage of World War II, Kotobukiya was briefly forced to halt its development of new products, but after the war (in 1946) it re-released Torys Whisky,[tpl]efn|"Torys" from Torii Shinjiro, no apostrophe (not *"Tory's").[/tpl] which became a great hit in post-war Japan. In 1961, Kotobukiya launched the famous "Drink Torys (Whisky) and Go to Hawaii" campaign. At the time, a trip abroad was considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In 1963, Kotobukiya changed its name to "Suntory", taken from the name of the famous whisky it produces. In the same year, Musashino Beer Factory began its production of the Suntory Beer. In 1997, the company became Japan's sole bottler, distributor, and licensee of Pepsi products.
On April 1, 2009, Suntory became a stockholding company named "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Holdings Limited|サントリーホールディングス株式会社[/tpl]" and established "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Beverage and Food Limited|サントリー食品株式会社[/tpl]", "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Products Limited|サントリープロダクツ株式会社[/tpl]", "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Wellness Limited|サントリーウェルネス株式会社[/tpl]", "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Liquors Limited|サントリー酒類株式会社[/tpl]", "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Beer & Spirits Limited|サントリービア&スピリッツ株式会社[/tpl]", "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Wine International Limited|サントリーワインインターナショナル株式会社[/tpl]", and "[tpl]Nihongo|Suntory Business Expert Limited|サントリービジネスエキスパート株式会社[/tpl]".Suntory News Release on January 19, 2009 (Global website), (Japan website) - Suntory Limited

From the early 1990s, Suntory has collaborated extensively with Melbourne biotechnology firm Florigene to genetically engineer the world's first true blue rose, a symbol often associated with the impossible or unattainable. In 1991, the team won the intense global race to isolate the gene responsible for blue flowers, and has since developed a range of genetically modified flowers expressing colors in the blue spectrum, as well as a number of other breakthroughs extending the vase life of cut flowers.
In 2003, Suntory acquired a 98.5% equity holding in Florigene. Prior to this, Florigene had been a subsidiary of global agrochemicals giant Nufarm Limited since 1999. In July 2004, Suntory and Florigene scientists announced to the world the development of the first roses containing blue pigment, an important step toward the creation of a truly blue colored rose.
In July 2011, Suntory Beverage and Food Limited together with PT GarudaFood from MNC Group in Indonesia have agreed to make a new firm to produce non-alcoholic drink with 51 percent and 49 percent shares respectively. It will produce Suntory Ooolong Tea, Boss and Orangina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/16/garudafood-suntory-form-joint-venture.html |title=GarudaFood, Suntory form joint venture |work=The Jakarta Post |date=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]
