[[Carathéodory metric]]

CATEGORIES: Hyperbolic geometry, Metric geometry

In mathematics, the Carathéodory metric is a metric defined on the open unit ball of a complex Banach space that has many similar properties to the Poincaré metric of hyperbolic geometry. It is named after the Greek mathematician Constantin Carathéodory.

==Definition==

Let (X, || ||) be a complex Banach space and let B be the open unit ball in X. Let Δ denote the open unit disc in the complex plane C, thought of as the Poincaré disc model for 2-dimensional real/1-dimensional complex hyperbolic geometry. Let the Poincaré metric ρ on Δ be given by
(thus fixing the curvature to be −4). Then the Carathéodory metric d on B is defined by
What it means for a function on a Banach space to be holomorphic is defined in the article on Infinite dimensional holomorphy.

==Properties==

==Carathéodory length of a tangent vector==

There is an associated notion of Carathéodory length for tangent vectors to the ball B. Let x be a point of B and let v be a tangent vector to B at x; since B is the open unit ball in the vector space X, the tangent space TxB can be identified with X in a natural way, and v can be thought of as an element of X. Then the Carathéodory length of v at x, denoted α(x, v), is defined by
One can show that α(x, v) ≥ ||v||, with equality when x = 0.
