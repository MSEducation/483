Human capital is the stock of competencies, knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, including creativity, cognitive abilities, embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value.  It is an aggregate economic view of the human being acting within economies, which is an attempt to capture the social, biological, cultural and psychological complexity as they interact in explicit and/or economic transactions.  Many theories explicitly connect investment in human capital development to education, and the role of human capital in economic development, productivity growth, and innovation has frequently been cited as a justification for government subsidies for education and job skills training.[tpl]cite journal |first=Michael |last=Simkovic |ssrn=1941070 |title=Risk-Based Student Loans |year=2013 |journal=Washington and Lee Law Review |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=527 [/tpl]
"Human capital" has been and is still being criticized in numerous ways. Michael Spence offers signaling theory as an alternative to human capital.Michael Spence (1973). "Job Market Signaling". Quarterly Journal of Economics (The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 87, No. 3) 87 (3): 355–374. doi:10.2307/1882010. JSTOR 1882010.Michael Spence (2002). "Signaling in Retrospect and the Informational Structure of Markets". American Economic Review 92 (3): 434–459. doi:10.1257/00028280260136200. Pierre Bourdieu offers a nuanced conceptual alternative to human capital that includes cultural capital, social capital, economic capital, and symbolic capital.The Forms of Capital: English version published 1986 in J.G. Richardson's Handbook for Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 241–258. These critiques, and other debates, suggest that "human capital" is a reified concept without sufficient explanatory power.
It was assumed in early economic theories, reflecting the context, i.e., the secondary sector of the economy was producing much more than the tertiary sector was able to produce at the time in most countries – to be a fungible resource, homogeneous, and easily interchangeable, and it was referred to simply as workforce or labor, one of three factors of production (the others being land, and assumed-interchangeable assets of money and physical equipment).  Just as land became recognized as natural capital and an asset in itself, and human factors of production were raised from this simple mechanistic analysis to human capital.  In modern technical financial analysis, the term "balanced growth" refers to the goal of equal growth of both aggregate human capabilities and physical assets that produce goods and services.
The assumption that labour or workforces could be easily modelled in aggregate began to be challenged in 1950s when the tertiary sector, which demanded creativity, begun to produce more than the secondary sector was producing at the time in the most developed countries in the world.  left|400px|right|thumb|Clark's Sector model the for US economy 1850–2009[tpl]cite web|title=Who Makes It?

The role of leadership, talent, even celebrity was explored.
Today, most theories attempt to break down human capital into one or more components for analysis  http://www.sveiby.com/articles/IntellectualCapital.htmlPaolo Magrassi (2002) "A Taxonomy of Intellectual Capital", Research Note COM-17-1985, Gartner[tpl]cite journal|last=Sveiby|first=Karl Erik|year=1997|title=The Intangible Asset Monitor|journal=Journal of Human Resource Casting and Accounting|volume=2|issue=1[/tpl]– usually called "intangibles".  Most commonly, social capital, the sum of social bonds and relationships, has come to be recognized, along with many synonyms such as goodwill or brand value or social cohesion or social resilience and related concepts like celebrity or fame, as distinct from the talent that an individual (such as an athlete has uniquely) has developed that cannot be passed on to others regardless of effort, and those aspects that can be transferred or taught: instructional capital.  Less commonly, some analyses conflate good instructions for health with health itself, or good knowledge management habits or systems with the instructions they compile and manage, or the "intellectual capital" of teams – a reflection of their social and instructional capacities, with some assumptions about their individual uniqueness in the context in which they work.  In general these analyses acknowledge that individual trained bodies, teachable ideas or skills, and social influence or persuasion power, are different.
Management accounting is often concerned with questions of how to model human beings as a capital asset.  However it is broken down or defined,
human capital is vitally important for an organization's success (Crook et al., 2011); human capital increases through education and experience.[ref]
