[tpl]nihongo|Ōmisoka|大晦日|[/tpl], New Year's Eve, is the second-most important day in Japanese tradition because it is the final day of the old year and the eve of New Year's Day, which is the most important day of the year.
Around 11:00 pm on Ōmisoka at home, people often gather for one last time in the old year to have a bowl of toshikoshi-soba ([tpl]lang|ja|年越しそば[/tpl]) or toshikoshi-udon ([tpl]lang|ja|年越しうどん[/tpl]) together—a tradition based on people's association of eating the long noodles with “crossing over from one year to the next,” which is the meaning of toshi-koshi. While the noodles are often eaten plain, or with chopped scallions, in some localities people top them with tempura. Traditionally, families make Osechi ([tpl]lang|ja|おせち[/tpl]) for new year day because cooking during the first 3 days of the new year is considered unlucky. See The Kitchen god. Nowadays, most families buy Osechi or cook ordinary dishes. 
At midnight, many visit a shrine or temple for Hatsumōde ([tpl]lang|ja|初詣[/tpl]).
Another regular feature of Ōmisoka starts at 7:30 pm when public broadcaster NHK airs Kōhaku Uta Gassen ("Red vs. White singing contest"), one of the country's most-watched television programs. Popular singers (and singing groups) split into two teams, women in the red team and men in the white, which then alternate while competing for the audience's heart throughout the evening. At around 11:30 pm, the final singer (or group) sings, and the audience and a panel of judges are asked to cast their votes to decide which team sang better. The winning team gets a trophy and "the winners' flag."  The program ends at about 11:45 pm. Programming then switches to coverage of midnight celebrations around the country.
Throughout Japan, Shinto shrines prepare amazake to pass out to crowds that gather as midnight approaches. Most Buddhist temples have a large cast bell (see bonshō for photos) that is struck once for each of the 108 earthly desires believed to cause human suffering.

==Greetings==

When seeing someone for the last time before the new year, it is conventional to say 良いお年を (yoi o-toshi wo), "Have a good New Year"; once the new year has started and one sees someone again for the first time, one instead says a greeting such as 明けましておめでとう (akemashite o-medetō) "Happiness on the opening (of a new year)".

==Etymology==

Widely unknown even in Japan is the etymology of the word Ōmisoka. The kanji 晦 written as 三十 (mi-so) means 30, mi-so-ka (Kanji 晦日) refers to the 30th and last day of a month in the ancient lunar calendar. The prefix Ō (大) makes it a comparative, so it's the last of the last days of the month. The word miso itself derives from the original numeric system in Japanese: mi is the traditional word for 3, also still found in some counter word compounds such as mittsu (三つ), while the suffix -so used to be added to native numerals, thus 30 would be mi + so. In modern Japanese, Chinese loans are used instead, and 30 is pronounced san-jū (さんじゅう, "three-ten").
