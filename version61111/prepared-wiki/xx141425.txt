Certain types of foods consumed primarily as Anju include golbaengi muchim, nogari with peanuts, and jokbal.

==History==

Until the Chosun Dynasty, alcohol was mainly served in jumaks (a type of inn or tavern), where soups with rice, along with traditional alcohol such as makgeolli, were served to guests. Since the introduction of beer and Western foods into Korea, mainly from Japan in the nineteenth century, bars and pubs have enjoyed a newfound popularity, and many types of Western foods have been consumed as anju.

==By types of liquor==

Some foods are considered to be best complimented by certain types of alcohol. For example, samgyeopsal, barbecued pork belly, is considered to go best with soju, while fried chicken or Korean seasoned chicken goes well with beer. Pa-jun and mokkoli (or dongdongju) is a popular combination for rainy days.

==By the place where alcohol is served==

There are a number of different types of bars in South Korea, and each category sells different kinds of food and alcoholic beverages.
