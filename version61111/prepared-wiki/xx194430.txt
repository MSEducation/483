==History==

Poisoned Pen Press was founded in 1997 by Barbara G. Peters, Robert Rosenwald, and their daughter, Susan Malling. Peters, who had founded Scottsdale Arizona's 'The Poisoned Pen, A Mystery Bookstore' a decade ago, sees consolidations in the publishing industry as a threat to cultural diversity and to the survival of the independent bookstore.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.poisonedpenpress.com/about-us|title=Poisoned Pen Press Website - history of the company|accessdate=2008-11-30[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Poisoned Pen Press began by selling out-of-print books, but soon expanded to publish original titles.  They earned two Edgar Award nominations (1998 and 2000) and many of their books receive positive reviews in trade publications and general press.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.poisonedpenpress.com/about-us/about-us/interview-with-barbara-peters|title=Interview with Barbara Peters|accessdate=2008-11-30[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]
