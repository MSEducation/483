It is located to the right of the Taiwan Strait, east of Nantou County and shares a border with Changhua County divided by the Zhuoshui River. Yunlin is one of the counties of Taiwan that is part of the Chianan Plain, a flat land rich for agriculture with abundant waters. Agricultural products of Yunlin county include pomelo, tea leaves, suan cai, papaya and muskmelon. Due to Yunlin's abundant waters, it has potential for hydroelectricity. Douliu is the largest, and capital city of Yunlin. Yunlin is one of the least developed counties on the West coast, thus emigration is a major problem.

==History==

Yunlin county's establishment can be dated back to the Qing Dynasty. Liu Mingchuan was in charge of Taiwan at the time, when Taiwan was only divided into  only a few counties. Due to the abundance of mountains, transportation and communication between bordering counties such as Changhua County and Chiayi County was difficult, so Liu suggested a new county called Yunlin for easier management.
In 1887, Yunlin became one of the four counties of Taiwan.
During the Japanese colonial times, Yunlin was again abolished and combined into today's Tainan City. However Douliu continues to be an important city of Central Taiwan.
In 1981, Douliu satisfied the Taiwanese Local Constitution and became the County-controlled city of Yunlin county.
