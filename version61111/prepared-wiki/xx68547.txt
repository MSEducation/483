Trans World Airlines operated flights to Wichita, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles (a nonstop 727 to LAX started in 1967). Braniff operated Lockheed Electras to Denver and Oklahoma City. Frontier Airlines operated Convair 580s to (Oklahoma/Kansas). The April 1957 OAG shows 23 weekday departures: 11 Braniff, 8 TWA, 2 Central and 2 Continental. The first scheduled jets into Amarillo were on TWA in 1964.
In 1952 the name changed to Amarillo Air Terminal. After the adjacent Amarillo Air Force Base was deactivated in 1968 a portion became part of Amarillo Air Terminal. The primary instrument runway, built for the USAF Strategic Air Command base, at 13,502 feet (4,115 m) is among the longest commercial runways in the United States and is still used for military training. During the mid-1970s the airport was used for jet training by (then) West German national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG.Amarillo Voices: Journal is worth much more than a thousand words  In 1976 the airport changed its name to Amarillo International Airport upon the opening of a U.S. Customs facility.
