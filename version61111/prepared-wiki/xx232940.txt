When three Guantanamo captives died in custody on June 10, 2006, camp authorities labelled the men's deaths suicides, and suspected they had been coordinated by attorneys aiding the captives to file habeas corpus petitions in the USA's civil court system.
Kisthardt was assigned the task of overseeing the seizure and processing of all the captive's personal papers â€“ half a ton of papers.
The seizure included the privileged client-attorney correspondence.
