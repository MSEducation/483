Chardal (or Hardal; Hebrew: חרד"ל, acronym for חרדי לאומי, Charedi Le-umi, lit. "Nationalist Charedi", plural Chardalim) refers to the portion of the Religious Zionist Jewish community in Israel which inclines significantly toward Charedi ideology.

==Literal meaning==

Chardal is an initialism of the words Charedi, Dati, and Leumi. The acronym is easily remembered by Hebrew speakers since it is the same as the Hebrew word for mustard.

==History and groups==

The term Chardal is part of a broad process of certain groups of Religious Zionist youth becoming more strict in certain religious observances and more ideologically driven by the thought of Rabbi Zvi Yehudah Kook. In the late 1970s, graduates of Yeshivat Merkaz Harav began to reject certain aspects of the Religious Zionist and Bnei Akiva lifestyle. At that time, some of the graduates were already referred to as "plain-clothes Haredim."
According to some sources, the term Chardal was created at a meeting of the youth group EZRA in 1990. (Ezra is the Poalei Agudah youth group associated with Torah im Derech Eretz.) In later years, the term Chardal became a group that actually started separating itself from the broader religious Zionist community in order to dedicate itself to leading a life dedicated to strict Jewish practice, without the influence of outside culture. There was emphasis placed on modesty in dress and early marriage. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner was a major ideologue for this group. 
All Chardalim built their thought on the writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook as interpreted by his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. This approach gives a great role for faith and messianism in Judaism. They also stress the study of Yehudah Halevi's Kuzari and the writings of the Maharal of Prague. 
In recent years, it refers to those under the influence of Rabbi Zvi Yisrael Thau, who left Yeshivat Merkaz Harav to found the more Chardalic Yeshivat Har Hamor. Rabbi Thau rejects secular studies and secular influences. He is also against any academic influence on teachers colleges, rejecting the influence of modern educational psychology and modern approaches to the study of Bible. Those who follow this approach are called followers of Yeshivat HaKav- "Yeshivot that follow the line."
The term Chardal is sometimes used to refer to those coming from the Haredi world who join Nahal Haredi (the shortened army service for Yeshiva graduates) and continue to live within the broader Chardal world. It is also sometimes used for American yeshivish Jews who moved to Israel and support the state.

==Description==

On yeshiva.org.il Chardal is described as "The people who classify themselves as 'Charedi Leumi', or 'Chardal', try to keep the Mitzvot strictly, Kalah Kechamurah and weighty matters alike, while being involved in the national life in the state, and in the settling Eretz Yisrael."

It has also been explained as the "Anglo Orthodox religious sector who follow a Charedi lifestyle, yet may also serve in the army in religious units, attend a Hesder yeshiva, and pursue a work career." [tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Yet another explanation is "those connected to the seriousness of Torah learning and stricter observance of Jewish Law — like the charedim — but who are Zionist and have a more positive view of the secular world and Israel, like the dati leumi camp."

==Distinctions from other movements==

Despite their roots within Modern Orthodox Judaism and Religious Zionism, the Chardalim have become increasingly distinguished from both currents while simultaneously retaining continuity with them in theology and ideology.
The Chardalim have vacillated in their support for the state, when that support comes into conflict with their belief that halacha insists on the promotion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and prohibits the removal of settlements. As a result, the Chardalim have increasingly become opposed to the state's actions against some settlements. While the Chardalim have moved towards Charedi positions on many issues, their uncompromising position on settlements distances them from the Charedim, who are much more willing to compromise on this issue.

==Internal divisions==

Chardalim have in common the belief, most identified with Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, that the Zionist movement and the state of Israel play a central role in the messianic process. This belief is tested when the state takes steps that seem to undermine the messianic process, particularly removing Jewish residents from settlements, and transferring the parts of Land of Israel to non-Jewish control. Chardalim variously lean towards one of two general approaches to this conflict.
It should be noted that the term "mamlachti" also refers to many more moderate religious Zionists, who are willing to accept the "will of the Jewish people" as a consideration when it comes to many other issues such as the secular nature of society. This latter group predates the Chardal movement by decades, and is identified much more with the mainstream Religious Zionist movement than with the Chardal.

==Schools==

Ahavat Yisrael (Rappaport) -  There are schools for both boys and girls located in Jerusalem as well as Ramat Beit Shemesh. Their philosophy is "To adhere to an open Charedi approach to Halacha and lifestyle, while at the same time leaving the possibility for army service and university studies as a goal." https://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/community-a-housing/community-guide-beta-listings/12279-rappaport-boys-ramot-jerusalem.html

==Locations==

Many Chardalim live in West Bank settlements. The settlement town of Kiryat Arba, led by its Rabbi Dov Lior, is considered a Chardal stronghold as is the town of Beit El, led by Rabbi Melamed and Rabbi Shlomo Aviner. Chardalim are also predominant in many other settlements, including Yitzhar, Bat Ayin, Ofra, Shilo, and the Jewish parts of Hebron. There are yeshivot in Ramat Gan and Yerucham which are seen as Chardal yeshivot. Some Jerusalem neighborhoods are also Chardal strongholds, such as Har Nof, Kiryat Moshe and the Jewish Quarter of the Old City.
