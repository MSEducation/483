===Personal life===

Webb learned French from Azzedine Alaia with whom she lived during her stay in Paris.
Webb dedicates her time to several charitable organizations: LIFEBeat, Product Red and the RPM Nautical Foundation. LIFEBeat is close to Webb's heart because she was deeply affected by the AIDs crisis in the 80's as a model living in New York. Webb got involved with RPM because of her ex-husband, George Robb, who works to bring up shipwrecks for museums and governments.   
Webb married George Robb in 2002 and had daughters Leila Rose Robb (born October 2002) and Molly Blue Robb (born May 2004).Veronica Webb Celebrity-Parent Profile - Cookiemag.com The couple divorced in 2009.
