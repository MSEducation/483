"Rise & Fall" is a song by British R&B artist Craig David and the third single taken from his second studio album, Slicker Than Your Average (2002). The song, a collaboration with British musician Sting, returned David to the UK top five, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. It was the biggest hit from the album.
The song is based on a sample of the 1993 song "Shape of My Heart" from Sting's album Ten Summoner's Tales. Girl group Sugababes released their song, "Shape", which also sampled the Sting song within weeks of "Rise & Fall". The song also returned David to the top ten of the Australian Singles Chart, outpeaking both "What's Your Flava?" and "Hidden Agenda". It also marked the first DVD single release from David.
