== History == 
This alcoholic drink was invented in 1864 by an American immigrant Melville Sewell Bagley in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[tpl]citation |pages=59-60 |title=The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism |author=Paul H. Lewis |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1990 |isbn=9780807818626[/tpl]  Bagley was a native of the state of Maine. He was involved in the dry goods business in New Orleans before the outbreak of the American Civil War. After the outbreak he emigrated to Buenos Aires where he worked for a commission merchant.
Hesperidina was launched December 24th 1864 with an extensive poster campaign and an ad in La Tribuna newspaper. The advertisement stated Hesperidina is a "stomach digestive, prepared with bitter oranges." Hesperidina became Argentina trademark #1 on October 27th, 1876.
Beverages, indeed, opened the door to a whole new sector of advertisement driven by the Hesperidina campaign and the arrival to the country of world-wide "food and beverage" names such as Real Hollands, Nestl√©, Domecq and Bols among others.
