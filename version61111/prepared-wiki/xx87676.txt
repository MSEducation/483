==History==

The line to the north was opened in 1872 as part of the North East railway to Wodonga. A completely new station with a single platform was provided in 1878 on the site of the present island platform, with passenger subways and footbridges added in 1886, along with conversion of the island platform to the current layout. It was also at this time that a road overpass was provided at Mount Alexander Road, in what was one of the first grade separation projects to be carried out in the state. In 1909 the present buildings were provided, along with a centre track between platforms 1 and 2.
Electric train services between the city and Essendon were inaugurated in 1919, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, with all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941.[tpl]cite book|author=SE Dornan & RG Henderson|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|page=54|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1[/tpl] The station took the layout it has today in 1969, with the abolition of the centre track, closure of the stand alone signal box, provision of automatic signalling along the line, and replacement of the Buckley Street interlocked crossing gates with boom barriers.
