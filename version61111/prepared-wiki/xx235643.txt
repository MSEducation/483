The Halloween celebration, which lasts all weekend, has often culminated in rioting, contributing to its "wild" reputation. As a result, the celebration has become a point of contention in local government. The cost of additional police force, the potential of damage to local businesses, and the protection of the city's reputation have prompted the concern of Madison leaders, some of whom have suggested canceling the event altogether. The university has also taken steps to curtail Halloween mayhem, including restrictions on guests at University residence halls during the weekend.
In the summer of 2006, Mayor Dave Cieslewicz unveiled the city's plan for the upcoming Halloween events on State Street. The plan at its core consisted of blocking off State Street, charging five dollars for admission from select points of entry and closing off the street at midnight.Channel 3000  The price has increased since.
As of 2006, the city government officially calls the party "Freakfest." It includes both films and live performances by nationally known bands. The 2008 version of Freakfest had O.A.R. as its headliner and took place on November 1.[tpl]cite news | last = Knutsen | first = Kristian | title = O.A.R. to headline Freakfest 2008 Halloween party in Madison | work = The Isthmus | date = 2008-09-24 | url = http://www.isthmus.com/daily/article.php?article=23831 | accessdate = 2008-12-09[/tpl]
