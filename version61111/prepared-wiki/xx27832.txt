Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians.
Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become one of the largest seaports in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century the city also grew as one of Great Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies.
With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow is known as the "Second City of the British Empire" for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml| title=Victorian Glasgow| accessdate=14 September 2010|publisher=BBC History[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The+Second+City.htm| title=About Glasgow: The Second City of the Empire — the 19th century| accessdate=9 July 2007|publisher=Glasgow City Council[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php| title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914| author=Fraser, W, H| accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=University of Glasgow[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html| title=Glasgow — city of reality| author=McIlvanney, W| accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=Scotland — the official online gateway[/tpl] Today it is one of Europe's top ten financial centres[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ifsdglasgow.co.uk/news/latest-news/glasgow-enters-european-top-ten| title=Global Financial Centres Index 10: Glasgow Enters European Top Ten| accessdate=8 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.glasgowchamberofcommerce.com/news/glasgow-buzz/2011/september-2011/glasgow-enters-european-top-ten-financial-centres.aspx| title=Glasgow Jumps Thirteen Places in Financial Centre World Rankings| accessdate=8 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] and is home to many of Scotland's leading businesses.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/Factsheets/| title=About Glasgow: Factsheets| accessdate=9 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] Glasgow is also ranked as the 57th most liveable city in the world.[tpl]cite web|author=Česky |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_quality_of_living |title=List of cities by quality of living - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Early origins and development===

The present site of Glasgow has been used since prehistoric times for settlement, being the furthest downstream fording point of the River Clyde, at the point of its confluence with the Molendinar Burn. After the Romans left Caledonia the settlement was part of the extensive Kingdom of Strathclyde, with its capital at Dumbarton [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] downstream, which merged in the 9th century with other regions to create the united Kingdom of Scotland.The City of Glasgow - The Third Statistical Account of Scotland , published 1958  The origins of Glasgow as an established city derive ultimately from its medieval position as Scotland's second largest bishopric. Glasgow increased in importance during the 10th and 11th centuries as the site of this bishopric, reorganised by King David I of Scotland and John, Bishop of Glasgow.
There had been an earlier religious site established by Saint Mungo in the 6th century. The bishopric became one of the largest and wealthiest in the Kingdom of Scotland, bringing wealth and status to the town. Between 1175 and 1178 this position was strengthened even further when Bishop Jocelin obtained for the episcopal settlement the status of Burgh from King William I of Scotland, allowing the settlement to expand with the benefits of trading monopolies and other legal guarantees. Sometime between 1189 and 1195 this status was supplemented by an annual fair, which survives to this day as the Glasgow Fair.
Glasgow grew over the following centuries, the first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main North-South route over the river via Glasgow Cross. The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 served to increase the town's religious and educational status, and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.
Following the Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs the 14 Incorporated Trade Crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the Town Council of the earlier Merchants Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year. Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611. Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen.
Daniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, that Glasgow was "the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted."   At that time, the city's population numbered approximately 12000, and was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to the city's economy and urban fabric, brought about by the influences of the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.

===Trading port===

After the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. The city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde, as the river within the city itself was then too shallow.Abolition of the Slave Trade. Learning and Teaching Scotland Online. Retrieved on 26 September 2007 By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on Glasgow's River Clyde, with over [tpl]convert|47000000|lb|tonnes|abbr=on[/tpl] of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSCE03|title=The Glasgow Story: Industry and Technology — Food, Drink and Tobacco|publisher=The Glasgow Story|year=2004|accessdate=29 July 2008|first=Ian|last=Donnachie[/tpl] At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.Harris, Nathaniel (2000). Heritage of Scotland, pg. 70. Checkmark Books, London. ISBN 0816041369.

===Industrialisation===

The opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow.
The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie, Stanley Spencer and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world.
Glasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the "Second City of the Empire" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php|title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914|publisher=The Glasgow Story|year=2004|accessdate=9 July 2008|first=W.

Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.The City of Glasgow - The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, published 1958
Glasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from other parts of Britain and Ireland and from Continental Europe.
During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Loch Katrine aqueduct, Subway, Tramway system, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.Glasgow's Great Exhibitions by Perilla Kinchin and others, published 1988
The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post–World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the "Red Clydeside" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II and grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, Britain's lack of investment and innovation led to growing overseas competition from countries like Japan and West Germany which weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries.
As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report, which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city.  The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts which started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s, which saw the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050119043309/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002|archivedate=19 January 2005|title=Secret plot to strip Glasgow of influence|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|date=5 September 2002|accessdate=11 December 2007|first=John|last=Staples[/tpl]
The city invested heavily in its roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways which biscected the central area.  There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands, in order to halve the city's population base.
By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The "Glasgow's miles better" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7468870.stm|title=Why Glasgow was "miles better"|publisher=BBC News |date=23 June 2008|accessdate=30 July 2008|first=Reevel|last=Alderson[/tpl] The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European City of Culture in 1990, and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27153210/10| title=Interim Evaluation of the Cities Growth Fund: A Report to the Scottish Executive — Appendix 4: Glasgow| publisher=Scottish Government| date=March 2007| accessdate=26 June 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_41198_en.pdf|title=Housing regeneration in Glasgow: Gentrification and upward neighbourhood trajectories in a post-industrial city| publisher=eSharp| year=2006| accessdate=10 July 2008| first=Zhan| last=McIntyre|format=PDF[/tpl] The city is now considered by Lonely Planet to be one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/oct/15/glasgow-scotland|title=Lonely Planet guide rates Glasgow as one of the world's top 10 cities|accessdate=15 October 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Severin | last=Carrell | date=15 October 2008[/tpl]
Despite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation. A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2D5AF9D8-CE27-40D1-9BDF-47020507440A/0/GlasgowEconomicAudit2007SummaryReportFinal.pdf| title=Glasgow Economic Audit 2007—Summary Report| publisher=Glasgow Economic Forum| year=2007| format=PDF| accessdate=10 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland, while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be "economically inactive".[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/breakthroughglasgow_05_02_08.pdf| title=Breakthrough Glasgow| publisher=The Centre for Social Justice| date=1 February 2008| accessdate=8 February 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.

===Toponymy===

It is common to derive the name Glasgow from the older Cumbric glas cau or a Middle Gaelic cognate, which would have meant green hollow. The settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as Glasgu. It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as Glasgu (often glossed as "the dear Green" or "dear green place").

===Heraldry===

The coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866.Urquhart, R.M. (1973) Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry. London. Heraldry Today. ISBN 978-0-900455-24-7. It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo and are listed in the traditional rhyme:
St Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name. This was abbreviated to "Let Glasgow Flourish" and adopted as the city's motto.
In 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a "St Mungo's Bell" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green.
The supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in "the act of benediction". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.
The arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.Urquhart, R.M. (1979). Scottish Civic Heraldry. London. Heraldry Today.

==Government==

Although the Glasgow Corporation had been a pioneer in the municipal socialist movement from the late 19th century, since the Representation of the People Act 1918, Glasgow increasingly supported Left-wing ideas and politics at a national level. The city council has been controlled by the Labour Party for over 30 years, since the decline of the Progressives.
In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and German Revolution of 1918–1919, the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at Westminster, with one uprising in January 1919 prompting the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George to deploy 10,000 troops and tanks onto the city's streets. A huge demonstration in the city's George Square on 31 January ended in violence after the Riot Act was read.
Since 2007 when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour party within the city has declined (though it remains one of only two local authorities - along with North Lanarkshire, where Labour maintains an outright majority over the other parties)
Industrial action at the shipyards gave rise to the "Red Clydeside" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the 20th century it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax, and then the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, a left-wing party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's wealthiest area. The resultant general political bias against the Conservative party continued and currently they have only 1 of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969-1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.

===Scottish Parliament region===

The Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament covers the Glasgow City council area, the Rutherglen area of the South Lanarkshire and a small eastern portion of Renfrewshire. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 first past the post constituency members and seven of the 56 additional members. Both kinds of member are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The system of election is designed to produce a form of proportional representation.
The first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster Members of Parliament (MPs) representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of MSPs was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.
Currently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:

===United Kingdom Parliament constituencies===

Following reform of constituencies of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs), the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:

==Geography==

Glasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in West Central Scotland. Its second most important river is the Kelvin whose name was used for creating the title of Baron Kelvin and thereby ended up as the scientific unit of temperature.
On older maps Glasgow will be found within the area of the pre-1975 county of Lanarkshire, from 1975 to 1996 it will appear within Strathclyde Region; current maps will generally show Glasgow as one of 32 Council Areas in Scotland.

===Location===

===Climate===

Despite its northerly latitude, close to the same line as Moscow and Copenhagen, Glasgow's climate is classified as oceanic (Köppen Cfb).
Data is available online for 3 official weather stations in the Glasgow area: Paisley, Abbotsinch and Bishopton. All are located to the West of the city centre.
Owing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Temperatures are usually higher than most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to much of Western Europe. At Paisley, the annual precipitation averages [tpl]convert|1245|mm|1[/tpl]
Winters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of [tpl]convert|5.0|°C|1[/tpl], though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing.  The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around [tpl]convert|-12|°C[/tpl] in the area. Snowfall resulting in snow lying on the ground is an infrequent occurrence and generally short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.
During the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally very scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above [tpl]convert|20|°C[/tpl]. Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.
Temperature extremes have ranged from [tpl]convert|−19.9|°C|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|31.2|°C|0[/tpl], at Abbotsinch,  and [tpl]convert|−14.8|°C|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|31.0|°C|0[/tpl] at Paisley. The coldest temperature to have occurred in recent years was [tpl]convert|-12.5|C|F[/tpl] at Bishopton during December 2010.

==Demography==

The 1950s saw the population of the City of Glasgow area peak at 1,089,000. During this period, Glasgow was one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearings of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to "new towns" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late 20th century, making direct comparisons difficult. The city continues to expand beyond the official city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around [tpl]convert|400|sqmi|km2|-2[/tpl] of all adjoining suburbs, if commuter towns and villages are included.
There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the Glasgow City Council Area (which lost the districts of Rutherglen and Cambuslang to South Lanarkshire in 1996) and the Greater Glasgow Urban Area (which includes the conurbation around the city).

==Districts and suburbs==

===City centre===

The city centre is bounded by the High Street to the east, the River Clyde to the south and the M8 motorway to the west and north which was built through the Townhead, Charing Cross, Cowcaddens and Anderston areas in the 1960s.

====Retail and theatre district====

The city centre is based on a grid system of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is George Square, site of many of Glasgow's public statues and the elaborate Victorian Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of Argyle Street, Sauchiehall Street and Buchanan Street, the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism "Great Street Award" 2008.The Academy of Urbanism : Awards http://web.archive.org/web/20080119212642/http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/awards.htm Retrieved 28 May 2008
The main shopping centres are Buchanan Galleries and the St. Enoch Centre, with the up-market Princes Square and the Italian Centre specialising in designer labels. The London-based department store Selfridges purchased a site in the city some years ago as part of its plans to expand stores, plans which have now been shelved according to the company. Glasgow's retail portfolio forms the UK's second largest and most economically important retail sector after Central London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business-strategies.co.uk/upload/newsletter_oct07/retail_market_spotlight_autumn2007.pdf |title=Retail Ranking from Experian |publisher=Business-strategies.co.uk |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=133843 |title=Top of the Shops — Gerald Eve Publishes Prime Retail |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=5 November 2004 |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl]
The city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the Theatre Royal (performing home of Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet), the Pavilion Theatre, the King's Theatre, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow Film Theatre, Tron Theatre, Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the Centre for Contemporary Arts, McLellan Galleries and the Lighthouse Museum of Architecture. The world's tallest cinema, the eighteen-screen Cineworld is situated on Renfrew Street. The city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the University of Strathclyde, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow School of Art and Glasgow Caledonian University.

====Merchant City====

To the east is the commercial and residential district of Merchant City. The Merchant City was formerly the residential district of the wealthy city merchants in the 18th and early 19th centuries, particularly the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. As the Industrial Revolution and the wealth it brought to the city resulted in the expansion of Glasgow's central area westward, the original medieval centre was left behind. Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Clock Tower; all that remains of the original City Chambers, which was destroyed by fire in 1926. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/history1.htm|title=Glasgow's Merchant City: Historical Development|publisher=Merchant City Initiative|year=2008|accessdate=29 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
From the late 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of cafés and restaurants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4|title=Merchant City Glasgow: Restaurants and Cafés|publisher=Merchant City Glasgow — Merchant City Initiative|year=2008|accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616150025/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4  |archivedate = 16 June 2008[/tpl] The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7|title=Merchant City Glasgow: Shops|publisher=Merchant City Glasgow — Merchant City Initiative|year=2008|accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616150040/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7  |archivedate = 16 June 2008[/tpl]
The Merchant City is the centre of Glasgow's growing "cultural quarter", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and Trongate, and at the heart of the annual Merchant City Festival. The area has supported a huge growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2|title=Merchant City Glasgow: Galleries and Art|publisher=Merchant City Glasgow — Merchant City Initiative|year=2008|accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616150015/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2  |archivedate = 16 June 2008[/tpl] The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a "cultural quarter" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council, and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trongate103.com/|title=Trongate 103|year=2008|accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl] The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1|title=Merchant City Glasgow: Venues and Theatres|publisher=Merchant City Glasgow — Merchant City Initiative|year=2008|accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616150010/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1  |archivedate = 16 June 2008[/tpl]

====Financial district====

Also see Glasgow's International Financial Services District
To the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of Blythswood Hill and Anderston, lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the International Financial Services District (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the "square kilometre" or "Wall Street on Clyde".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/business/glasgow-flourish.html|title=Let Glasgow flourish|accessdate=29 July 2008|work=Scotland: the official online gateway[/tpl] Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters. With a reputation as an established financial services centre, coupled with comprehensive support services, Glasgow continues to attract and grow new business.
Of the 10 largest general insurance companies in the UK, 8 have a base or head office in Glasgow — including Direct Line, Esure, AXA and Norwich Union. Key banking sector companies have also moved some of their services to commercial property in Glasgow — Resolution, JPMorgan Chase, Abbey, HBOS, Barclays Wealth, Tesco Personal Finance, Morgan Stanley, Lloyds TSB, Clydesdale Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Ministry of Defence have several departments and Clydeport, the Glasgow Stock Exchange, Student Loans Company, Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, BT Group, Scottish Friendly. Scottish Qualifications Authority and Scottish Enterprise also have their headquarters based in the district. Royal Dutch Shell also have one of their six world-wide Shared Business Centres located in the IFSD. Hilton Worldwide have corporate office base in Cadogan Street.

===West End===

Glasgow's West End is a bohemian district of cafés, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of Kelvingrove Park, the University of Glasgow, Glasgow Botanic Gardens and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, focused especially on the area's main thoroughfare, Byres Road. The area is popular with tourists, and contains many hotels, including the prestigious One Devonshire Gardens, which has accommodated a number of celebrity guests on visits to the city.
The West End includes residential areas of Hillhead, Dowanhill, Kelvingrove, Kelvinside, Hyndland, Broomhill, and, to an increasing extent, Partick. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of Charing Cross. This includes areas such as Scotstoun, Jordanhill, Kelvindale and Anniesland.
The West End is bisected by the River Kelvin which flows from the Campsie Fells in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.
The spire of Sir George Gilbert Scott's Glasgow University main building (the second largest Gothic Revival building in Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy.
The area is also home to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena and the Henry Wood Hall (home of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra although they generally perform at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall).  Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the Museum of Transport, which reopened in 2010 after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at Glasgow Harbour where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde.  The new building is built to a design by Zaha Hadid. The West End Festival, one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.
Glasgow is the home of the SECC, the United Kingdom's largest exhibition and conference centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/Glasgow.asp?venue=Scottish%20Exhibition%20and%20Conference%20Centre |title=Glasgow Conferences Venues UK |publisher=Conferences-uk.org.uk |date=17 July 1995 |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.secc.co.uk/ |title=The home of the Scottish Exhibition + Conference Centre |publisher=SECC |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.venuefinder.com/venues/scottish_exhibition_+_conference_centre/V8654/meeting-rooms/ |title= Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre [/tpl] A major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by Foster and Partners is currently under construction, including a 12,000 seat arena, and a 5 star hotel and entertainments complex.

===East End===

The East End extends from Glasgow Cross in the City Centre to the boundary with North and South Lanarkshire. It is home to the famous Glasgow Barrowland Market, popularly known as "The Barras",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm |title=The Official Glasgow Barrowland Ballroom Site |publisher=Glasgow Barrowland |accessdate=5 May 2009[/tpl]  Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow Green, and Celtic Park, home of Celtic FC. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to Sir William Arrol & Co., James Templeton & Co and William Beardmore and Company. A notable local employer continues to be the Wellpark Brewery, home of Tennent's Lager.
The Glasgow Necropolis Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the cathedral in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the [tpl]convert|62|m|ft|0|sing=on[/tpl] high statue of John Knox at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former pretensions can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as "Homes for the Future", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.[tpl]cite web|author=Glasgow Architecture |url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/homes_for_the_future_glasgow.htm |title=Homes for the Future, 1999 |publisher=Glasgow Architecture|year=1999 |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl]
East of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739–1757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants. Also close by is the more modest Episcopalian St Andrew's-by-the-Green, the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the "Whistlin' Kirk" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ.
Overlooking Glasgow Green is the façade of Templeton On The Green, featuring vibrant polychromatic brickwork intended to evoke the Doge's Palace in Venice.Templeton's Carpet Factory, Glasgow — Princes Regeneration[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
The extensive Tollcross Park was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large baronial mansion was built in 1848 by David Bryce, which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex.
The new Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena, a modern replacement for the Kelvin Hall, is planned for Dalmarnock. The area will also be the site of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.
To the north of the East End lie the two massive gasometers of Provan Gas Works, which stand overlooking Alexandra Park and a major interchange between the M8 and M80 motorways. Often used for displaying large city advertising slogans, the towers have become an unofficial portal into the city for road users arriving from the north and east.
The East End Healthy Living Centre (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area. The centre provides service such as sports facilities, health advice, stress management, leisure and vocational classes.East End Healthy Living Centre Homepage

===South Side===

Glasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde, covering areas including the Gorbals, Toryglen, Govan, Ibrox, Shawlands, Simshill, Strathbungo, Cardonald, Mount Florida, Pollokshaws, Nitshill, Pollokshields, Battlefield, Langside, Govanhill, Crosshill, Cessnock, Mosspark, Kinning Park, Mansewood, Arden, Carnwadric, Kennishead, Darnley, Newlands, Deaconsbank, Pollok, Croftfoot, Castlemilk, King's Park, Cathcart, Muirend and Barrhead, Busby, Clarkston,Eaglesham, Giffnock, Thornliebank, Netherlee, and Newton Mearns in the East Renfrewshire council area, as well as Cambuslang, East Kilbride, and Rutherglen in the South Lanarkshire council area.
Although predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the world famous Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander 'Greek' Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida, (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium, (home of Rangers FC).
The former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the new headquarters for BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV) which have relocated there to a new purpose built digital media campus.
In addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built or are currently planned, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.
The South Side also includes many great parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, Bellahouston Park and Rouken Glen Park, and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle. The South Side is also home to Pollok Country Park, which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/pollokparkbritainsbestpark.htm|title=Pollok Park Britain's Best Park|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=Glasgow City Council[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Pollok Park is Glasgow’s largest park and the only country park within the city boundaries. It is also home to Poloc Cricket Club. The name was taken from one of the early spellings of the area, to differentiate it from Pollok F.C.
Govan is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Southern General Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system.

===North Glasgow===

North Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie and Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire and Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas. Possilpark is one such area, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and Hamiltonhill had fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years.
This has led to large scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as Ruchill, which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern housing estates. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented social housing, with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and Glasgow Housing Association.
Maryhill consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as Maryhill Park and North Kelvinside. Maryhill is also home to Firhill Stadium, home of Partick Thistle F.C. since 1909, and the professional Rugby Union team, Glasgow Warriors. The junior team, Maryhill F.C. are also located in this part of north Glasgow.
The Forth and Clyde Canal passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated.
Sighthill is home to Scotland’s largest asylum seeker community.
A huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world’s locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the St. Rollox railway works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn.

==Culture==

The city has many amenities for a wide range of cultural activities, from curling to opera and ballet and from football to art appreciation; it also has a large selection of museums that include those devoted to transport, religion, and modern art. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 1990 when Glasgow was designated European City of Culture.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/Cultural+Renaissance.htm| title=Cultural renaissance: the 1980s and 1990s| author=Glasgow City Council| accessdate=13 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

Most of Scotland's national arts organisations are based in Glasgow, including Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, National Theatre of Scotland, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Scottish Youth Theatre.
Glasgow has its own "Poet Laureate", a post created in 1999 for Edwin Morgan[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gla.ac.uk:443/avenue/27/poet.html| title=Glasgow's first poet laureate| author=John Hancox| work=Avenue| accessdate=9 July 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and as of 2007 occupied by Liz Lochhead.

===Recreation===

Glasgow is home to a variety of theatres including the King's Theatre, the Theatre Royal and the Citizens Theatre and is home to many municipal museums and art galleries, the most famous being the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and the Burrell Collection. Most of the museums in Glasgow are publicly owned and free to enter.
The city has hosted many exhibitions over the years, including being the UK City of Architecture 1999, European Capital of Culture 1990, National City of Sport 1995–1999 and European Capital of Sport 2003. Glasgow has also hosted the National Mod no less than twelve times since 1895.List of Mod's places for each year on Sabhal Mòr Ostaig website
In addition, unlike the older and larger Edinburgh Festival (where all Edinburgh's main festivals occur in the last three weeks of August), Glasgow's festivals fill the calendar. Festivals include the Glasgow International Comedy Festival, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, Glasgow International Jazz Festival, Celtic Connections, Glasgow Fair, Glasgow Film Festival, West End Festival, Merchant City Festival, Glasgay, and the World Pipe Band Championships.

===Music scene===

Glasgow has many live music venues, pubs, and clubs. Some of the city's more well-known venues include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The Hydro, the SECC,  Glasgow Cathouse,  King Tut's Wah Wah Hut (where Oasis were spotted and signed by Glaswegian record mogul Alan McGee), the Queen Margaret Union (who have Kurt Cobain's footprint locked in a safe), the Barrowland, a ballroom converted into a live music venue as well as The Garage which is the largest nightclub in Scotland. More recent mid-sized venues include ABC and the O2 Academy, which play host to a similar range of acts. There are also a large number of smaller venues and bars which host many local and touring musicians, including Stereo, 13th Note and Nice N Sleazy.

===Religion===

Glasgow is a city of significant religious diversity. The Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church are the two largest Christian denominations in the city. There are 147 congregations in the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow http://www.presbyteryofglasgow.org.uk/ (of which 104 are within the city boundaries, the other 43 being in adjacent areas such as Giffnock).Church of Scotland Yearbook 2008–09, ISBN 978-0-86153-384-8 The city has four Christian cathedrals: Glasgow Cathedral, of the Church of Scotland; St Andrew's Cathedral, of the Roman Catholic Church; St Mary's Cathedral, of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and St Luke's Cathedral, of the Greek Orthodox Church.

===Dialect===

Glaswegian, otherwise known as the Glasgow patter, is a local variety of Scots.
Glaswegian is a dialect, more than an alternative pronunciation; words also change their meaning as all over in Scotland, e.g. "away" can mean "leaving" as in A'm away, an instruction to stop being a nuisance as in away wi ye, or "drunk" or "demented" as in he's away wi it. Ginger is a term for any carbonated soft drink, historically referring to ginger beer (A bottle o ginger, [tpl]IPA-sco|ə ˈboʔl ə ˈdʒɪndʒər|IPA[/tpl]). Then there are words whose meaning has no obvious relationship to that in standard English: coupon means "face", via "to punch a ticket coupon". A headbutt is known in many parts of the British Isles as a "Glasgow kiss", although this term is rarely used by Glaswegians, who say "Malkie", e.g., "ah'll Malkie ye" or "stick the heid/nut on ye".
A speaker of Glaswegian might refer to those originating from the Scottish Highlands and the Western Isles as teuchters, while they would reciprocate by referring to Glaswegians as keelies and those from the East of Scotland refer to Glaswegians as Weegies (or Weedgies).
The long-running TV drama Taggart and the comedies Empty, Chewin' the Fat, Rab C. Nesbitt, Still Game and Dear Green Place depict the Glaswegian patois, while Kevin Bridges, Frankie Boyle, Craig Ferguson and Billy Connolly have made Glaswegian humour known to the rest of the world.

===Architecture===

Very little of medieval Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th century Provand's Lordship and 13th century St. Mungo's Cathedral, although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact.  The vast majority of the city as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.
The city is notable for architecture designed by the Glasgow School, the most notable exponent of that style being Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the Arts and Crafts Movement and the main exponent of Art Nouveau in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the Glasgow School of Art, Willow Tearooms and the Scotland Street School Museum. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.Watch video of the church[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] and Interview with Stuart Robertson, Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Director
Another architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance was Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet who was awarded the R.I.B.A's Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the "Second City of the Empire". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.
Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares. Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields - the first major planned garden suburb in Britain - Newlands and Carmunnock Village.Glasgow City Council Planning Department reports  
Modern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is affectionately known as the "Armadillo".

==Economy==

Glasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and is at the hub of the metropolitan area of West Central Scotland. Glasgow also has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-uk-s-second-most-prosperous-city-1-738231|title=Edinburgh UK's second most prosperous city|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|accessdate=28 May 2012|last=MacDonnell|first=Hamish|date=3 March 2005[/tpl] The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies.

==Transport==

===Public transport===

Glasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT).
The city has many bus services; since bus deregulation almost all are provided by private operators though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: First Glasgow, McGill's Buses, Stagecoach West Scotland and Glasgow Citybus. The main bus terminal in the city is Buchanan bus station.
Glasgow has the most extensive urban rail network in the UK outside of London with rail services travelling to a large part of the West of Scotland. Most lines were electrified under British Rail. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by First ScotRail, who own the franchise as determined by the Scottish Government. Central Station and Queen Street Station are the two main railway terminals. Glasgow Central is the terminus of the [tpl]convert|641.6|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long West Coast Main Line[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/virgin/ |title=West Coast Main Line Pendolino Tilting Trains, United Kingdom |publisher=Railway-technology.com |accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl] from London Euston. All services to and from England use this station. Glasgow Central is also the terminus for suburban services on the south side of Glasgow, Ayrshire and Inverclyde, as well as being served by the cross city link from Dalmuir to Motherwell. Most other services within Scotland — the main line to Edinburgh, plus services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and the Western Highlands — operate from Queen Street station.
The city's suburban network is currently divided by the River Clyde, and the Crossrail Glasgow initiative has been proposed to link them; it is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Government. The city is linked to Edinburgh by four direct railway links. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the Glasgow Subway. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground metro system, and is generally recognised as the world's third underground railway after the London Underground and the Budapest Metro.[tpl]cite web|author=SPT |url=http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html  |title=SPT Subway |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=16 April 1980 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229231523/http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html |archivedate = 29 December 2007[/tpl] Both rail and subway stations have a number of park and ride facilities.
As part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde a Bus Rapid Transit system called Clyde Fastlink is currently under construction.

===Shipping===

Ferries used to link opposite sides of the Clyde in Glasgow but they have been rendered near-obsolete, by bridges and tunnels including the Erskine Bridge, Kingston Bridge, and the Clyde Tunnel. The only remaining crossings are the Renfrew Ferry between Renfrew and Yoker, and the Kilcreggan Ferry in Inverclyde, both run by SPT but outwith the city boundary. The PS Waverley, the world's last operational seagoing paddle-steamer,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waverleyexcursions.co.uk/waverley.htm |title=PS Waverley |publisher=Waverleyexcursions.co.uk |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] provides services from Glasgow city Centre, mainly catering to the pleasure cruise market. A regular waterbus service links the city Centre with Braehead in Renfrewshire, some 30 minutes downstream. A service by Loch Lomond Seaplanes, connecting the city with destinations in Argyll and Bute started in 2007.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6187102.stm| title=Seaplane air service to take off|publisher=BBC News |date=27 November 2006| accessdate=9 July 2007[/tpl] The only operational dock left in Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of Containerisation, most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5 million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.C.Michael Hogan, (2011) Sea of the Hebrides. Eds. P. Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC.

===Roads===

The main M8 motorway passes through the city centre and connects to the M77, M73, and M80 motorways. The A82 connects the city to Argyll and the western Highlands. The M74 runs directly south towards Carlisle; the M74 completion scheme has extended the motorway from Tollcross into the Tradeston area to join the M8.
Other road projects in the city include East End Regeneration Route, which aims to provide easier access to deprived areas of the East End by linking the M8 to the extended M74.

===Airports===

The city is served by two international airports and a seaplane terminal: Glasgow International Airport (GLA) ([tpl]convert|13|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire and Glasgow Prestwick Airport (PIK) which is approximately [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] south west of Glasgow in Ayrshire and Glasgow Seaplane Terminal, by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde. There is also a small airfield at Cumbernauld  in Lanarkshire ([tpl]convert|29|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] to the north-east) and Glasgow City Heliport located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde. A plan to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International was dropped with the cancelling of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link in 2009.

==Housing==

Glasgow is known for its tenements - the red (or blonde) sandstone buildings are one of the most recognisable signatures of the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml|publisher=BBC |title=Victorian Achievement: Victorian Glasgow|accessdate=30 March 2008[/tpl] These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20000813/ai_n13950376|title=Tenement living is the life and always has been|work=Sunday Herald|author=Jack McLean|accessdate=24 July 2009 | date=13 August 2000[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] The Hyndland area of Glasgow is the only tenement conservation area in the UK[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hyndl.demon.co.uk/hyndland/0mainindax.htm |title=Hyndland Local History |publisher=Hyndl.demon.co.uk |accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl] and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.
Like many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel.Drivers for high rise living[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, in order to feed the local demand for labour.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y4fZZeJqqRcC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=irish+labour+glasgow+tenements&source=web&ots=wZ071BJL9Z&sig=jIEk-u0DZ4ev86Znpcw1d1CI8LA&hl=en#PPR1,M1 |title=Exiles and Islanders: The Irish Settlers of Prince Edward Island by Brendan O'Grady |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl] The massive demand outstripped new building and many, originally fine, tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.Worksall, Frank The Tenement – a way of life.

Efforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSEF11|title=The Glasgow Story: Buildings and Cityscape — Public Housing|author=Ranald MacInnes|accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl]  Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.
The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm|publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |title=Springburn Virtual Museum: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975|accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl] Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a "universally admired architectural" style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm |title=Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building |publisher=Glasgow.gov.uk |accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Healthcare==
