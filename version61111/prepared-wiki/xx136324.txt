Live in Munich 1977 is a live album and DVD released by the British hard rock band Rainbow in 2006.
The concert was recorded in Munich on October 20, 1977, originally filmed to air on the German Rockpalast TV show.

The set is not from the same tour that produced the previously released live album On Stage (which was mostly culled from their 1976 Japanese tour), but from their 1977 European tour, a few months prior to the release of Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, with a different bass player and keyboardist.
The DVD release also features the three promotional videos for Rainbow's Long Live Rock 'n' Roll album, and interviews with Bob Daisley and former tour manager Colin Hart.
On April 26, 2010 a double 180 gram limited edition gatefold vinyl reissue of the album was released through Just For Kicks Music (Germany).
