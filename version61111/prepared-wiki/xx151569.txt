==College career==

Brink finished his career as one of Washington State's all-time greats, holding the school career records in passing yards, touchdowns, attempts, completions and total offense. His senior year he threw for 3,818 yards, the second highest single-season total in school's history. He is the only Cou­gar to have five 400-plus yard games and has five of the top 10 and three of the top four passing games in WSU history.  Although the program was coming off three consecutive 10 win seasons when Brink inherited the team, he failed to lead the Cougars to a single winning season in four years as a starter.
Brink finished his career as the third leading passer, in terms of yards, in Pac-10 history, behind Carson Palmer and Derek Anderson and fifth leader in touchdowns. He is also only the sixth signal caller in conference history to throw for more than 10,000 yards and toss 70-or-more touchdowns. In his college career, Brink completed 58.4 percent of his passes for 10,913 yards. He threw 76 touchdowns but also 43 interceptions. Brink led the Cougars to four straight seasons without a bowl berth. As a starter, Brink was 17-23 over four seasons. 
During a game against Oregon State University in the 2005 season Brink set a new school record with 531 passing yards. Ahead 30-16 at the break, the Cougars, however, lost that game due in part to defensive and special teams lapses and other mistakes, but also because Brink threw one touchdown against four interceptions. For much of the 2006 season, Brink led the Pac-10 in passing yards. He was named second team All-Pac-10 for his efforts. The Cougars were at one point in the 2006 season ranked No. 25 in the nation with a 6-3 record, but lost their final three games to finish the year at 6-6.  In 2006-2007 Pac-10 rankings, he led the league in total offense with 242.2 yards per game, was second in passing at 241.6 ypg, and fourth in passing efficiency.
Brink finished his senior year as the 2007 Pac-10 leader in total offense and named second team All-Pac-10. His final game as a Cougar resulted in a come-from-behind, 42-35 victory over rival University of Washington in the annual Apple Cup in which he threw for 399 yards and five touchdowns. He remains the only WSU quarterback ever to beat Washington three times.
