The Bullfinch, Common Bullfinch or Eurasian Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae.  In Anglophone Europe it is known simply as Bullfinch, as it is the original bird to bear the name bullfinch.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The taxonomy was described in 2001 by Arnaiz-Villena et al. The closest relative of the bullfinches is genus Pinicola (Pine grosbeak and Crimson-browed finch).[tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=A|coauthors= et al|title= Phylogeography of crossbills, bullfinches, grosbeaks,and rosefinches| journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|year=2001|volume=58| pages=1159–1166| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lc24a9vybanmw0gq/fulltext.pdf| doi=10.1007/PL00000930[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=A|coauthors= Gómez-Prieto P, Ruiz-de-Valle V|title= Phylogeography of finches and sparrows|journal=Nova Science Publishers|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-60741-844--3|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/downloadOA.php?order=1&access=true&osCsid=578391717583ba2180ffa42bf304e1f6[/tpl]

The Azores Bullfinch, previously regarded as a subspecies of Eurasian Bullfinch, is now recognised as a distinct species.

==Description==

The Bullfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird. The upper parts are grey; the flight feathers and short thick bill are black; as are the cap and face in adults (they are greyish-brown in juveniles), and the white rump and wing bars are striking in flight. The adult male has red underparts, but females and young birds have grey-buff underparts. The song of this unobtrusive bird contains fluted whistles.

==Distribution and habitat==

This bird breeds across Europe and temperate Asia. It is mainly resident, but many northern birds migrate further south in the winter.  Mixed woodland with some conifers is favoured for breeding, including parkland and gardens.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This species does not form large flocks outside the breeding season, and is usually seen as a pair or family group.

===Breeding===

It builds its nest in a bush, (preferably more than four metres tall and wide), mature stands of scrub, or tree, laying four to seven eggs. It is peculiar among Passeriformes for having spermatozoa with a rounded head and a blunt acrosome.Birkhead, Timothy R.; Immler, Simone; Pellatt, E.

===Feeding===

The food is mainly seeds and buds of fruit trees, which can make it a pest in orchards. Ash and hawthorn are favoured in autumn and early winter.Dyda J, Symes N and Lamacraft D (2009) Woodland management for birds: a guide to managing woodland for priority birds in Wales.
