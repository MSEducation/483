[[Circumfix]]

CATEGORIES: Affixes

A circumfix is an affix, a morpheme that is placed around another morpheme.  Circumfixes contrast with prefixes, attached to the beginnings of words; suffixes, that are attached at the end; and infixes, inserted in the middle. See also epenthesis. Circumfixes are common in Malay and Georgian.

==Examples==

[tpl]circumfix|Angle brackets[/tpl] are used to mark off circumfixes. 

===Germanic languages===

The circumfix is probably most widely known from the German past participle, which is ge[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]t for regular verbs. The verb spielen, for example, has the participle gespielt. Dutch has a similar system (spelen → gespeeld in this case).

===East Asian languages===

In Japanese, some linguists consider o[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]ni naru and o[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]suru to be honorific circumfixes; for example yomu → o[tpl]circumfix|yomi[/tpl]ni naru (respectful), o[tpl]circumfix|yomi[/tpl]suru (humble).

===Austronesian languages===

For example, a circumfix can be added to the root adil "fair" to form keadilan "fairness".[tpl]cite book |title=Morfologi dalam Ilmu Bahasa |last=Baryadi |first=I.

===Other languages===

In most North African and some Levantine varieties of Arabic, verbs are negated by placing the circumfix ma[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]š around the verb together with all its prefixes and suffixed direct- and indirect-object pronouns. For example, Egyptian bitgibuhum-laha "you bring them to her" is negated as ma[tpl]circumfix|bitgibuhum-lahā[/tpl]š "you don't bring them to her".
In Berber languages the feminine is marked with the circumfix t[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]t. The word afus "hand" becomes t[tpl]circumfix|afus[/tpl]t. In Kabyle, θ[tpl]circumfix|issli[/tpl]θ "bride" derives from issli "groom". From bni, to build, with t[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]t we obtain tbnit "thou buildest". 
In Hebrew, magdelet "magnifier", for example, the root is gdl "big" (in the H-stem hagdel "to enlarge") and the circumfix is m[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]et.
Negation in Guaraní is also done with circumfixes, nd[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]i and nd[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]mo'ãi for future negations.
In some Slavic languages, and in Hungarian, the superlative of adjectives is formed with a circumfix. For example, in Czech, the circumfix nej[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]ší is used – mladý "young" becomes nejmladší "youngest". The corresponding circumfix in Hungarian is leg[tpl]circumfix| [/tpl]bb, as in legnagyobb "biggest", from nagy "big". (In both cases, the comparative form is produced using the suffix without the prefix: mladší "younger"; nagyobb "bigger".) 
In Gurmanchema, noun classes are indicated by circumfix.
