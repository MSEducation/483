Edmilson Gonçalves Pimenta (born 17 September 1971 in Santa Teresa, Espírito Santo), simply Edmilson, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played in various offensive positions.

==Football career==

After starting out as a senior for modest outfit of Esporte Clube Democrata, Edmilson moved to Portugal in the 1993 summer, going on to remain in the country for most of his professional career; he began with lowly C.D. Nacional – then in division two – and S.C. Salgueiros, where his solid performances earned him a transfer to top level powerhouse F.C. Porto.
At Porto, Edmilson was instrumental as the club won the second and third of its five consecutive league accolades, signing a lucrative contract with French side Paris Saint-Germain FC. Unsettled, he returned to Portugal in January 1998, joining Sporting Clube de Portugal; he scored 10 goals in his first full season with the Lions and, although not an essential first-team member, still contributed with 20 matches in 1999–2000 as the capital club ended an 18-year drought and conquered the title.
Until his retirement in 2007 Edmilson played, in quick succession, with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, Portimonense SC, FK Lyn, R.C.S. Visétois and amateurs CTE Colatina (two spells).
