===Origins===

The Future of Flight Aviation Center & Boeing Tour is the result of a partnership between The Boeing Company, Future of Flight Foundation, Snohomish County Public Facilities District and Snohomish County Airport.  The $23-million dollar project debuted in December 2005 with the opening of the museum.  The Future of Flight Foundation is a 501-3(c) nonprofit organization.  The Foundation operates the Center and owns the Center's collection.  The Foundation's mission is "to educate, entertain and engage our global community to inspire innovation."

===Exhibits===

Exhibits at the Future of Flight Aviation Center include:

==Boeing Tour==

The Boeing Tour covers the Boeing Everett Factory, where guests can view airplanes in all stages of construction and testing.  The factory is the location for production of the Boeing 747, 767, 777, and 787.  The tour also includes the main assembly building, which holds the record in Guinness World Records for the largest building in the world by volume.  It is 472 million cu. ft (13.3 million m³) and covers 98.3 acres (398,000 m²).
The former Boeing Tour Center was located next to the factory and now is abandoned, after closing in December 2005 when the Future of Flight Aviation Center opened.

==Retail Outlets==

The Boeing Store is located at the front of the tour. It is a store that features items that relate to the Boeing Company. There is a separate Future of Flight store next to it, selling many more traditional Pacific Northwest gift shop items, including foodstuffs. The center also includes a small cafeteria across the lobby.
