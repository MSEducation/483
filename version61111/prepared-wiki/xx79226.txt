The North Aegean ([tpl]lang-el|Περιφέρεια Βορείου Αιγαίου[/tpl]) is one of the thirteen regions of Greece. It comprises the islands of the north-eastern Aegean Sea, except for Samothrace, which belongs to the region of East Macedonia and Thrace, and Imbros and Tenedos which belong to Turkey.

==Administration==

The North Aegean region was established in the 1987 administrative reform. With the 2010 Kallikratis plan, its powers and authority were redefined and extended. Along with the South Aegean, it is supervised by the Decentralized Administration of the Aegean based at Piraeus. The capital of the region is situated in Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. 
Until the Kallikratis reform, the region consisted of the three prefectures of Samos, Chios and Lesbos. Since 1 January 2011 it is divided into 5 regional units, formed around major islands:[tpl]PDFlink|1=Kallikratis reform law text[/tpl] Chios, Ikaria, Lemnos, Lesbos and Samos.
The region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Athanasios (Nasos) Giakalis, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
