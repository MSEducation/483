Prince Hall (1735 – 1807)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p37.html |accessdate= April 25, 2013 |title= Prince Hall (1735 - 1807) |work=Africans in America |publisher=WGBH-TV, Boston [/tpl] was an African American noted as a tireless abolitionist, for his leadership in the free black community in Boston, and as the founder of Prince Hall Masonry.
Hall tried to gain New England’s enslaved and free blacks a place in Freemasonry, education and the military, which were some of the most crucial spheres of society in his time. Hall is considered the founder of “Black Freemasonry” in the United States, known today as Prince Hall Freemasonry. Hall formed the African Grand Lodge of North America. Prince Hall was unanimously elected its Grand Master and served until his death in 1807.
He lobbied for education rights for black children and was active in the back-to-Africa movement. Many historians regard Prince Hall as one of the prominent African-Americans during the early years of the United States.

==Early life==

Hall was born in 1735. Hall may have been born in Barbados, somewhere else in the Caribbean, or in Africa. Author and historian James Sidbury said: "It is more likely that he was a native of New England."
Historian Charles H. Wesley developed what is now the widely accepted theory about Prince Hall's early years. Based upon his research, by age 11 Prince Hall was a slave to Boston tanner William Hall. By 1770, Prince Hall was a free, literate black man living in Boston.[tpl]cite book|author=Lorenzo Johnston Greene|title=Prince Hall: Massachusetts Leader in Crisis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HpJflAEACAAJ|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=1961|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|page=241[/tpl] The manumission certificate for Prince Hall, dated one month after the Boston Massacre 1770, stated that "no longer Reckoned a slave, but had always accounted as a free man." It is unclear how he learned to read and write; he may have been self-taught or, like other slaves and free blacks in New England, he may have had assistance.Greene, p. 241.[tpl]#tag:ref|Sidbury contends that Hall was in Richmond,CA by 1763 (end of the Seven Years' War).|group="nb"[/tpl]

==Family, church and work life==

Hall and a woman named Delia, a servant outside William Hall's household, had a son named Primus in 1756.
Hall joined the Congregational Church in 1762; he was 27 years of age. He then married an enslaved woman named Sarah Ritchie who died. He married Flora Gibbs of Gloucester eight years after Sarah's death.
In Boston, Hall worked as a peddler, caterer and leatherworker, owning his own leather shop. In April 1777 he created five leather drumheads for an artillery regiment of Boston. Hall was a homeowner who voted and paid taxes.
His son, Primus, was a fellow abolitionist, spent years supporting education of African American children, was a Freemason in his father's lodge and had served in the Revolutionary War.

==Revolutionary War==

Hall encouraged enslaved and freed blacks to serve the American colonial military. He believed that if blacks were involved in the founding of the new nation, it would aid in the attainment of freedom for all blacks.Loretta J.

England issued a proclamation that guaranteed freedom to blacks who enlisted in the British army. Once the British Army filled its ranks with black troops, the Continental Army reversed its decision and allowed blacks into the military.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=What a Mighty Power We Can be: African American Fraternal Groups and the Struggle for Racial Equality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ku9aOC9OxnMC&pg=PA34|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12299-1|page=233[/tpl] It is believed, but not certain, that Hall was one of the six "Prince Halls" from Massachusetts to serve during the war.

Having served during the Revolutionary War, many African Americans expected, but did not receive, racial equality when the war ended. With the intention of improving the lives of fellow African Americans, Prince Hall collaborated with others to propose legislation for equal rights. He also hosted community events, such as educational forums and theatre events to improve the lives of black people.
Many of the original members of the African Masonic Lodge had served during the Revolutionary War.[tpl]cite book|title=What a Mighty Power We Can be: African American Fraternal Groups and the Struggle for Racial Equality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ku9aOC9OxnMC&pg=PA34|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12299-1|pages=2–3[/tpl]

==Freemason==

Prince Hall was interested in the Masonic fraternity because Freemasonry was founded upon ideals of liberty, equality and peace. Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Prince Hall and fourteen other free black men petitioned for admittance to the white Boston St. John’s Lodge.Maurice Wallace, “Are We Men?: Prince Hall, Martin Delany, and the Masculine Ideal in Black Freemasonry,” American Literary History, Vol. 9, No. 3.Freemasonry British Columbia and Yukon. Prince Hall. They were turned down. Having been rejected by colonial Freemasonry, Hall and 15 others sought and were initiated into Masonry by members of Lodge No. 441 of the Grand Lodge of Ireland on March 6, 1775.princehall.org A Brief History of Prince Hall Freemasonry in Massachusetts Prince Hall. Retrieved July 16, 2012 The Lodge was attached to the British forces stationed in Boston. Hall and other freedmen founded African Lodge No. 1 and he was named Grand Master.}
The black Masons had limited power; they could meet as a lodge, take part in the Masonic procession on St. John’s Day, and bury their dead with Masonic rites but could not confer Masonic degrees or perform any other essential functions of a fully operating Lodge.Joanna Brooks, “Prince Hall Freemasonry, and Genealogy,” African American Review, Vol. 34, No. 2. Unable to create a charter, they applied to the Grand Lodge of England. The grand master of the Mother Grand Lodge of England, H. R. H. The Duke of Cumberland, issued a charter for the African Lodge No. 1 later renamed African Lodge no. 459 September 29, 1784.Sidney Kaplan and Emma Nogrady Kaplan, The Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1989; ISBN 0-87023-663-6), p. 203. The lodge was the country's first African Masonic lodge.[tpl]cite book|author=James Sidbury Professor of History University of Texas at Austin|title=Becoming African in America : Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic: Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FZCRrc4bZBkC|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804322-5|page=41[/tpl] Due to the African Lodge's popularity and Prince Hall's leadership, the Grand Lodge of England made Hall a Provincial Grand Master on January 27, 1791. His responsibilities included reporting on the condition of lodges in the Boston area. Six years later, on March 22, 1797 Prince Hall organized a lodge in Philadelphia, called African Lodge #459, under Prince Hall’s Charter. They later received their own charter. On June 25, 1797 he organized African Lodge (later known as Hiram Lodge #3) at Providence, Rhode Island.Coleman, 2007.

Author and historian James Sidbury said  "Prince Hall and those who joined him to found Boston's African Masonic Lodge built a fundamentally new "African" movement on a preexisting institutional foundation. Within that movement they asserted emotional, mythical, and genealogical links to the continent of Africa and its peoples.[tpl]cite book|author=James Sidbury Professor of History University of Texas at Austin|title=Becoming African in America : Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic: Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FZCRrc4bZBkC|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804322-5|page=73[/tpl] 
After the death of Prince Hall, on December 4, 1807, the brethren organized the African Grand Lodge on June 24, 1808, including the Philadelphia, Providence and Boston lodges. The African Grand Lodge was in 1827 renamed the Prince Hall Grand Lodge, in his honor.Theda Skocpol, “Organizations Despite Adversity: The Origins and Development of African American Fraternity Associates," Social Science History, Volume 28, Number 3.
Hall was considered the "father of African Freemasonry."[tpl]cite book|author=James Sidbury Professor of History University of Texas at Austin|title=Becoming African in America : Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic: Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FZCRrc4bZBkC|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804322-5|page=74[/tpl] Prince Hall said of civic activities:  My brethren, let us pay all due respect to all who God had put in places of honor over us: do justly and be faithful to them hat hire you, and treat them with the respect they may deserve; but worship no man.

==Community activism==

After Hall obtained his freedom, he worked within the state political arena to advance rights for blacks, end slavery and protect free blacks from being kidnapped by slave traders. He proposed a back-to-Africa movement, pressed for equal educational opportunities, and operated a school for African Americans in his home. He engaged in public speaking and debate, citing Christian scripture against slavery to a predominantly Christian legislative body.[tpl]cite book|author=Lorenzo Johnston Greene|title=Prince Hall: Massachusetts Leader in Crisis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HpJflAEACAAJ|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=1961|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|page=288[/tpl]

===Education===

Hall requested that the Massachusetts Congress create a school program for black children. Hall cited the same platform for fighting the American Revolution of “Taxation without Representation.”[tpl]cite book|author=William A. Muraskin|title=Middle-class Blacks in a White Society: Prince Hall Freemasonry in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tKoc4KF8u1cC&pg=PA33|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02705-3|pages=33, 227[/tpl]Joanna Brooks, "Prince Hall, Freemasonry, and Genealogy," Indiana State University, 34.2 (2000): 197–216. Print. Although Hall’s arguments were logical, his two attempts at passing legislation through the Massachusetts Senate both resulted in failure. Denied equal funding,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Hall started a school program for free black children out of his own home that emphasized classical education and Liberal Arts.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Primus, his son, established a school in his home for the education of African American children and sought funding from the community, including African American sailors. Elisha Sylvester was a teacher there. After Elisha, two Harvard University students taught the school. Unsuccessful in attempts to establish a public school with the city of Boston in 1800, the school was moved to the African Meeting House, the church built by Thomas Paul, an African American minister. Primus Hall continued fund-raising to support the African American school until 1835.

===Speech and petition writing===

He is known for giving speeches and writing petitions. In a speech given to the Boston African Masonic Lodge, Hall stated, “My brethren, let us not be cast down under these and many other abuses we at present labour under: for the darkest is before the break of day… Let us remember what a dark day it was with our African brethren, six years ago, in the French West Indies. Nothing but the snap of the whip was heard, from morning to evening”.Maurice Jackson, “Friends of the Negro! Fly with Me, The Path is Open to the Sea,” Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 58 – 59.
His notable written works include the 1792 Charge and 1797 Charge.[tpl] cite book| author=Gregory S.

He addressed the importance of black leaders playing prominent roles in the shaping of the country and creation of unity. In his 1797 Charge, Hall wrote about the treatment and hostility that blacks received in the United States.[tpl]cite book|author=James Sidbury Professor of History University of Texas at Austin|title=Becoming African in America : Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic: Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FZCRrc4bZBkC|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804322-5|pages=119–123, 230[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Charles Harris Wesley|title=Prince Hall, life and legacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LHcbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=1983|publisher=United Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction, Prince Hall Affiliation|pages=55–61, 110–119[/tpl] He recognized black revolutionaries in the Haitian Revolution. Hall also wrote a petition in 1787.
In a speech he presented in June, 1797, Hall said:
 Patience, I say; for were we not possessed of a great measure of it, we could not bear up under the daily insults we meet with in the streets of Boston, much more on public days of recreation. How, at such times, are we shamefully abused, and that to such a degree, that we may truly be said to carry our lives in our hands, and the arrows of death are flying about our heads....tis not for want of courage in you, for they know that they dare not face you man for man, but in a mob, which we despise... 

===Back to Africa movement===

Prince Hall was involved in the Back-to-Africa movement and approached the legislature to request funds for voluntary emigration to Africa. In January 1773, Prince Hall and seventy three other African-American delegates presented an emigration plea to the Massachusetts Senate.Arthur White, "Black Leadership Class and Education in Antebellum Boston", The Journal of Negro Education, Autumn 1973.[tpl]cite book|author=James Sidbury Professor of History University of Texas at Austin|title=Becoming African in America : Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic: Race and Nation in the Early Black Atlantic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FZCRrc4bZBkC|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804322-5|pages=78, 119[/tpl] This plea contended that the African Americans would be better suited to the warm climate of Africa and would better endure the African lifestyle. This failed.
Hall fought hard for the movement when a group of freed black men were captured and detained while making their way to Africa. Due to a lack of support and enthusiasm for the movement, Hall decided to turn his efforts towards equality in education.

==Copp's Hill Burying Ground==

Prince Hall died in 1807. and is buried in the Historic Copp's Hill Burying Ground in Boston along with other notable Bostonians from the colonial era. Also, thousands of African Americans who lived in the "New Guinea" community at the base of Copp's Hill are buried alongside Snowhill Street in unmarked graves.City of Boston Copp's Hill Burying Ground]
A tribute monument was erected in Copp's Hill on June 24, 1835 in his name next to his grave marker. The inscription reads:
