[[Sussex RUR Cup]]

CATEGORIES: County Cup competitions, 1896 establishments in England, Sussex

The Sussex Royal Ulster Rifles Charity Cup is the original Cup which was presented to the Sussex County FA in 1897 by the Officers and men of the Royal Irish Rifles (subsequently Royal Ulster Rifles). The 1st Battalion Royal Irish Rifles won the Sussex Senior Cup, Brighton Shield, Charity Cup and Vernon Wentworth Cup in 1895/6 and were recognised as ‘Sussex Champions’. The trophy was presented as a permanent memento of their achievement and to raise money for charity. 
Since its inception in 1896/7, the Sussex (R.U.R) Charity Cup has had many different formats from an end of season invitation competition to its present knockout style. A third of all gate receipts from the matches played in the competition go to the SCFA Benevolent Fund for injured players.
