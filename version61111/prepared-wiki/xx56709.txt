[tpl]cquote|It's the area code for British Columbia... we're glad we've attached this strange importance to that number, it crops up everywhere now. We noticed when we stayed in Hamburg in Germany (in a hotel called "Commodore" – pure coincidence), that the number to phone reception from your room was '604'. Moments afterwards the building had caught fire and we were lucky to escape with our lives. I'm not joking.|4=Daniel Hunt[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/ladytron-2/ |title=Ladytron – Chaos Control Digizine |publisher=Chaoscontrol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl][/tpl]

Reuben Wu said about the process of making a new Ladytron album: "We start writing individually. We've never really lived in the same city before. We've always been geographically apart. ... It's always been first as individuals, and then reviewing everything together, and then working on each other's songs. That's how we've always worked. And it goes well with how we make music. We do get together down the line and in the studio when we start fleshing out the tracks".[tpl]cite web|title=Interview: Ladytron's Reuben Wu - Shanghai - Shanghai Blogs Blog - City Weekend Guide|url=http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/articles/blogs-shanghai/shanghais-nightlife/interview-ladytrons-reuben-wu/|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]
