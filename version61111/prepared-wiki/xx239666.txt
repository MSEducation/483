Albert Stroni (born 18 November 1971) is an Albanian retired footballer who played as a striker.

==Club career==

Born in Fier, Stroni soon showed skills as a prolific striker in his homeland, playing for Dinamo Tirana and Apolonia Fier and being instrumental in the former side's double in the 1989–90 season.
In 1992 Stroni moved to FR Yugoslavia to play for FK Partizan but, after being vastly overlooked, he returned home to Dinamo Tirana. In the following summer he switched to Spain, where he would spend most of his remaining years as a footballer: he started with SD Compostela but, because of burocratic reasons, ended not playing a single league match for the club, after which he joined Galician neighbours CD Ourense also in the second division, where he also did not manage to appear officially.
Subsequently, Stroni signed with amateurs Club Lemos in the same autonomous community, eventually becoming one of the most important players in the club's history, averaging more than one goal every two games and first promoting the club to the fourth level. After three seasons he played one year with another amateur – and Galician – side, Ponte Ourense, and another in Gimnástica Segoviana CF. 
Stroni would represent three clubs in 2000–01, starting in Portugal with F.C. Maia then returning to Spain to play for Mérida UD and CD Don Benito. In the following campaign he signed with French team Angers SCO but, after a poor year, returned again to Spain and Lemos, for a further four years and another fourth-tier promotion (in his last season he acted as player-coach, and scored a total of 105 official goals in his two spells). The 35-year-old retired in 2007, after one season with another team in division four, CD Lalín.
After retiring Stroni relocated in Ourense, where he opened a car stand. Shortly after, however, he accepted the offer to manage Lemos, who faced the possibility of folding.Desde Albania con balón (From Albania with a football); El País, 25 January 2010 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]

==International career==

Stroni represented the Albanian national team on 35 occasions, all categories counted. After appearing for the under-21s – during that team's trip to Spain, he fled and requested right of asylum – he went on to gain three caps for the senior side.
