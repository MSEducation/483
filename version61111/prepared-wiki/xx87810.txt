Staunton ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|æ|n|t|ən[/tpl] [tpl]respell|STAN|tən[/tpl]) is an independent city in the U.S. state of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 23,746.[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51790.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2014[/tpl] It is the county seat of surrounding Augusta County,[tpl]GR|6|dateform=mdy[/tpl] although the two are separate jurisdictions.
Staunton is a principal city of the Staunton-Waynesboro Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a 2010 population of 118,502.
Staunton is known for being the birthplace of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. president, and the home of Mary Baldwin College, historically a women's college. The city is also home to Stuart Hall, a private co-ed preparatory school, as well as the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind.

==History==

The area was first settled in 1732 by John Lewis and family. In 1736, William Beverley, a wealthy planter and merchant from Essex County, was granted by the Crown over 118,000 acres (478 km²) in what would become Augusta County. Surveyor Thomas Lewis in 1746 laid out the first town plat for Beverley of what was originally called Beverley's Mill Place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roanetnhistory.org/bookread.php?loc=WaddellsAnnals&pgid=64 |title=Chapter 3: From the First Court to the First Indian War - Page 52, Waddell's Annals of Augusta County, Virginia, from 1726 to 1871 |publisher=Roanetnhistory.org |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl] Founded in 1747, it was renamed in honor of Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife to Royal Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Gooch.[tpl]cite book |last= Room |first= Adrian |title= Dictionary of World Place Names Derived from British Names |year= 1989 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |isbn= 978-0-415-02811-0|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=7JEOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1 |pages= 168[/tpl] Because the town was located at the geographical center of the colony (which then included West Virginia), Staunton served between 1738 and 1771 as regional capital for what was known as the Northwest Territory, with the westernmost courthouse in British North America prior to the Revolution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.co.augusta.va.us/Index.aspx?page=422 |title=Augusta County, VA : History |publisher=Co.augusta.va.us |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl] By 1760, Staunton was one of the major "remote trading centers in the backcountry" which coordinated the transportation of the vast amounts of grain and tobacco then being produced in response to the change of Britain from a net exporter of produce to an importer.  Staunton thus played a crucial role in the mid 18th century expansion of the economies of the American Colonies which, in turn, contributed to the success of the American Revolution.[tpl]cite book | author = Gordon S. Wood | title = The American Revolution: a history | publisher = Modern Library | year = 2002 | page = 13 | isbn = 0-679-64057-6[/tpl] It served as capital of Virginia in June 1781, when state legislators fled Richmond and then Charlottesville to avoid capture by the British.
Slaves were held in Staunton. For instance, in 1815, a slave named Henry ran away from John G. Wright's Staunton plantation. Wright later placed an ad in the Daily National Intelligencer in Washington, D.C. seeking Henry's return. This ad is notable in its genre for the fact that it notes that Henry was an excellent cook and was widely travelled, having been to the West Indies.[tpl]cite web | url = http://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/3494 | title = Wanted: Experienced Cook, World Traveler, Runaway Slave | publisher = The History Engine at the University of Richmond | accessdate = August 2, 2011[/tpl]

===The Civil War and immediately prior===

In August 1855, President Franklin Pierce visited Staunton.  He gave a speech at the Virginia Hotel, in which he stated that his "feelings revolted from the idea of a dissolution of the union."  He said that "it would be the Iliad of innumerable woes, from the contemplation of which he shrank."[tpl]cite news|publisher=New York Daily Times (reprinted from the Staunton Vindicator)|date=August 22, 1855|page=1|title=The President in Staunton, Va.[/tpl]
Located along the Valley Pike, Staunton developed as a trade, transportation and industrial center, particularly after the Virginia Central Railroad arrived in 1854. Factories made carriages, wagons, boots and shoes, clothing and blankets. In 1860, the Staunton Military Academy was founded.  By 1860, Staunton had at least one pro-union, anti-slavery newspaper (the Staunton Spectator) and at least one pro-secession, pro-slavery newspaper (the Staunton Vindicator).[tpl]cite web | url = http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/hist100.06/kim/essay.html | title = A Disunited South: Augusta and its Pro-Unionists | author = Fritz Umbach | accessdate = August 2, 2011[/tpl]  The Spectator ran editorials before the war urging its citizens to vote for union,[tpl]cite web | url = http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/news/ss1860/va.au.ss.1860.09.11.xml | title = How to Vote | publisher = The Staunton Spectator | date = September 11, 1860 | accessdate = August 2, 2011[/tpl] while the Vindicator ran, e.g., stories reporting on "unruly" slaves mutilating themselves to escape being sold.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/responses/docs8.html | title = Desperate Negro Woman | publisher = The Staunton Vindicator | year = 1861 | accessdate = August 2, 2011[/tpl]
On May 23, 1861, Virginians voted on whether or not to ratify articles of secession from the Union.  The articles were overwhelmingly approved throughout the Commonwealth.  In Staunton the vote was 3300 in favor of secession and 6 opposed.[tpl]cite news|publisher=New York Times|date=June 1, 1861|page=8|title=The Vote for Secession in Virginia[/tpl]  During the Civil War, the town became an important Shenandoah Valley manufacturing, staging area and supply depot for the Confederacy.  On May 2, 1862, Union General John C. Frémont occupied Staunton while on his way to a rendezvous with General Nathaniel P. Banks[tpl]cite news|title=Fremont at Staunton, VA|work=Kalamazoo Gazette|date=May 2, 1862|page=2[/tpl] to pursue Stonewall Jackson into what would become known as the Battle of Cross Keys, fought near Harrisonburg, Virginia on June 6-7, 1862.

==Western State Hospital==

Staunton is also home to the former Western State Lunatic Asylum, a hospital for the mentally ill, which originally began operations in 1828. The hospital was renamed Western State Hospital in 1894.
In its early days, the facility was a resort-style asylum. It had terraced gardens where patients could plant flowers and take walks, roof walks to provide mountain views, and many architectural details to create an atmosphere that would aid in the healing process.  However, by the mid 19th Century, this utopian model of care had vanished, replaced by overcrowding in the facility and the warehousing of patients.  Techniques such as "ankle and wrist restraints, physical coercion, and straitjackets" were used.   After the passage of the Eugenical Sterilization Act of 1924 in Virginia,HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 607 (HJ607ER), "Expressing the General Assembly's regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics", Virginia Legislative Information System  patients were forcibly sterilized at Western State[tpl]cite journal | journal = Augusta Historical Bulletin | author = Amanda Brocato | title = The Campaign for Eugenics in Virginia: The Influence of Dr. J.S. DeJarnette | year = 2008 | pages = 105–117[/tpl] until the law authorizing the practice was repealed in the 1970s.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/eugenics/4-influence.cfm | title = Eugenics in Virginia | publisher = Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, University of Virginia | accessdate = July 31, 2011[/tpl]  Later, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were practiced at the facility.
When Western State vacated the property and moved its adult patients to its present site near Interstate 81, the facility was renamed the Staunton Correctional Center and turned into a medium-security men's penitentiary. The prison closed in 2003, and the site was left vacant for several years. In 2005, the state of Virginia gave the original property to the Staunton Industrial Authority.[tpl]cite web | url = http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?051+sum+HB1943 | title = Virginia HB1943/SB1015 | accessdate = July 30, 2011[/tpl]  It is now a condominium complex called The Villages at Staunton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2006/02/02/onarchstaunton.html |title=The HooK: On architecture - Historic treatment: Staunton commits to Western State |publisher=Readthehook.com |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl]
A separate complex, The DeJarnette State Sanatoruim, was constructed in 1932 and acted as a location for patients with the ability to pay for their treatment. Dr. DeJarnette was the superintendent of the sanatorium from its opening until his retirement in 1947.

Folksinger Phil Ochs attended Staunton Military Academy between 1956 and 1958, where he played clarinet in the marching band.  His exposure to the country music played on local radio, quite different from what he was used to hearing in his home state of Ohio, was a significant influence on his decision to become a singer.[tpl]cite book|last=Schumacher|first=Michael|title=There but for fortune: the life of Phil Ochs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vj8IAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 14, 2011|date=September 6, 1996|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0-7868-6084-5|page=27[/tpl]

Black Virginians were largely barred from education until Reconstruction.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/education.htm | title = Beginnings of Black Education | publisher = Virginia State Historical Society | year = 2004 | accessdate = August 5, 2011[/tpl]  The first school in Staunton which allowed African-Americans to attend was established by the Freedmen's Bureau under the supervision of the commanding general of the occupying Union army in late 1865.  Arrangements were made to bring in women from the North as teachers, and the jury rooms of the Augusta County Courthouse, located at 1 E. Johnson Street, were to be used as classrooms.  The court protested this plan, however, and it is possible that another location was found.[tpl]cite news | date = October 31, 1865 | newspaper = Staunton Spectator | page = 3 | title = Freedmen's School | url = http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/news/ss1865/va.au.ss.1865.10.31.xml#03 [/tpl]
In 1964 the Staunton chapter of the NAACP threatened the city with a lawsuit if they did not immediately desegregate the public schools.[tpl]cite news|work=The Free Lance-Star|date=May 12, 1964|title=Staunton Keeps Pupil System, Faces Suit|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-dhNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w4oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6407%2C3742337[/tpl]  The City School Board, headed by Thomas W. Dixon, declined to take further action, contending that the schools were already desegregated as ten black children had been allowed to attend previously all-white schools. Attorneys for the city of Staunton submitted a plan for the desegregation of its public schools in 1965 by eliminating all negro schools in time for the 1967-68 school year, which was approved by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  However, the implementation of this plan was delayed to such an extent that a group of African-American parents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the city.  This case, Bell v. School Board of Staunton, was decided on January 5, 1966, with the court stating that the delay was a violation of the rights of the students under the Fourteenth Amendment and ordering that the schools and their faculty be desegregated in time for the 1966-67 school year.[tpl]cite web | url = http://va.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19660105_0000001.WVA.htm/qx | title = Bell v.

The Staunton city school district is one of 21 in Virginia which take elementary school students out of class for Bible lessons on a voluntary basis, a practice known as Weekday Religious Education.  Although the U.S. Supreme Court ended taxpayer funded religious education in 1948 in McCollum v. Board of Education, four years later they opened the door to privately funded voluntary classes held during school hours but away from school premises in Zorach v. Clauson.  In 2005, a group of parents in Staunton asked the school board to halt the practice.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29266-2005Jan22.html | publisher = The Washington Post | date = January 23, 2005 | title = Bible Breaks at Public Schools Face Challenges in Rural Virginia | author = Carol Morello | accessdate = July 31, 2011[/tpl]  However, the challenge was unsuccessful, and the Bible classes are still being taught (as of June 2013).[tpl]cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:NVIR&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=146F7069EFDA7918&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Donations needed to keep Religious Ed program operating|work=The News-Virginian|author=Bob Stuart|date=June 16, 2013[/tpl]

Amtrak provides service to Staunton under the Cardinal route. The route serves Staunton's downtown train station. It also serves as the closest station for the nearby cities of Harrisonburg and Lexington.
Staunton had a municipal bus system during the 20th century, known as the Staunton Transit Service, but it was dissolved in 1989.[tpl]cite web | url = http://commonwealthcoach.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66&Itemid=78 | title = 1973 GMC TDH3302 Staunton Transit at Commonwealth Coach and Trolley | accessdate = July 31, 2011[/tpl]  In 1944, World War II veteran S. Melvin Johnson wrote to Truman Gibson, assistant to William H. Hastie, advisor to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, regarding segregated seating on the Staunton Transit Service and stating that returning African-American soldiers would not stand for such conditions.Letter from S. Melvin Johnson to Truman Gibson, collected in Subject Files of Judge William H. Hastie, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War, “N” through “Z”. National Archives, College Park, Maryland. This letter was an indication of the role that African-American veterans would later play in the American civil rights movement.  In 1946, after the United States Supreme Court decision Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, which found that Virginia's segregated seating law was unconstitutional with respect to interstate bus routes, Ethel New, a black woman from Lynch, Kentucky, was arrested for violating the law because she had purchased an intrastate ticket.[tpl]cite news|title=Must Occupy Back Seat, VA Supreme Court says|work=The Afro American|date=September 6, 1947|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Yh0mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vv0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4251%2C1151045[/tpl]  New suffered a miscarriage subsequent to her arrest and sued Greyhound Lines and the arresting officer in Staunton. In September 1947, meeting in Staunton, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the all-white jury's verdict exonerating both the bus line and the officer.
