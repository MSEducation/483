Gorodomlya Island is located on the Seliger Lake in the Tver Oblast of Russia. It is 200 miles northwest of Moscow.
The Soviet government established a biological research center at Gorodomlya Island in 1928. During the 1930s the island was a test site for pathogens that cause foot-and-mouth disease.
In 1946, German rocket scientists, including Helmut Gr√∂ttrup, were brought to the island to work on the Soviet space program. The German colony at Gorodomlya was designated as Branch 1 of research bureau NII-88. The bureau participated in the design of the R-1 rocket, a version of the V-2 manufactured with Russian parts.
