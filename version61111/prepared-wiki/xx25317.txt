[[Heelflip]]

CATEGORIES: Skateboarding tricks

The heelflip (aka heel), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis.
A heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the Ollie has become a defining trick of "New School" skateboarding[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl].

==Execution==

A heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, the board spins toe-side (towards the toes). For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.
While the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder:

Variations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:
