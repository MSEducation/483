[[Hybrid reactor]]

CATEGORIES: Anaerobic digester types

A hybrid reactor is an anaerobic digester that combines a UASB reactor with an anaerobic filter. This combination is an advanced form enabling improved solid retention time in the treatment of waste water. This waste water can be built up in the secondary chamber and must be removed daily or an explosion is imminent to occur.
