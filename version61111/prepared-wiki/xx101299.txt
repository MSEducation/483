[[Christina piercing]]

CATEGORIES: Female genital piercings

A Christina piercing, also known as a Venus piercing, is a female genital piercing. It is located where the outer labia meet, below the pubic mound.Margo DeMello (2007) Encyclopedia of Body Adornment, pp133, Greenwood Press ISBN 978-0-313-33695-9 Unless the recipient has an extremely sympathetic anatomy, Christinas are usually considered surface piercings and have a high rejection rate. Due to anatomical variation, it is not possible with every woman. The piercing does not facilitate sexual stimulation and can be found uncomfortable when pressure is applied, for example when wearing tight pants.Elayne Angel (2009) The Piercing Bible, pp151, Crossing Press ISBN 978-1-58091-193-1   

==History and culture==

The Christina piercing, like most surface piercings, is of contemporary origin. The first known Christina piercing was performed in the 1990s.  As is common practice in the piercing industry, it was named after the first recipient of the piercing, a woman named Christina. It is also occasionally referred to by the less commonly used term Venus, in reference to its placement.

==Healing==

The piercing usually heals in 3 to 4 months.  Because it involves a surface piercing, it can lead to complications during the healing phase.  Further difficulties develop due to the relatively long piercing canal and constant movement and friction.  In addition to infection, the Christina piercing also is inclined to wash out.  As soon as it is completely healed, the jewelry should be taken out before shaving the intimate vulva or mons pubis areas.  

==Jewelry==

Christinas are usually pierced with either a custom made circular barbell or surface bar, to reduce the risk of rejection.  If the recipient's anatomy allows for it, a captive bead ring can be worn after the piercing has fully healed. A captive bead ring should never be used as initial jewellery.
