==Background and release==

During an interview with Digital Spy, Derulo stated that the prospect of his first single with a guest appearance made him "really excited": he called "Talk Dirty" "shocking" and "out there", and felt that listeners would "be thinking 'Hmm, really?!'", but also that "it was so much fun". The song was released to digital retailers in New Zealand on August 2, 2013, with a release in Australia following on August 9: it was released in the United Kingdom on September 15, 2013. On December 17, Derulo released the official acoustic version of the song. Following the success of the song Derulo re-recorded the song and premiered the official Spanish version of the single ‘Háblame sucio‘ also with the guest vocals of 2 Chainz on February 27, 2014, and is scheduled for digital release on March 11, 2014.http://www.jasonderulo.com/news/talk-dirty-en-espanol-1976196http://www.idolator.com/7507940/jason-derulo-unleashes-a-spanish-version-of-smash-hit-talk-dirty-listen

==Composition==

"Talk Dirty" largely eschews the pop and electronic influences found in Derulo's earlier work, instead drawing prominently from contemporary R&B.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/4320321/jason-derulo-announces-tattoos-album-releases-talk-dirty-track | title=Jason Derulo Announces 'Tattoos' Album, Releases 'Talk Dirty' Track with 2 Chainz | publisher=Prometheus Global Media | work=Billboard | date=July 23, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013 | author=Rettig, James[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rap-up.com/2013/07/23/new-music-jason-derulo-f-2-chainz-talk-dirty/ | title=New Music: Jason Derulo f/ 2 Chainz – 'Talk Dirty' | publisher=Devin Lazerine | work=Rap-Up | date=July 23, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013[/tpl] The song opens and closes with a woman speaking words in broken english: Spin magazine considered this one element of an attempt to encompass an "international polyglot/clusterfuck pop atmosphere" similar to that found in the production work of Timbaland in the early 2000s.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.spin.com/articles/rap-songs-of-the-week-2-chainz-teams-up-with-jason-derulo-for-some-reason/ | title=Rap Songs of the Week: 2 Chainz Teams Up With Jason Derulo for Some Reason | publisher=Spin Media | work=Spin | date=July 25, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013[/tpl] Ricky Reed's instrumentation, which contains a sample of "Hermetico" by Israeli group Balkan Beat Box, incorporates percussion as well as the "honky-horns" that back the chorus,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/listen-to-jason-derulo-talk-dirty-f-2-chainz-strea/74363/ | title=Listen To Jason Derulo's 'Talk Dirty' F. 2 Chainz | publisher=Prefix Magazine | date=July 24, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013 | author=Barretto, Clyde[/tpl] which Spin likened to those found in "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis and "Somewhereinamerica" by Jay-Z. The track is in the Phrygian dominant scale, with a tonal centre of F sharp major.  A version with a sax solo in place of the rap verse was also released to mainstream radio. The chorus also uses a sample from Balkan Beat Box' song "Move It"

==Critical reception==

James Rettig of Billboard commended Derulo for "taking more risks" with the song's composition than in "The Other Side", citing the horn sounds backing the chorus as an example. Spin criticized Derulo's sexualised lyrics for demonstrating "cultural ignorance", but concluded that the song as a whole "is the craziest song that could be a hit right now", in that Derulo's lyrics make those performed by 2 Chainz "appear almost tasteful". Writing for MSN, Kathy Iandoli described the song as "horn-heavy, splashy, braggy", and wrote that 2 Chainz's lyrics lend the song "X-rated fun" by "balancing out the PG-rated verses" of Derulo.
Rap-Up noted how "Talk Dirty" demonstrates a "more scandalous side" of Derulo.  Kathy Iandoli's review of the song for MSN contains the subtitle "Apparently the booty speaks a universal language", based on Derulo's lyrics – which he partly speaks in a patois – claiming that even if he cannot speak the language of a foreign woman, her "booty don't need explaining", and his reference to "lipstick stamps" on his passport.[tpl]cite web | url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--jason-derulo-and-2-chainz-talk-dirty-in-new-uk-single | title=Jason Derulo and 2 Chainz "Talk Dirty" In New UK Single | publisher=Microsoft | work=[tpl]noitalic|MSN[/tpl] | date=July 23, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013 | author=Iandoli, Kathy[/tpl] DJBooth reviewer Richard quipped that "Talk Dirty" demonstrates how when Derulo "spits game to beautiful women... he always manages to make himself understood".

===Reception===

Although Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV claimed that the video was thematically shallow, writing that it contained "no real plot... other than "ass"... "hot babes playing trumpets" and "flexing pecs", she complimented Derulo's choreography and dancing, observing him to "shake it like a bawse while scoping out those hot babes playing trumpets" as he "dances and twerks around the video's many colorful sets", and quipped "The more pec-flexin', the better!"[tpl]cite web | url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2013/08/07/jason-derulo-2-chainz-talk-dirty-video/ | title=New Video: Jason Derulo Featuring 2 Chainz, 'Talk Dirty' (NSFW) | publisher=Viacom Media Networks | work=[tpl]noitalic|MTV[/tpl] | date=August 7, 2013 | accessdate=August 18, 2013 | author=Rubenstein, Jenna Hally[/tpl]
