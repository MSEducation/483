==History==

The name "Gatwick" was first recorded as "Gatwik" in 1241 (the name of a manor) on the site of today's airport, on the northern edge of the North Terminal's aircraft taxiing area; until the 19th century, it was owned by the De Gatwick family."Gatwick Airport History", Business & Community Reference Guide for in and around Crawley 2008/09, Wealden Marketing, 2008, p. 85 Its name  derives from the Anglo-Saxon gāt (goat) and wīc (dairy farm); i.e. "goat farm".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/names.html |title=The origins of some English place names |author=Lambert, Tim |quote= (-wick: ... Or it could mean a specialised farm 'e.g. Gatwick was a goat farm' ) |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]
The London and Brighton Railway opened on 21 September 1841, and ran near Gatwick Manor. In 1890, the descendants of the original owners sold the area to the newly established Gatwick Race Course Company. The new owners opened a racecourse the following year adjacent to the London-Brighton railway, and a dedicated station included sidings for horse boxes. The course hosted steeplechases and flat races, including the Grand National during the First World War in 1916, 1917 and 1918.

===1920–1945===

During the late 1920s, land adjacent to the racecourse (at Hunts Green Farm, along Tinsley Green Lane) was used as an aerodrome; it was licensed in August 1930 as Gatwick Aerodrome after a change of owners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatwickaviationsociety.org.uk/history.asp |title=History – 1958 |publisher=Gatwick Aviation Society website |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl] Later that year the Surrey Aero Club was formed at the aerodrome by Ronald Waters, manager of Home Counties Aircraft Service (based at Penshurst Airfield in Kent). The club used the Hunts Green farmhouse as its clubhouse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1930/untitled0%20-%201179.html |title=Surrey Aero Club Opening, Private Flying and Club News|work=Flight International |date=10 October 1930 |page=1115 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/content/image_galleries/gatwick_50_gallery.shtml |title=Gatwick at 50, Sussex History |work=BBC Southern Counties |date=May 2009 |page= |accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/content/image_galleries/gatwick_50_gallery.shtml?3|title=Gatwick at 50|website=BBC Sussex & Surrey|accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl]
The Redwing Aircraft Company bought the aerodrome in 1932, and operated a flying school; it was also used for pilots flying in for races. In 1933, the Air Ministry approved commercial flights from Gatwick, and the aerodrome was sold for £13,500 to investor Morris Jackaman. Jackaman formed a new airport company, Airports Limited, in 1934. Hillman's Airways became Gatwick's first commercial airline operator, beginning scheduled service from the airport to Belfast and Paris.
In 1935, a new airline, Allied British Airways, was formed with the  merger of Hillman's Airways, United Airways and Spartan Airways. The new carrier, which shortened its name to British Airways, became Gatwick's principal operator. The lack of adequate space at Heston Aerodrome resulted in Airwork Services' relocating to Gatwick.
On 6 July 1935, the aerodrome closed temporarily for renovations, which included the construction of the "Beehive", the world's first circular terminal building. In September the Gatwick railway station opened, served by two trains per hour on the Victoria-Brighton line. On 30 September, the Tinsley Green station opened [tpl]convert|0.85|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the present Gatwick station.
The first scheduled flight departed from the Beehive terminal on 17 May 1936, bound for Paris. The airfare was £4 5s, including a first-class rail ticket from London Victoria Station. The airport was officially reopened on 6 June 1936 by the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Swinton. The opening ceremony of the Beehive, the airport's new terminal, was held the same day. The Beehive was designed by Frank Hoar and incorporated several novel features, including a subway to the railway station at Tinsley Green which allowed passengers to travel from Victoria Station to the aircraft without stepping outside. After the airport's official reopening, the Tinsley Green railway station was renamed "Gatwick Airport". Air Travel Ltd, which had relocated to Gatwick from Penshurst, moved into the new airport's hangar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201511.html |title=Gatwick's send-off |work=Flight |date=11 June 1936 |page= 616 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201512.html |title=Gatwick's send-off ... |work=Flight |date=11 June 1936 |page= 617 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201513.html |title=Gatwick's send-off ... |work=Flight |date=11 June 1936 |page= 618 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201516.html |title=Gatwick's send-off ... |work=Flight |date=11 June 1936 |page= 619 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201475.html |title=Modern Airport – Features of Gatwick, London's Latest Terminal: Rational Building Layout: Ground and Air Traffic Control: Ancillary Services |work=Flight |date=4 June 1936 |page= 602 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201478.html |title=Modern Airport – Features of Gatwick, ... |work=Flight |date=4 June 1936 |page= 603 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201479.html |title=Modern Airport – Features of Gatwick, ... |work=Flight |date=4 June 1936 |page= 604 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl]
Two fatal accidents occurred (in September and November 1936), raising questions about the airport's safety.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202620.html |title=The Gatwick Accident, Commercial Aviation |work=Flight |date=24 September 1936 |page= 327 |accessdate=13 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202865.html |title=Gatwick and Mirabella, Commercial Aviation |work=Flight |date=22 October 1936 |page= 420 |accessdate=13 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%203281.html |title=The Crawley Accident, Commercial Aviation |work=Flight |date=20 November 1936 |page= 590 |accessdate=13 July 2011[/tpl] The area was foggy, and its clay soil drained poorly; this caused the new subway to flood after rain. As a result, and because longer landing strips were needed, the pre-war British Airways moved to Croydon Airport in 1937. Gatwick returned to private flying, and was used as a Royal Air Force (RAF) flying school. The airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in September 1939, becoming a base for RAF night-fighters and an Army co-operation squadron during the Second World War (primarily for repairs and maintenance).Aeroplane — Britain's Airports: A New Era, Vol. 111, No. 2841, p. 5, Temple Press, London, 31 March 1966 Racing at Gatwick ended in 1940.

===1945–1958===

Although the airport was officially decommissioned in 1946, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation continued operating it as a civil airfield (initially for a six-month trial period). Airwork provided maintenance at Gatwick and other charter airlines, flying war-surplus aircraft, began using the airport despite its persistent drainage problem. Most commercial air services were cargo flights. The original Gatwick railway station was renamed "Gatwick Racecourse".
In November 1948, the airport's owners warned that it might revert to private use by November 1949; Stansted was favoured as London's second airport, and Gatwick's future was unclear. In 1950, despite local opposition, the Cabinet chose Gatwick as an alternative to Heathrow, and British European Airways (BEA) began flights to the Channel Islands.Classic Aircraft (Gone but not forgotten ... BEA: Highlands and Islands — Never on a Sunday), Vol. 45, No. 6, p. 46, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, June 2012
In May 1950, Gatwick's first charter flight left the airport's original grass runway for Calvi on the Mediterranean island of Corsica (with a refuelling stop in Nice).

In July 1952, the British government confirmed that the airport would be renovated, primarily for aircraft diverted from Heathrow in bad weather. That year, BEA established a base at Gatwick for its helicopter operations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200614.html |title=BAH is moving ... to Aberdeen, Rotary Briefs, Business Aviation|work=Flight International |date=2 March 1985 |page=12 |accessdate=2 June 2012[/tpl] The airport was closed from 1956 to 1958 for the £7.8 million renovation;Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 8 during that period, BEA continued using Gatwick for its helicopter operations. The renovations were performed by Alfred McAlpine;The Road to Success: Alfred McAlpine 1935–1985, p. 54, Tony Gray, Rainbird Publishing, 1987 they entailed diverting the A23 London–Brighton trunk road and the River Mole, building a runway across the former racecourse and rebuilding the former racecourse railway station next to the new terminal. The main pier of what is now the South Terminal was laid at this time.

===1958–1970===

On 27 May 1958, the original Gatwick railway station (which had been rebuilt) reopened as the Gatwick Airport station, and the Tinsley Green station was closed. Before the official opening, Transair operated the first commercial air service from the new Gatwick on 30 May 1958;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%201230.html |title=Gatwick – 1974 |work=Flight International |date=22 August 1974 |page= 218 |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]Cooper, B., Got your number, Golden Gatwick, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 6 June 2008, p. 12 a Jersey Airlines de Havilland Heron was the first aircraft scheduled to arrive at the rebuilt airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jerseyairlines.org/bernard.html |title=The early Days |publisher=Jersey Airlines |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]
Queen Elizabeth II flew into Gatwick on 9 June 1958 in a de Havilland Heron of the Queen's Flight for the opening. The first "official" flight after the reopening ceremony was a BEA DC-3 operating a charter for the Surrey County Council to Jersey and Guernsey. Gatwick was the world's first airport with a direct railway link and the first to combine mainline rail, trunk-road facilities and an air-terminal building in one unit. It was also one of the first with an enclosed pier-based terminal, which allowed passengers to walk under cover to waiting areas near the aircraft (with only a short walk outdoors). Another feature of Gatwick's new air terminal was its modular design, permitting subsequent, phased expansion.
Between 1958 and 1959, Sudan Airways and BWIA West Indies Airways were among Gatwick's first scheduled overseas airlines. The former's Blue Nile service was the first scheduled flight from Gatwick by a foreign airline.launched on 8 June 1959 The service, between Khartoum and Gatwick via Cairo, Athens and Rome, initially used Airwork Vickers Viscount aircraft. US supplemental carriersholders of supplemental air carrier certificates authorised to operate non-scheduled passenger and cargo services to supplement the scheduled operations of certificated route air carriers; airlines holding supplemental air carrier certificates are also known as "nonskeds" in the US Seven Seas Airlines, Capitol International, President Airlines and Transocean Airlines and several South European and Scandinavian charter airlines were among the airport's early overseas users.
Beginning in the late 1950s, a number of British contemporary private airlines joined Airwork (Gatwick's only surviving pre-war private airline) at the airport. The first was Transair, which relocated to Gatwick from Croydon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1958/1958%20-%200512.html |title=Flight International, 18 April 1958, World Airline Directory ... |page= 528 |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl] It was followed by Morton Air Services and Hunting-Clan Air Transport, relocating from Croydon and Heathrow respectively. In July 1960, they merged with Airwork and Southend-based Air Charter to form British United Airways (BUA). BUA assumed its predecessors' services, becoming Britain's biggest independent (and Gatwick's foremost resident) airline during the 1960s.Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 9[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200548.html |work=Flight International |title=World Airline Survey – The UK Carriers ... |page= 546 |date= 12 April 1962 |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl] By the end of the decade it was the airport's leading scheduled operator, with a [tpl]convert|44,100|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] network of short-, medium- and long-haul routes across Europe, Africa and South America using contemporary BAC One-Eleven and Vickers VC10 jet aircraft.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, pp. 58, 61, 63, 68/9, 82/3, 88, 90, 93–98, 99
Despite the rapid expansion of BUA's (and other airlines') scheduled activities at Gatwick, the airport was dominated by non-scheduled services into the 1980s. Most were inclusive tour (IT) passenger services provided by a number of British independent operators and their overseas counterparts. During the 1960s, IT service accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of Gatwick's annual passengers, earning the airport its "bucket and spade" nickname.
On 1 April 1961, BEA began operating half its London–Paris flights from Gatwick; the airport's designation became "London (Gatwick)", emphasising its status as a London airport. London Airport became "London (Heathrow)".[tpl]cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1961/feb/23/london-region-air-traffic |publisher=Hansard |title=London Region Air Traffic |date=23 February 1961 |accessdate=4 June 2012[/tpl] The following year, two additional piers were added to the terminal.
On 1 May 1963, non-scheduled operators began implementing the Ministry of Aviation's instruction to transfer all regular charter flights from Heathrow to Gatwick, restricting the former's use for non-scheduled operations to "occasional" charter flights.Aeroplane — World Transport Affairs: Ministry instructs charter operators to use Gatwick, Vol. 105, No. 2689, p. 16, Temple Press, London, 2 May 1963 On 26 May, BUA launched "Silver Arrow", a twice-daily combined rail-air service between London and Paris with a Viscount for the cross-Channel Gatwick–Le Touquet air service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200482.html |title=New way to Paris|work=Flight International |date=4 April 1963 |page= 460 |accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl]Aeroplane — Integration in Action ...: the Silver Arrow rail-air-rail service from London to Paris, Vol. 113, No. 2883, pp. 4-6, Temple Press, London, 19 January 1967

Caledonian Airways purchased British United Airways in November 1970, and the combined airline was initially known as Caledonian/BUA. The acquisition enabled Caledonian to become a scheduled airline; in addition to the routes inherited from BUA, it began scheduled service to Europe, North and West Africa, North America and the Middle and Far East during the 1970s and 1980s.

The sales were part of GIP's strategy to syndicate the equity portion of the original acquisition by issuing bonds to refinance bank debt.

===Flight movements===

Gatwick operates as a single-runway airport although it has two runways; the northern runway (08L/26R) can only be used when the main runway (08R/26L) is out of use for any reason. Documentation published by the airport in April 2014 indicates that the usable length of its main runway (08R/26L) is [tpl]convert|11,178|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] when aircraft take off in a westerly direction (26) and [tpl]convert|10,863|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] when takeoffs occur in an easterly direction (08). The documentation lists the respective usable runway lengths for the northern runway (08L/26R) as [tpl]convert|9,974|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] (direction 08) and [tpl]convert|8,858|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] (direction 26), and states that nearly three-quarters of takeoffs are towards the west (74 percent, over a 12-month period). Both runways are [tpl]convert|148|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wide; they are [tpl]convert|656|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] apart,"Gatwick Runway Options Consultation" (Section 2: Our runway options / 2.1 Features common to all options – The length of the runway), Gatwick Airport Limited, April 2014, p. 16 which is  insufficient for the simultaneous use of both runways. During normal operations the northern runway is used as a taxiway, consistent with its original construction (although it was gradually widened).
The main runway uses a Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS). The northern runway does not have an ILS; when it is in use, arriving aircraft use a combination of distance measuring equipment and assistance from the approach controller (using surveillance radar) or (where equipped, and subject to operator approval) an RNAV (GNSS) approach (also available for the main runway).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=93&Itemid=142.html |title=NATS – London Gatwick Aerodrome Approach Charts |publisher=Nats-uk.ead-it.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl] On both runways, a continuous descent approach is used to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night.[tpl]Cite journal| author=BAA Gatwick | title = Flight Evaluation Report 2006/07| url = http://www.gatwickairport.com/assets//B2CPortal/Static%20Files/FEU%20Report%202006-07.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =26 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227080554/http%3A//www.gatwickairport.com/assets//B2CPortal/Static%2520Files/FEU%2520Report%25202006-07.pdf |archivedate = 27 February 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Security===

The airport is policed by the Gatwick District of Sussex Police. The district is responsible for the entire airport (including aircraft) and, in certain circumstances, aircraft in flight. The 150 officers attached to this district include armed and unarmed officers, and community support officers for minor offences. The airport district counters man-portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) by patrolling in and around the airport, and a separate sub-unit has vehicle checks around the airport."Guarding Gatwick", Airports – September/October 2007 (Key Publishing), p. 17
Gatwick is one of three UK airports with body scanners, located in the main search areas of both terminals. Access to airside portions of the airport is controlled and maintained by the airport's team of security officers, regulated by the Department for Transport. Brook House, an immigration-removal centre of the UK Border Agency, was opened near the airport on 18 March 2009 by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.[tpl]cite news |date=18 March 2009 |title=Illegal immigrant centre opened |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7950704.stm |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]

Slots left by the US carriers (and the collapse of Zoom, XL Airways UK and Sterling) were taken by EasyJet, Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. A number of new, full-service airlines have established operations at the airport, including Air China, Caribbean Airlines, Garuda Indonesia,due to begin operations in September 2014 Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. This is part of the airport's strategy to attract higher-spending business travellers (countering its dependence on European low-cost and charter markets), increasing year-round capacity utilisation by smoothing peaks and troughs in traffic. Gatwick's success in persuading these airlines to launch (or re-launch) routes to overseas destinations important for business and leisure travel was aided by a lack of comparable slots at Heathrow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediacentre.gatwickairport.com/News/Small-decline-in-passenger-numbers-at-Gatwick-in-January-7d0.aspx |title=Small decline in passenger numbers at Gatwick in January |publisher=London Gatwick Airport |date=11 February 2013 |accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/gatwick-goes-after-the-business-traveller |title=Gatwick goes after the business traveller |publisher=Business Traveller |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Caribbean Airlines to launch flights from Gatwick to Trinidad |url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/business/media-centre/press-releases/caribbean-airlines-to-launch-flights-from-gatwick-to-trinidad/|publisher=Gatwick Airport|date=26 March 2012|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]

==Airlines and destinations==

Gatwick has two terminals: North and South. The South Terminal is Gatwick's older and busier terminal, and is also where the airport railway station is located. The following list includes all scheduled services to and from Gatwick Airport, as well as regular charter flights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/flights/timetables/charter/ |title=Charter flights timetable |publisher=Gatwick Airport |year=2014 |accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]

===[tpl]anchor|Terminal Moves[/tpl]Terminal moves===

As part of a recently agreed, seven-year strategic commercial partnership between Gatwick and EasyJet, the airport proposes a number of changes to individual airlines' terminal locations. If agreed by all parties, the proposed changes will see EasyJet consolidate all Gatwick operations in the North Terminal while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will swap their current terminals. Gatwick believes that these terminal moves will improve the airport's operational efficiency and resilience as the use of different terminals by EasyJet and British Airways would reduce pressure on the North Terminal's check-in, security, boarding and ramp areas at peak times. In addition, a terminal swap by Virgin would free up lounge and gate space for BA long-haul passengers in the South Terminal and, unlike BA's current short-haul schedules, Virgin's long-haul schedules would not clash with EasyJet's busy schedule in the North Terminal due to the airlines' differing peak times.

==Busiest routes==

In 2012 passenger numbers declined for some busy Spanish destinations, although there was an increase in for Barcelona, Milan, Nice and the long-haul destination Cancun, Mexico. The greatest 2012 increase in domestic passengers was for Aberdeen and other airports in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while short-haul traffic within England declined.

===Traffic===

====1958–2000====

Gatwick handled 186,172 passengers during its first seven months of operation after the 1956–58 reconstruction; the annual number of passengers passing through the airport was 368,000 in 1959 and 470,000 in 1960.
Passenger numbers reached 1 million for the first time during the mid-1960s, with a record 1.4 million passing through the airport during the 1965–66 fiscal year.1 April 1965 to 31 March 1966 Gatwick accommodated two million passengers for the first time during the 1967–68 fiscal year1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968 and three million in the 1969–70 fiscal year,1 April 1969 to 31 March 1970 with British United Airways accounting for nearly half.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ukaccs.info/gatwick/profile.htm |title=Airport Profile: Brief History |publisher=Ukaccs.info |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 9 & 10
By the early 1970s, 5 million passengers used Gatwick each year, with a record 5.7 million during the 1973–74 fiscal year.1 April 1973 to 31 March 1974 During that period, British Caledonian accounted for approximately half of all charter passengers and three-fourths of scheduled passengers.
Within a decade annual passenger numbers doubled, to 10 million; they doubled again, to over 20 million, by the late 1980s.Iyengar, K., Bermuda Bloomers, Golden Gatwick, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 8 February 2008, p. 18Iyengar, K., The only way is up, Golden Gatwick, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 11 April 2008, p. 14 By the turn of the millennium, Gatwick handled more than 30 million passengers annually.

====[tpl]anchor|2000 onwards[/tpl]Since 2000====

 
 
35.4 million passengers passed through Gatwick in 2013, an increase of 3.5 percent over the previous year and exceeding the previous peak year of 2007. Long-haulexcluding North Atlantic and European scheduled passenger traffic recorded increases of 8.9 and 6.1 percent (to 5.07 and 19.65 million, respectively) over the previous year. North Atlantic, UK,including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man Irish and European charterincluding North Africa traffic saw decreases of 10.7, 1.4, 1.4 and 1.2 percent (to 1.65, 3.78, 1.27 and 4.03 million passengers respectively) over the corresponding figures for 2012.
Compared with a year earlier, March 2014 passenger numbers increased by 5.1 percent to over 2.7 million (an increase of 131,500 over March 2013). Other long-haul, European scheduled and Irish traffic recorded increases of 13.1, 11.4 and 0.1 percent (to 505,200, 1.488 million and 105,100 passengers, respectively). North Atlantic, European charter and UK traffic recorded decreases of 21.7, 19.5 and 1 percent (to 100,500, 201,800 and 307,900 passengers, respectively). Air transport movements increased by 5.4 percent (to 18,891), and cargo volume decreased by 11.9 percent (to 7,525 metric tonnes). The 6.1-percent increase in total passenger traffic to and from destinations in Europe (to over 1.8 million) included additional passengers on scheduled service to and from business destinations such as Moscow, Istanbul, Stockholm and Copenhagen and leisure destinations in Spain and Portugal. The temporary frequency increase on Flybe's route to Newquay and additional growth on other UK domestic routes proved insufficient to fully compensate for the loss of passengers on account of the withdrawal of Gatwick–Manchester services by British Airways. Double-digit declines in North Atlantic and European charter traffic reflected cessation of flights by US Airways and an ongoing shift towards the scheduled market by low-cost leisure airlines such as Monarch. Leisure traffic to the Caribbean and, to a lesser extent, business and leisure traffic connecting with Emirates via Dubai accounted for the additional 58,700 passengers travelling to other long-haul destinations. Average monthly load factors were 83.1 percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediacentre.gatwickairport.com/News/London-Gatwick-traffic-results-for-March-2014-8f1.aspx |title=London Gatwick traffic results for March 2014 |publisher=London Gatwick Airport |date=14 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]

==Ground transport==

Gatwick has set goals of 40-percent public-transport use by the time annual passenger traffic reaches 40 million (estimated in 2015) and 45 percent by the time it reaches 45 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/PublicationFiles/business_and_community/all_public_publications/2012/lgw_asas_2012_web.pdf |title=Access Gatwick |year=2012 |publisher=Gatwick Airport |accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]

===Road===

The airport is accessible from a motorway spur road at junction 9A of the M23, which links to the main M23 motorway [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] east at junction 9. The M23 connects with London's orbital motorway, the M25, [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] north; this provides access to much of Greater London, the South East and beyond, and the M23 is the main route for traffic to the airport. Gatwick is also accessible from the A23, which serves Horley and Redhill to the north and Crawley and Brighton to the south. The A217 provides access northwards to the town of Reigate. The airport has long and short-stay car parks at the airport and off-site, although these are often full in summer. Local restrictions limit parking at (and near) Gatwick.

===Rail===

The airport railway station, next to South Terminal, provides connections along the Brighton Main Line to Victoria Station and London Bridge and Brighton, Worthing, Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Bognor Regis to the south. Although the Gatwick Express to Victoria (operated by Southern) is the best-known service from the station, other companies (including First Capital Connect and First Great Western) also use the station and Southern services Victoria and London Bridge under its own name. First Capital Connect provide direct trains to Luton Airport; First Great Western trains directly link Reading and connect to Oxford and the west. Pedestrians may reach Heathrow by a X26 Express Bus outside East Croydon station, an intermediate stop for rail service to London.

===[tpl]anchor|Bus and coach[/tpl]Bus===

National Express Coaches operates coaches to Heathrow Airport, Stansted Airport and cities and towns throughout the region and country. Oxford Bus Company operate direct services to Oxford, and EasyBus operates mini-coaches from both terminals to Earls Court and West Brompton.
Local buses connect North and South Terminals with Crawley, Horley, Redhill, Horsham and Caterham. Services are offered by Metrobus and Fastway, a guided bus rapid transit system which was the first of its kind to be built outside a major city. There are two sets of stairs for pedestrians to leave South Terminal at ground level (near the cycle route) from Zone L and the train-station area (labelled Exit Q and Exit P on the ground), which access local bus stops.

===[tpl]anchor|Cycle[/tpl]Bicycle===

Route 21 of the National Cycle Network passes under South Terminal, allowing virtually traffic-free cycling northwards to Horley and southwards to Three Bridges and Crawley. A goods-style lift runs between the terminal and ground level (labelled "Lift to Cycle Route"), near Zone L.

===Terminal transfer===

The airport's North and South Terminals are connected by a [tpl]convert|0.75|mi|km[/tpl], elevated, two-way automated people mover track. The shuttle normally consists of two automatic, three-car, driver-less trains. Although colloquially known as a "monorail",[tpl]Cite book|last=Hudson|first=Kenneth |title=Industrial history from the air|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|chapter=Airports and Airfields|isbn=978-0-521-25333-8[/tpl] the shuttle runs on a dual, concrete track with rubber tyres and is not (technically) a monorail.
The Gatwick transit system opened in 1983 when the circular satellite pier was built (connecting the pier to the main terminal), and was the UK's first automated people-moving system. A second track was built in 1987, linking to the North Terminal. Although the original satellite transit line was replaced with a walkway-and-moving walkway link, the inter-terminal shuttle remains in operation.
Gatwick began upgrading its shuttle service in April 2008. The original Adtranz C-100 people-mover cars remained in operation until 2009, when they had travelled a total of 2.5 million miles (4 million km).

Gatwick has been included in a number of reviews of airport capacity in southeastern England. Expansion options have included a third terminal and a second runway, although a 40-year agreement not to build a second runway was made in 1979 with the West Sussex County Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/PublicationFiles/business_and_community/all_public_publications/transforming_gatwick/1979_Runway_Agreement_Actual_Copy.pdf |title=1979 Gatwick Airport runway agreement |publisher=Gatwick Airport |accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] Expanded operations would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today, with a new terminal between two more-widely-spaced runways. This would complement or replace the South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baa.com/assets/B2CPortal/Static%20Files/lgw_interim_masterplan.pdf |title= interim master plan (Gatwick Interim Master Plan – October 2006) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]
Airport management proposed a second runway (south of the existing runway and the airport boundary) was unveiled in July 2013. This was shortlisted for further consideration by the Airports Commission in December 2013, and the commission's final report is due to be published by summer 2015.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23410288 |title=Gatwick Airport announces second runway plan |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crawleynews.co.uk/Airports-Commission-report-Gatwick-Heathrow/story-20330773-detail/story.html |title=Airports Commission report: Gatwick & Heathrow on shortlist for expansion |publisher=www.crawleynews.co.uk |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013[/tpl] Another proposal would extend the North Terminal south, with a passenger bridge in the area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges. Gatwick's draft master plan (released for consultation on 13 October 2011) apparently dropped the passenger-bridge plan in favour of a mid-field satellite (next to the control tower) linking to the North Terminal as part of an expanded 2030 single-runway, two-terminal airport.Draft Gatwick Master Plan (A single runway airport – 2030: 10.2.14 Aprons and piers and Figure A.12, p. 93 and Appendix A – Drawings), Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, 13 October 2011
In late 2011 the Department for Transport also began a feasibility study of a high-speed rail link between Gatwick and Heathrow as part of a plan combining the airports into a "collective" or "virtual hub", Heathwick. The scheme envisages a high-speed rail route parallel to the M25, covering [tpl]convert|35|mi[/tpl] in 15 minutes. Trains would reach speeds of [tpl]convert|180|mph|kph|abbr=on[/tpl], and passengers would need to pass through immigration (or check in) only once.
