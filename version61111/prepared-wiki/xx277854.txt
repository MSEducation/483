The Tyson House, at 242 W. Liberty St. in Reno, Nevada is a historic house that was built during 1904-1906 and that was once owned by the family of Nevada senator Francis Newlands.  It includes Colonial Revival elements but is primarily of Queen Anne architectural style.
The structure is primarily significant for its architecture;  the building "is an imposing and interesting vernacular example of its style in Reno, and one of the increasingly rarer representatives of this era in the City's past."  It has been modified only slightly, and "gains prominence through its corner siting."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/83001123.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Tyson House |author=Paula Boghosian |date=June 14, 1982 |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] and accompanying two photos from 1981
