The Zygnematales ([tpl]lang-el|ζυγός[/tpl] (zygos) + νήμα (nēma) (nom.), νήματος (nēmatos) (gen.)), also called the Conjugales, are an order of green algae,[tpl]cite journal |author=Turmel M, Otis C, Lemieux C |title=The complete chloroplast DNA sequences of the charophycean green algae Staurastrum and Zygnema reveal that the chloroplast genome underwent extensive changes during the evolution of the Zygnematales |journal=BMC Biol. |volume=3|pages=22 |year=2005 |pmid=16236178 |pmc=1277820 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-3-22 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/22[/tpl] comprising several thousand different species in genera such as the well-known Zygnema and Spirogyra.  All the members of this group develop into unbranched filaments, one cell thick, which grow longer through normal cell division.  Most live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris.[tpl]clarify|reason=various debris is vague, undefined|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Systematically they fall within the division Charophyta, which includes the groups of algae that are most closely related to the higher plants. Charophyta are included with land plants (Embryophyta) in the clade Streptophyta.http://esciencenews.com/articles/2011/04/17/ancestors.land.plants.revealed
Sexual reproduction in Zygnematales takes place through a process called conjugation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kapraun DF |title=Nuclear DNA Content Estimates in Green Algal Lineages: Chlorophyta and Streptophyta |journal=Ann. Bot. |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=677–701 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17272304 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcl294 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17272304 |pmc=2802934[/tpl]  Here filaments of opposite gender line up, and tubes form between corresponding cells.  The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across, or sometimes both cells crawl into the tube.  The cells then meet and fuse to form a zygote, which later undergoes meiosis to produce new filaments.  As in plants, only the female passes chloroplasts on to the offspring.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The only other group of conjugating algae are the desmids, which live as individual cells often with a striking symmetrical appearance.  The two orders Zygnematales and Desmidiales are closely related and placed together in the class Zygnematophyceae.
