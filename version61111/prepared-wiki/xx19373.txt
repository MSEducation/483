Brazoria County, like nearby Brazos County, takes its name from the Brazos River.  The county also includes what was once Velasco, Texas, which was the first capital of the Republic of Texas.

==History==

Brazoria County, like nearby Brazos County, takes its name from the Brazos River, which flows through it. Anglo-Texas began in Brazoria County when the first of Stephen F. Austin's authorized 300  American settlers arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in 1821.  Many of the events leading to the Texas Revolution developed in Brazoria County. In 1832, Brazoria was organized as a separate municipal district by the Mexican government, and so became one of Texas original counties at independence in 1836.  
Stephen F. Austin's original burial place is located at a church cemetery, Gulf Prairie Cemetery, in the town of Jones Creek, Texas, on what was his brother-in-law's "Peach Point Plantation".  His remains were exhumed in 1910 and brought to the state capital in Austin.  Also, the town of West Columbia served as the first capital of Texas, dating back to prerevolutionary days.thumb|Group of men at work in Brazoria County
