===2008 Summer Olympics===

Mitcham represented Australia at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 10 m platform and the 3 m springboard events. He placed 16th on the 3 m springboard and did not qualify for the final. He qualified in second position for the semi-final and final of the 10 m platform event. After experiencing mixed success in his first five dives in the final, Mitcham entered the final round of dives in second place, 34 points behind Chinese diver Zhou Lüxin. After Zhou performed his worst dive of the final and scored 74.80, Mitcham still needed to score 107.30, a very high score on the platform, to win the gold.Beijing 2008 - Diving Men's 10 m Platform Intermediate Results However, his near-perfect final dive drew four perfect 10 scores from judges and achieved a score of 112.10, the highest single-dive score in Olympic history.[tpl]cite web|author=Rebecca Williams |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/beijing_olympics/story/0,27313,24231335-5017607,00.html |title=Breathtaking Mitcham wins gold | Other Sports |publisher=Fox Sports |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] He finished with an overall score of 537.95 to defeat Zhou, who finished with an overall score of 533.15, to win Australia's second diving medal of the Games.

Mitcham's medal was followed by the Australia Post issuing a 50 cent stamp of him. His stamp was issued on 26 September 2008, one day after his victory.

===2009 and beyond===

Following his victory at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Mitcham placed fourth in his next major contest on the 10 metre platform, the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome. He was beaten narrowly by Zhou Lüxin, the Chinese diver he'd beaten in the Olympics final, while British youngster Tom Daley took home the championship.
At the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Mitcham won four silver medals, partnering fellow Australian diver Ethan Warren to come runner-up in the synchronized events in both the 3 and 10 metre. In the 1 metre springboard final he lost to Canadian Alexandre Despatie. In his specialist event, the 10 metre platform, he again lost to Tom Daley.
As outlined in his 2012 autobiography, Mitcham commenced use of recreational methamphetamine in 2011, becoming addicted to the substance and subsequently recovering with the assistance of Narcotics Anonymous. Mitcham is quoted as saying "I had still failed to achieve my childhood dream of becoming the best in the world at something," and so had turned to drug use. Australian Olympic Committee officials, in November 2012, stated that they had been unaware of the drug use (which occurred prior to the 2012 London Olympic Games), but welcomed Mitcham's recovery.[tpl]cite web|last=Passa |first=Dennis |url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/more-sport/diver-matthew-mitcham-opens-up-about-drug-addiction/story-fndukor0-1226518583583 |title=Diver Matthew Mitcham opens up about drug addiction |publisher=News.com.au |date=2012-11-17 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]
In December 2011, Mitcham returned from an abdominals injury to win the Australian 10-meter platform with 480.05 points putting his Olympic dreams back on track. Not only did Mitcham achieve this accolade, he was also named Male Diver of the Year 2012.
Mitcham placed 13th in the semifinals of the 10m event at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, narrowly missing the mark to qualify for the finals.
In November 2012, he published an autobiography entitled Twists and Turns. This was originally only available in hard copy in Australia and as a e-book internationally, but a paperback version is scheduled to be released internationally on July 2, 2013.http://www.amazon.com/Twists-Turns-M-Mitcham/dp/0732294894/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371559843&sr=8-1&keywords=matthew+mitchamhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Twists-Turns-Matthew-Mitcham/dp/0732294894/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371559883&sr=8-1&keywords=matthew+mitcham
In 2013, Mitcham became a judge on the Australian diving show Celebrity Splash!, alongside Greg Louganis and Alisa Camplin. The show started airing in April of that year.

==Personal life==

Mitcham was born in Brisbane but lives and trains in Sydney. He publicly came out as gay in 2008 to the Sydney Morning Herald when they were profiling Olympic hopefuls.[tpl]cite news |first= Harley |last= Dennett|authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= A Backward Three–Somersault Tuck (With a Twist)  |url= http://www.advocate.com/news/2008/07/30/backward-three%E2%80%93somersault-tuck-twist |work= |publisher= The Advocate |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=  |accessdate=24 August 2008 |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl] During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he was also featured on the cover of the international gay publication The AdvocateNicholas Fonseca article and interview in The Advocate: Matt's Next Act in August 2008 and March 2009, as well as the cover of Australian gay publication DNA. Mitcham's then boyfriend, Lachlan Fletcher, attended the 2008 Summer Olympic Games as a spectator. His trip was sponsored by a grant from Johnson & Johnson's Athlete Family Support Program.
Mitcham gained media coverage in Australia as reporters thought he was the first Australian to compete at the Olympic Games as an openly gay man at the time of his competition. However, Mathew Helm, the Australian diver who won the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the men's 10m platform, had publicly announced he was gay before the Olympics began.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/beijing2008/out-proud-and-ready-to-go-for-gold/2008/05/23/1211183107597.html |title=Out, proud and ready to go for gold |date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |periodical=Sydney Morning Herald |first=Jessica |last=Halloran[/tpl][tpl]Citation| last =| first =| author-link =| publication-date =| date =| year =| title = Perfect 10 - Matt Helm| magazine = DNA| series =| publication-place =| place =| publisher =| volume =| issue = 83| pages =| url = http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1165| issn =| doi =| oclc =| accessdate =4 October 2008[/tpl] Other notable gay Australian Olympians include Ji Wallace, who competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics and won a silver medal in the inaugural trampoline event; however, he came out after the Games.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/ji-talking-on-highs-lows-and-a-super-new-move/2007/06/09/1181089387102.html |title=Ji talking: on highs, lows and a super new move |date=10 June 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |first=Daniel |last=Lane |periodical=Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl]
Prior to his 10m platform win, Outsports.com reported Mitcham to be one of only ten openly gay athletes competing in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.outsports.com/os/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=111&pop=1&page |title=In Beijing Olympics, only 10 openly gay athletes  |date=23 August 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2009 |periodical=Outsports.com |first=Jim |last=Buzinski |format=[/tpl]
Mitcham has said when asked to comment on his coming out: "I don’t see sexuality as influencing my beliefs or opinions or perceptions of anybody, whether they’re gay, straight, bi, trans, experimental, I don’t care. I see it as a very uninfluential factor in people." Mitcham has said that after the Beijing Olympics, he received many letters from gay teenagers, "and that was really nice, really humbling".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stevedow.com.au/Default.aspx?id=433 |title=Steve Dow, Journalist |publisher=Stevedow.com.au |date= [/tpl]
In 2009 and 2010, Mitcham was selected by readers of samesame.com.au as one of the 25 most influential gay Australians.[tpl]cite web|title=Samesame 25|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/25/2010/|publisher=samesame|accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]

==Sponsorship==

Despite his diving achievements, Mitcham struggled to attract corporate sponsorship. In the The Advocate, an editor said, "What's a guy to do when he's got the gold, the fame, the man - but no big-time endorsements?"[tpl]full|date=November 2012[/tpl] In 2009, Mitcham secured financial support from the Australian telecommunications provider Telstra.The Daily Telegraph (Australia), 8 February 2009 "Mitcham secures sponsorship".
