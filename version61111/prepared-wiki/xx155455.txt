Guto Pryderi Puw (born 1971)[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/04_april/25/proms_new_commissions.shtml | title=Press Packs - New music: BBC commissions | publisher=BBC Online | author= | date=25 April 2007| accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]  is a Welsh composer, university lecturer and conductor.  He is considered to be one of the most promising Welsh composers of his generation and a key figure in current Welsh music. Puw's music has been broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and been featured on television programmes for the BBC and S4C. He has twice been awarded the Composer's Medal at the National Eisteddfod.
Puw's works include pieces for unusual combinations of instruments, such as a tuba quartet or a trio consisting of harp, cello and double-bass, as well as more traditional forces such as solo baritone and piano, choir or orchestra. He was associated with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales as its Resident Composer, the first holder of this title, from 2006 to 2009. Puw wrote an Oboe concerto as part of this association, and his latest composition for the orchestra was premiered at the 2007 Proms. Puw's own Welsh identity is a recurrent theme in his music: some of his pieces set Welsh-language poetry to music and one of his pieces, Reservoirs, is written about the flooding of Welsh valleys to provide water for England.

==Music==

===Welsh links===

Puw's music is rooted in the language and literature of Wales, with a particular affinity to the poetry of R. S. Thomas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.valeofglamorganfestival.org/2005_text_composers.htm |title=Vale of Glamorgan Festival composers 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060209181738/www.valeofglamorganfestival.org/2005_composers.htm#Puw|archivedate=9 February 2006|accessdate=12 January 2010|publisher=Vale of Glamorgan Festival[/tpl] Welsh titles and settings of poetry in Welsh feature in his work, such as Mecanwaith, Dawns y Sêr, and ... onyt agoraf y drws ...).  He has won the Composer's Medal at the National Eisteddfod of Wales twice, winning it first in 1995 for a harp piece, Ffantasia II. In 1997, when the Eisteddfod was held in Bala, he won the Medal for a string quartet, [tpl]lang|cy|Mecanwaith[/tpl] ("Mechanism") – this piece was later featured in S4C's television series [tpl]lang|cy|Y Cyfansoddwyr[/tpl] ("The Composers"). [tpl]lang|cy|Mecanwaith[/tpl] has also been performed by the Duke Quartet at the 1998 Bath International Music Festival and the 1999 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.

===Orchestral works===

Puw's oboe concerto was commissioned by BBC NOW and was premiered by them at [tpl]lang|cy|Theatr Brycheiniog[/tpl], Brecon, on 27 April 2006, with the orchestra's principal oboist (David Cowley) as the soloist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prsformusic.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/2007%20British%20Composer%20Awards%20Winners%20release%20FINAL.pdf|title=5th British Composer Awards – Winners Announced|publisher=PRS for Music|date=6 December 2007|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] It takes its inspiration from different qualities of the human voice, including stutters and chatterboxes. Puw has said that "The second movement is inspired by talkative people who won't let you contribute to a conversation", represented by a repeated row of 13 notes played until "it gets rather unbearable".[tpl]cite news|work=Western Mail |date=21 April 2006[/tpl] It was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 1 March 2007 as part of a programme of music by Welsh composers to celebrate St David's Day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/afternoonon3/pip/aoatj/ |date=1 March 2007|title=Afternoon on 3|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] The concerto won Puw the 2007 BBC Radio 3 Listeners Award at the British Composer Awards.
His orchestral piece Reservoirs was inspired by a 1968 poem by R. S. Thomas about the drowning of Welsh valleys such as Tryweryn (a few miles from where Puw grew up) and Clywedog to provide water for England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.valeofglamorganfestival.org/2005_text_programmes.htm |title=Vale of Glamorgan Festival of Music 2005 – Programmes|publisher=Vale of Glamorgan Festival|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060204182901/www.valeofglamorganfestival.org/2005_programmes.htm#Thursday%201%20September,%207.30pm|archivedate=4 April 2006|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] Puw had a particular affinity with the topic as his grandfather lost farmland in the Tryweryn flooding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4789372.stm|title= Tryweryn reservoir 'unnecessary'|publisher=BBC News|date=9 March 2006|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] Nevertheless, he has said that he "decided not to take the poem too literally because as a composer you can be subject to criticism for doing that." It was nominated in 2005 in the Large-Scale Composition category of the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/music/news/news_18.03.05.php.en|title=Guto Puw's 'Reservoirs' nominated for RPS Music Award|publisher=Bangor University|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] The music was used in a BBC2 Wales documentary, "Drowning a Village", broadcast on 9 March 2006. A performance by BBC NOW was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of the 2005 Vale of Glamorgan Festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/hearandnow/pip/o8bk8/ |title=Hear And Now: Vale of Glamorgan Festival|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl]
As part of his association with BBC NOW, Puw was commissioned by the BBC to compose for the 2007 Proms.  His orchestral piece, [tpl]lang|cy|... onyt agoraf y drws ...[/tpl] ("... unless I open the door ...") was premiered on 9 August 2007, conducted by David Atherton.BBC Proms Guide 2007 ISBN 978-1-84607-256-7  It is based on a story from the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh tales, in which a group of warriors, lately returned from Ireland, feast in Harlech for seven years with the severed head of their leader at the head of the table.  They then feast in Penfro for eight years in a hall with three doors, and only remember the dreadful events that happened in Ireland when the third door opens.  Each of the three doors in Penfro was represented by an instrument in a box in the Royal Albert Hall.

===Other works===

Unusual instrumentation and unusual performance techniques, including elements of improvisation, are also important features of his work. In 1998 he composed X-ist, a piece for IST (the Improvising String Trio, consisting of harp, cello and double-bass).  It was described by reviewers as a "frighteningly frantic" and "challenging" piece.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brucesfingers.co.uk/catalogue/bf28reviews.html |last=Horn|first=Walter|publisher=Bruce's Fingers |title= IST Ghost Notes|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl]  X-ist uses a graphic score and includes written directions to the players that act as "creative stimuli", containing notes and motifs to be followed. The piece also requires the cellist and double-bassist to tap their instruments, as well as use normal playing methods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jazzword.com/reviews/102680|last=Waxman|first=Ken|title=IST|date=13 January 2003|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] Another piece requiring improvisation by performers was his commission for the 2001 Bangor New Music Festival, [tpl]lang|cy|Trioled[/tpl], which was written for ensemble (saxophone, guitar, harp, keyboard, cello, piano) and optional dancer.  In his performing notes, Puw describes the pieces as a "stimulus for musical improvisation" in which any notes, normal or extended musical techniques and / or percussive effects may be applied.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmic.org/cgi-bin/fullwork.cgi?id=464&f=c |title=Catalogue: Trioled |language=Welsh |publisher=Welsh Music Information Centre |accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]lang|cy|Trioled[/tpl] has two contrasting sub-sections, a and b, arranged in the form a-b-a-a-a-b-a-b to match the Welsh poetic measure of the same name, with the strings playing calmly in the "a" sections, and saxophone and keyboard (gradually joined by the other instruments) playing in a more lively manner in the "b" sections. The musicians and the dancer are required to react to each other's contributions in each section to create a "multi-media" experience.
Visages, his 1999 piece for 2 tubas and 2 euphoniums, was described as "astringent, often whimsical but well written for these instruments".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/june01/Tubulate.htm |title=Earth and Moon: Music for Brass Quartet|first=Philip |last=Scowcroft|publisher=MusicWeb International|date=June 2001|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl]  Puw said that in the piece "Freedom is granted to the performers to make any subtle facial expressions that add to the musical interpretation".[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmic.org/cgi-bin/fullwork.cgi?id=595&f=c  |title=Catalogue: Visages |publisher=Welsh Music Information Centre |accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Puw describes [tpl]lang|cy|Ffantasia III[/tpl] (a piece for solo piano, composed for the 2000 Bangor New Music Festival) as an "intimate reflection" upon the music of, and a tribute to, Robert Schumann, his "intricate compositional style" and "world of delicate expression".[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmic.org/cgi-bin/fullwork.cgi?id=593&f=c |title=Catalogue: Ffantasia III |language=Welsh |publisher=Welsh Music Information Centre |accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The music becomes "simpler and softer" throughout the piece, moving from the "rhythmic complexity" of the opening bars through to slow quavers transforming into triplets.   An ensemble piece, different light (for clarinet, violin, cello and piano) was "inspired by the idea of moving a picture from one place to another, be it to another house, or from one room to the next, or even from one wall to another."[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmic.org/cgi-bin/fullwork.cgi?id=590&f=c |title=Catalogue: Different Light|publisher=Welsh Music Information Centre |accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] As the picture is moved, it looks the same but is perceived in a different light.  Puw attempts to convey this in musical terms by having each instrument enter separately with its own musical phrase in the first part of the piece. Then, in the second part of the piece, all the thematic material is repeated with the instruments playing simultaneously, so that the music is similarly perceived in a different light. different light was featured at the 2001 UKwithNY festival at the Angel Orensanz Center in New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wmic.org/cgi-bin/composerfull.cgi?id=5|title=Doctor Guto Pryderi Puw |publisher=Welsh Music Information Centre|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  His 2005 composition for the Bangor New Music Festival, Stereo Type, was written for amplified typewriters and tape.  It was premiered by UWB School of Music students in the Deiniol Shopping Centre, Bangor, on 5 March 2005.
