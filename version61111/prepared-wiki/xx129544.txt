Paul Roos Gymnasium is a government school for boys in the town of Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa, founded in 1866 as Stellenbosch Gymnasium. 
The school was renamed three times, Stellenbosch Boys High, Victoria College (after the Queen) and in 1940 Paul Roos Gymnasium. Paul Roos, a former captain of the Springbok rugby union team, was himself a former pupil and teacher at the school, and was the school's rector from 1910 to 1940, after which the school was renamed in his honour.
