CATEGORIES: Zhongshan

Zhōngshān ([tpl]zh|c=中山[/tpl]), previously known as Xiāngshān ([tpl]zh|c=香山[/tpl]), is a prefecture-level city in the south of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. Zhongshan, one of the few cities in China with an eponymous name, is named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) who is known in Chinese as Sun Zhongshan.  Sun, the founding father of the Republic of China, was born in Cuiheng village in Nanlang Township of what was then Xiangshan County.  In 1925, the year after his death, Xiangshan was renamed Zhongshan in his honor. The main ethnic group in Zhongshan is Han, and the main language is Cantonese.

==Names==

Until 1925, Zhongshan was generally known as Xiangshan or Heung-san ([tpl]zh|c=香山|l=Fragrant Mountain[/tpl]), in reference to the many flowers that grew in the mountains nearby.Tai Ping Huan Yu Ji 《太平寰宇记》, juan 157, 3019.  The city was renamed in honor of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who had adopted the name Zhongshan.  Sun is considered by both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China to be the "Father of Modern China", and was from Cuiheng village – now part of Nanlang Town in Zhongshan.

==History==

The Zhongshan area was part of Dongguan during the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD), and was a significant sea salt producer.  In 1082, during the Northern Song Dynasty, a fortified settlement called Xiangshan was founded in the area, marking the first official use of the name by which it would be known throughout most of its modern history.  The prosperous settlement was then upgraded to a county in 1152.  Much of the First Opium War took place in and around Zhongshan: in 1839, the famous official Lin Zexu arrived in Zhongshan and ordered the expulsion of Sir Charles Elliot and other British traders from the area.  Qing Dynasty soldiers resisted British attacks on the area in 1840, but were ultimately overwhelmed.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhongshan was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army which implemented Unit 8604 or Nami Unit, a secret military medical unit, related to Unit 731, that researched biological warfare and other topics through human experimentation. It was headquartered at Zhongshan Medical University (Hal Gold, Unit 731 Testimony, 2003, p. 50).
In 1983, Zhongshan was elevated in administrative status from a county to a county-level city and again in 1988 to a prefecture-level city.

==Geography==

Zhongshan is located along the west side of the mouth of the Pearl River, directly opposite Shenzhen and Hong Kong.  Zhongshan is directly south of Guangzhou and Foshan's north-south alluvial plains, and just north of Zhuhai and Macau's hilly coastlines.
Geological evidence suggests that before the 2nd millennium BC, the area Zhongshan now occupies was mostly on the floor of the South China Sea.  Like much of southern China, Zhongshan has many mountains and hills – most notably the Wugui Mountains ([tpl]zh|c=五桂山|p=Wǔguī Shān|j=Ng5gwai3 Saan1[/tpl]) – and these formed a system of steep islands.  Like most river delta systems, the Pearl River and its tributaries gradually deposited silt on the ocean floor, causing its alluvial plain to reach further and further out into the sea.  Zhongshan's northern flatland appeared around 1100 AD, and was settled soon after.  The city's current geography is typical of southern China: numerous steep mountains and hills with alluvial plains in between down to the coastline.  The main peak of the Wugui Mountains is the highest point in the city, at [tpl]convert|531|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level.
Like nearly all of southern China, Zhongshan's climate is warm and humid most of the year, with an average temperature of [tpl]convert|22|°C[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|175|cm|in[/tpl] of rainfall each year.  Southern China experiences fairly frequent typhoons and thunderstorms, and most rain falls between April and September.

==Economy==

===Primary industries===

Primary productions are agricultural, such as rice, lychee, banana, and sugar cane. Added to this, horticulture in Xiaolan Town is famous throughout southern China for its blooming chrysanthemum.

===Manufacturing industries===

Zhongshan, together with Dongguan, Nanhai and Shunde, are dubbed as Four Little Tigers in Guangdong. The proximity of Zhongshan to Hong Kong and Macau is an advantage to its economic development, especially on the manufacturing industries.
In the 1980s, Zhongshan had a relatively developed State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) sector that was used to stimulate Township and Village Enterprises (TVE) development in the countryside. Currently, the SOE sector is much weaker and the economy is dominated by foreign investment and TVEs, and also by various specialized manufacturing towns. Each of these towns is specialized in making a particular product. Most of the towns are so successful that they earn a reputation as a leading manufacturer in their own pillar industries. Indeed, "One Industry in One Town" has become a unique economic feature in Zhongshan.
Pillar industries in various specialized manufacturing towns in Zhongshan include:
The government of Zhongshan encourages "Research and Design" in the region by setting up national level research centre and specialized industrial regions. For example, the Zhongshan National Torch High-Tech Industrial Development Zone (中山国家级火炬高技术产业开发区) was established in 1990 in the east of the city by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the governments of Guangdong province and Zhongshan. Zhongshan Port, which ranks among the top 10 ports nationwide in terms of container-handling capacity, is in the zone.RightSite.asia | ZhongShan National Torch High-Tech Industrial Development Zone Since 2001, it has contained Zhongshan Electronic Base of China (中国电子中山基地) for its reputation on the electronic acoustics industries. Following the possible development in Nansha, the city considers its eastern part, of which [tpl]convert|400|km²|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of land is available, as a focus of development.
Currently, the city is trying to re-organize the fragmented industrialization. Meanwhile, the light and labour intensive industry characteristic of Zhongshan's economy imposes problem on shortage of land in Zhongshan.
