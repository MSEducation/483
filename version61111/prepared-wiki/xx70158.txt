CATEGORIES: Stochastic processes, Probability theorems

In probability theory, the Girsanov theorem (named after Igor Vladimirovich Girsanov) describes how the dynamics of stochastic processes change when the original measure is changed to an equivalent probability measureM. Musiela, M. Rutkowski: Martingale methods in financial modelling. 2nd ed. New York : Springer-Verlag, 2004. Print.[tpl]rp|607[/tpl]. The theorem is especially important in the theory of financial mathematics as it tells how to convert from the physical measure which describes the probability that an underlying instrument (such as a share price or interest rate) will take a particular value or values to the risk-neutral measure which is a very useful tool for pricing derivatives on the underlying.

==History==

Results of this type were first proved by Cameron–Martin in the 1940s and by Girsanov in 1960.  They have been subsequently extended to more general classes of process culminating in the general form of Lenglart (1977).

==Significance==

Girsanov's theorem is important in the general theory of stochastic processes since it enables the key result that if Q is a measure absolutely continuous with respect to P then every P-semimartingale is a Q-semimartingale.

==Statement of theorem==

We state the theorem first for the special case when the underlying stochastic process is a Wiener process. This special case is sufficient for risk-neutral pricing in the Black-Scholes model and in many other models (e.g. all continuous models).
Furthermore if Y is a local martingale under P then the process

==Corollary==

If X is a continuous process and W is Brownian motion under measure P then
is Brownian motion under Q.
it follows by Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion that this is a Q Brownian
motion.

===Comments===

In many common applications, the process X is defined by

==Application to finance==

In finance, Girsanov theorem is used each time one needs to derive an asset's or rate's dynamics under a new probability measure. The most well known case is moving from historic measure P to risk neutral measure Q which is done - in Black Scholes framework - via Radon–Nikodym derivative:
Other classical applications of Girsanov theorem are quanto adjustments and the calculation of forwards' drifts under LIBOR market model.
