==The town of Brøndby==

Brøndby consists of three cities: Brøndbyvester (west), Brøndbyøster (east) and to the south Brøndby Strand. Brøndbyøster is the "original" Brøndby and has a couple of old farmhouses, but mostly consists of single family houses - this is a typical middle-class Danish suburb. Brondby's name in Danish means "well town".
Brøndbyøster is east of the big intersection that parts the three different Brøndbys. (Brøndby Strand Projects '93http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/B_strand.jpg), this part of the city has many older people and immigrants.
