[[Medical School of Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Schools of medicine in Japan, Japanâ€“Portugal relations

In the 16th century the Portuguese Jesuits founded in Japan the Medical School of Japan, which was destined to teach western medicine to the Japanese Catholics.
As such, Portugal was pioneer in introducing western medicine in Japan.
The school was closed in 1648 when the Jesuits and the Portuguese were expelled from Japan.
