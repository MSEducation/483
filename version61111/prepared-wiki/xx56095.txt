Seal is the fourth album (and third self-titled album) by Seal. It follows the aborted sessions for Togetherland, which was scrapped because Seal thought it was not up to the standard of his previous work. To avoid confusion with past albums, the album is sometimes referred to informally as Seal IV, the official title in Australia.
In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number four. In the United States, it debuted at number three in the U.S. Billboard 200, making his highest charting album to date.
