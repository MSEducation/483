The Meritorious Unit Citation is a collective group decoration awarded to members of Australian military units. It recognises sustained outstanding service in warlike operations. The Meritorious Unit Citation was created in 1991, along with the Unit Citation for Gallantry.

==Description==

The insignia of a Meritorious Unit Citation is a rhodium plated sterling silver frame measuring [tpl]convert|32|x|15|mm|in[/tpl], with a design of flames emanating from the edge to the centre. The frame surrounds a ribbon bar of old gold, which may display a rhodium plated, [tpl]convert|7|mm|in|adj=on[/tpl] diameter, sterling silver Federation Star on its centre.
Members attached to the unit when the citation is awarded wear it with the Federation Star, and continue to wear this after leaving the unit. Members who subsequently join the unit wear the citation without the Federation Star, and discontinue wearing it after leaving the unit.
