The single was originally scheduled for release on August 22, but was moved to September 12 due to production issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5uFZuqdSN|title= 音楽ガッタス　CDシングル『鳴り始めた恋のBELL』発売日変更のお知らせとお詫び (Ongaku Gatas CD single "Narihajimeta Koi no Bell" release date change announcement and apology)|language=Japanese|publisher=Hello!

The error was not corrected until many copies had already been sold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/ustan777/archives/51002738.html|title= Hello Project's new unit, Ongaku Gatas, release postponed to September... but it's in the shops?|language=Japanese|date=2007-08-21|accessdate=2010-11-15[/tpl] In the original release, there are typographical errors in the names and home-towns of the group's members. In the later releases, however, these have been corrected.
