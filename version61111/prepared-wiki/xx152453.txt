"Northern Whale" is a song by an unnamed alternative rock band fronted by Damon Albarn, and was released as the third track on their 2007 debut album The Good, the Bad and the Queen (see 2007 in British music).

==The story behind the song==

When introducing the song at the band's first ever "official" gig (having already played three warm-up gigs in Devon) at The Roundhouse in Camden Town in October 2006, Albarn said that the song started out a year earlier as a love song for partner Suzi Winstanley when she was about to go to Antarctica to swim underwater with leopard seals, but then "a whale came up the Thames and it turned into a song about a whale".

==Music==

The song starts with a synthesised part playing staccato crotchets. This riff is sequenced throughout the song. Light percussion woodblocks are added after a short while. The bass guitar joins the synthesiser and plays with it throughout the song.
