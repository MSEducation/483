In 1932, the governing Progressives formed an electoral alliance with the Liberals. Although he supported the alliance at the provincial level, Jonasson nonetheless challenged Ingaldson to represent the Gimli constituency in the 1932 election. He was successful on his third attempt, defeating Ingaldson[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html#J0 |title=MLA Biographies - Deceased |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba[/tpl] by 271 votes.
