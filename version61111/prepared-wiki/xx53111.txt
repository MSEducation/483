[tpl]nihongo|Sen no Rikyū|千利休||extra=1522 - April 21, 1591, also known simply as Sen Rikyū[/tpl], is considered the historical figure with the most profound influence on chanoyu, the Japanese "Way of Tea", particularly the tradition of wabi-cha. He was also the first to emphasize several key aspects of the ceremony, including rustic simplicity, directness of approach and honesty of self. Originating from the Edo Period and the Muromachi Period, these aspects of the tea ceremony persist.[tpl]cite book|last=Birmingham Museum of Art|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=Ala|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=48|url=http://artsbma.org[/tpl] Rikyū is known by many names; for convenience this article will refer to him as Rikyū throughout.
There are three iemoto (sōke),  or "head houses" of the Japanese Way of Tea, that are directly descended from Rikyū: the Omotesenke, Urasenke, and Mushakōjisenke, all three of which are dedicated to passing forward the teachings of their mutual family founder, Rikyū.

==Early life==

Rikyū was born in Sakai, present-day Osaka prefecture. His father was a warehouse owner named [tpl]nihongo|Tanaka Yohyoue|田中与兵衛[/tpl], who later in life also used the family name Sen, and his mother was [tpl]nihongo|Gesshin Myōchin|月岑妙珎[/tpl].Rikyū Daijiten (Rikyū Encyclopedia). Tankosha, 1989. ISBN 4-473-01110-0. His childhood name was Yoshiro."The Urasenke Legacy: Family Lineage", in ''Urasenke website.  Accessed May 16, 2006.
As a young man, Rikyū studied tea under the townsman of Sakai named Kitamuki Dōchin (1504–62),[tpl]cite book|author=Anderson, Jennifer L.|year=1991|title=An introduction to the Japanese tea ritual|isbn=0-7914-0749-7|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany, New York|page=35[/tpl] and at the age of nineteen, through Dōchin's introduction, he began to study tea under Takeno Jōō, who is also associated with the development of the wabi aesthetic in tea ceremony. He is believed to have received the Buddhist name [tpl]nihongo|Sōeki|宗易[/tpl] from the Rinzai Zen priest Dairin Sōtō (1480–1568) of Nanshūji temple in Sakai.Nishibe Bunjo, "Zen priests and Their Concepts of Tea," p. 13, in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 13 (1976). He married a woman known as Hōshin Myōju (? - 1577) around when he was twenty-one.Rikyū Daijiten, entry for Hōshin Myōju Rikyū also underwent Zen training at Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto. Not much is known about his middle years.

==Later years==

In 1579, at the age of 58, Rikyū became a tea master for Oda NobunagaAnderson, p. 36. and, following Nobunaga's death in 1582, he was a tea master for Toyotomi Hideyoshi.Anderson, p. 37 His relationship with Hideyoshi quickly deepened, and he entered Hideyoshi's circle of confidants, effectively becoming the most influential figure in the world of chanoyu.Rikyū Daijiten entries for 当世の風体　(the trend of the age) and 豊臣秀吉の側近 (Toyotomi Hideyoshi's confidant). In 1585, in order that he could help at a tea gathering that would be given by Hideyoshi for Emperor Ōgimachi and held at the Imperial Palace, the emperor bestowed upon him the Buddhist lay name and title [tpl]Nihongo|"Rikyū Koji"|利休居士[/tpl]."The Urasenke Legacy: Family Lineage", in ''Urasenke website. Accessed May 16, 2006. Another major chanoyu event of Hideyoshi's that Rikyū played a central role in was the Kitano Ōchanoyu, the grand tea gathering held by Hideyoshi at the Kitano Tenman-gū in 1587.
It was during his later years that Rikyū began to use very tiny, rustic tea rooms referred as sōan (lit., "grass hermitage"), such as the two-tatami mat tea room named Taian, which can be seen today at Myōkian temple in Yamazaki, a suburb of Kyoto, and which is credited to his design.  This tea room has been designated as a National Treasure. He also developed many implements for tea ceremony, including flower containers, teascoops, and lid rests made of bamboo, and also used everyday objects for tea ceremony, often in novel ways.
Raku teabowls were originated through his collaboration with a tile-maker named Raku Chōjirō. Rikyū had a preference for simple, rustic items made in Japan, rather than the expensive Chinese-made items that were fashionable at the time. Though not the inventor of the philosophy of wabi-sabi, which finds beauty in the very simple, Rikyū is among those most responsible for popularizing it, developing it, and incorporating it into tea ceremony. He created a new form of tea ceremony using very simple instruments and surroundings. This and his other beliefs and teachings came to be known as sōan-cha (the grass-thatched hermitage style of chanoyu), or more generally, wabi-cha. This "line" of chanoyu that his descendants and followers carried on was recognized as the [tpl]nihongo|Senke-ryū|千家流||"school of the house of Sen"[/tpl].
A writer and poet, the tea master referred to the ware and its relationship with the tea ceremony, saying  "Though you wipe your hands and brush off the dust and dirt from the vessels, what is the use of all this fuss if the heart is still impure?"Sadler, A.L.  Cha-no-yu:  The Japanese Tea Ceremony.  Rutland, VT and Tokyo:  Tuttle, 1962.
Two of his primary disciples were Nanbō Sōkei (南坊宗啓; dates unknown), a somewhat legendary Zen priest, and Yamanoue Sōji (1544–90), a townsman of Sakai. Nanbō is credited as the original author of the Nanpō roku (南方録), a record of Rikyū's teachings. Yamanoue's chronicle, the Yamanoue Sōji ki (山上宗二記), gives commentary about Rikyū's teachings and the state of chanoyu at the time of its writing.Rikyū Daijiten
Rikyū had a number of children, including a son known in history as Sen Dōan, and daughter known as Okame. This daughter became the bride of Rikyū's second wife's son by a previous marriage, known in history as Sen Shōan. Due to many complex circumstances, Sen Shōan, rather than Rikyū's legitimate heir, Dōan, became the person counted as the 2nd generation in the Sen-family's tradition of chanoyu (see "san-Senke" at schools of Japanese tea ceremony).
Rikyū also wrote poetry, and practiced ikebana.flowers for chanoyu are not called ikebana; need verification about him practicing ikebana

==Death==

Although Rikyū had been one of Hideyoshi's closest confidants, because of crucial differences of opinion and other reasons which remain uncertain, Hideyoshi ordered him to commit ritual suicide. In The 48 Laws of Power, American author Robert Greene states that Hideyoshi was enraged by Rikyū's commissioning of a vain statue of himself which was placed inside the palace gates, through which Hideyoshi entered, thus putting himself below Rikyū.  While Hideyoshi's reason may never be known for certain, it is known that Rikyū committed seppuku at his residence within Hideyoshi's Jurakudai villa in Kyoto in  1591 on the 28th day of the 2nd month (of the traditional Japanese lunar calendar; or April 21 when calculated according to the modern Gregorian calendar), at the age of seventy."The Urasenke Legacy:Family Lineage", in Urasenke website.

According to Okakura Kakuzo in The Book of Tea, Rikyū's last act was to hold an exquisite tea ceremony. After serving all his guests, he presented each piece of the tea-equipage for their inspection, along with an exquisite kakemono, which Okakura described as "a wonderful writing by an ancient monk dealing with the evanescence of all things." Rikyū presented each of his guests with a piece of the equipment as a souvenir, with the exception of the bowl, which he shattered, uttering "Never again shall this cup, polluted by the lips of misfortune, be used by man." As the guests departed, one remained to serve as witness to Rikyū's death. Rikyū's last words, which he wrote down as a death poem, were in verse, addressed to the dagger with which he took his own life:
When Hideyoshi was building his lavish residence at Fushimi the following year, he remarked that he wished its construction and decoration to be pleasing to Rikyū. He was known for his temper, and is said to have expressed regret at his treatment of Rikyū.Sansom, George (1961). "A History of Japan: 1334-1615." Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp364,370.
Rikyū's grave is located at Jukōin temple in the Daitoku-ji compound in Kyoto; his posthumous Buddhist name is Fushin'an Rikyū Sōeki Koji.
Memorials for Rikyū are observed annually by many schools of Japanese tea ceremony.  The Omotesenke school's annual memorial takes place at the family's headquarters each year on March 27, and the Urasenke school's takes place at its own family's headquarters each year on March 28. The three Sen families (Omotesenke, Urasenke, Mushakōjisenke) take turns holding a memorial service on the 28th of every month, at their mutual family temple, the subsidiary temple Jukōin at Daitoku-ji temple.
