Nepean Island is a small uninhabited island located at 
[tpl]coord|29|04|S|167|57|E|type:isle_region:NF|display=inline,title[/tpl], about 1 km south off a golf course on Norfolk Island in the Southwest Pacific.  It was named in 1788 by Lieutenant Philip Gidley King for Evan Nepean, Under Secretary of the Home Department of the United Kingdom. It is part of the Australian territory of Norfolk Island and is included in the Norfolk Island National Park, as is nearby Phillip Island, and about 10 per cent of Norfolk Island proper.  The island is made of calcareous rock dating from the late Pleistocene and is a breeding site for several species of seabirds. The island is uninhabited due to its small size and tall cliffs flanking it, making it nigh on impossible for boats to land there. It forms part of the Norfolk Island National Park, along with Norfolk Island and Phillip Island.
