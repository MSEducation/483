[[Great Bookham]]

Great Bookham is a village in Surrey, England, located between Leatherhead and Guildford. The Bookhams – Great and Little Bookham – are part of the Saxon settlement of Bocham, "the village by the beeches". They are surrounded by common land.  Great Bookham is the larger village but Little Bookham houses the railway station.
The villages are situated on the A246 which is the main route for traffic travelling between the Surrey towns of Leatherhead and Guildford. Whilst once two distinct villages, the Bookhams have long been interconnected with residential roads that give most newcomers the impression that it is in fact one large village.
The village is well known as the location of Polesden Lacey, a country house located on the southern edge of the village, surrounded by over [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl] of grounds, now owned by the National Trust and open to the public.

==History==

According to a charter c.675, the original of which is lost but which exists in a later form, there were granted to the Abbey twenty dwellings at Bocham cum Effingham. This was confirmed by four Saxon kings; King Offa of Mercia and of the nations roundabout in 787; King Athelstan who was King and ruler of the whole island of Britain in 933 confirmed the privileges to the monastery; King Edgar, Emperor of all Britain in 967 confirmed "twelve mansiones" in Bocham, and King Edward the Confessor, King of the English'' in 1062 confirmed twenty mansae at Bocham cum Effingham, Driteham and Pechingeorde.
Great Bookham lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative district of Effingham half hundred.
The Domesday Book 1086, which was a survey for taxation purposes, makes the first known distinction between the parishes of Great and Little Bookham, if it is assumed that there was no separate parish at the time of the charter of Edward the Confessor in 1062. Driteham and Pechingeorde are both referred to in the Domesday Book and appear to have been absorbed into the manors of Effingham and Effingham East Court.  Great Bookham appears in Domesday Book as Bocheham.St Nicolas church history It was held by St Peter's Abbey, Chertsey. Its Domesday Assets were: 13 hides; 1 church, 1 mill worth 10s, 20 ploughs, [tpl]convert|6|acre|m2[/tpl] of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 110 hogs. It rendered (in total): £15.
It seems probable, as the number of cottages in Bocham cum Effingham remained constant, that the later charters must have been copies of earlier charters which were not revised to accord with the actual number of cottages at any one time.
Jane Austen is said to have spent time in Bookham whilst writing several of her novels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Its location is consistent with the geographical details in Emma.Surrey writers

==Polesden Lacey==

A regency villa on the southern edge of the village, Polesden Lacey has been the site of a house since at least 1336.  The current house dates from the 17th century, and was bequeathed by its last owner, the hon. Mrs Greville, a legendary Edwardian hostess, to the National Trust in 1942. When the Greville's purchased the property in 1906, they extensively remodelled the house with the help of Mewes and Davis, architects of the Ritz Hotel. There are large walled and formal gardens, an orchard and croquet lawn, as well as extensive farmland. The property and its 1400 acre estate are open to the public, being one of the National Trust's most visited properties.
The house is also the National Trust's Southern Region head office.
King George VI and his bride spent part of their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey, as guests of Mrs Greville.
The poet and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan was a previous owner of the property from 1804.

==Bookham Grove==

To the south side of the High Street stands Bookham Grove Manor, built in the early 18th century, once owned by the Dawnay family. It is now converted into apartments, with coach houses built in its now [tpl]convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] grounds. The manor's original large estate covered the surrounding roads up to Dorking Road, and Groveside, and had grounds to the front, running down to the Guildford Road.  When the land was sold for development in 1947, the shops and car park were built in the grounds to the front of the house.  Another surviving part of the estate is the stables, on the corner of Dorking Road.

==Eastwick Park==

Sadly, Eastwick Park, a beautiful manor in the village, was lost in 1958.  The house stood within the area of roads now known as the 'Eastwick area', and its very large private estate included Great Bookham Commons, which were saved by the village and given to the National Trust. Since being used as a private house, the manor was used by Canadian military in the second world war, and was also a school called Southey Hall, before being demolished for redevelopment. The original gates to the house stand just west of Eastwick Park Avenue on Lower Road. A full history of Eastwick Park, Southey Hall Prep School and the Canadian Artillery who were stationed there during WW2 can be found in the Bookham Residents Association website.

==Geography==

To the west of the Bookhams lies the village of Effingham; further west on the road to Guildford lie the similar villages of East and West Horsley and East and West Clandon. To the north-east lie Fetcham and Leatherhead, north of which the area becomes increasingly urban heading towards central London, which is only [tpl]convert|23|mi|km[/tpl] away. To the south-east, across the North Downs, is the village of Westhumble and the market town of Dorking.

==Today==

The village has a high street, located in Great Bookham, which is, as its name suggests, the larger of the two villages. It has two butchers, a family run fishmongers and two traditional greengrocers.  The beautiful Rayleigh House at the top of the high street, originally built as the Victoria Temperance Hotel by Mary Chrystie, now contains Henshaws Estate Agents and a healthcare practice.
Three pubs are situated in the village, The Anchor, The Royal Oak, The Old Crown and one in Little Bookham, Ye Olde Windsor Castle. Legend has it that King Henry VIII's hunting parties used to pass through Bookham and stop in the Windsor, hence its royal name.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] The village has a curry house.  The Old Barn Hall is the main community centre, regularly used for staging amateur dramatics productions and hosting parties and receptions.
There are 2 successful primary schools in the village, which makes the area very sought after with families: Eastwick Junior School in Eastwick Drive and The Dawnay School in Griffin Way.

==Bookham Commons==

Bookham Commons includes the two commons in Great Bookham and Little Bookham.  Great Bookham Common was bought by local residents in 1923 to save the oak woodlands, then given to the National Trust. Little Bookham Common was given to the Trust in 1924 by Mr H Willock-Pollen, then Banks Common in 1925 by Mr R Calburn.
The London Natural History Society has been surveying Bookham Commons for over 50 years, making it one of the best recorded sites for wildlife in south east England.
The common land consist of grassland (wet, low-lying meadows), woodland, scrub and twelve ponds. The ponds are home to all three British species of newt, including the rare Great Crested Newt. The five largest ponds are man-made, formed for fish-production in the 17th-century.
