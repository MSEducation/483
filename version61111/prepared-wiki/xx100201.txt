Friends Reunited is a portfolio of social networking websites based upon the themes of reunion with research, dating and job-hunting. The first and eponymous website was created by a husband and wife team in the classic back bedroom internet start-up; it was the first online social network to achieve prominence in Britain, and it weathered the dotcom bust.
Each site works on the principle of user-generated content through which registered users are able to post information about themselves which may be searched through by other users. A double-blind email system allows contact between users. Formerly, the site cost £7.50 per year to use but is now free.Friends Reunited axes fee - Technology - News - Manchester Evening News
The main Friends Reunited site aims to reunite people who have in common a school, university, address, workplace, sports club or armed service; the sister site Genes Reunited enables members to pool their family trees and identify common ancestors; the Dating and Jobs sister sites link members with similar attributes, interests and/or locations.
Friends Reunited branding has been attached to CD collections of nostalgic popular music, and television programmes broadcast on the ITV network, which owned the site until August 2009. A book of members' stories was published in 2003 by Virgin Books, and a song about (and named after) the site was released by The Hussys in 2006.
Following ITV's sale of the site to DC Thomson's Brightsolid subsidiary in 2009, the company relaunched Friends Reunited in March 2012 with a new emphasis on nostalgia and memories.[tpl]cite news|last=Lee|first=David|title=Friends Reunited relaunches site with 'nostalgia' focus|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17510660|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=27 March 2012[/tpl]
