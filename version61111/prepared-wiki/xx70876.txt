==Species==

The classification of Hieracium into species is notoriously difficult. One reason is the apomictic reproduction (in which plants asexually produce seeds), which tends to produce a lot of minor geographical variation. Over 9000 species names have been published in Hieracium but some botanists regard many of those as synonyms of larger species.

==Plant pest==

All species of the genus Hieracium are classed as invasive species throughout New Zealand. They are banned from sale, propagation and distribution under the National Pest Plant Accord. Hieracium is a pasture weed that reduces available feed for livestock and displaces the indigenous plants.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.weedbusters.co.nz/weed_info/detail.asp?WeedID=119 |title=Hieracium species Detailed information sheet  |publisher=The Weedbusters Management Committee (www.weedbusters.co.nz) |accessdate=2010-05-02 [/tpl] It is a particular threat in alpine ecosystems previously dominated by native tussocks, though it will colonise habitats from bare ground, to exotic pine forest, to native Southern Beech forest.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/science-and-technical/DSIS109.pdf|title= Genetic diversity in tussock hawkweed (Hieracium lepidulum) and use of allele frequencies for identifying patterns of spread[/tpl]
In the United States, many species of Hieracium have been introduced and all species present are considered noxious weeds in one or more states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=HIERA|title=Hieracium L._hawkweed_USDA NRCS[/tpl]
