The Grup Gerak Khas ([tpl]lang-en|Special Service Group[/tpl]) is a special forces regiment of the Malaysian Army which conducts special operations missions for the Malaysian government, such as direct action, unconventional warfare, sabotage, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering. It is the administrative and operational group to which the three regiments of the Rejimen Gerak Khas and its supporting units are subordinated.
While the GGK traces its origins to 1965 and the post Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, they gained fame and recognition worldwide after successfully pacifying a communist insurgency in the jungles of Malaysia during the Communist Insurgency War.
21 Gerup Gerak Khas is commanded by a Brigadier General and is currently located at Iskandar Camp, in Mersing, Johor comprising 11 Gerak Khas Regiment tasked to counter-terrorism, 21 Commando Regiment and 22 Commando Regiment. The three regiments' tasks are guerrilla/anti-guerrilla warfare, escape and evasion, subversion, sabotage, counter terrorism, asymmetric warfare and their most highly regarded expertise – jungle warfare.Berita Wilayah

==History==

The Special Forces Directorate was established in the Ministry of Defense, late Tun Abdul Razak Hussein on 1960s to coordinate the operations of the special forces regiments during the Indonesian Confrontation. In 1965, the Ministry of Defence called for volunteers from the Army and Navy for Commando training. On 25 February 1965, introductory training was conducted at Majidee Camp, Johor Bahru by the British 40 Commando of the Royal Marines. The selection was harsh, and from the initial 300 personnel who volunteered, only 15 were selected to undergo the six weeks Basic Commando course. Of these, only four officers and nine other ranks passed. Here is the list of men who were part of the nucleus team which later formed the GGK :
This unit is partly based on by the 40th Royal Marines Commandos and was then called Malaysian Special Service Unit. Such was the beginning of the Malaysian Gerup Gerak Khas (Special Service Group). With assistance from instructors from 40 Commando Royal Marines, the Special Service Group expanded and in 1965 alone conducted six Basic Commando courses. On 1 August 1970 the 1st Special Service Regiment was formed at Sungai Udang Camp in Melaka. In January 1981, Markas Grup Gerak Khas was established in Imphal Camp, Kuala Lumpur to act as the Brigade Headquarters for the three special forces regiments. The headquarters group would also include combat support units and service support units.
Gerup Gerak Khas was renamed 21 Gerup Gerak Khas which formalises the formation as the 21st brigade group in the Malaysian Army.

==Bases==

Sungai Udang Camp was the acknowledged Home of the Commandos and its spiritual home. Members of the regiment trained with foreign special forces units from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Indonesia, Australia and the United States of America, further enriching the knowledge base. Under the 3rd Malaysian Plan and the expansion of the Armed Forces, the PULPAK – Pusat Latihan Peperangan Khas (Special Warfare Training Centre) was established. In 1983, 22nd Commando Regiment moved to Kuala Kubu Baru due to congestion at Sungai Udang Military Camp.
21 Gerup Gerak Khas and its regiments and support units have moved to Iskandar Camp, the new Special Operations Force base in Mersing. Situated 15 km south of Mersing, Iskandar Camp covers an area of [tpl]Convert|2000|acre|km2[/tpl]. Facilities include 200 buildings, 20 km of roads, 3 bridges, a harbour, landing pads, parade squares and other facilities. The project cost was RM422 million. The new base was named Kem Iskandar, after the Sultan of Johor, a staunch supporter of Rejimen Gerak Khas and its current colonel in chief.

==Organisations==

The Malaysian Special Forces is subordinated to the Armed Forces HQ and Army HQ. The three regiments of Gerak Khas are grouped under 21 Gerup Gerak Khas. This brigade sized unit also includes supporting units such as Signals and Engineer units. 11 Gerup Gerak Khas is currently also tasked with the CRW function.
Gerup Gerak Khas faces problems retaining members nearing the end of their enlistment, and finding new recruits to replace existing commandos once they reached the mandatory age limit. Concerned with high numbers of special Forces personnel leaving the service, the Malaysian Government increased, as of 1 January 2005, the monthly incentive payments to RM600 for those who have served between 1 to 10 years, RM750 for those who had served between 11 to 15 years and RM900 for those whose service have exceeded 16 years.The 2005 Budget Speech report from the Malaysian Prime Minister's Office.

==Recruitment, selection and training==

===Special Warfare Training Centre===

Pusat Latihan Peperangan Khusus (PULPAK) (Special Warfare Training Centre) was formed on 1 August 1976. Before its inception, all GGK personnel training was conducted by 1st RGK (now 21 GGK). However, 21st Commando, 22nd Commando and 11th RGK are still supporting PULPAK by providing manpower and expertise. The role of SWTC is to provide specialized courses and training for all army personnel in accordance with current situation:
Courses conducted at PULPAK: (Some advanced courses are still classified)

===Training===

All members of GGK train with SAS (United Kingdom / New Zealand / Australia) as well as US Army's 1st Special Forces Group (1st Bn, Okinawa, Japan) and United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units. 1st Bn/1st SFG usually drops by a few times a year. The GGK and the Indonesian's Kopassus enjoy a close relationship.
All GGK trainees must pass five different training phases:

==Expansions==

The 2nd Special Service Regiment was established on 1 January 1977, based at Sungai Udang Camp, Melaka. In 1979, Colonel Borhan Bin Ahmad was appointed the Commandant of Special Warfare Training Centre. A separate Special Forces Directorate was established in the Ministry of Defence on 4 April 1980 and the Markas Grup Gerak Khas (HQ Special Forces Group) was established in Imphal Camp, Kuala Lumpur. As such, supporting units were attached to Gerup Gerak Khas.
The commando units were then redesignated and 1st Special Service Regiment became 21st Regiment Para Commando and 2 Special Service Regiment became 22nd Regiment Para Commando. On 1 April 1981, the 11th and 12th Special Service Regiments were formed to provide support to 21st Commando and 22nd Commando. However 12th Special Service Regiment was disbanded soon after during the realignment of the Malaysian Army in the 1980s and its members were deployed to other combat units. Further to this development, the designation for the Para Commando Regiment was changed to the Commando Regiment. In 1983, 22nd Commando Regiment moved to Kuala Kubu Baru due to insufficient facilities in Sungai Udang Camp. All three as well as the Royal Malaysian Navy PASKAL will be soon moving out to the new SOF base in Mersing, facing the South China Sea unlike the Sungai Udang which is facing the very busy waterway of the Straits of Malacca. Sungai Udang Camp is very small and lacking in many facilities for a good SOF base and training centre. It is also near to a massive oil refinery and countless condominium projects which makes it unsuitable for security and practical reasons. The 3 regiments again had a name change, becoming known as 11th CRW Regiment, 21st Commando Regiment and 22nd Commando Regiment.
Sungai Udang Camp was certified as the ‘Home of the Commandos’. Its achievements attracted many volunteers from other corps. Lieutenant Colonel Borhan bin Ahmad was the first administrator of MSSG responsible for expanding the Special Operations Forces. Various activities including sports and other Army activities were organized to get the SOF involved. Joint programs are conducted with other countries such as Britain, New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America to improve knowledge and to get new experience in certain aspects of SOF operations.
In the Third Malaysia Plan and the expansion of the Armed Forces, Special Warfare Training Centre (SWTC) was established on 1 August 1976. The function is to fulfill the training requirements for the Special Forces Team. After the establishment of SWTC, the Second Regiment of Special Service was established on 1 January 1977. All the three units were based in Sungai Udang, Melaka. In 1979, SWTC was fully established with Colonel Borhan bin Ahmad as the Commandant.
The Special Forces Directorate was established in the Ministry of Defence on 4 April 1980. Further to this, in January 1981, Grup Gerak Khas Command Headquarters was established in Imphal Camp, Kuala Lumpur. The establishment of the Special Operations Forces group also involved other elements such as the combat support units and service support units. At the same time the names of the commando units were redesignated to 21st Regiment Para Commando and 22nd Regiment Para Commando.
