It acts synergistically with FSH.

==Structure==

LH  is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a  glycoprotein molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein.
Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits, labeled alpha and beta subunits, that are non-covalently associated (i.e., without any disulfide bridge linking them):[tpl]cite journal | author = Jiang X, Dias JA, He X| title = Structural biology of glycoprotein hormones and their receptors: Insights to signaling | journal = Mol Cell Endocrinol |date=Aug 2013 | pmid = 24001578 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2013.08.021| url = | issn = [/tpl]
The different composition of these oligosaccharides affects bioactivity and speed of degradation. The biologic half-life of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of  FSH (3–4 hours) and hCG (24 hours).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
