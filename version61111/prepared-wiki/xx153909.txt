</ref> However, in light of the known complexities of gene expression networks (and phenomena such as [[epigenetics]]), it is clear that instances where a single gene "codes for" a single, discernible phenotypic effect are rare, and that media presentations of "a gene for X" grossly oversimplify the vast majority of situations.

==Genes as a blueprint==

It is widely believed that genes provide a "blueprint" for the body in much the same way that architectural or mechanical engineering blueprints describe buildings or machines.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dusheck J |title=The interpretation of genes |journal=Natural History |volume=111 |pages=52–9 |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_8_111/ai_92284523[/tpl] At a superficial level, genes and conventional blueprints share the common property of being low dimensional (genes are organised as a one-dimensional string of nucleotides; blueprints are typically two-dimensional drawings on paper) but containing information about fully three-dimensional structures. However, this view ignores the fundamental differences between genes and blueprints in the nature of the mapping from low order information to the high order object.
In the case of biological systems, a long and complicated chain of interactions separates genetic information from macroscopic structures and functions. The following simplified diagram of causality illustrates this:
Even at the small scale, the relationship between genes and proteins (once thought of as "one gene, one polypeptide")Evers, C. The One Gene/One Enzyme Hypothesis, National Health Museum, retrieved 12 July 2007 is known to be complicated, with approximately 5 proteins in the human body for each gene.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] More significantly, the causal chains from genes to functionality are not separate or isolated but are entangled together, most obviously in metabolic pathways (such as the Calvin and citric acid cycles) which link a succession of enzymes (and, thus, gene products) to form a coherent biochemical system. Furthermore, information flow in the chain is not exclusively one-way. While the central dogma of molecular biology describes how information cannot be passed back to inheritable genetic information, the other causal arrows in this chain can be bidirectional, with complex feedbacks ultimately regulating gene expression.
Instead of being a simple, linear mapping, this complex relationship between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward to deconvolute. Rather than describing genetic information as a blueprint, some have suggested that a more appropriate analogy is that of a recipe for cooking,[tpl]cite book | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = The Blind Watchmaker | publisher = W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. | location = New York | origyear = 1986 | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-393-31570-3 |page=295[/tpl] where a collection of ingredients is combined via a set of instructions to form an emergent structure, such as a cake, that is not described explicitly in the recipe itself.

==Genes as words==

It is popularly supposed that a gene is "a linear sequence of nucleotides along a segment of DNA that provides the coded instructions for synthesis of RNA"gene. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved 30 May 2007, from Dictionary.com website and even some current medical dictionaries define a gene as "a hereditary unit that occupies a specific location on a chromosome, determines a particular characteristic in an organism by directing the formation of a specific protein, and is capable of replicating itself at each cell division."gene. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 30 May 2007, from Dictionary.com website
In fact, as the diagram illustrates schematically, genes are much more complicated and elusive concepts. A reasonable modern definition of a gene is "a locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions."[tpl]cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7092|pages=398–401 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/441398a |pmid=16724031|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P [/tpl] One of the major complicating factors is that the exons which code for the proteins are often separated by many introns, which used to be called "junk DNA" but appear to have various as-yet-ill-understood purposes. The exons can be combined in different orders (splice variants) to produce different proteins. For example the gene called Dscam in Drosophila has 110 introns and therefore tens of thousands of possible splice variants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Celotto AM, Graveley BR |title=Alternative splicing of the Drosophila Dscam pre-mRNA is both temporally and spatially regulated |journal=Genetics |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=599–608 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11606537 |pmc=1461822 [/tpl]
This kind of misperception is perpetuated when mainstream media report that an organism's genome has been "deciphered" when they mean that it has simply been sequenced.e.g. New York Times Genome of DNA Discoverer Is Deciphered. Retrieved 1 June 2007.
