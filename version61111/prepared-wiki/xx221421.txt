===Early days===

Akademicki Zwiàzek Sportowy was founded on May 15, 1909, during a meeting of students, which took place in Collegium Novum of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków.  A student of medicine of the Jagiellonian University, Waclaw Majewski, became first director of the association.

Among most famous AZS's sportspersons of the interbellum period, there were Halina Konopacka, Roger Verey, Jerzy Ustupski, Wladyslaw Segda and Adam Papee. Most popular sports, practiced by members of the organization, were tourism, rowing, track and field, tennis, fencing and skiing.         
Quick growth of the organization made it necessary to create central office of the AZS, which would coordinate activities of all local branches. It was created on March 18–19, 1923 in Warsaw, during a meeting of all representatives. First director of the central office was Stefan Grodzki.
