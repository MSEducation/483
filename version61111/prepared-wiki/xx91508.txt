New Frankley in Birmingham is the only civil parish in Birmingham, England. As such, it has its own parish council.
It was established in 2000 in an area in the south-west of the city south of Bartley Reservoir (map), transferred from Bromsgrove (and thus also from Worcestershire to the West Midlands) in 1995, which had previously been part of the Frankley parish. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 7,890.
The parish borders Frankley parish in Bromsgrove District to the north, the unparished area of Birmingham to the east, the unparished area of Rubery to the south, and Romsley parish to the west.
Frankley was intended to have a railway station by extending the old line beyond the disused freight line serving Longbridge through the old Rover car works.  The intention was long stated in the West Midlands Local Transport Plan and in Birmingham's UDP. After deciding that 'providing for' a fast bus link was better than having trains, the intention to eliminate the railway formed a part of the 2008 Longbridge Area Action Plan.
