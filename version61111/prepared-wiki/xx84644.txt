[[Stroke]]

CATEGORIES: Stroke

A stroke, sometimes referred to as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebrovascular insult (CVI), or colloquially brain attack is the loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the brain.  This disturbance is due to either ischemia (lack of blood flow) or hemorrhage.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sims NR, Muyderman H |title=Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume= 1802|issue= 1|pages= 80–91|date=September 2009 |pmid=19751827 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.003[/tpl]  Ischemia is caused by either blockage of a blood vessel via thrombosis or arterial embolism, or by systemic hypoperfusion.[tpl]cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

A stroke is a medical emergency and can cause permanent neurological damage or death. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco smoking and atrial fibrillation. High blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor of stroke. Cerebrovascular disease was the second leading cause of death worldwide in 2004.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Mathers|first1=CD|author2=Boerma, T; Ma Fat, D|title=Global and regional causes of death|journal=British medical bulletin|year=2009|volume=92|pages=7–32|pmid=19776034|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldp028[/tpl]
An ischemic stroke is occasionally treated in a hospital with thrombolysis (also known as a "clot buster"), and some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from neurosurgery. Treatment to recover any lost function is termed stroke rehabilitation, ideally in a stroke unit and involving health professions such as speech and language therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Prevention of recurrence may involve the administration of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and dipyridamole, control and reduction of high blood pressure, and the use of statins. Selected patients may benefit from carotid endarterectomy and the use of anticoagulants.

==Classification==

Strokes can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/preventing_stroke.htm|title=Brain Basics: Preventing Stroke|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl] Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood supply, while hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest are hemorrhagic. Some hemorrhages develop inside areas of ischemia ("hemorrhagic transformation"). It is unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic stroke.

===Definition===

In the 1970s the World Health Organization defined stroke as a "neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours",[tpl]cite book |author=World Health Organisation|title=Cerebrovascular Disorders (Offset Publications) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year= 1978|pages= |isbn=92-4-170043-2 |oclc= 4757533|doi=[/tpl] although the word "stroke" is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from transient ischemic attack, which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours. With the availability of treatments which can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as brain attack and acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kidwell CS, Warach S |title=Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome: diagnostic criteria |journal=Stroke |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=2995–8 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14605325|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000098902.69855.A9[/tpl]

===Ischemic===

In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:
Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed "cryptogenic" (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30-40% of all ischemic strokes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Guercini F, Acciarresi M, Agnelli G, Paciaroni M |title=Cryptogenic stroke: time to determine aetiology |journal=Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=549–54 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18208534 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02903.x[/tpl]
There are various classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bamford J, Sandercock P, Dennis M, Burn J, Warlow C |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pages=1521–6 |date=June 1991 |pmid=1675378 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O[/tpl] Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed. See [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.strokecenter.org/trials/scales/oxford.html |title=Oxford Stroke Scale |author=Internet Stroke Center |accessdate=2008-11-14[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Bamford JM |title=The role of the clinical examination in the subclassification of stroke |journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases |volume=10 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=2–4 |year=2000 |pmid=11070389 |doi=10.1159/000047582[/tpl] The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) embolism of cardiac origin, (3) occlusion of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation). Abuser of stimulant drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic strokes.[tpl]cite web|last=Osterweil,|first=Neil|title=Methamphetamine induced ischemic strokes|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/Strokes/4761|publisher=Medpagetoday|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Adams HP |title=Classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke.

===Hemorrhagic===

Intracranial hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the skull vault. A distinction is made between intra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the brain) and extra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). Intra-axial hemorrhage is due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage (blood in the ventricular system). The main types of extra-axial hemorrhage are epidural hematoma (bleeding between the dura mater and the skull), subdural hematoma (in the subdural space) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (between the arachnoid mater and pia mater). Most of the hemorrhagic stroke syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g., headache, previous head injury).

==Signs and symptoms==

Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms.  For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.

===Early recognition===

Various systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Different findings are able to predict the presence or absence of stroke to different degrees. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present).  Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is significantly decreased (– likelihood ratio of 0.39).[tpl]cite journal |author=Goldstein LB, Simel DL |title=Is this patient having a stroke? |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=19 |pages=2391–402 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15900010 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.19.2391[/tpl] While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.
Proposed systems include FAST (face, arm, speech, and time),[tpl]cite journal |author=Harbison J, Massey A, Barnett L, Hodge D, Ford GA |title=Rapid ambulance protocol for acute stroke |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9168 |pages=1935 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10371574 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00966-6[/tpl] as advocated by the Department of Health (United Kingdom) and the Stroke Association, the American Stroke Association, the National Stroke Association (US), the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS)[tpl]cite journal |author=Kidwell CS, Saver JL, Schubert GB, Eckstein M, Starkman S |title=Design and retrospective analysis of the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) |journal=Prehospital Emergency Care |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–73 |year=1998 |pmid=9799012 |doi=10.1080/10903129808958878[/tpl] and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS).[tpl]cite journal |author=Kothari RU, Pancioli A, Liu T, Brott T, Broderick J |title=Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale: reproducibility and validity |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=373–8 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10092713 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70299-4[/tpl] Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.[tpl]NICE|68|Stroke|2008[/tpl]
For people referred to the emergency room, early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nor AM |title=The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=727–34 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16239179 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70201-5 |author-separator=, |author2=Davis J |author3=Sen B |display-authors=3 |last4=Shipsey |first4=Dean |last5=Louw |first5=Stephen J |last6=Dyker |first6=Alexander G |last7=Davis |first7=Michelle |last8=Ford |first8=Gary A[/tpl]

===Subtypes===

If the area of the brain affected contains one of the three prominent central nervous system pathways—the spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, and dorsal column (medial lemniscus), symptoms may include:
In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral).  Depending on the part of the brain affected,  the defect in the brain is usually on the opposite side of the body.  However, since these pathways also travel in the spinal cord and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate a stroke.
In addition to the above CNS pathways, the brainstem gives rise to most of the twelve cranial nerves. A stroke affecting the brain stem and brain therefore can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:
If the cerebral cortex is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but also can produce the following symptoms:
If the cerebellum is involved, the patient may have the following:

===Associated symptoms===

Loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occurs more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain.
If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.

==Causes==

===Thrombotic stroke===

In thrombotic stroke a thrombus[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18120.htm|publisher= U.S. National Library of Medicine |work=MedlinePlus |title=Thrombus[/tpl] (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. A thrombus itself (even if non-occluding) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off, at which point it is called an "embolus." Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke:
Sickle-cell anemia, which can cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. A stroke is the second leading killer of people under 20 who suffer from sickle-cell anemia.

===Embolic stroke===

An embolic stroke refers to the blockage of an artery by an arterial embolus, a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis).
Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.
Emboli most commonly arise from the heart (especially in atrial fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an atrial or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain.[tpl]cite book|first=by Vinay Kumar|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Professional Edition.|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier.|location=Philadelphia, Pa|isbn=978-1-4377-0792-2|edition=8th ed.[/tpl]
Cardiac causes can be distinguished between high and low-risk:[tpl]cite journal |author=Ay H, Furie KL, Singhal A, Smith WS, Sorensen AG, Koroshetz WJ |title=An evidence-based causative classification system for acute ischemic stroke |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=688–97 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16240340 |doi=10.1002/ana.20617[/tpl]

===Systemic hypoperfusion===

Systemic hypoperfusion is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the body. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially "watershed" areas - border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.

===Venous thrombosis===

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke.

===Intracerebral hemorrhage===

It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension,[tpl]cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Abstract/1996/10003/Hypertension_and_stroke.5.aspx|title=Hypertension[/tpl] intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary haemorrhage has occurred. Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke).

===Silent stroke===

A silent stroke is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and the patients are typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still damages the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have suffered a major stroke are also at risk of having silent strokes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miwa K |title=Silent cerebral infarction is associated with incident stroke and TIA independent of carotid intima-media thickness |journal=Intern. Med. |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=817–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20453400 |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/49.3211?from=PubMed |doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3211 |author-separator=, |author2=Hoshi T |author3=Hougaku H |display-authors=3 |last4=Tanaka |first4=Makiko |last5=Furukado |first5=Shigetaka |last6=Abe |first6=Yuko |last7=Okazaki |first7=Shuhei |last8=Sakaguchi |first8=Manabu |last9=Sakoda |first9=Saburo |first10=Kazuo[/tpl] In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent strokes typically cause lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. Silent strokes are estimated to occur at five times the rate of symptomatic strokes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Herderscheê D, Hijdra A, Algra A, Koudstaal PJ, Kappelle LJ, van Gijn J |title=Silent stroke in patients with transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke.

==Pathophysiology==

===Ischemic===

Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20074922  | author-separator =, | last1 = Deb | author-name-separator=  | first1 = P| doi=10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.12.001 | last2 = Sharma | first2 = S | last3 = Hassan | first3 = KM | title = Pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute ischemic stroke: An overview with emphasis on therapeutic significance beyond thrombolysis | journal = Pathophysiology : the official journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology / ISP | volume=17 | issue=3 |date=June 2010 | pages=197–218[/tpl] Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading to death of the tissue, i.e., infarction. (This is why fibrinolytics such as alteplase are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques.[tpl]cite book|author= Richard S. Snell|title= Clinical neuroanatomy, 6. ed |publisher=  Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia|pages= 478–485|isbn= 978-963-226-293-2 |year=2006[/tpl] Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and occlude brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now occluded, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts into using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the "ischemic penumbra".Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook on Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Edition
As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of high energy phosphate compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy-dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na+) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells' proteins, lipids and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of mitochondria, which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to apoptosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Ischemia also induces production of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium is particularly important. In fact, many antioxidant neuroprotectants such as uric acid and NXY-059 work at the level of the endothelium and not in the brain per se. Free radicals also directly initiate elements of the apoptosis cascade by means of redox signaling.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ischemic cascade. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism, unlike most other organs.
In addition to injurious effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction can result in loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, hyaluronic acid, and other elements of connective tissue. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in a breakdown of the protective blood brain barrier that contributes to cerebral edema, which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Hemorrhagic===

Bleeding within the skull cavity can occur from various causes.  Subdural and epidural bleeding mostly are the result of trauma.[tpl]cite book|last=Longo et al|first=ed. Dan L. Longo ... [et|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|pages=Chapter 370|edition=18th ed.[/tpl]   Hemorrhagic strokes arise from bleeding within the brain parenchyma or intraventricular spaces, and are classified based on their underlying pathology.  Some examples of hemorrhagic stroke are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug induced bleeding.[tpl]cite book|last=Longo et al|first=ed. Dan L. Longo ... [et|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|pages=Chapter 370|edition=18th ed.[/tpl]   They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. This can distort and injure tissue. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wang J |title=Preclinical and clinical research on inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage |journal=Prog.

==Diagnosis==

Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hill MD |title=Diagnostic biomarkers for stroke: a stroke neurologist's perspective |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=2001–2 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16244286 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2005.056382[/tpl]

===Physical examination===

A physical examination, including taking a medical history of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of a stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the NIH stroke scale.

===Imaging===

For diagnosing ischemic stroke in the emergency setting:[tpl]cite journal |author=Chalela JA |title=Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in emergency assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke: a prospective comparison |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9558 |pages=293–8 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17258669 |pmc=1859855 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60151-2 |author-separator=, |author2=Kidwell CS |author3=Nentwich LM |display-authors=3 |last4=Luby |first4=Marie |last5=Butman |first5=John A |last6=Demchuk |first6=Andrew M |last7=Hill |first7=Michael D |last8=Patronas |first8=Nicholas |last9=Latour |first9=Lawrence |first10=Steven[/tpl]

For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans SPECT and PET/CT may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow and PET with FDG isotope the metabolic activity of the neurons.

===Underlying cause===

When a stroke has been diagnosed, various other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the current treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary, since the cause of stroke varies with age, comorbidity and the clinical presentation. Commonly used techniques include:

==Prevention==

Given the disease burden of strokes, prevention is an important public health concern.[tpl]cite journal |author=Straus SE, Majumdar SR, McAlister FA |title=New evidence for stroke prevention: scientific review |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=11 |pages=1388–95 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12234233 |doi=10.1001/jama.288.11.1388[/tpl] Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year).

====Anticoagulation drugs====

Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson ES, Lanes SF, Wentworth CE, Satterfield MH, Abebe BL, Dicker LW |title=A metaregression analysis of the dose-response effect of aspirin on stroke |journal=Arch.

Ticlopidine has more skin rash, diarrhea, neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect.[tpl]cite journal |author=Halkes PH, van Gijn J, Kappelle LJ, Koudstaal PJ, Algra A |title=Aspirin plus dipyridamole versus aspirin alone after cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin (ESPRIT): randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9523 |pages=1665–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16714187 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68734-5[/tpl] Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after sustaining a myocardial infarction.

====Surgery====

Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases.

===Women===

A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including: taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure, blood pressure medications in pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=C.|author2=McCullough, L. D.; Awad, I. A.; Chireau, M.

===Secondary prevention===

Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hart RG, Pearce LA, Aguilar MI |title=Meta-analysis: antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=12 |pages=857–67 |year=2007 |pmid=17577005 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-146-12-200706190-00007[/tpl] However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anti-coagulation started early after an embolic stroke.[tpl]cite journal |author=Paciaroni M, Agnelli G, Micheli S, Caso V |title=Efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatment in acute cardioembolic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=423–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17204681 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000254600.92975.1f [/tpl]ACP JC synopsis 
Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHADS/CHADS2 system. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while dabigatran is a new alternative which does not require prothrombin time monitoring.
Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=MJ|author2=Gronseth, G; Anderson, DC; Biller, J; Cucchiara, B; Dafer, R; Goldstein, LB; Schneck, M; Messé, SR|title=Summary of evidence-based guideline: Periprocedural management of antithrombotic medications in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal=Neurology|date=May 28, 2013|volume=80|issue=22|pages=2065–2069|pmid=23713086|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318294b32d|pmc=3716407[/tpl]
If studies show carotid stenosis, and the patient has residual function in the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.

==Management==

===Ischemic stroke===

Definitive therapy is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was crystallized as Time is Brain! in the early 1990s.Gomez CR: Time is Brain! J Stroke and Cerebrovasc Dis 3:1-2. 1993, additional Time Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.[tpl]cite journal |author=Saver JL |title=Time is brain - quantified |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=263–6 |year=2006 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/01.STR.0000196957.55928.abv1 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000196957.55928.ab |pmid=16339467[/tpl]
Tight control of blood sugars in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Bellolio|first1=MF|author2=Gilmore, RM, Stead, LG|title=Insulin for glycaemic control in acute ischaemic stroke|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011-09-07|volume=9|pages=CD005346|pmid=21901697|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005346.pub3|editor1-last=Bellolio|editor1-first=M Fernanda|issue=9[/tpl] High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful.

====Thrombolysis====

Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in acute ischemic stroke, when given before three hours of symptom onset increases the risk of death in the short term but in the long-term improves the rate of independence; the change in long term mortality is not significant.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Wardlaw|first1=JM|author2=Murray V, Berge E, Del Zoppo G, Sandercock P, Lindley RL, Cohen G|title=Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischaemic stroke: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Lancet|date=May 23, 2012|volume=Online first|pmid=22632907|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60738-7|issue=9834|pages=2364–72|pmc=3386494[/tpl] When broken down by time to treatment it increases the chance of being alive and living independently by 9% in those treated within three hours, however the benefit for those treated between three and six hours is not significant. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated. There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial hemorrhage post treatment versus who will not.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=WN|author2=Slot, KB; Fernandes, P; Sandercock, P; Wardlaw, J|title=Risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 studies|journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation|date=November 2012|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2904–9|pmid=22996959|doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.665331[/tpl]
Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators[tpl]cite journal |author= The National Institute Of Neurological Disorders And Stroke Rt-Pa Stroke Study Group,|title=Tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=333 |issue=24 |pages=1581–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7477192 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/333/24/1581|doi=10.1056/NEJM199512143332401[/tpl] which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome.

====Mechanical thrombectomy====

Removal of the clot may be attempted in those where it occurs within a large blood vessel and may be an option for those who either are not eligible for or do not improve with intravenous thrombolytics.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Tenser|first1=MS|author2=Amar, AP; Mack, WJ|title=Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke using the MERCI retriever and penumbra aspiration systems|journal=World neurosurgery|date=December 2011|volume=76|issue=6 Suppl|pages=S16–23|pmid=22182267|doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2011.07.003[/tpl] Significant complications occur in about 7%.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ortega-Lopez Y, Llanos-Mendez A|title=thrombectomy with MERCI device.

====Hemicraniectomy====

Large territory strokes can cause significant edema of the brain with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in strokes of the middle cerebral artery territory, and is also called "malignant cerebral infarction" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some more people survive with disability who would otherwise have died.[tpl]cite journal |author=Simard JM, Sahuquillo J, Sheth KN, Kahle KT, Walcott BP |title=Managing malignant cerebral infarction |journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=217–29 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21190097 |pmc=3243953 |doi=10.1007/s11940-010-0110-9[/tpl]

===Hemorrhagic stroke===

People with intracerebral hemorrhage require neurosurgical evaluation to detect and treat the cause of the bleeding, although many may not need surgery. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics, key in treating ischemic stroke, can make bleeding worse. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood pressure, blood sugar, and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Stroke unit===

Ideally, people who have had a stroke are admitted to a "stroke unit", a ward or dedicated area in hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to a stroke unit have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke.[tpl]cite journal|title=Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care for stroke|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 11, 2013|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000197.pub3[/tpl]
When an acute stroke is suspected by history and physical examination, the goal of early assessment is to determine the cause. Treatment varies according to the underlying cause of the stroke, thromboembolic (ischemic) or hemorrhagic.

===Rehabilitation===

Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications and educate family members to play a supporting role.
A rehabilitation team is usually multidisciplinary as it involves staff with different skills working together to help the patient. These include physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one third of the people manifest post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale may be used to assess the likelihood of a stroke patient being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from hospital.
Good nursing care is fundamental in maintaining skin care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring vital signs such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Stroke rehabilitation begins almost immediately.
For most people with stroke, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.http://www.stroke.scot.nhs.uk/docs/UseOfAnkle-FootOrthosesFollowingStroke.pdf PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise, however PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and re-learning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.[tpl]harvnb|O'Sullivan|2007|pp=471, 484, 737, 740[/tpl] OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the Activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Speech and language therapy is appropriate for patients with the speech production disorders: dysarthria[tpl]cite journal |author=Mackenzie C |title=Dysarthria in stroke: a narrative review of its description and the outcome of intervention |journal=Int J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=125–36 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21480809 |doi=10.3109/17549507.2011.524940 |url=[/tpl] and apraxia of speech,[tpl]cite journal |author=West C, Hesketh A, Vail A, Bowen A |title=Interventions for apraxia of speech following stroke |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD004298 |year=2005 |pmid=16235357 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004298.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=West |editor1-first=Carolyn[/tpl] aphasia,[tpl]cite journal |author=Kelly H, Brady MC, Enderby P |title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=5 |pages=CD000425 |year=2010 |pmid=20464716 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Brady |editor1-first=Marian C[/tpl] cognitive-communication impairments and/or dysphagia (problems with swallowing).
Patients may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.
Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positionings.[tpl]harvnb|O'Sullivan|2007|p=719[/tpl] Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates. Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.
Stroke rehabilitation should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the "window" considered officially by U.S. state rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement. However, patients have been known to continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking. Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the stroke patient's routine. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most patients will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.
Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating patients to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not.[tpl]cite journal|last=B. Lange, S. Flynn & A. Rizzo|title=Initial usability assessment of off-the-shelf video game consoles for clinical game-based motor rehabilitation|journal=Physical Therapy Reviews|year=2009|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.1179/108331909X12488667117258|first1=B.|last2=Flynn|first2=S.|last3=Rizzo|first3=A.[/tpl] Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.
Other novel non-invasive rehabilitation methods are currently being developed to augment physical therapy to improve motor function of stroke patients, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)[tpl]cite journal|last1=Fregni|first1=F|author2=Pascual-Leone A|title=Technology Insight: noninvasive brain stimulation in neurology—perspectives on the therapeutic potential of rTMS and tDCS|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Neurology|year=2007|volume=3|issue=7|pages=383–393|doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0530|pmid=17611487[/tpl] and robotic therapies.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Balasubramanian|first1=S|author2=Klein J, Burdet E.|title=Robot-assisted rehabilitation of hand function|journal=Current Opinion in Neurology|volume=23|issue=6|pages=661–70|doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32833e99a4|pmid=20852421|year=2010[/tpl]

Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss, and pain. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, coma or death can result.
Emotional problems resulting from stroke can result from direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include anxiety, panic attacks, flat affect (failure to express emotions), mania, apathy, and psychosis.
30 to 50% of stroke survivors suffer post stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, sleep disturbances, lowered self esteem, and withdrawal.

Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with antidepressants.
Emotional lability, another consequence of stroke, causes the patient to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the patient's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes patients to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.

Some patients show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy.

In a condition called hemispatial neglect, a patient is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere.
Cognitive and psychological outcome after a stroke can be affected by the age at which the stroke happened, pre-stroke baseline intellectual functioning, psychiatric history and whether there is pre-existing brain pathology.[tpl]cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1-4377-0434-4|author=Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH|volume=1|edition=6th|pages=100–1|editor=Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J|chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice[/tpl]
Up to 10% of people following a stroke develop seizures, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Reith J, Jørgensen HS, Nakayama H, Raaschou HO, Olsen TS |title=Seizures in acute stroke: predictors and prognostic significance.
