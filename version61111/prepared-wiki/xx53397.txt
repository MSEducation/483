USS ''Reid'' (FFG-30), twenty-second ship of the Oliver Hazard Perry class of guided-missile frigates, was named for Sailing Master Samuel Chester Reid (1783â€“1861).
Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, San Pedro, California on 23 January 1978 as part of the FY78 program, Reid was laid down on 8 October 1980, launched on 27 June 1981, and commissioned on 19 February 1983.
On 18 August 1990, Reid fired the first shots of Operation Desert Shield when she fired across the bow of an Iraqi tanker who had refused to change course when ordered.
The Reid's unofficial nickname Reidski, used during the 1980s, came into use as the Reid found herself, more often than not, playing on the side of the "orange" team during fleet exercises.
