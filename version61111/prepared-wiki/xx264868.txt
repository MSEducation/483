==Reception==

MTV Iggy classified the release as "It's a sign of good things to come. "Quiero Verte Mas" is an upbeat piano, vibraphone, and bass pop track track with a swingin' hand clap beat. Francisca sings with a raw, easy quality that sounds fit for American country songs. (But lets hope it doesn’t come to that!) And just to show you she’s serious, Francisca, 23, even dropped her girlish glitz and got all grown up on the single cover.".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://blog.mtviggy.com/2011/01/05/chile-pop-diva-francisca-valenzuela-wants-to-see-you-more/ |title=Chile Pop Diva Francisca Valenzuela Wants To See You More.|accessdate=2011-01-11|work=MTV Iggy[/tpl]
