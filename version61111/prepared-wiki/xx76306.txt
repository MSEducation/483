An acrophobic, on the other hand, continues to over-rely on visual signals whether because of inadequate vestibular function or incorrect strategy.  Locomotion at a high elevation requires more than normal visual processing. The visual cortex becomes overloaded resulting in confusion. Some proponents of the alternative view of acrophobia warn that it may be ill-advised to encourage acrophobics to expose themselves to height without first resolving the vestibular issues. Research is underway at several clinics.[tpl]cite journal |last=Whitney |first=SL |author2=Jacob, Rolf G|author3=Sparto, BG |date=May 2005 |title=Acrophobia and pathological height vertigo: indications for vestibular physical therapy? |journal=Physical Therapy |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=443–458 |issn=0031-9023 |pmid=15842192[/tpl]

==Treatment==

There have been a number of promising studies into using virtual reality as a treatment for acrophobia.[ref]

Many different types of medications are used in the treatment of phobias like fear of heights, including traditional anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines, and newer options like antidepressants and beta-blockers.
Drugs can seem very effective in the short term, but they are not a cure. Anxiety medication can provide temporary relief, but it doesn’t treat the underlying cause of the disorder. Once you stop taking the drug, usually all the symptoms of fear of heights return in full force.
You need to be aware of the risks of anxiety medication, too:  Anxiety drugs often cause a wide range of unpleasant and sometimes even dangerous side effects.
Many anxiety meds are habit forming and physically addictive too, making it difficult to get off the medication once you’ve started. The bottom line is that anxiety medications can be helpful in the short term but can only ever mask the symptoms of fear of heights, never cure and tackle the root cause.
