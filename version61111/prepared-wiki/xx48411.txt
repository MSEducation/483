JBuilder is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the programming language Java from Embarcadero Technologies.  Originally developed by Borland JBuilder was spun off with CodeGear which was eventually purchased by Embarcadero Technologies in 2008.
JBuilder's main competitors are the products from Eclipse Foundation (Eclipse), Genuitec (MyEclipse), JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA), and Oracle (JDeveloper and NetBeans). Oracle used to base the first versions of JDeveloper on code from JBuilder licensed from Borland, but it has since been rewritten from scratch.[ref]
