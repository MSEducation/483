RAF Bushey Hall is a former Second World War non-flying Royal Air Force station located [tpl]Convert|6.7|mi[/tpl] south west of St Albans, Hertfordshire and [tpl]Convert|8.8|mi[/tpl] north east of Uxbridge, London, England.

==History==

It was established at a private golf club and was used as a headquarters facility for the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force in the United Kingdom.  It was situated close to its Royal Air Force counterpart at RAF Bentley Priory, near Stanmore. It was also known as USAAF station 341.WW2 Headquarters – 8th USAAF Fighter Command, The Forties Experience, Lincolnsfields Children's Centre.
During the war the facility was the headquarters for the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force VIII Fighter Command (1942–45). Its name frequently led to the site being confused with Army Air Force Station 586 at Bushy Park in south-west London, which was the Headquarters of United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) during 1944 and 1945.

==Current use==

In 1955, the facility was returned to civil control.  It is now Bushey Hall Golf Club and Lincolnsfields Children's Centre.
