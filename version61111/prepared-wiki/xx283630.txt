==History and architecture==

The church originally dates from around the late 13th or early 14th century, but underwent two periods of restoration in the mid 19th century, during which the porch and chancel were rebuilt, and a vestry was added. The church is built of North Curry sandstone, with hamstone dressing and a slate roof. It has a western crenellated tower which has set-back buttresses. At each of the three stages of the tower, it has gargoyles on the corner edges. A clock, and empty niche for a statue are featured on the southern face of the tower. The tower includes 19th century stained glass. The arcade is of octagonal piers topped with plain capitals.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zaqpW4jc0JEC&pg=PA262#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The buildings of England: South and West Somerset |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2001 |origyear=1958 |isbn=0-14-071014-0 |page=262[/tpl] The church was classified as a Grade II* listed building in February 1955.
The church features an early 16th-century 3/5 bay rood screen, of the Devon style, which originally spanned across the entire nave and aisle, but is now split. The lower section of the screen depicts the story of the Dragon of Norton Camp. The south west corner of the graveyard is believed to have been a burial site for gypsies.
