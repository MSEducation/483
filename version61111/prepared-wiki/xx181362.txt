==Design==

The Star of Courage is in the form of a [tpl]convert|38|mm|in[/tpl] wide silver compass star Celeste with a maple leaf in each angle. On the obverse is a gold roundel at the centre of the star, bearing a maple leaf surrounded by a laurel wreath. The reverse bears on the upper arm the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch beneath a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hon/nat-honour-honneur/index-eng.htm| last=Royal Canadian Mounted Police| title=Honours and Recognition Programs > Canadian National Honours| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 May 2009[/tpl] and the inscription COURAGE. Below this is engraved the name and rank of the recipient.
This medallion is worn on the left chest, on a [tpl]convert|38|mm|in[/tpl] wide ribbon coloured red with two vertical blue stripes: for men, hung from a bar, and for women, on a ribbon bow, both pinned to the left chest. Should an individual already possessing a Star of Courage be awarded the medal again for subsequent acts of bravery, he or she is granted a medal bar, in gold and bearing a maple leaf, for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended; a small gold maple leaf is also added to the ribbon bar.

==Eligibility and receipt==

On 1 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, created the Star of Courage to recognize acts of great bravery. Any person, living or deceased, may be nominated for the Star of Courage; it is not necessary that the act of bravery take place in Canada, nor must the person who carried out the act be a Canadian. However, the event must have involved Canadians and/or Canadian interests. Nominations can be made no later than two years following either the act of bravery itself or the conclusion of any coroner's or court's inquest into the events for which the person was nominated. [tpl]As of|2009|August[/tpl], the Star of Courage has been presented to 417 people, though no bars have yet been issued.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/index_e.asp?results=1&Firstname=&Middlename=&Lastname=&City=&Province=&TypeID=br&Title=&PostNominal=&Incident=&Honours=2&AwardStart=&AwardEnd=&InvestStart=&InvestEnd=&npp=99999| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Honours > Decorations > Decorations for Bravery > Search: Decorations for Bravery Recipients List > Level of Award: Star of Courage| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
