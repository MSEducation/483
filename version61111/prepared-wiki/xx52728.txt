[[Ï]]

CATEGORIES: Specific letter-diacritic combinations

[tpl]unicode|Ï[/tpl], lowercase [tpl]unicode|ï[/tpl], is a symbol used in various languages written with the Latin alphabet; it can be read as the letter I with diaeresis or I-umlaut.
In Afrikaans, Catalan, Dutch, French, Galician, Welsh, Southern Sami, and occasionally English, [tpl]angle bracket|ï[/tpl] is used when [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl] follows another vowel and indicates hiatus (diaeresis) in the pronunciation of such a word—that is, it indicates that the two vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, rather than together as a diphthong or digraph. For example, French maïs ([tpl]IPA-fr|ma.is|IPA[/tpl], maize); without the diaeresis, the [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl] is part of the digraph [tpl]angle bracket|ai[/tpl]: mais ([tpl]IPA-fr|mɛ|IPA[/tpl], but). The letter is also in Dutch Oekraïne ([tpl]IPA-af|ukrɑːˈinə|IPA[/tpl], Ukraine), and English naïve ([tpl]IPAc-en|n|ɑː|ˈ|iː|v[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|iː|v[/tpl]).
In scholarly writing on Turkish, [tpl]angbr|ï[/tpl] is sometimes used to write the close back unrounded vowel [tpl]IPA|/ɯ/[/tpl], which in standard modern Turkish orthography is written as the dotless i [tpl]angbr|ı[/tpl].
In the transcription of the languages of the Amazon, ï is used to represent the high central vowel [tpl]IPAblink|ɨ[/tpl].
