[[Cefn Hirgoed]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains and hills of south Wales

Cefn Hirgoed is a ridge in Bridgend county borough in South Wales. 
The ridge extends for about 5km east from the village of Sarn just north of Bridgend to Pen-prysg north of Pencoed. At the point where it reaches its highest elevation of 142m, are a couple of covered reservoirs. Towards the west the M4 motorway runs along the hillâ€™s southern edge.

==Geology==

The hill is formed from relatively hard-wearing sandstones of the South Wales Lower Coal Measures with mudstone layers between the sandstones which here dip steeply northwards into the South Wales Coalfield syncline.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 248 Pontypridd & accompanying memoir

==Access==

Almost the entire hill is mapped as open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 giving a general right of access on foot to the public. It and the adjacent Hirwaun Common are also crossed by several public footpaths. A couple of minor roads, Heol Spencer and Heol Llan/Heol-Las, run north-south across the ridge.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map 151 Cardiff & Bridgend
