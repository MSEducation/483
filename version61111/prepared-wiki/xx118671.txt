Holbeck railway station was a railway station that served the district of Holbeck, in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

==Overview==

Holbeck Station was unusual in that it had platforms on two different levels, the Holbeck High Level (HL) and Holbeck Low Level (LL).
The station was closed to the public in 1958. The route where trains ran through Holbeck High Level station to Leeds Central station had latterly closed in 1967, with the tracks subsequently being lifted and the bridge carrying the high level track over the low level, removed.
Trains running along the Airedale, Wharfedale and Harrogate Lines still pass over the site of Holbeck Low Level station on their way in and out of Leeds station, although there is no clear indication of the former station that existed on the site.
