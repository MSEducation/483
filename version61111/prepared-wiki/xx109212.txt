The group went through a variety of names, including The Caribbeans,Notes, "(1955) Edric Connor and the Southlanders â€“ Songs from Trinidad", folkcatalogue. South Londoners, and Southerners, before settling on The Southlanders. Nesbeth remains with old members the group to this day, where they continue to perform on cruise ships and in hotels. Alan Wilmot has since retired and resides at home in South London. 
Whilst their biggest commercial hit was 1958's cover version of "Alone", which sold over one million copies; the song they are most identified with is "I am a Mole and I Live in a Hole" (also known as "Mole", "The Mole" and "The Mole in a Hole"). The unforgettable title line from the song was spoken by the group's bass voice Harry Wilmot, father of Gary Wilmot. Harry Wilmot died in 1961, when his son was six years old. The song failed to make the UK Singles Chart in 1958, but has been performed at every Southlanders' event since its release. Group founder Vernon Nesbeth said that the group tried to take the song out of their set but that club managers and audiences insisted upon hearing it. "It's become protected. Untouchable. We've even sung it in Japanese", said Nesbeth.
"Alone" was released by Decca, and entered the UK Singles Chart in November 1957. It was the group's only appearance in the chart, in which they spent ten weeks and peaked at #17.
