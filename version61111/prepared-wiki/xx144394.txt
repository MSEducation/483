[[KLCC LRT Station]]

CATEGORIES: Kelana Jaya Line

KLCC LRT station is an underground rapid transit station in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, served by the Kelana Jaya Line.
It is located in the basement of Avenue K, a shopping mall along Jalan Ampang. A pedestrian subway links the station to Suria KLCC and the rest of the KLCC development which includes the Petronas Twin Towers, Maxis Tower and the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. Located outside the station, along Jalan Ampang and Jalan P Ramlee, is the KLCC bus hub.
Located right in the middle of the city, and so close to many landmarks, this is one of the busiest stations on the LRT system. It is packed especially on weekends and school holidays.
The pedestrian walkway linking between the Petronas Twin Towers and Pavilion Kuala Lumpur shopping centre in Bukit Bintang was launched in January 2012 and completed now.
