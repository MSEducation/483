</ref>  LINER nuclei contain weakly [[ion]]ized gas.  The power source for the LINER emission has been debated extensively, with some researchers suggesting that LINERs are powered by [[active galactic nuclei]] that contain [[supermassive black hole]]s and other researchers suggesting that LINERs are powered by [[star formation]] activity.

===X-ray emission===

X-ray observations of NGC 5005 have revealed that it contains a variable, point-like hard X-ray source in its nucleus.[ref]
