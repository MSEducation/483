===2010 World Cup and wrongly disallowed goal===

In the round-of-16 match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against rivals Germany, Lampard had a first-half shot at goal that bounced off the crossbar and from TV replays was clearly seen to cross the goal line. If counted, it would have tied the game 2–2. However, neither the referee nor the linesman saw it as a goal, and play was continued. In the second-half, Lampard hit the cross-bar again, with a 30-yard free-kick. The final score was a 4–1 win for Germany, eliminating England from the tournament.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7857382/England-v-Germany-Frank-Lampards-disallowed-goal-highlights-stupidity-of-Fifas-ruling.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=England v Germany: Frank Lampard's disallowed goal highlights stupidity of Fifa | first=Kevin | last=Garside | date=27 June 2010[/tpl]
