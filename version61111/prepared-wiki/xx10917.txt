Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /.) is a technology-related news website owned by the US-based company Dice Holdings, Inc. The site, which bills itself as "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters", features user-submitted and evaluated news stories about science and technology-related topics. Each story has a comments section attached to it. Slashdot was founded in 1997 as a blog, Chips & Dips, by Hope College computer science student Rob Malda, also known as "Commander Taco" and classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos".
Summaries of stories and links to news articles are submitted by Slashdot's own readers, and each story becomes the topic of a threaded discussion among users. Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment.  Moderation applies either −1 or +1 to the current rating, based on whether the comment is perceived as either normal, offtopic, insightful, redundant, interesting, or troll (among others). The site's comment and moderation system is administered by its own open source content management system, Slash, which is available under the GNU General Public License.
In 2012, Slashdot had around 3.7 million unique visitors per month and received over 5300 comments per day.http://www.diceholdingsinc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=211152&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1735911 The site has won more than 20 awards, including People's Voice Awards in 2000 for Best Community Site and Best News Site. Occasionally, a story will link to a server causing a large surge of traffic, which can overwhelm some smaller or independent sites. This phenomenon is known as the "Slashdot effect".
The site is well known for its bias towards the open source software movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyberarmy.net/library/article/994|title=Interview with Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda|last=Ravn|date=January 13, 2006|publisher=cyberarmy.net|accessdate=January 7, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013014954/http://www.cyberarmy.net/library/article/994|archivedate=October 13, 2007[/tpl]

==History==

The origins of the site now known as Slashdot date back to July 1997 when Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda started a personal website called Chips & Dips, which featured a single "rant" each day about something that interested him – typically something to do with Linux or open-source software. At the time, Malda was a student at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, majoring in computer science. 
The site became Slashdot in September 1997 under the slogan "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters," and quickly became a hotspot on the Web for news and information of interest to computer geeks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1998/06/15/feature|title=Geek central|last=Leonard|first=Andrew|date=June 15, 1998|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl] 
The name "Slashdot" came from a somewhat "obnoxious parody of a URL" – when Malda registered the domain, he desired to make a name that was "silly and unpronounceable" – try pronouncing out, "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-slashdot-dot-org".[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/faq/slashmeta.shtml|title=FAQ: About Slashdot: What does the name "Slashdot" mean?|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=October 29, 2000|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl]
By June 1998 the site was seeing as many as 100,000 page views per day and advertisers began to take notice. By December 1998, Slashdot had net revenues of $18,000, yet its Internet profile was higher, and revenues were expected to increase. On June 29, 1999, the site was sold to Linux megasite Andover.net for $1.5 million in cash and $7 million in Andover stock at the IPO price. Part of the deal was contingent upon the continued employment of Rob Malda and Jeff Bates and on "the achievement of certain milestones". 
With the acquisition of Slashdot, Andover.net could now advertise itself as "the leading Linux/Open Source destination on the Internet".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newcitychicago.com/newcity/content/specials/webby_feature2.html|title=All the Young News|last=Welch|first=Matt|date=May 5, 2000|publisher=www.newcitychicago.com|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/09/17/slashdot/index.html|title=Slashdot goes quiet|last=Leonard|first=Andrew|date=September 17, 1999|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl]

During the first 12 years, the most active story with the most responses posted was the post-2004 US Presidential Election article "Kerry Concedes Election To Bush" with 5,687 posts. 
This followed the creation of a new article section, politics.slashdot.org, created at the start of the 2004 election on September 7, 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/07/1513235|title=Slashdot Goes Political: Announcing politics.slashdot.org|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=September 7, 2004|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl] 
Many of the most popular stories are political, with "Strike on Iraq" (March 19, 2003) the second-most-active article and "Barack Obama Wins US Presidency" (November 5, 2008) the third-most-active. 
The rest of the 10 most active articles are an article announcing the 2005 London bombings, and several articles about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design, Saddam Hussein's capture, and Fahrenheit 9/11. 
Articles about Microsoft and its Windows Operating System are popular—a thread posted in 2002 titled "What's Keeping You On Windows?" was the 10th-most-active story, and an article about Windows 2000/NT4 source-code leaks the most visited article with more than 680,000 hits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/hof.shtml|title=Hall of Fame|last=Malda|first=Rob|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl]
Some controversy erupted on March 9, 2001 after an anonymous user posted the full text of Scientology's "Operating Thetan Level Three" (OT III) document in a comment attached to a Slashdot article. 
The Church of Scientology demanded that Slashdot remove the document under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
A week later, in a long article, Slashdot editors explained their decision to remove the page while providing links and information on how to get the document from other sources.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/16/slashdot_caves_in_to_scientology/|title=Slashdot caves in to Scientology loonies|last=Greene|first=Thomas C.|date=March 16, 2001|publisher=The Register|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl]
Slashdot Japan was launched on May 28, 2001 (although the first article was published April 5, 2001) and is an official offshoot of the US-based Web site.

Slashdot implemented a subscription service on March 1, 2002. Slashdot's subscription model works by allowing users to pay a small fee to be able to view pages without banner ads, starting at a rate of $5 per 1,000 page views – non-subscribers may still view articles and respond to comments, with banner ads in place.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2002/03/slashdots_subscription_model.html |title=Slashdot's Subscription Model|last=Sims|first=David|date=March 1, 2002|publisher=www.oreillynet.com|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl]

Slashdot altered its threaded discussion forum display software to explicitly show domains for links in articles, as "users made a sport out of tricking unsuspecting readers into visiting Goatse.cx."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lVXnmsCCd3wC&pg=PA274#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Pro PHP Security |author=Snyder, Chris; Southwell, Michael |page=274 |publisher=Apress |year=2005| isbn=978-1-59059-508-4 |accessdate=September 14, 2010[/tpl]
In observance of April Fools' Day (April 1) in 2006, Slashdot temporarily changed its signature teal color theme to a warm palette of bubblegum pink and changed its masthead from the usual, "News for Nerds" motto to, "OMG!!! Ponies!!!" Editors joked that this was done to increase female readership.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6056735-7.html|title=Good one, Slashdot|last=Meyers|first=Michelle|date=March 31, 2006|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=January 13, 2010[/tpl] 
In another supposed April Fools' Day joke, User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/31/1610228|title=Slashdot Launches User Achievements|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl] This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements, such as "The Tagger" for tagging a story or "Member of the {1,2,3,4,5} Digit UID Club" for having a Slashdot UID consisting of a certain number of digits. 
While it was posted on April Fools' Day to allow for certain joke achievements, the system is real.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/faq/accounts.shtml#ac1300|title=Slashdot FAQ: What are these achievement things I keep hearing about?|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=April 29, 2009|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl]
Slashdot unveiled its newly redesigned site on June 4, 2006, following a CSS Redesign Competition. The winner of the competition was Alex Bendiken, who built on the initial CSS framework of the site. 
The new site looks similar to the old one but is more polished with more rounded curves, collapsible menus, and updated fonts.[tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=198 |title=Slashdot redesign goes live: a polished CSS  upgrade |last=MacManus |first=Richard |date=June 4, 2006 |publisher=ZDNet |accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl] On November 9 that same year, Malda wrote that Slashdot attained 16,777,215 (or 224 − 1) comments, which broke the database for three hours until the administrators fixed the issue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/articles/06/11/09/1534204.shtml|title=Slashdot Posting Bug Infuriates Haggard Admins |last=Malda|first=Rob|date=November 9, 2006|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl]

On August 25, 2011, Malda announced that he was resigning as Editor-in-Chief of Slashdot, effective immediately.

In September 2012, it was announced that Slashdot had been acquired by Dice Holdings, alongside other Geeknet websites including SourceForge and Freecode, for $20 million in cash.http://web.archive.org/web/20131208023450/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Dice-Holdings-acquires-Slashdot-and-SourceForge-1711181.html Dice, owner of job listing and career websites, stated that there were no plans for major changes to Slashdot. However, beginning October 1, 2013, the site is currently in "beta" for a new, controversial redesign that looks more like typical blog websites, with the once elaborate comment system now replaced with a simpler one at the end.[tpl]cite web|title=Come Try Out Slashdot's New Design (In Beta).|url=http://meta.slashdot.org/story/13/10/01/1849218/come-try-out-slashdots-new-design-in-beta|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl]  Many longtime users were upset with the mandatory migration to the new Beta version which adds visual complexity and removes many of the features that distinguished Slashdot from other news sites.  An organized 'Slashcott' of the site was set for the week of February 10-17, 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Slashdot creator on redesign backlash|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/02/07/slashdot-creator-on-redesign-backlash-every-slashdot-change-met-with-objections|accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl]

==Administration==

===Team===

The site is currently owned by Dice Holdings. It was run by its founder, Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda, from 1998 until 2011. He shared editorial responsibilities with several other editors including Timothy Lord, Patrick "Scuttlemonkey" McGarry, Jeff "Soulskill" Boehm, Rob "Samzenpus" Rozeboom, and Keith Dawson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/faq/slashmeta.shtml#sm100|title=Slashdot FAQ: About Slashdot: Who does this?|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=February 7, 2002|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book  | last = Johnson  | first = Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) | title = Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software  | publisher = Scribner  | year = 2001  | page = 46  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-684-86875-X[/tpl] Jonathan "cowboyneal" Pater is another popular editor of Slashdot, who came to work for Slashdot as a programmer and systems administrator. 
His online nickname (handle), CowboyNeal, is inspired by a Grateful Dead tribute to Neal Cassady in their song, "That’s It for the Other One".

===Slash and peer moderation===

The administration of the site uses the Slash source code and database, a content management system available under the GNU General Public License.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slashcode.com/about.shtml|title=Slashcode: About This Site|publisher=www.slashcode.com|accessdate=January 13, 2010[/tpl] Slashdot's editors are primarily responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories daily from submitters; they provide a one-paragraph summary for each and a link to an external site where the story originated. 
Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site's users.[tpl]cite journal|year=2004|title=Slash(dot) and Burn: Distributed Moderation in a Large Online Conversation Space|journal=Proc. of ACM Computer Human Interaction Conference|publisher=School of Information, University of Michigan|location=Vienna, Austria|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=985761&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=68238216&CFTOKEN=84840208|accessdate=February 28, 2012|author=Lampe, C.; Resnick, P.|doi=10.1145/985692.985761|isbn=1-58113-702-8|pages=543[/tpl] A user-based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive comments.[tpl]cite book|last=Pavlicek|first=Russell C.|title=Embracing insanity: open source software development.|publisher=SAMS Publishing|date=September 15, 2000|isbn=0-672-31989-6[/tpl] Every comment is initially given a score of -1 to +2, with a default score of +1 for registered users, 0 for anonymous users (Anonymous Coward), +2 for users with high "karma", or −1 for users with low "karma". 
As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up (+1) or down (−1). Moderators may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well, such as normal, offtopic, flamebait, troll, redundant, insightful, interesting, informative, funny, overrated, or underrated, with each corresponding to a -1 or +1 rating. So a comment may be seen to have a rating of "+1 insightful" or "-1 troll".
Moderation points add to a user's karma, and users with high "karma" are eligible to become moderators themselves. 
The system does not promote regular users as "moderators" and instead assigns five moderation points at a time to users based on the number of comments they have entered in the system – once a user's moderation points are used up, they can no longer moderate articles (though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date). 
Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points.[tpl]cite journal|last=Poor|first=Nathaniel|year=2005|title=Mechanisms of an Online Public Sphere: The Website Slashdot|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|publisher=Indiana University|volume=10|issue=2|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol10/issue2/poor.html|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl]
A given comment can have any integer score from -1 to +5, and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed. For instance, a user reading Slashdot at level +5 will only see the highest rated comments, while a user reading at level -1 will see a more "unfiltered, anarchic version".
A meta-moderation system was implemented on September 7, 1999,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/07/155233&mode=thread&tid=124|title=Slashdot's Meta Moderation|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=September 7, 1999|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl] to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system. 
Meta-moderators are presented with a set of moderations that they may rate as either fair or unfair. For each moderation, the meta-moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator (e.g. troll, funny), and the meta-moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated.

==Features==

Slashdot features discussion forums on a variety of technology- and science-related topics, or "News for Nerds", as its motto states. Articles are divided into the following sections:[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/faq/editorial.shtml|title=Editorial: What are the Slashdot Sections for?|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=December 1, 2004|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl]

===Tags===

Slashdot uses a system of "tags" where users can categorize a story to group them together and sorting them. Tags are written in all lowercase, with no spaces, and limited to 64 characters. For example, articles could be tagged as being about security or mozilla. Some articles are tagged with longer tags, such as whatcouldpossiblygowrong (expressing the perception of catastrophic risk), suddenoutbreakofcommonsense (used when the community feels that the subject has finally figured out something obvious), correlationnotcausation (used when scientific articles lack direct evidence; see correlation does not imply causation), or getyourasstomars (commonly seen in articles about Mars or space exploration).[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/faq/tags.shtml|title=Slashdot F.A.Q.: Tags|last=Malda|first=Rob|last2=et al.|first2=|date=April 29, 2009|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl]

==Culture==

As an online community with primarily user-generated content, many in-jokes and internet memes have developed over the course of the site's history. 
A popular meme (based on an unscientific Slashdot user poll[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1483&aid=-1|title=Best Meme in Slashdot's First 10 Years |date=October 1, 2007|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl]) is, "In Soviet Russia, noun verb you!"As an example, the phrase "You use the computer" would translate into "In Soviet Russia, the computer uses you!"

Slashdotters often use the abbreviation TFA which stands for The fucking article or RTFA (Read the fucking article), which itself is derived from the abbreviation RTFM.[tpl]cite news|author=Capn Guts|title=Meta musing, RTFA.|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/06/11/345286/-Meta-musing,-RTFA|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=Daily Kos|date=June 11, 2007[/tpl]

References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see vaporware).
Having a low Slashdot user identifier (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer.

==Traffic and publicity==

As of 2006, Slashdot had approximately 5.5 million users per month. As of January 2013, the site's Alexa rank is 2,000, with the average user spending 3 minutes and 18 seconds per day on the site and 82,665 sites linking in.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/slashdot.org |title= Slashdot.org Site Info | publisher= Alexa Internet |accessdate= 2013-02-03 [/tpl] The primary stories on the site consist of a short synopsis paragraph, a link to the original story, and a lengthy discussion section, all contributed by users. Discussion on stories can get up to 10,000 posts per day. Slashdot has been considered a pioneer in user-driven content, influencing other sites such as Google News and Wikipedia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/aug/13/observerreview.onlinesupplement|title=Websites that changed the world|last=Naughton|first=John|date=August 13, 2006|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=January 7, 2010 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Tapscott, D.; Williams, A.D.|title=Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything|publisher=The Penguin Group|location=New York City|date=2006, 2008|pages=144|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DVomiOeBg_YC&pg=PA144&dq=slashdot&cd=1#v=onepage&q=slashdot&f=false|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | isbn=978-1-59184-193-7[/tpl] 
There has been a dip in readership as of 2011, primarily due to the increase of technology-related blogs and Twitter feeds.[tpl]cite news|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Rob Malda, a.k.a.

In 2002, approximately 50% of Slashdot's traffic consisted of people who simply check out the headlines and click through, while others participate in discussion boards and take part in the community.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-938615.html|title=Newsmaker: Behind the Slashdot phenomenon|last=Lemos|first=Robert|date=June 24, 2002|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl] 
Many links in Slashdot stories caused the linked site to get swamped by heavy traffic and its server to collapse. This is known as the "Slashdot effect", a term which was first coined on February 15, 1999 that refers to an article about a "new generation of niche Web portals driving unprecedented amounts of traffic to sites of interest".[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/02/15/1249237&mode=thread&tid=124|title=Beware of the Slashdot Effect|last=Malda|first=Rob|date=February 15, 1999|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl] 
Today, most major websites can handle the surge of traffic, but the effect continues to occur on smaller or independent sites.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/185729/social_network_terms_go_mainstream.html|title=Social Network Terms Go Mainstream|last=Snol|first=Lexton|date=January 2, 2010|publisher=PC World|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl] These sites are then said to have been Slashdotted.
