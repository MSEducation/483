Freaky Creatures was a fantasy themed massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) from Abandon Interactive Entertainment with collectible action figures.http://pc.ign.com/articles/876/876936p1.html The customer would buy a starter pack with two collectible creatures and a reusable one gigabyte USB flash drive. The USB flash drive contains a code to unlock the game. In the game the player will then be able to play as the creatures they bought.

==Features and Gameplay==

Freaky Creatures features PVP creature battles, online chat, and planets to explore, and more.
Players are able to customize their creatures with extra parts, such as horns, wings, guns, swords, and tails.http://www.massively.com/2008/02/20/gdc08-abandon-interactives-freaky-creatures/ There are over 3.2 billion possible combinations of customization, and each part has a special effect on game play, such as an element effect, health bonus, opponent part de-activator, and more.
In addition to parts, the player can equip their creatures with powers to help them in battle. Certain powers are stronger and different from others and use different elements, but the creature must be at a high enough level to use a high level power.
The elements and other effects are Ice, Fire, Physical, Electric, and poison. Parts and powers also can add you the creature's HP (health), take away from the opponent's creature, change the creature's defense, and more.
The creature can also be equipped with a pet to aid it in battle. These pets can do ether attack damage on the opponent, or an effect on the creature differing with every pet. The player can choose the pet from a Puff Puff (small fuzzy rabbit-like pet), Purriz (Cat-like pet), Penga (Penguin-like pet), Warto (Frog-like pet), or an Orkal (shark-like pet)and a monket (monkey-fish like pet). The creature can only use the pet when it reaches level 11.
Once their characters are customized, they can use these creatures to fight other players in battle, fish in the lakes found in the lobbies, and more. Combat is a turn-based system that is similar to a rock/paper/scissor game. In this case it’s head/back/right arm/left arm/tail game with the option to use a power, pet attack, and/or creature special ability in each round. 
Once the battle is finished, the victor will acquire some of the powers and parts owned by the loser and Creature Credits to spend on more in the Creature Club Store found on the website (www.freakycreatures.com). The loser does not lose their powers and parts, the victor simply gains some of the same.
While not fighting, players can view their creature’s lair. At the lair, they can play with their creature, decorate the lair, raise pets, and more.http://www.ourfreakycreatures.com/
As of 2012 the website and game have been shut down.
