Home Audio Video Interoperability (HAVi) is a connection to control home audio and video hardware using FireWire. No products available.
Eight major consumer electronics manufacturers have come up with an 
open standard enabling home entertainment devices to communicate
intelligently with each other. The HAVi (Home Audio Video Interoperability) 
standard promises to bring true platform independent interoperability to 
consumer devices using high bandwidth IEEE 1394 (FireWire) as the
connecting medium. 
The manufactures, namely
Grundig, Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Sharp, Sony, Thomson and Toshiba along with now over
30 other participants, have formed a non-profit organization called HAVi (Home Audio Video
Interoperability) for promoting the development of interoperable consumer products. The goal
of HAVi organization is to provide a standard open architecture for intelligent audio and video
devices to interoperate with each other regardless of manufacturer, operating system, CPU or
programming language used for implementation (HAVi, Inc., 2001a).
The first beta version of the HAVi standard version 1.0 was published in December 1998
while the final 1.0 version was released in December 1999. The current version of the
specification is 1.1 (HAVi, Inc., 2001b) and it was published in May 15th 2001.
