  and all the finest spices.<ref>The assumption of the history of Lavender, originating from Naarda, along with the facts about the price in Roman time, are quoted widely throuout the web (over 350 entries in a google search) calling the city Naarda, Nerdus or Nardus. The [[Bible]] has many mentions of a fragrant plant called "Nerd"  and the [[Mishna]] recited daily in [[Jew]]ish prayers, refers to "Shibolet Nerd" ([[Hebrew]] for "Nard Spike") as one of the herbs used for making the holy essence at the biblical Temple. Dr. Fernie is the first known to link "Nard" with the city of Nerdus - Naarda, one of the major cities of Jewish study and origin of the [[Talmud]], during the years 150-1100 a.d. Since Naarda or Neharde'a - river of 'A - was on a canal between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers, it could never have been a Syrian city, but rather in present day [[Iraq]], somewhere in the [[Baghdad]] area. Dr Fernie refers widely to Jewish studies, probably quoted from a former botanist Robert Turner.</ref>
