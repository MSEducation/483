.</ref> and mathematically elegant way to [[optimization (mathematics)|minimise]] these differences and, hence, find a good layout for the graph. 
It is also possible to employ mechanisms that search more directly for energy minima, either instead of or in conjunction with physical simulation. Such mechanisms, which are examples of general global optimization methods, include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.
