==History==

Prior to 1869, there were five sheep runs in the Spalding area: Bundaleer, Booborowie, Canowie, Hill River and Bungaree. From this date the Spalding area was made available to farmers and a farming-centred community grew.
On 30 July 1885 the District Council of Spalding was proclaimed and in 1925 a post office was built in Spalding.
Spalding was serviced by a broad gauge railway line through the Clare Valley from Adelaide from its construction in 1922 until the last train in 1978.[tpl]cite web |title=The declining years of the Clare Railway |publisher=The Wilson Vineyard |url=http://www.wilsonvineyard.com.au/riesling_trail/18_decling_years.asp |work=Riesling Trail |accessdate=2006-10-28[/tpl] The railway bridge in Spalding was listed on the state Heritage Register in 1993.
