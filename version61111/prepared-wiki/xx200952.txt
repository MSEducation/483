The National Service Act 1948 was an Act of Parliament which extended the British conscription of World War II into peacetime, in the form of National Service. After a first version of the act had been approved in 1947, to be implemented 1 January 1949, the Cold War and the Malayan Emergency caused a revised and extended version to be approved in December 1948, only days before it came into force.[tpl]cite web|title=National Service – History|publisher=British Armed Forces and National Service|url=http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl]
The act was a modified version of the National Service Act of September, 1939, which it superseeded, and mainly aimed to address whether National Service would continue after the war. The National Service Act of September 1939 did not address this issue.
The National Service Act 1948 applied to all healthy young males who were not registered as conscientious objectors, as it did not affect neither the exemption for, nor the possibility to register as, conscientious objectors.

==Background==

In 1946, the British post-war government realised the need for an Armed Forces larger than what voluntary recruitment would provide. Discussions were soon started in parliament on a new National Service Act with a first such act being approved in July 1947. This first version was to come into force on 1 January 1949 and established the period of National Service to 12 months. However, financial crises, the advent of the Cold War and the Malayan Emergency caused the act to be amended before coming into force. The amendment was approved in December 1948, with the date in which it would come into force still being 1 January 1949.

==Differences to the previous act==

The act changed the age range from 18-41 to 17-21, and increased the period of National Service required from 6 to 18 months. As with previous acts, men who completed the service remained on the reserve list for the number of years in the age-range (4 years) which starting being counted from the moment they finished serving. However, men on the reserve list could only be called for periods of up to 20 days (previous acts allowed the period to be indefinite), and could not be called more than three times.
The act also changed the trades considered essential services to the merchant navy, farming and coal mining (previously, essential services were coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering-related trades and—to a limited extent—medicine). Young men working in the essential services were exempted from National Service for a period of eight years. If they stopped working in these industries before this period of eight years ended (that is, before turning 25), they could be called up for National Service.

==Korean War modifications of the act==

In October 1950, in response to the British involvement in the Korean War, the service period was extended to two years. To compensate the reserve period was reduced by six months.

==Ended in 1963==

National Service ended gradually from 1960. In November 1960 the last men entered service, as call-ups formally ended on 31 December 1960, and the last National Servicemen left the Armed Forces in May 1963.[tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1272 |title=What was National Service? |author=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=4 April 2013 |work=archive.iwm.org.uk[/tpl]
