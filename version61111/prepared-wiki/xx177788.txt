A historical journey to visit far-flung Jewish communities was undertaken by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela from 1165 to 1173 that crossed and tracked some of the areas that are today in the United Arab Emirates, which had also been under the control of the Persians. His trek began as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.[tpl]cite book |publisher=University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 1998 |title="Jews, Pilgrimage, and the Christian Cult of Saints: Benjamin of Tudela and His Contemporaries."

It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. On the other hand, he may have intended to catalogue the Jewish communities on the route to the Holy Land so as to provide a guide to where hospitality may have been found for Jews travelling to the Holy Land.[tpl]cite book |publisher=University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 1998 |title="Jews, Pilgrimage, and the Christian Cult of Saints: Benjamin of Tudela and His Contemporaries."

==Attitudes to Jews in recent history==

In recent years the United Arab Emirates has adopted an anti-semitic policy toward Jewish academics and authors from other countries who come to visit it. A Jewish Telegraphic Agency report in 1999 stated that: "A British university has banned Jewish authors from its courses at its campus in the United Arab Emirates. The University of Lincolnshire and Humberside has confirmed that books by Jews, as well as those that mention Jews in their bibliographies, are banned by its affiliate in the Persian Gulf state. In addition, the British Council, a state-run organization designed to promote British cultural achievements abroad, also conceded that it acquiesces in the censorship of works by Jews to accommodate "local political, religious or moral publishing laws."[tpl]cite web |publisher=highbeam.com (JTA) |title=British school bans books by Jews from its campus in the Persian Gulf |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23666718.html[/tpl]
In July 2000, the Harvard Divinity School accepted $2.5 million from the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. In 2002, the Zayed Center published a report on the Holocaust that said Zionists - not Nazis - "were the people who killed the Jews in Europe." This led to an uproar that the money be returned and that the center be closed.[tpl]cite web |work=Boston Globe  |title=Harvard Must Give Back Tainted Money |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FD5B22EB2D07DD5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/tpl] And as reported by the United States Department of State: "In August, the Government closed the Zayed Centre for Coordination and Follow-up, a think tank that published and distributed literature, sponsored lectures, and operated a website. The center published some books with anti-Zionism themes such as "The Zionist Movement and its Animosity to Jews" and "Al Buraq Wall, Not Wailing Wall." It also allowed some anti-Zionism language on its website, and hosted some speakers who promoted anti-Zionism views. According to a statement from President Zayed's office, the Government closed the center because its activities "starkly contradicted the principles of interfaith tolerance" advocated by the president." [tpl]cite web |publisher=US Dept. of State |title=United Arab Emirates: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27940.htm[/tpl] And again for 2007: "Anti-Zionism: There were some anti-Zionism or religiously intolerant editorials, op-eds and editorial cartoons in the English and Arabic-language electronic and print media. The Arabic-language press, including government subsidized and quasi-governmental newspapers such as Al-Ittihad, Al-Bayan, and Al-Khaleej, carried editorial cartoons depicting negative images of Zionists; Al-Bayan carried religiously intolerant articles as well. On May 14, 2007, for example, Al-Ittihad carried a cartoon of "the Zionist Lobby" who was depicted as a stereotypical Jew with a hooked nose and wearing a yarmulke. On August 2, 2006, Al-Bayan published an op-ed comparing "Zionism and Arabism," in which it made derogatory statements and asked, "are they (i.e. the Zionists) part of humanity?" On July 16 and 17, 2006, Al-Bayan carried editorial articles comparing Israelis to Nazis. On July 2, 2006, Al-Ittihad published a cartoon in which a stereotypically depicted Zionists was standing astride the globe, a reference to the long-standing anti-Zionism conspiracy that Zionists control the world."[tpl]cite web |publisher=US Dept. of State |title=United Arab Emirates: United Arab Emirates|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90223.htm[/tpl]

==New diplomatic openings to the US, Israel and Jews==

There have been some new openings by the United Arab Emirates as reported in the media. In an article in USA Today Arabs try outreach to Israel, U.S. Jews, 2007, it is reported that: "Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, are making some of their most public overtures ever to Israel and American Jews in an effort to undercut Iran's growing influence, contain violence in Iraq and Lebanon and push for a Palestinian solution. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have stepped up contacts with Israel and pro-Israel Jewish groups in the USA. The outreach has the Bush administration's blessing: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said six Arab States of the Persian Gulf and Egypt, Jordan and Israel are a new alignment of moderates to oppose extremists backed by Iran and Syria. She has said an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Saudi and Arab states' contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been so public. Arab countries have treated Israel as a pariah since it gained independence in 1948. Most Arab countries ban travel to Israel, investment there and other commercial ties with the Jewish state and routinely refer to it as the "Zionist entity". Among the other recent Arab-Jewish contacts: Saudi national security adviser Bandar bin Sultan met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jordan in September, said Daniel Ayalon, Israel's former ambassador to Washington. He said it was the highest-level Saudi-Israeli meeting he'd ever heard of.[tpl]cite news |publisher=USA Today |title=Arabs try outreach to Israel, U.S. Jews|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-02-11-arabs-outreach_x.htm | first=Barbara | last=Slavin | date=February 12, 2007 | accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl]
