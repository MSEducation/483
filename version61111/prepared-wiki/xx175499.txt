Water waves of different wave lengths travel with different phase speeds, a phenomenon known as frequency dispersion. For the case of infinitesimal wave amplitude, the terminology is linear frequency dispersion. The frequency dispersion characteristics of a Boussinesq-type of equation can be used to determine the range of wave lengths, for which it is a valid approximation. 
The linear frequency dispersion characteristics for the above set A of equations are:Dingemans (1997), p. 521.

The relative error in the phase speed c for set A, as compared with linear theory for water waves, is less than 4% for a relative wave number {{nowrap|kh The linear frequency dispersion characteristics of equation B are:

The original set of two partial differential equations (Boussinesq, 1872, equation 25, see set A above) does not have this shortcoming.
The shallow water equations have a relative error in the phase speed less than 4% for wave lengths λ in excess of 13 times the water depth h.

==Extensions==

There are an overwhelming number of mathematical models which are referred to as Boussinesq equations. This may easily lead to confusion, since often they are loosely referenced to as the Boussinesq equations, while in fact a variant thereof is considered. So it is more appropriate to call them Boussinesq-type equations. Strictly speaking, the Boussinesq equations is the above mentioned set B, since it is used in the analysis in the remainder of his 1872 paper.   
Some directions, into which the Boussinesq equations have been extended, are:

==Further approximations for one-way wave propagation==

While the Boussinesq equations allow for waves traveling simultaneously in opposing directions, it is often advantageous to only consider waves traveling in one direction. Under small additional assumptions, the Boussinesq equations reduce to:
Besides solitary wave solutions, the Korteweg–de Vries equation also has periodic and exact solutions, called cnoidal waves. These are approximate solutions of the Boussinesq equation.
