The French Open, often referred to as Roland Garros (officially: Les internationaux de France de Tennis, Roland Garros; also called Tournoi de Roland-Garros) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France. Named after the French aviator Roland Garros, it is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments; the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. Roland Garros is the only Grand Slam event held on clay and ends the spring clay court season.
It is one of the largest events in tennis and by far the largest clay-court tournament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/06/30/a20_16.php|title=Change Seems Essential to Escape Extinction : Wimbledon: World's Most-Loved Dinosaur|first= Christopher|last= Clarey|work=International Herald Tribune|date=30 June 2001|accessdate=20 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016123550/http://iht.com/articles/2001/06/30/a20_16.php  |archivedate = 16 October 2007[/tpl] Because of the slow-playing surface and the five-set men's singles matches without a tiebreak in the final set, the event is widely considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/26/news/preview.php| title= In a year of change at Roland Garros, the winners may stay the same |first= Christopher|last= Clarey|work=International Herald Tribune|date=26 May 2006|accessdate=8 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016123605/http://iht.com/articles/2006/05/26/news/preview.php |archivedate = 19 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://eurosport.yahoo.com/22052008/58/french-open-countdown-borg-s-view-rg.html| title= French Open – Countdown: Borg's view on RG |work=Eurosport|date=22 May 2008|accessdate=22 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.tennis.com/messageboards/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=8809&DisplayType=threaded&setCookie=1 |archivedate = 19 August 2011[/tpl]

==History==

Officially named in French Les internationaux de France de Roland-Garros or Tournoi de Roland-Garros (the "French Internationals of Roland Garros" or "Roland Garros Tournament" in English), the tournament is often referred to in English as the "French Open" and alternatively as "Roland Garros", which is the designation used by the tournament itself in all languages, including English. French spelling rules dictate that in the name of a place or event named after a person, the elements of the name are joined together with a hyphen.[tpl]cite book|title=Le Ramat typographique|last=Ramat|first=Aurel|year=1994|publisher=Éditions Charles Corlet|isbn=2854804686|page=63[/tpl] Therefore the names of the stadium and the tournament are hyphenated as Roland-Garros.
In 1891, a national tennis tournament began to be held, that was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. The first winner was a Briton—H. Briggs who was a Paris resident.  It was known as the Championnat de France, which is commonly referred to in English as the French Championships. The first women's singles tournament was held in 1897. The mixed doubles event was added in 1902 and the women's doubles in 1907. This "French club members only" tournament was played until 1924. This tournament had four venues during those years (1891-1924):
Another tournament, the World Hard Court Championships held on clay courts at Stade Français in Saint-Cloud from 1912 to 1914, then in 1920, 1921 and 1923, and at Brussels, Belgium in 1922, is sometimes considered as the precursor to the French Open as it was open to international competitors. Winners of this tournament included world no. 1's such as Tony Wilding from New Zealand (1913, 1914) and Bill Tilden from the US (1921). In 1924 there was no World Hard Court Championships due to the tennis being played at the Paris Olympic Games.
In 1925, the French Championships became open to all amateurs internationally and at the same time commenced being a major championship (designated by the ILTF). This tournament was held at the Stade Français in Saint-Cloud (site of the previous World Hardcourt Championships) in 1925 and 1927, on clay. In 1926 the Racing Club de France hosted the event in Paris, again on clay (site of the previous "French club members only" Championship). In 1928, the Roland Garros stadium was opened and the event has been held there ever since.[tpl]cite web | title= Roland Garros: a venue open all year long. Past Winners and Draws | publisher=ftt.fr | url=http://www.fft.fr/rolandgarros/default_en.asp?id=1575 | accessdate=7 August 2007[/tpl] After the Mousquetaires or Philadelphia Four (René Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet, and Jacques Brugnon) won the Davis Cup on American soil in 1927, the French decided to defend the cup in 1928 at a new tennis stadium at Porte d'Auteuil. The Stade de France had offered the tennis authorities three hectares of land with the condition that the new stadium must be named after the World War I pilot, Roland Garros.  The new Stade de Roland Garros, and its Center Court, which was named Court Philippe Chatrier in 1988, hosted that Davis Cup challenge.
From 1946 through 1947, the French Championships were held after Wimbledon, making it the third Grand Slam event of the year.
In 1968, the French Championships became the first Grand Slam tournament to go open, allowing both amateurs and professionals to compete.
Since 1981, new prizes have been presented: the Prix Orange (for the player demonstrating the best sportsmanship and cooperative attitude with the press), the Prix Citron (for the player with the strongest character and personality) and the Prix Bourgeon (for the tennis player revelation of the year).
In another novelty, since 2006 the tournament has begun on a Sunday, featuring 12 singles matches played on the three main courts.
Additionally, on the eve of the tournament's opening, the traditional Benny Berthet exhibition day takes place, where the profits go to different charity associations.
In March 2007, it was announced that the event would provide equal prize money for both men and women in all rounds for the first time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1215 | title= Roland Garros Awards Equal Pay|publisher= WTA Tour| date=16 March 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Surface characteristics==

Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared to grass courts or hard courts. For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface. For example, Pete Sampras, known for his huge serve and who won 14 Grand Slam titles, never won the French Open - his best result was reaching the semi-finals in 1996. Many players who have won multiple Grand Slam events have never won the French Open, including John McEnroe, Venus Williams, Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport. Andy Roddick, who once held the record for the second-fastest serve (249 km/hr) in the history of professional tennis and who has reached at least the semifinals of the other three Grand Slams multiple times, never reached the quarter-finals at the French Open (his best result was the fourth round in 2009).
On the other hand, players whose games are more suited to slower surfaces, such as Rafael Nadal, Björn Borg, Ivan Lendl, and Mats Wilander, and, on the women's side Justine Henin, have found great success at this tournament.  In the open era, the only male players who have won both the French Open and Wimbledon, played on faster grass courts, are Rod Laver, Jan Kodeš, Björn Borg, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

==Expansion vs. relocation==

In 2009 the  Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT) announced that it had determined that the French Open's venue had become inadequate, compared to other major tennis tournament facilities.  As a result, it had commissioned the French architect Marc Mimram (designer of the Passerelle des Deux Rives footbridge across the Rhine River in StrasbourgMimram Footbridge. Culture Routes Retrieved 18 August 2010.) to design a significant expansion of  Stade Roland Garros.  On the current property, the proposal calls for the addition of lights and a roof over Court Philippe Chatrier.  At the nearby Georges Hébert municipal recreation area, east of Roland Garros at Porte d'Auteuil, a fourth stadium will be built, with a retractable roof and 14,600 seating capacity, along with two smaller courts with seating for 1,500 and 750.The Roland Garros Stadium of the Future. Roland Garros official Web site Retrieved 17 August 2010.
In 2010, faced with opposition to the proposed expansion from factions within the Paris City Council, the FFT announced it was considering an alternate plan to move the French Open to a completely new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits.  Three sites reportedly being considered are Marne-la-Vallée (site of the Euro Disney resort), the northern Paris suburb of Gonesse near of the international airport Charles de Gaulle, and a vacant army base near Versailles.Martin, John (22 May 2010). French Officials Consider Relocation Options for the Open. New York Times Retrieved 18 August 2010.  Amid charges of bluffing and brinkmanship, a spokesman explained that Roland Garros is less than half the size of other Grand Slam venues, leaving the FFT with only two viable options: expansion of the existing facility or relocation of the event.Walker, Randy (1 June 2010). "French Open May Have to Leave Paris and 'Watch Tradition Grow".  World Tennis magazine. Retrieved 17 August 2010.
In February 2011, the decision was taken to keep the French Open at its current location near the Porte d'Auteuil. The venue will undergo major renovations by 2018. Court n°1 will be demolished, while 2 new courts will be built. In addition, a retractable roof will be installed on the Philippe Chatrier court, and the size of the venue will be expanded by 60%.

==Ball boys and ball girls==

At the 2010 French Open there were 250 "ramasseurs de balles" which in English translates literally as "gatherers of balls".  They are aged between 12 and 16 years old, and dress in matching shirts and shorts. The 250 ball boys and ball girls are chosen to take part in the French Open by an application and selection process, which in 2010 had approximately 2,500 applicants from across France.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/sports/tennis/02ballkids.html| title=Ball Kids Wake Up The French Open| date=1 June 2010|accessdate=20 April 2011|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Branch[/tpl] Upon selection the ball boys and ball girls participate in preparatory training in the weeks leading up to the French Open to ensure that they are prepared for the day they set foot on the professional tennis court in front of a global audience.
