A dagger, or obelisk, [tpl]unichar|2020|DAGGER|html=[/tpl], is a typographical symbol or glyph. The term "obelisk" derives from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ὀβελίσκος[/tpl] (obeliskos), which means "little obelus"; from [tpl]lang-grc|ὀβελός[/tpl] (obelos) meaning "roasting spit".[tpl]cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/obelus?region=us|title=obelus|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries Online|date=April 2010[/tpl] It was originally represented by the ÷ symbol and was first used by the Ancient Greek scholars as critical marks in manuscripts.
A double dagger or diesis, [tpl]unichar|2021|double DAGGER|html=[/tpl], is a variant with two handles.

==History==

The dagger symbol originated from a variant of the obelus (plural: obeli), originally depicted by a plain line (-) or a line with one or two dots (÷).[tpl]cite book|author=|title =Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary|publisher =Merriam-Webster, Inc|year =2003|page=855|isbn =978-0-87779-809-5|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&lpg=PA855&dq=obelos&pg=PA855#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] It represented an iron roasting spit, a dart, or the  sharp end of a javelin,[tpl]cite book|editor=William Harrison Ainsworth|title =The New monthly magazine|publisher =Chapman and Hall|volume=125|year =1862|page=1|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=PycaAQAAIAAJ&dq=obelos&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] symbolizing the skewering or cutting out of dubious matter.
The obelus is believed to have been invented by the Homeric scholar Zenodotus as one of a system of editorial symbols. They were used to mark questionable or corrupt words or passages in manuscripts of the Homeric epics.[tpl]cite book|author=Harold P.

While the asterisk (asteriscus) was used for corrective additions, the obelus was used for corrective deletions of invalid reconstructions.[tpl]cite book|title =A Simplified Guide to BHS|chapter= BHS Critical Apparatus|url =http://www.ericlevy.com/Revel/Cosmogony/Guide%20to%20BHS%20Critical%20Aparatus.PDF[/tpl] It was used when non-attested words are reconstructed for the sake of argument only, implying that the author did not believe such a word or word form had ever existed. Some scholars used the obelus and various other critical symbols, in conjunction with a second symbol known as the metobelos ("end of obelus"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07316a.htm|title=Hexapla|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 27, 2011[/tpl] variously represented as two vertically arranged dots, a γ-like symbol, a mallet-like symbol, or a diagonal slash (with or without one or two dots). They were used to indicate the end of a marked passage.[tpl]cite book|author=Ernst Würthwein|title =The text of the Old Testament: an introduction to the Biblia Hebraica|publisher =Wm. B.

It was used much in the same way by later scholars to mark differences between various translations or versions of the Bible and other manuscripts.[tpl]cite book|author= Daniel H. Garrison|title =The student's Catullus|year =2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|page=184|isbn =978-0-8061-3635-6|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ESLZMFuTlDYC&lpg=PA184&dq=obelus%20dagger&pg=PA184#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The early Christian Alexandrian scholar Origen (c. 184 – 253 AD) used it as a method of indicating differences between different versions of the Old Testament in his Hexapla.[tpl]cite book|author=R.

St. Jerome (c. 347 – 420) used a simple horizontal slash for an obelus, but only for passages in the Old Testament.[tpl]cite book|editor=William Smith & Henry Wace|title =A Dictionary pf Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines; During the First Eight Centuries.

Isidore of Seville (c. 560 – 636 AD) described the use of the symbol as follows: "The obelus is appended to words or phrases uselessly repeated, or else where the passage involves a false reading, so that, like the arrow, it lays low the superfluous and makes the errors disappear... The obelus accompanied by points is used when we do not know whether a passage should be suppressed or not."[tpl]cite book|author=Richard Barrie Dobson|title =Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2|publisher =Routledge|year =2000|page=1038|isbn =978-1-57958-282-1|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&lpg=PA1038&dq=obelus%20death&pg=PA1038#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Medieval scribes used the symbols extensively for critical markings of manuscripts. In addition to this, the dagger was also used in notations in early Christianity, to indicate a minor intermediate pause in the chanting of Psalms, equivalent to the quaver rest notation. It is also used to indicate a breath mark when reciting, along with the asterisk, it is thus frequently seen beside a comma.[tpl]cite book|editor= Iain Fenlon|author=Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Peter Jeffery, & Ingrid Monson|title =Early Music History: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Music|year =1994|chapter= Oral and written transmission in Ethiopian Christian chant|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=81|isbn =978-0-521-45180-2|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Xt9FzmdCdskC&lpg=PA81&dq=obelus%20dagger&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seiyaku.com/customs/crosses/obelisk.html|title=Obelisk, Obelus, Dagger|publisher=seiyaku.com|accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]
In the 16th century, the printer and scholar Robert Estienne (also known as Stephanus in Latin and Stephens in English) used it to mark differences in the words or passages between different printed versions of the Greek New Testament  (Textus Receptus).[tpl]cite book|author=David Martin (French divine)|title =A critical dissertation upon the seventh verse of the fifth chapter of St. John's First Epistle: there are three that bear record in Heaven, &c. : wherein the authentickness of this text is fully prov'd against the objections of Mr. Simon and the modern Arians|publisher =Printed for William and John Innys|chapter=Chap.

The obelus was also occasionally used as a mathematical symbol for subtraction. It was first used as a symbol for division by the Swiss mathematician Johann Rahn in his book Teutsche Algebra in 1659. This gave rise to the modern mathematical symbol ÷.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/arithme7.html|title=Math Words, pg 7|publisher=Math Words Alphabetical Index|accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]
Due to the variations as to the different uses of the different forms of obeli, there is some controversy as to which symbols can actually be considered obeli. The lemniscus (÷) and its variant, the hypolemniscus (⨪), is sometimes considered to be different from other obeli. And obeli may have referred strictly only to the horizontal slash and the dagger symbols.

==Modern usage==

The dagger is usually used to indicate a footnote, in the same way an asterisk is. The dagger is only used for a second footnote when an asterisk is already used. A third footnote employs the double dagger.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=190|author=Hoefler, Jonathan|title=House of Flying Reference Marks, or Quillon & Choil|publisher=Hoefler & Frere-Jones|date=4 June 2009|authorlink=Jonathan Hoefler[/tpl] Additional footnotes are somewhat inconsistent and represented by a variety of symbols, e.g., parallels (||) and the pilcrow (¶), some of which were nonexistent in early modern typography. Partly because of this, superscript numerals have increasingly been used in modern literature in the place of these symbols, especially when several footnotes are required. Some texts use asterisks and daggers alongside superscripts, using the former for per-page footnotes and the latter for endnotes.
The dagger is also used to indicate death, extinction, or obsolescence.[tpl]cite book|author= Eric Partridge|title =You Have a Point There: A Guide to Punctuation and Its Allies|year =2004|publisher=Routledge|page=235|isbn =978-0-203-37992-9|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=OudW3l2IoPUC&lpg=PA235&dq=obelus%20dagger&pg=PA235#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The asterisk and the dagger, when placed beside years, are used to indicate year of birth and year of death respectively. When placed immediately before or after a person's name, it indicates that the person is deceased.[tpl]cite book|author= Elizabeth Knowles|title =Oxford dictionary of phrase and fable|year =2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn =978-0-19-920246-1|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=r2KIvsLi-2kC&lpg=PT1104&dq=obelus%20dagger&pg=PT1104#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Alastair Campbell|title =The digital designer's jargon buster|year =2004|publisher=The Ilex Press Ltd|page=84|isbn =978-1-904705-35-2|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=URyQM0btTbIC&lpg=PT87&dq=obelus%20dagger&pg=PT87#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|editor=John Lennard|title =The poetry handbook: a guide to reading poetry for pleasure and practical criticism|publisher =Oxford University Press|year =2005|page=140|chapter=Punctuation|isbn =978-0-19-926538-1|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=0eRtOqjNMxEC&lpg=PA140&dq=obelus%20death&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] In this usage, it is referred to as the "death dagger".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.apsstylemanual.org/oldmanual/parts/authors.htm|title=Author Line |publisher=The APS Online Style Manual|accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] In the Oxford English Dictionary, the dagger symbol is used to indicate an obsolete word.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/public/oed3guide|title=Guide to the Third Edition of the OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]
The dagger (†) should not be confused with the Christian cross (✝, U+271D), the character "box drawings light vertical and horizontal" (┼, U+253C), or other cross symbols. The double dagger should not be confused with the alveolar click ([tpl]IPAblink|ǂ[/tpl], U+01C2), the Cross of Lorraine (☨, U+2628), or the patriarchal cross (☦, U+2626).
While daggers are freely used in English-language texts, they are often avoided in other languages because of their similarity to the Christian cross. In German, for example, daggers are commonly employed only to indicate a person's death or the extinction of a word, language, species or the like.
