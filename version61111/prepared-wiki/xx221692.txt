[[Table knife]]

CATEGORIES: Knives, Eating utensils

A table knife is an item of cutlery with a single cutting edge, part of a table setting.  Table knives are typically of moderate sharpness only, designed to cut only prepared and cooked food.  They are usually made of stainless steel and may be ornate, often having handles of bone, wood or (less commonly now) ivory. Before the invention of stainless steel ordinary steel was used. Modern table knives are commonly made of a single piece of stainless steel (example pictured below). A special type of table knife is a fish knife where the blade is pointed and made of silver plate.  
The distinguishing feature of a table knife is a blunt or rounded end.  The origin of this, and thus of the table knife itself, is attributed by tradition to Cardinal Richelieu around 1637, reputedly to cure dinner guests of the unsavoury habit of picking their teeth with their knife-points.[tpl]cite news|last=Long |first=Tony |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/05/dayintech_0513 |title=May 13, 1637: Cardinal Richelieu Makes His Point |publisher=Wired.com |date= 13 May 2008|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
Later, in 1669, King Louis XIV of France banned pointed knives in the street and at his table,
insisting on blunt tips, in order to reduce violence.[tpl]cite book|last=Patrick|first=Bethanne Kelly|title=An Uncommon History of Common Things|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-4262-0420-5 |quote=isbn13=978-1-4262-0420-3|author2=John Thompson, Henry Petroski |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bcaXzXPP8ooC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=King+Louis+XIV+banned+pointed+knives&source=bl&ots=V7-A7qxUFY&sig=834rpg_eWmZm_G-sB3HIpbgJdfI&hl=en&ei=eNmBTrvDEaGDsgKqy5jdDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=King%20Louis%20XIV%20banned%20pointed%20knives&f=false |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite journal|author=Emma Hern|author2=Will Glazebrook, Mike Beckett|title=Reducing knife crime|journal=BMJ Editorial|year=2005|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/330/7502/1221.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7502.1221[/tpl]

In any table setting, the knife will typically be the piece to bear the maker's stamp, on the blade.  The English city of Sheffield is noted for its cutlery manufacture and many knives bear the city's name in addition to the maker's.
Most table knives require a fork to stabilise foods during cutting. Rocker knives, however, do not.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IYseAAAACAAJ&dq=0553137530&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zOBSUou_NMGAqQH3y4HYAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |title=The Source Book for the Disabled: An Illustrated Guide to Easier and More Independent Living for Physically Disabled People, Their Families and Friends |year=1981 |publisher=Bantam Books |location=London |isbn=0553137530 |pages=235â€“7 |author=Pat Barr... et al.|editor=Glorya Hale |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]
