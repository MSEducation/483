Persi Warren Diaconis (born January 31, 1945) is an American mathematician and former professional magician.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/478457a[/tpl][tpl]Diaconis Graham 2011[/tpl] He is the Mary V. Sunseri Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at Stanford University.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/ |title=Stanford University - Persi Diaconis |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022704/text/persi.shtml |title=It’s no coincidence: Stanford University mathematician and statistician Persi Diaconis will serve as a Patten Lecturer at Indiana University Bloomington |work= |accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl]
He is particularly known for tackling mathematical problems involving randomness and randomization, such as coin flipping and shuffling playing cards.

==Card shuffling==

Professor Diaconis   received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1982, and  in 1992 published (with Dave Bayer) a paper entitled "Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to Its Lair"[tpl]cite doi|10.1214/aoap/1177005705[/tpl] (a term coined by magician Charles Jordan in the early 1900s) which established rigorous results on how many times a deck of playing cards must be riffle shuffled before it can be considered random according to the mathematical measure total variation distance.  Diaconis is often cited for the simplified proposition that it takes seven shuffles to randomize a deck.  More precisely, Diaconis showed that, in the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model of how likely it is that a riffle results in a particular riffle shuffle permutation, it takes 5 riffles before the total variation distance of a 52-card deck begins to drop significantly from the maximum value of 1.0, and 7 riffles before it drops below 0.5 very quickly (a threshold phenomenon), after which it is reduced by a factor of 2 every shuffle. Interestingly, when entropy is viewed as the probabilistic distance, riffle shuffling seems to take less time to mix, and the threshold phenomenon goes away (because the entropy function is subadditive.).[tpl]Cite doi|10.1098/rspa.2000.0625[/tpl]
Diaconis has coauthored several more recent papers expanding on his 1992 results and relating the problem of shuffling cards to other problems in mathematics. Among other things, they showed that the separation distance of an ordered blackjack deck (that is, aces on top, followed by 2's, followed by 3's, etc.) drops below .5 after 7 shuffles.  Separation distance is an upper bound for variation distance.[ref]

==Biography==

Diaconis left home at 14Lifelong debunker takes on arbiter of neutral choices to travel with sleight-of-hand legend Dai Vernon, and dropped out of high school, promising himself that he would return one day so that he could learn all of the math necessary to read William Feller's famous two-volume treatise on probability theory, An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications. He returned to school (City College of New York for his undergraduate work graduating in 1971 and then a Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from Harvard University in 1974), learned to read Feller, and became a mathematical probabilist.Jeffrey R.

According to Martin Gardner, at school Diaconis supported himself by playing poker on ships between New York and South America.  Gardner recalls that Diaconis had "fantastic second deal and bottom deal".Interview with Martin Gardner, Notices of the AMS, June/July 2005.
Diaconis is married to Stanford statistics professor Susan Holmes.
