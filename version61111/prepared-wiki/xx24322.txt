[[Peptic ulcer]]

CATEGORIES: Abdominal pain, Diseases of oesophagus, stomach and duodenum

A peptic ulcer is a distinct breach in the mucosal lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or the first part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcer),[tpl]cite web|title=Peptic ulcer|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000206.htm|work=Medline Plus|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=10 April 2014[/tpl] a result of caustic effects of acid and pepsin in the lumen. Histologically, peptic ulcer is identified as necrosis of the mucosa which produces lesions equal to or greater than 0.5 cm (1/5"). It is the most common ulcer of an area of the gastrointestinal tract that is usually acidic and thus extremely painful. Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common causes of peptic ulcer. Ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs.[tpl]cite web|title=Peptic ulcer|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001255/[/tpl]
Four times as many peptic ulcers arise in the duodenum—the first part of the small intestine, just beyond the stomach—as in the stomach itself. About 4% of gastric ulcers are caused by a malignant tumor, so multiple biopsies are needed to exclude cancer. Duodenal ulcers are generally benign.
The appearance of an ulcer can be either the classic erosive, concave, crater-like ulcer (the image held by most patients) or convex, perhaps resembling a colonic polyp. As a generalization, the erosive concave type tend to be located in the stomach proper while the convex type tend to be found in the pylorus/duodenum.
These convex growths have an extensive variety of shapes and forms, but in all forms the ulcer projects above the level of the surrounding tissue. For extended periods these growths characteristically lack any surface breaks in the mucosic tissue and also initially lack any visual differentiation from the surrounding tissue even in larger sizes.
The surface integrity for this type ulcer enables growth over extended periods without the pain associated with crater ulcers. This site reference,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/hans/gastrolab/e033.htm |title=Gastrolab |publisher=Kolumbus.fi |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] contains a series of convex ulcer photos. The images display a range from normal appearing growths to quite abnormal appearances. But notably, until the advanced growth stages non-crater, convex ulcers lack any surface cratering or breaks in the mucosa.
While these convex growths resemble a tumour to some extent, they are actually abnormal growths of the gastric tissue, and involve the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa layers, not a pathogenic organism. However, these growths, like crater style ulcers, may metamorph into pathogenic growths.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of a peptic ulcer can be
A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and prednisolone).
In patients over 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3 hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum.
Also, the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the patient's age. Furthermore, typical ulcers tend to heal and recur and as a result the pain may occur for few days and weeks and then wane or disappear.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive_disorders/peptic_disorders/peptic_ulcer.html |title=Peptic Ulcer |date=October 2006 |work=Home Health Handbook for Patients & Caregivers |publisher=Merck Manuals[/tpl] Usually, children and the elderly do not develop any symptoms unless complications have arisen.
Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers. This pain can be misinterpreted as hunger, indigestion or heartburn. Pain is usually caused by the ulcer but it may be aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area. The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum, it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty. Also, sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/ds00242/dsection=symptoms| title=Peptic ulcer |accessdate= 2010-06-18[/tpl] However, peptic ulcer disease symptoms may be different for every sufferer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ulcerdisease.net/| title=Ulcer Disease Facts and Myths |accessdate= 2010-06-18[/tpl]

===Complications===

==Cause==

A major causative factor (60% of gastric and up to 90% of duodenal ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/http://www.humpath.com/spip.php?article7501|title=antral mucosa - Humpath.com - Human pathology|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis), resulting in a defect in the regulation of gastrin production by that part of the stomach, and gastrin secretion can either be increased, or as in most cases, decreased, resulting in hypo- or achlorhydria. Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid can contribute to the erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation. Studies in the varying occurrence of ulcers in third world countries despite high H. pylori colonization rates suggest dietary factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.Ma LS A Tribute to Dr Frank I Tovey on his 90th Birthday World J Gastroentol 2011 August 21: 17(31) 3565–3566
Another major cause is the use of NSAIDs. The gastric mucosa protects itself from gastric acid with a layer of mucus, the secretion of which is stimulated by certain prostaglandins. NSAIDs block the function of cyclooxygenase 1 (cox-1), which is essential for the production of these prostaglandins. COX-2 selective anti-inflammatories (such as celecoxib or the since withdrawn rofecoxib) preferentially inhibit cox-2, which is less essential in the gastric mucosa, and roughly halve the risk of NSAID-related gastric ulceration.
The incidence of duodenal ulcers has dropped significantly during the last 30 years, while the incidence of gastric ulcers has shown a small increase, mainly caused by the widespread use of NSAIDs. The drop in incidence is considered to be a cohort-phenomenon independent of the progress in treatment of the disease. The cohort-phenomenon is probably explained by improved standards of living which has lowered the incidence of H. pylori infections.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Johannessen T |title=Peptic ulcer disease |journal=Pasienthandboka |url=http://www.pasienthandboka.no/default.asp?mode=document&parentid=2104&menuid=2105&documentid=26957[/tpl]
Although some studies have found correlations between smoking and ulcer formation,[tpl]Cite journal |title=A Prospective Study of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer and Its Relation to Smoking, Alcohol, and Diet |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |year=1992 |first=Ikuko |last=Kato |coauthors=Abraham M.

Treatment involved bed rest and a bland diet. Later, researchers added stomach acid to the list of causes and began treating ulcers with antacids.

(p. 1066)
Gastrinomas (Zollinger Ellison syndrome), rare gastrin-secreting tumors, also cause multiple and difficult-to-heal ulcers.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis is mainly established based on the characteristic symptoms. Stomach pain is usually the first signal of a peptic ulcer. In some cases, doctors may treat ulcers without diagnosing them with specific tests and observe whether the symptoms resolve, thus indicating that their primary diagnosis was accurate.
Confirmation of the diagnosis is made with the help of tests such as endoscopies or barium contrast x-rays. The tests are typically ordered if the symptoms do not resolve after a few weeks of treatment, or when they first appear in a person who is over age 45 or who has other symptoms such as weight loss, because stomach cancer can cause similar symptoms. Also, when severe ulcers resist treatment, particularly if a person has several ulcers or the ulcers are in unusual places, a doctor may suspect an underlying condition that causes the stomach to overproduce acid.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a form of endoscopy, also known as a gastroscopy, is carried out on patients in whom a peptic ulcer is suspected. By direct visual identification, the location and severity of an ulcer can be described. Moreover, if no ulcer is present, EGD can often provide an alternative diagnosis.
One of the reasons that blood tests are not reliable for accurate peptic ulcer diagnosis on their own is their inability to differentiate between past exposure to the bacteria and current infection. Additionally, a false negative result is possible with a blood test if the patient has recently been taking certain drugs, such as antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/DS00242/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis| title=Peptic ulcer |accessdate= 2010-06-18[/tpl]
The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori can be made by:
The breath test uses radioactive carbon atom to detect H. pylori.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/DS00242/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis| title=Tests and diagnosis |accessdate= 2010-06-18[/tpl] To perform this exam the patient will be asked to drink a tasteless liquid which contains the carbon as part of the substance that the bacteria breaks down. After an hour, the patient will be asked to blow into a bag that is sealed. If the patient is infected with H. pylori, the breath sample will contain radioactive carbon dioxide. This test provides the advantage of being able to monitor the response to treatment used to kill the bacteria.
The possibility of other causes of ulcers, notably malignancy (gastric cancer) needs to be kept in mind. This is especially true in ulcers of the greater (large) curvature of the stomach; most are also a consequence of chronic H. pylori infection.
If a peptic ulcer perforates, air will leak from the inside of the gastrointestinal tract (which always contains some air) to the peritoneal cavity (which normally never contains air). This leads to "free gas" within the peritoneal cavity. If the patient stands erect, as when having a chest X-ray, the gas will float to a position underneath the diaphragm. Therefore, gas in the peritoneal cavity, shown on an erect chest X-ray or supine lateral abdominal X-ray, is an omen of perforated peptic ulcer disease.

===Macroscopic appearance===

Gastric ulcers are most often localized on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The ulcer is a round to oval parietal defect ("hole"), 2 to 4 cm diameter, with a smooth base and perpendicular borders. These borders are not elevated or irregular in the acute form of peptic ulcer, regular but with elevated borders and inflammatory surrounding in the chronic form. In the ulcerative form of gastric cancer the borders are irregular. Surrounding mucosa may present radial folds, as a consequence of the parietal scarring.

===Microscopic appearance===

A gastric peptic ulcer is a mucosal defect which penetrates the muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, produced by acid-pepsin aggression. Ulcer margins are perpendicular and present chronic gastritis. During the active phase, the base of the ulcer shows 4 zones: inflammatory exudate, fibrinoid necrosis, granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. The fibrous base of the ulcer may contain vessels with thickened wall or with thrombosis.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/chronic-peptic-ulcer.php| title=ATLAS OF PATHOLOGY|accessdate=2007-08-26[/tpl]

===Differential diagnosis===

 
 

==Treatment==

Younger patients with ulcer-like symptoms are often treated with antacids or H2 antagonists before EGD is undertaken.
Patients who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed a prostaglandin analogue (Misoprostol) in order to help prevent peptic ulcers, which are a side-effect of the NSAIDs.
When H. pylori infection is present, the most effective treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Metronidazole) and 1 proton pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole) may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be Amoxicillin + Metronidazole + Pantoprazole (a PPI). In the absence of H. pylori, long-term higher dose PPIs are often used.
Treatment of H. pylori usually leads to clearing of infection, relief of symptoms and eventual healing of ulcers. Recurrence of infection can occur and retreatment may be required, if necessary with other antibiotics. Since the widespread use of PPI's in the 1990s, surgical procedures (like "highly selective vagotomy") for uncomplicated peptic ulcers became obsolete.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=highly selective vagotomy is still widely used|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Perforated peptic ulcer is a surgical emergency and requires surgical repair of the perforation. Most bleeding ulcers require endoscopy urgently to stop bleeding with cautery, injection, or clipping.
Ranitidine and famotidine, which are both H2 antagonists, provide relief of peptic ulcers, heartburn, indigestion and excess stomach acid and prevention of these symptoms associated with excessive consumption of food and drink. Ranitidine and famotidine are available over the counter at pharmacies, both as brand-name drugs and as generics, and work by decreasing the amount of acid the stomach produces allowing healing of ulcers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000094/| title=Ranitidine in Peptic Ulcer[/tpl]
Sucralfate (Carafate) has also been a successful treatment of peptic ulcers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marvistavet.com/html/sucralfate.html|title=Sucralfate for Peptic Ulcer[/tpl]
