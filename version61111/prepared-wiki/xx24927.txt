==Overview==

The government runs the broadcast media, which includes three national radio stations and two national television networks, as well as dozens of local radio and television stations. In 2000 there were 252 radios, 158 television sets, 219 telephone lines, and 110 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, and since then demand for access to the Internet has increased rapidly. In 1998, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (renamed the Ministry of Information & Communication Technology) began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, the Iranian telecom industry's revenues were estimated at $1.2 billion.Iran Daily - Economic Focus - 10/09/06[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.
The Fourth Five Year Economic Development Plan has proposed the following key benchmarks for 2010: 36 million fixed lines; 50% penetration rate for mobile phones; establishment of reliable rural ICT connections and 30 million internet users. Given the recent developments of the industry, the objectives are very likely to be achieved.
According to one report,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.budde.com.au/Research/Iran-Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband-and-Forecasts.html |title=Iran - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Forecasts |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Iran has seen above average growth, specially in mobile subscriber numbers. Mobile data services are available but account for a small proportion of total data consumption in 2014. Some telecom parameters of 2012 & 2014 are as below:
More than 23 million Iranians have access to the Internet and over 45 million own mobile phones (2009/10). Tech-savvy citizens use text messages to communicate with friends and browse the Internet — which the government controls in terms of access and speed — for a multiplicity of purposes. Blogging is also immensely popular.[tpl]cite web|last=Quirk |first=Patrick W. |url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6199 |title=Iran's Twitter Revolution |publisher=Fpif.org |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2012-01-23[/tpl] Iran is among 5 countries with cyber warfare capabilities according to the Defense Tech institute (US military and security institute).http://www.defensetech.org/archives/004432.html

==Press==

The press in Iran is privately owned and reflects a diversity of political and social views. A special court has authority to monitor the print media and may suspend publication or revoke the licenses of papers or journals that a jury finds guilty of publishing antireligious material, slander, or information detrimental to the national interest. Since the late 1990s the court has shut down many pro-reform newspapers and other periodicals. Most Iranian newspapers are published in Persian, but newspapers in English and other languages also exist. The most widely circulated periodicals are based in Tehrān. Popular daily and weekly newspapers include Ettelaat, Kayhan, Resalat, Iran Daily and the Tehran Times (both are English-language papers).

==Satellite==

Since the 1970s, there have been a number of proposals for a state-owned communications satellite, called Zohreh (en:Venus) from 1993 onwards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/sa/v8n3p2Shapir.html|title=Iran's Efforts to Conquer Space|author=Yiftah S. Shapir[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/iran/comm/index.html|title=Zohreh[/tpl] The planned satellite would have similar capabilities to a commercially-produced Western satellite, while such capabilities are already provided through leases owned by the Iranian telecommunications sector. Most recently, an agreement was signed between Iran and Russia in 2005 to develop the satellite with a planned launch date of 2007,[tpl]cite book |title=Iran Oil: The New Middle East Challenge to America |last=Howard |first=Roger |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=1-84511-249-0 |page=140 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=q9doOy4n6ioC&pg=PA140&dq=Zohreh+%2Bsatellite |accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl] but the launch has been postponed until at least 2009, set to follow actual construction of the satellite.[tpl]cite news |title=Iran's Zohre satellite to be launched in 2009 |url=http://www.iranian.ws/cgi-bin/iran_news/exec/view.cgi/24/19451 |work=Persian Journal |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2008-07-17 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Telephone==

Inadequate but currently being modernized and expanded with the goal of not only improving the efficiency and increasing the volume of the urban service but also bringing telephone service to several thousand villages, not presently connected.

===Domestic===

As a result of heavy investing in the telephone system since 1994, thousands of mobile cellular subscribers are being served; moreover, the technical level of the system has been raised by the installation of thousands of digital switches.
Iran’s telecommunication network enjoys the highest growth rate in the Middle East. One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989–1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994–1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Iran's telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from "voice" mobile-phone and 1/10 from "data" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business. As of 2010, Iran had about 66 million mobile-phone subscribers covering about 70% of the population. In contrast, about 36% of Iranians had fixed-line phones.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204644504576651503577823210.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Steve | last=Stecklow | title=Chinese Tech Giant Aids Iran | date=2011-10-27[/tpl]

==Internet==

In 1993 Iran became the second country in the Middle East to be connected to the Internet, and since then the government has made significant efforts to improve the nation's ICT infrastructure. Iran's national Internet connectivity infrastructure is based on two major networks: the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the public data network. The PSTN provides a connection for end-users to Internet service providers (ISPs) over mostly digital lines and supports modem-based connections. The Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI), a subsidiary of TCI, operates the public data network. Iran's external Internet links use the basic Internet protocol of TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol) via satellite exclusively. For data lines, copper, fibre, satellite and microwave are the available media, and popular services are high-speed Internet via digital subscriber lines (DSL), high-bandwidth lease lines and satellite. About 33 Iranian cities are connected directly by the Trans-Asia-Europe cable network, or "silk road", connecting China to Europe.

==="National internet"===

Since 2005, Iran has been developing a "national Internet" to improve control over its content as well as speed. The project, which is separate from the world wide web, will be completed by 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1189.html |title=Tehran's Unplugged Internet Plan |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23[/tpl] This network will be separated from the rest of the internet, specifically for domestic use. Creating such a network, similar to one used by North Korea, would prevent unwanted information from outside of Iran getting into the closed system. Myanmar and Cuba also use similar systems.Christopher Rhoads and Farnaz Fassihi, May 28, 2011, Iran Vows to Unplug Internet, Wall Street Journal Iran has announced that all government ministries and state bodies will go offline from September 2012.http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/07/iran-offline
The current internet services will not be replaced by the National Information Network or '"National Internet" or "Clean Internet" as it is called. In order to protect the privacy of Iranian internet users, a number of non-governmental organizations are currently developing domestic search engines that people can use through the National Information Network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/12/jan/1188.html |title=Iranians to remain connected to World Wide Web |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23[/tpl]
Iranian officials have accused U.S.-based technology companies such as Google, Twitter and Microsoft of working in tandem with U.S. authorities to spy on Iranian online trends, search behavior, social networking sites and e-mail. These companies have denied those allegations.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-increasingly-controls-its-internet/2012/02/07/gIQAxTya1Q_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Thomas | last=Erdbrink | title=Iran increasingly controls its Internet | date=2012-02-09[/tpl] As of 2013, 90% of all of Internet traffic is being routed to hosts outside the country.

====Infrastructure====

Iran has developed (or is in the process of developing) IT/technology parks, infrastructures for local emails, instant messaging (IM), domestic search engines, auction website, e-commerce, e-government, distance education, social medias, a domestic version of the Linux Operating System called "Sharif Linux", bespoke or open source software for web browsing, word processing, spreadsheet and database; accounting and various business/financial and industrial software, security software and video games.[ref]

Iran is also manufacturing key computer, internet and IT components, including a local data center, microprocessors, supercomputers, routers, computer monitors, printers, mobile phones, fiber optics and lasers.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-01/iran-to-start-first-phase-of-domestic-internet-by-may-fars-says.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Ladane | last=Nasseri | title=Iran to Start First Phase of Domestic Internet by May, Fars Says | date=2012-04-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/feb/1248.html |title=Iran unveils indigenous supercomputers |publisher=Payvand.com |accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]http://web.ut.ac.ir/routerlabhttp://wayback.archive.org/web/20090201000000*/http://www.austrade.gov.au/ICT-to-Iran/default.aspxhttp://www.iran-daily.com/1390/2/11/MainPaper/3955/Page/4/Index.htm#http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=118164&sectionid=3510208

===ISPs===

The leading Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI) which belongs to Telecommunication Company of Iran (now privatized) and the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST) are two bodies that act as ISPs. As of 2008, the largest privately owned ISP was Parsnet, which serves only Tehran. The leading ISP with a provincial focus is Isfahan-based Irangate.net. The Neda Rayaneh Institute (NRI) was the first private ISP in Iran.
Domain names with the ".ir" suffix are assigned by the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics (IPM). DCI maintains the network infrastructure, providing Internet access via the IRANPAK X.25 packet-switching network, which covers most major cities. DCI is the only ISP with a permit for supplying government agencies. DCI supplies both dial-up and leased lines to its users.
By the regulations of Iran, these ISPs should rely on the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) for their bandwidth. Previously serviced by TCI’s Public Switch Telephone Network, the ISPs have recently been provided with modern data line capacity through a national IP-based network. With the completion of this new network, Internet services in Iran is expected to improve dramatically.http://www.austrade.gov.au/ICT-to-Iran/default.aspx

====Download speed====

Iranian internet has an average speed of two megabytes per second, about one-tenth of the global average (2014). Hong Kong, the world leader, boasts an average of 72 mbps; the United States ranks 31st, at about 21 mbps.http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/internet-improvements-in-store-for-iran/2014/02/13/b3d730fe-8ea4-11e3-878e-d76656564a01_story.html

====Broadband Internet access====

As of 2012, 11 private access providers (PAPs) and TCI compete for market share, offering ADSL2+, WiMAX, and other fixed wireless broadband services.[ref]
