It is reported that she struggled with a learning disability, but nevertheless graduated from St. Paul Academy and Summit School.  Bancroft was a camper and staff member at YMCA Camp Widjiwagan.  Bancroft became a wilderness instructor and a gym teacher in Minneapolis (at Clara Barton Open School) and St. Paul.
She gave up her teaching post in 1986 in order to participate with the
"Will Steger International North Pole Expedition". She arrived at the North Pole together with five other team members after 56 days using dogsleds. This made Bancroft the first woman to reach the North Pole on foot and by sled.
She was also the first woman to cross both polar ice caps to reach the North and South Poles, as well as the first woman to ski across Greenland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://klobuchar.senate.gov/newsreleases_detail.cfm?id=278587& |title=Senator Amy Klobuchar |publisher=Klobuchar.senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl] In 1993 Bancroft led a four-woman expedition to the South Pole on skis; this expedition was the first all-female expedition to cross the ice to the South Pole.[tpl]cite web|url=http://keynotespeakers.com/speaker_detail.php?speakerid=3214 |title=Ann Bancroft - Speaker Profile |publisher=Keynotespeakers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl] In 2001, Ann and Norwegian adventurer Liv Arnesen became the first women to ski across Antarctica.

In March 2007, Bancroft and Arnesen were taking part in a trek across the Arctic Ocean to draw attention to the problem of global warming. However, according to The Washington Post, the expedition was called off "after Arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes, and extreme cold temperatures drained the batteries in some of their electronic equipment."[tpl]citation |title=Frostbite Ends Bancroft-Arnesen Trek |first=Patrick |last=Condon |periodical=The Washington Post |date=2007-03-12 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/12/AR2007031200997.html |accessdate=2007-09-04[/tpl]
