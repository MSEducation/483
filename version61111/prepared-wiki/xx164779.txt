Nick the Knife is a 1982 album by Nick Lowe. The album was Lowe's third solo LP, and his first since the 1981 breakup of his band Rockpile. However, the record still has several Rockpile ties, as Lowe's former bandmates Billy Bremner and Terry Williams play on the album. In addition, Lowe does a slowed-down remake of the Rockpile song "Heart"; the original version can be found on the band's album Seconds of Pleasure sung by Bremner.
Nick the Knife reached #50 on the Billboard 200, and #99 on the UK album charts. No singles from the album made the US or UK charts, although in Canada "Stick It Where The Sun Don't Shine" hit the top 40.
Nick the Knife is notable for being one of only two Nick Lowe solo albums with no covers, as it is composed entirely of songs written or co-written by Lowe (the other album is 1990's Party of One).
The album is currently out of print.
