Ron Richards (11 May 1928 â€“ 20 September 2013) was an Australian rules footballer, who played in the Victorian Football League, (VFL).
Recruited, like his brother Lou, from Collingwood Technical School, Ron Richards enjoyed a productive VFL career with Collingwood. 
He starred on a wing in the 1953 Grand Final defeat of Geelong, but he could also rove, was dangerous near goal, and was a fierce tackler in the backlines.
Richards died following a long illness in 2013, aged 85.[tpl]cite web|title=Vale Ron Richards|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2013-09-20/vale-ron-richards|publisher=Collingwood Football Club|accessdate=20 September 2013[/tpl]
