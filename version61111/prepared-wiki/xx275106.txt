===Tiger Bay Warriors (1993 to 2000)===

The club was formed in 1993 as the Tiger Bay Warriors, and started out as a Junior Flag team.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/Tiger%20Bay%20Warriors.htm | title=Teams: Tiger Bay Warriors | publisher=Britball Now | accessdate=2008-03-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080610051659/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball+Teams/Tiger+Bay+Warriors.htm  |archivedate = 2008-06-10[/tpl] They were accepted into Junior Division Two Touch and recorded a 4-0-0 record in the regular season (including one postponed game against the Gloucester Gladiators which was awarded to the Warriors) before narrowly losing the bowl game 6–8 to the London Capitals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Results/1993results.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1993 Season | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-02-27[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1993TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1993 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-02-27[/tpl]
The following two years, the Warriors played at Youth Kitted level. In 1994 season they won the BYAFA South East Division with a perfect 8-0 record and reached the playoff semi-final.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1994TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1994 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl] In 1995, they recorded a 2-3 season in the Southern Division but still managed to reach the playoffs, losing 0–8 to the London Capitals in their quarter-final.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1995TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1995 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl]
The decision was then taken to move up to senior level, and the Warriors were admitted to the Southwest Conference of the British Senior League's third division. Their experience in their previous youth tournaments seemed to serve them well as their first season at this level saw them post an 8-2 record, finishing second in their conference. They went on the reach the playoff semi-final before losing to the eventual divisional champions, the Winchester Rifles.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1996TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1996 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2007-04-13 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl] They reached the play-offs once again in 1997 after finishing second in their conference, only to be forced to withdraw from their playoff match against the PA Knights due to an acute player shortage.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1997TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1997 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl] 
As with the year before, the Warriors finished the 1998 regular season in second place, tied with the Southern Sundevils with a 7-1 record but with an inferior points difference. As a result they lost home advantage for their playoff match and this proved crucial as they went down by a single point to the London Mets.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1998TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1998 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl] The following year, they once again finished the regular season with a 7-1 record tied with the Hertfordshire Stags and the Sabres, but they avoided last season's disappointment by finishing top on points difference. This paid off as they made it all the way to the divisional play-off final before losing a tight final game against the Chester Romans by just two points.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/1999TABLES.xls | format=XLS | title=BAFL 1999 League Standings | publisher=Britball Now | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-03-13[/tpl]
Unfortunately the Warriors were unable to build on this success. After losing several key players and the services of Head Coach Rob Mota, they were forced to withdraw from the league in 2000[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/Tiger%20Bay%20Warriors.htm | title=Teams: Tiger Bay Warriors | publisher=Britball Now | accessdate=2008-03-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080610051659/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball+Teams/Tiger+Bay+Warriors.htm  |archivedate = 2008-06-10[/tpl] and subsequently the team disbanded.
