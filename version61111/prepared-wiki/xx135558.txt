Sneed, a clergyman and mason, settled in an area by the Athabasca River. For the first few years it was difficult for them. They had to cut out an area for planting crops and building houses. The climate is not what they were used to since they came from areas like Oklahoma which had milder winters. The settlers were tough as was their surrounding and three quarters of them stayed.
They built a school house in 1913 and a nondenominational church in 1914. They had a baseball team that was widely known in the north. Amber Valley was the largest community of black people in Alberta until the 1930s.
The community was the subject of the 1984 documentary film We Remember Amber Valley, directed by Selwyn Jacob.[tpl]cite web|url=http://megadiversities.com/entrevues/156-exclusive-interview-with-selwyn-jacob-the-producer-of-the-documentary-on-harry-jerome-.html|title=Exclusive interview with Selwyn Jacob: The Producer of the documentary on Harry Jerome|last=Turner|first=Patricia|date=27 December 2011|work=Mega Diversities|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl]
