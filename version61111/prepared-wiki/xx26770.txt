==History==

Newark was originally founded in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony. The city saw tremendous industrial and population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots.  The city has experienced revitalization during the 1990s and early 21st century.Riche, Patrick. "Newark's Prudential Center: A Key Player in Newark's Re-Branding Efforts", Forbes, January 10, 2012. Accessed June 25, 2012. "Newark is currently undergoing a major revitalization.  The Prudential Center, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, The Newark Symphony, Riverfront Stadium and Red Bull Park in nearby Harrison and home to Major League Soccer’s New York Red Bulls represent just part of the nearly $2 billion in construction underway."
Newark was originally formed as a township on October 31, 1693, based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a Royal charter on April 27, 1713, and was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township, changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark's Vailsburg.Snyder, John P.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 26.107 square miles (67.617 km2), of which, 24.187 square miles (62.644 km2) of it is land and 1.920 square miles (4.973 km2) of it (7.35%) is water.[tpl]GR|1|dateform=mdy[/tpl] It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida.Population, Housing Units, Area, and Density: 2010 - United States - Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area, in Principal City, Not in Principal City, and County; and for Puerto Rico. United States Census Bureau American Fact Finder. Accessed June 4, 2012. The city's altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately [tpl]convert|230|ft|m|adj=j[/tpl] above sea level in the western section of the city.The Official Website of the City of Newark, NJ. 2005. Accessed May 28, 2012. Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River, with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark's high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.A View of Mt. Prospect, NewarkHistory.com. Accessed June 25, 2012. "Of the upper class districts of Old Newark - High Street, Lincoln Park, Weequahic and Forest Hill - Forest Hill is the most famous and best preserved."
Until the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was able to reclaim [tpl]convert|68|acres|0|adj=j[/tpl] of the marshland for the further expansion of Newark Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.Sturken, Barbara. "Newark Airport Gains In International Travel", The New York Times, February 11, 1990. Accessed June 25, 2012. "The oldest airport in the New York metropolitan region, Newark opened in 1928 on [tpl]convert|68|acres|0|adj=j[/tpl] of reclaimed swampland. It underwent a major overhaul in 1973, when an immense $400 million complex opened to replace an outmoded 20-year-old terminal."
Newark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey's Gateway Region, which is said to have received its name from Newark's nickname as the "Gateway City".Erminio, Vinessa. "Gateway? Renaissance? A reviving city earns its nicknames", The Star-Ledger, December 8, 2005. Accessed June 25, 2012. "Newark also was known as the Gateway City about 1960. This may have been because of a statewide tourism campaign in which regions of the state were designated with names. Newark, Jersey City and the surrounding communities were called Gateway."

===Neighborhoods===

Newark is New Jersey's largest and second-most racially diverse city (after neighboring Jersey City). It is divided into five political wards,[tpl]cite web |title = Newark City Ward Boundaries (2000)|work = | publisher = Rutgers University |year = 2000 |url = http://policy.rutgers.edu/cupr/rcopc/data_atlas/6.pdf |accessdate = February 25, 2012[/tpl] which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.Living Here: Neighborhoods, Brick City Development Corporation for Newark, NJ. Accessed June 25, 2012. "The city is divided into five wards, each with distinct neighborhoods. Residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central and West Wards, while industry is concentrated largely in the East and South Wards near the airport and seaport.... East Ward. The most densely populated section of Newark, the East Ward, is home of one of the largest Portuguese-speaking communities in the country."
State law requires that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk.Reock, Ernest C., Jr. [tpl]Wayback |date=20110813100521 |url=http://cgs.rutgers.edu/resource-center/resourcecenter-1/documents/redistricting_nj_after_2010.pdf#page=12 |title="Redistricting New Jersey After the Census of 2010" [/tpl], Rutgers University Center for Government Studies, March 2008, pp. 7-9, backed up by the Internet Archive as of August 13, 2011. Accessed August 6, 2013. "The law requires that wards be formed of compact and contiguous territory. The most precise requirement is that the population of the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest ward by more than 10% of the mean average population of the wards." Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.Staff. "'Obvious gerrymander,' Scrimmage says of plans", Afro-American (newspaper), April 12, 1969. Accessed June 25, 2012.Hernandez, Roger. "Hispanics Deserve a Slice of the Pie", Rocky Mountain News, May 31, 1991. Accessed June 25, 2012.

"Voting Boundaries Awaited in Essex", The New York Times, November 27, 1977. Accessed June 25, 2012.
Newark's Central Ward, formerly known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's original history including the Lincoln Park, Military Park and the James Street Commons Historic Districts. The Ward contains the University Heights, The Coast/Lincoln Park, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue Neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the subject of the 1968 novel Howard Street by Nathan Heard, is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue.
In the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other white Catholic and Christian groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by Blacks. The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the largest health sciences university in the nation, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. It is also home to three other universities – New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University - Newark, and Essex County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.newark.nj.us/residents/neighborhood_services/central_ward.php |title=City of Newark, NJ - Central Ward |publisher=City of Newark |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]

A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse.
The West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg, Ivy Hill, West Side, Fairmount and Lower Roseville. It is home to the historic Fairmount Cemetery. The West Ward, once a predominately Irish-American, Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed primarily of Latinos, African Americans, Caribbean Americans, and Haitians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.newark.nj.us/residents/neighborhood_services/west_ward.php |title=City of Newark, NJ - West Ward |publisher=City of Newark |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl] The West Ward has struggled in recent years with elevated rates of crime, particularly violent crime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/fatal_shooting_of_pizza_chef_i.html |title=Fatal shooting of West Ward pizza chef is latest 'tragic and senseless' Newark slaying |author=Strunsky, Steve |work=The Star-Ledger |publisher=NJ.com |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl]
The South Ward comprises the Weequahic, Clinton Hill, Dayton, and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home to residents of predominately Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics. The South Ward is represented by Council Member Ras Baraka. The city’s second-largest hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, can be found in the South Ward, as can 17 public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, one police precinct, a mini precinct, and three fire houses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ci.newark.nj.us/residents/neighborhood_services/south_ward.php |title=South Ward |author= |work= |publisher=City of Newark, NJ |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl]
The East Ward consists of much of Newark's Downtown commercial district, as well as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark's industry was located in the 19th century. Today, due to the enterprise of its immigrant population, the Ironbound (also known as "Down Neck" and "The Neck")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/ewrnr-renaissance-newark-airport-hotel/ironbound/209022/home-page.mi |title=Ironbound |publisher=Marriot |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] is a destination for shopping, dining, and nightlife.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.goironbound.com/portal/ |title=Home Page |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Ironbound Business Improvement District |accessdate=June 28, 2012[/tpl] A historically immigrant-dominated section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed "Little Portugal" due to its heavily Portuguese population, which is one of the largest Portuguese speaking communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become home to Brazilians, Latin Americans, African Americans, and commuters to Manhattan. Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and six elementary schools.

===Political corruption===

Newark has been marred with episodes of political corruption throughout the years. Five of the previous seven Mayors of Newark have been indicted on criminal charges, including the previous three Mayors: Hugh Addonizio, Kenneth Gibson, and Sharpe James. As reported by Newsweek: "... every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for crimes committed while in office".[tpl]cite web|author=Andrew Romano |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/03/10/the-swamps-of-jersey.html |title=The Swamps of Jersey - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]
Addonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and WWII veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, who, ironically, he characterized as corrupt and a part of the political machine of the era. During the 1967 riots, it was found that Addonizio and other city officials were taking kickbacks from city contractors. He was convicted of extortion and conspiracy in 1970, and was sentenced to ten years in federal prison.[tpl]cite news|author=Josh Barbanel |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/02/obituaries/hugh-j-addonizio-67-ex-mayor-of-newark-jailed-5-years-dead.html |title=HUGH J.

His successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges. During his tenure as Mayor in 1980, he was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.[tpl]cite web|author=Wally Edge| authorlink = Wally Edge |url=http://www.politicsnj.com/newark-tradition-10260 |title=The Newark Tradition | Politicker NJ |publisher=Politicsnj.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]
Sharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010 for good behavior.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin, John |url=http://blog.nj.com/ledgerarchives/2008/07/judge_prosecutors_clash_over_j.html |title=Judge, prosecutors clash over James' 27-month jail term |work=The Star-Ledger |publisher=NJ.com |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl]

==Local media==

Newark does not have any major television network affiliates due to its proximity to New York City. WNET, a flagship station of the Public Broadcasting Service, and Spanish-language WFUT-TV, a TeleFutura owned-and-operated station, are licensed to Newark. The state's leading newspaper, The Star-Ledger, owned by Advance Publications, is based in Newark. Radio Station WJZ (now WABC (AM)) made its first broadcast in 1921 from the Westinghouse plant near Lackawanna Station. It moved to New York City in the 1920s. Pioneer radio station WOR AM was originally licensed to and broadcast from the Bamberger's Department Store in Newark. Radio Station WNEW-AM (now WBBR) was founded in Newark in 1934. It later moved to New York City. In addition, WBGO, a National Public Radio affiliate that reaches New York City with a format of standard and contemporary jazz, is at 54 Park Place in downtown Newark. WNSW AM-1430 (formerly WNJR) and WQXR (which was formerly WHBI and later WCAA) 105.9 FM are also licensed to Newark.Newark, NJ Radio Stations, radio-locator.com. Accessed June 26, 2012.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Early history====

The Morris Canal, stretching [tpl]convert|102|miles|adj=j[/tpl] to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York City area.Solarino, Audrey. "The history of the Morris Canal", Suburban Trends, May 20, 2010. Accessed June 28, 2012. The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. As the city came to be more and more congested, further means of transportation were sought; eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys which eventually became electric trolleys that ran down the main streets of downtown Newark including Broad Street and up Market Street near the courthouse. The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.Drummond, James O. Transportation and the Shaping of the Physical Environment In an Urban Place: Newark, New York University dissertation. The Morris Canal also saw its days come to an end, only to be more recently used by the Newark City Subway, now known as the Newark Light Rail. Even today, many of the subway stations still portray the Canal in its original state in the form of mosaic works.

====Present day====

Newark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and the northeastern United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/works/njchoices/pdf/newark.pdf | title=New Jersey’s Long-Range Transportation Plan | format=PDF | accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl] Newark Liberty International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the New York region and the 14th-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic),Enplanements at Primary Airports (Rank Order) CY10, Federal Aviation Administration, October 26, 2011.

Accessed April 11, 2012. Newark Airport was the New York City area's first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on land reclaimed by the Port Authority. Just east of the airport lies Port Newark, the fifteenth-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the East Coast of the United States. In 2003, the port moved over $100 billion in goods.Lipton, Eric. "New York Port Hums Again, With Asian Trade", The New York Times, November 22, 2004. Accessed June 26, 2012. "Last year, $100 billion worth of wares moved through the port, up 12 percent in just a year."
Newark is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 280, Interstate 78, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, and Route 21. Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers., which was first constructed in 1938 and will be undergoing a $900 million renovation project.McGeehan, Patrick. "Commuters Feel Pinch as Christie Tightens", The New York Times, May 16, 2011. Accessed June 26, 2012. "Without the Port Authority money, Mr. Simpson said, New Jersey would have to spend about $30 million a year just to keep the Pulaski Skyway — a 70-year-old bridge that serves as a link between Newark Liberty International Airport and the Holland Tunnel — from falling down. Now, it will invest about $900 million over five years to 'basically rebuild the whole bridge.'"
Local streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.On Broadway, NewarkHistory.org. Accessed June 26, 2012.  "Newark's Broadway was called Belleville Avenue in the Nineteenth Century. Like Springfield Avenue, Bloomfield Avenue, and South Orange Avenue, Broadway is one of Newark's great radial streets. The name of the street, for reasons unknown to me, was changed from Belleville Ave to Broadway in the early Twentieth century."
Newark is second in the U.S. to New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile,[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] and is extensively served by mass transit. Newark Penn Station, situated just east of downtown, is the city's major train station, connecting the interurban PATH system (which links Newark to Manhattan) with three New Jersey Transit commuter rail lines and Amtrak service to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. Only one mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in the bed of the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.Greater Newark Bus System Study, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority. Accessed June 26, 2012. "Approximately 50 of these bus routes, operated by NJ TRANSIT and Coach USA, converge in the City of Newark, making it a critical hub for people transfering between buses, as well as between bus and rail."
Newark is served by New Jersey Transit bus routes 1, 5, 11, 13, 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 99, 107, and 108.
