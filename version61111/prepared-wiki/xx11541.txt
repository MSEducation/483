Since 2010, the Vermont Department of Health has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct blood serum surveys of the state's deer and moose populations. Tests  for eastern equine encephalitis virus antibodies were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont's counties. In 2012, 12% of deer and 2.4% of moose tested positive.

===Flora===

Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by Northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak.[tpl]cite journal |author = Olson, D. M, E.

Many of Vermont's rivers, including the Winooski River, have been subjected to man-made barriers to prevent flooding.
Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry. Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, pear thrips, and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, in effect forcing the sugar maples to "migrate" north to Canada.[tpl]Cite news | first=Keith | last=Winston | title=Wildlife habitats shift as winters grow warmer | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20111129/COLUMNISTS01/311290015/Keith-Winsten-Wildlife-habitats-shift-winters-grow-warmer| work= | newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 7B | date=November 29, 2011 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-Columbian===

Between 8500 and 7000 BCE, at the time of the Champlain Sea, Native Americans inhabited and hunted in Vermont. During the Archaic period, from the 8th millennium BCE to 1000 BCE, Native Americans migrated year-round. During the Woodland period, from 1000 BCE to CE 1600, villages and trade networks were established, and ceramic and bow and arrow technology was developed. In the western part of the state there lived a small population of Algonquian-speaking tribes, including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples. Sometime between 1500 and 1600, the Iroquois, based in present-day New York, drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont, later using the area as a hunting ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki. The population in 1500 was estimated to be around 10,000 people.

===Colonial===

The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been Jacques Cartier in 1535. On July 30, 1609 French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed Vermont as part of New France. In 1666, French settlers erected Fort Lamotte, the  first European settlement in Vermont.
In 1638, a "violent" earthquake was felt throughout New England, centered in the St. Lawrence Valley. This was the first seismic event noted in Vermont.
In 1690, a group of Dutch-British settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney Point [tpl]convert|8|mi[/tpl] west of present-day Addison.
During Dummer's War, the first permanent British settlement was established in 1724, with the construction of Fort Dummer. It was to protect the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro.
From 1731 to 1734, the French constructed Fort St. Frédéric, which gave the French control of the New France/Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley.  With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and English, French began construction of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York in 1755.  The British failed to take Fort St. Frédéric or Fort Carillon between 1755 and 1758. In 1759, a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon, after which the French abandoned Fort St. Frédéric.  Amherst constructed Fort Crown Point next to the remains of the Fort St. Frédéric, securing British control over the area.
Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the 1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British. Colonial settlement was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians, in order to try to end encroachment on Native American lands. The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=this has long been missing a citation in the History article as well|date=July 2011[/tpl] With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.
On March 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts, and south of 45 degrees north latitude. In 1770, Ethan Allen, his brothers Ira and Levi, and Seth Warner, recruited an informal militia known as the Green Mountain Boys to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against newcomers from New York.
When New York refused to recognize the land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants (towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth), dissatisfied New Hampshire settlers organized in opposition. This led to their proclaiming an independent Vermont on January 15, 1777, during the American Revolutionary War.Slade, William, Jr., Compiler.

===Independence and statehood===

On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont.[tpl]cite web|title=Second Vermont Republic|work=Vermont's Declaration of Independence (1777)|url=http://www.vermontrepublic.org/vermonts_declaration_of_independence_1777|accessdate=January 17, 2007[/tpl] For the first six months of its existence, it was called The Republic of New Connecticut.Esther Munroe Swift, Vermont Place-Names: Footprints in History Picton Press, 1977
On June 2, 1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met to adopt the name "Vermont." This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian who wrote to them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States as the 14th state. On July 4, the Constitution of Vermont was drafted at the Windsor Tavern; it was adopted by the delegates on July 8. This was among the first written constitutions in North America to partially ban slavery, provide for universal adult male suffrage, and require support of public schools. It was in effect from 1777 to 1791.The Old Constitution House State Historic Site, Historic Vermont Slavery was fully banned by state law on November 25, 1858, less than three years before the American Civil War.Barton Chronicle book review[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl].

===Revolutionary War===

The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States. A combined American force, under General Stark's command, attacked the British column at Hoosick, New York, just across the border from Bennington. It killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment. General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at Saratoga, New York, on October 17 that year.
The battles of Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday.
The Battle of Hubbardton (July 7, 1777) was the only Revolutionary battle in present day Vermont. Although the Continental forces were technically defeated, the British forces were damaged to the point that they did not pursue the Americans (retreating from Fort Ticonderoga) any further.

===Statehood and the antebellum era===

Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for 14 years. The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788[tpl]Citation | first = Margaret | last = Bucholt | url = http://www.manchestervermont.net/about.php | contribution = Manchester and the Mountains Chamber of Commerce | title = An Insider's Guide to Southern Vermont | publisher = Penguin | year = 1991[/tpl] and operated a statewide postal service. Thomas Chittenden was the Governor in 1778–89 and in 1790–91. The state was obliged to solve conflicting property ownership disputes with New Yorkers. On March 4, 1791, Vermont joined the federal union as the 14th state, and the first to enter the Union after the original 13 colonies. Vermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836.
From the mid-1850s on, Vermonters became activists in terms of opposing slavery, which they had previously worked to contain in the South. Abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens developed as a national leader and later promoted Radical Republican goals after the American Civil War. While the Whig Party shriveled, and the Republican Party emerged, Vermont supported Republican candidates.  In 1860 it voted for Abraham Lincoln for US President, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===The Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Vermont sent more than 34,000 men into United States service. Almost 5,200 Vermonters, 15 percent, were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease, a higher percentage than any other state.
The northernmost land action of the war, the St. Albans Raid, took place in Vermont.

===Postbellum era to present===

====Demographic changes====

Beginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont attracted numerous Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly English and French-Canadian ancestry. Many migrated to Barre, where the men worked as stonecutters of granite, for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states. Many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century to support their families. Such facilities helped absorb new residents, who peaked between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.Susan Richards, "Making Home Pay: Italian and Scottish Boardinghouse Keepers in Barre, 1880–1910", Vermont History Journal, 2005, accessed October 23, 2013

====Natural disasters====

The state has suffered some natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, extensive rain and flooding. Large-scale flooding occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 84 people died, including the state's lieutenant-governor.[tpl]cite web|author=btv webmaster |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/27flood.shtml |title=National Weather Service – Burlington, VT – The Flood of 1927 |publisher=Erh.noaa.gov |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]

Another flood occurred in 1973, causing the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.
The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by Tropical Storm Irene. Heavy rains caused flooding in many towns built in narrow river valleys. The governor described it as one of the worst natural disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries, second only to the flood of 1927.[tpl]Cite news | first=Nancy | last=Remsen | title=Obama declares disaster in Vermont, federal aid on way | url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110901/NEWS02/110901027/Shumlin-asks-Obama-declare-Vermont-major-disaster-area?odyssey=nav%7Chead| work= | newspaper=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1A | date=September 2, 2011 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl]

====Political changes====

Vermont approved women's suffrage decades before it became part of the national constitution. Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.
In 1964, the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. Sims required "one-man, one-vote" redistricting in all states; this resulted in major changes in Vermont. This ruling required city residents to be given an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years.[tpl]cite web|title="One Man, One Vote" ...

This arrangement had meant that urban issues were not considered in proportion to the number of people affected by them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
In July 2000 Vermont was the first state to introduce civil unions. In 2009 the Vermont became the first state to legislate same-sex marriage, unforced by court challenge or ruling.[tpl]Cite news|title=Vermont Legislature Makes Same-Sex Marriage Legal|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 7, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/us/08vermont.html | first=Abby | last=Goodnough | accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl]

According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2013, Vermont has an estimated population of 626,630, which is an increase of 889, or 0.14% percent, from the prior year and an increase of 889, or 0.14% percent, since 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 7,148 people (33,606 births minus 26,458 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 7,889 people into the state. In 2006 it had the second lowest birthrate in the nation, 42/1000 women.[tpl]Cite book|author = Associated Press |title = Vt. birth rate ranks second lowest in U.S|publisher = Burlington Free Press|date = August 22, 2008[/tpl]
Net migration from outside the United States resulted in an increase of 4,359 people, and net migration from within the country produced an increase of 3,530 people. As of 2009, 47.8% of Vermont's population was born outside the state, with first and second-generation Vermonters representing a majority of the population.  The changing demographics between those with multi-generational ties to the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has resulted in a degree of tension between the two perspectives. This tension is expressed in the terms, "Woodchuck", being applied to those established in the state, and "Flatlander", applied to the newcomers.[tpl]cite web|title=Modern Vermont 1940-today: Flatlanders vs. Woodchucks|url=http://vermonthistory.org/freedom_and_unity/vt_transition/flat_wood.html|publisher=Vermont Historical Society|accessdate=December 5, 2012[/tpl]
