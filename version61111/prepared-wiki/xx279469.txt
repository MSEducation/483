==Post Civil War==

After the war the Army's health care professionals were organized as the Medical Department, and Baxter was appointed Assistant Medical Purveyor with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the regular Army.D. Appleton and Company, The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events, 1891, page 632  In 1871 he received a Master of Arts degree from UVM.University of Vermont, Catalogue of University of Vermont, 1791–1890, 1890, page 66
In March, 1872 Baxter was appointed Chief Medical Purveyor, and in 1874 he was promoted to Colonel.Vermont Historical Society, Vermont History, Volume 43, 1975, page 240  In 1875 Baxter graduated from Columbian University (now George Washington University Law School) with a Bachelor of Laws degree.Columbian University, Historical Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of the Columbian University, 1891, page 141
Baxter's duties included serving as personal physician to the President of the United States.  He attended James A. Garfield's family, but was out of town when Charles J. Guiteau shot Garfield in July 1881.  As a result, Baxter did not examine Garfield following the shooting or treat him during his subsequent illness.James C. Clark, The Murder of James A. Garfield, 1993, page 42Martin S. Nowak, The White House in Mourning: Deaths and Funerals of Presidents in Office, 2010, page 99  By the time he rushed back to Washington, Doctor Willard Bliss had taken charge and would not let Baxter see the wounded President.[tpl]cite book|last=Rutkow|first=Ira|title=James A.

Garfield, page 93  In fact Bliss had only recently been readmitted to the District of Columbia Medical Society, which had expelled him in 1870 over his advocacy for African American doctors to be admitted.  In addition, he had been expelled over willingness to consult with homeopaths at a time when most medical professionals were allopaths and disdained homeopathy.  Having been readmitted to the Society so recently, Bliss likely maintained his lead role in Garfield's treatment as a way to restore his own reputation.Gloria Moldow, Women Doctors in Gilded-age Washington: Race, Gender, and Professionalization, page 98Candice Millard, Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President, 2012, page 163New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Documents of the New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Volume 5, 1872, page 926
