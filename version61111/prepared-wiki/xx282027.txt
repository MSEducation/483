Chase City High School, now known as Maple Manor Apartments, is a historic high school complex located at Chase City, Mecklenburg County, Virginia. The school building was built in 1908 and expanded in 1917.  It consists of two two-story, brick Colonial Revival style buildings connected by a one-story connector building built in 1960.  Also on the property is a contributing two-story, rectangular, brick building constructed in 1917 for vocational agriculture classes. A one-story, concrete block addition to the building was constructed about 1939. The school closed in 1980, and in 1991 the complex was sensitively rehabilitated for use as apartments for the elderly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Mecklenburg/186-0002_Chase_City_High_School_2000_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Chase City High School |author=William N.
