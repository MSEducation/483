Windsor Park Collegiate (WPC) is a public secondary school in Winnipeg, Manitoba, within the Louis Riel School Division. 

==History==

"In the year of nineteen hundred and sixty, in the community of Windsor Park, there opened a school that became a legend. Only one other school in North America had this unique hexagonal architecture. The first principal of the school, Windsor Park Collegiate, was Mr. D. M. Slater, and the faculty population was 27. The first school President was R. D. McClelland. The school had a population of 619, ranging from Grade 7 to Grade 12. 93 of the students were graduating that year."
Taken from the 1978 Yearbook
The other school spoken of featuring the "unique hexagonal architecture" is Donald D. Lum Elementary School in Alameda, California, which opened in 1961.
Currently, Windsor Park Collegiate is a Grade 9 to Grade 12 school serving 490 students. Its 34 teachers and 40 support staff strive to maintain an environment that promotes student learning. The school offers an English Language Program.

==Construction==

Windsor Park Collegiate was built in the cold war era, and thus has a large bomb shelter in the foundation of the school.  This is accessible though a crawlspace near the former cafeteria (also underground), and a door near the main gymnasium changing rooms. The old cafeteria space is now used as a weight room as part of the physical education program.

==Special Needs Program==

WPC has the largest secondary school Special Needs program in the Louis Riel School Division.  It is technically termed the Co-op Education Program and the Skills for Living Program.  This program works with integration into standard classes, as well as work experience and life skills training.

===Bistro in the Park===

In 1999, the program opened up Crackers The Bistro, a full-service restaurant that was open to the public for lunch 5 days a week.  Here they train and "employ" exclusively the students who are in the Occupational Skills Program within the Louis Riel School Division.  It is located in a residential strip mall very close to WPC.   The program was a great success in reaching its goals, but is still operated largely off donations and public funding.  In 1999 this program won the Manitoba School Board Innovation Award http://www.bigdatabase.ca/big-html/nonsecure/resources/success/success-crackers.html.   As of July 2006 the restaurant was renamed Bistro in the Parkhttp://www.lrsd.net/Administration/Boardroom/Minutes/Minutes06June2006.htm.
