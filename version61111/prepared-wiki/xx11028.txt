</ref> The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the [[Eddington luminosity]] which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named [[R136a1]] in the Large Magellanic Cloud, RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 solar masses, which puts this limit into question.<ref name=eso20100721>
