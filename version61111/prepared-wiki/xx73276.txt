[tpl]legend|#00FFFF|Classes 2 and 3[/tpl]]]
When a new state is admitted to the Union, its two senators have terms that correspond to those of two different classes, among the three classes defined below. Which two classes is determined by a scheme that keeps the three classes as close to the same size as possible; one that avoids the largest class differing by more than one senator from the smallest class.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/general/common/generic/NewCongress_faq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions about a New Congress |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=11 June 2013[/tpl]  A coin toss determines which new senator enters which of the classes selected to be expanded.
This means at least one of any new state's first pair of senators has a term of less than six years, and one term is either two or four years shorter than the other.
When the last state was admitted, Hawaii in 1959, candidates for the Senate ran either for "seat A" or "seat B".  The new Senators, in a process managed by the Secretary of the Senate, drew lots to determine which of the two would join the Class 1 (whose term would end in five-and-a-half years), and which would join Class 3 (whose term would end in three-and-a-half years).[tpl]cite web | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F17F83458137B93C2AA178CD85F4D8585F9&scp=1&sq=&st=p | work=The New York Times | first=Lawrence E. | last=Davies | title=G.O.P.
