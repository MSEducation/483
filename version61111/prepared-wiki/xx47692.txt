Johan Asplund (born 1937) is a Swedish sociologist interested in social interaction and ethnomethodology.He appears cited e.g. in the works of Mats Alvesson (on reflexive methodology and critical management theory). At present, his works are not widely translated from the original Swedish.It is said that he thinks that the essence of a text gets lost if you translate it, and therefore refuses being published in other languages. Until his retirement, he holds[tpl]clarify|date=July 2012[/tpl] the chair of Sociology at Lund University.
Two of his most widely read books are "Det sociala livets elementära former" (1987, approximately "Elementary forms of social life"), in which he introduces his theory about humans as essentially "socially responsive" (socialt responsiva), and "Essä om Gemeinschaft och Gesellschaft" (1991, "Essay about Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft"), in which he explains and discusses this concept, originally developed by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies, 1887. Johan Asplund's writings on cities are summarized in English by Bo Gronlund in New Urban Theory.
