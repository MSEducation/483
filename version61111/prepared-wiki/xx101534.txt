An integrated steel mill has all the functions for primary steel 
production:
The principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore, 
limestone, and coal (or coke).  These materials are charged in batches 
into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up 
excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the 
accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast
into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steelmaking 
operations. Historically the Bessemer process was a major 
advancement in the production of economical steel, but it has now been 
entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace.
Molten steel is cast into large blocks called "blooms".  During the 
casting process various methods are used, such as addition of 
aluminum, so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where
they can be cut off the finished bloom.
Because of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating
and cooling a blast furnace, typically these primary steelmaking 
vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several 
years duration. Even during periods of low steel demand, it may not be 
feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold, though some adjustment of 
the production rate is possible.
Integrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical
to build in 2,000,000 ton per year annual capacity and up.  Final 
products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural 
sections, heavy plate, strip, wire rod, railway rails,  
and occasionally long products such as 
bars and pipe.
A major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is 
the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke, which
is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a 
blast furnace.
Integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in 
mini-mills, such as arc furnaces and direct casting, to reduce 
production costs.
World integrated steel production capacity is at or close to world 
demand, so competition between suppliers results in only the most 
efficient producers remaining viable.  However, due to the large 
employment of integrated plants, often governments will financially 
assist an obsolescent facility rather than take the risk of having 
thousands of workers thrown out of jobs.[tpl]Nonspecific|date=July 2007[/tpl]
