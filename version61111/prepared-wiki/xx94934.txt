==History==

The countryside around present day Rhymney would have been very different in the early 17th century. A new parish of Bedwellty had been formed in 1624,Monmouthshire Parish Map covering the lower division of the Wentloog Hundred, in the county of Monmouth, a hilly district between the river Rumney, on the West, and the Sirhowey on the East. The upper Sirhowy Valley at this time would have been a natural well wooded valley, consisting of a few farms and the occasional small iron works where iron ore and coal naturally had occurred together. Later it would have contained the chapelries of Rhymney and Tredegar, the latter being known as a market town. It wasn’t until the 1750s that industrialisation began with the establishment of the Sirhowy Iron Works. It was from this pastoral pre-industrial period that the Buccaneer Henry Morgan was born around 1635 -the eldest son of Robert Morgan, a farmer living in Llanrhymny,Biography of Sir Henry Morgan, 1635-84 Dudley Pope, Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd, (1977) ISBN 0436377357 page 62 today known as Rhymney three miles from Tredegar. In Welsh the original meaning of Llan is ‘an enclosed piece of land’.
The town was founded with the establishment of the Union ironworks in 1801, with the Rhymney Iron Company later being founded from a merger between the Bute and Union Ironworks in 1837.  The ironworks  used local coking coal, iron ore and limestone. From the mid-19th century, steam coal pits were sunk to the south of the town.  The ironworks closed in 1891 and by the early 20th century the town's collieries employed nearly the entire local population.
The parish church of St David's is a grade II* listed Building.  [tpl]cite web|url = http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-13578-church-of-st-david-rhymney|title= Church of St David, Rhymney|publisher= British Listed Buildings|accessdate = 14 January 2014[/tpl] 
The history of Rhymney is described in Rhymney Memories, a book by Dr Thomas Jones.  Jones was born in the town and his daughter, the Labour Party politician Eirene White, was later granted the title Baroness White of Rhymney.

==Education and transport==

The town's secondary school, Rhymney Comprehensive, serves a catchment area that includes Fochriw, Pontlottyn and New Tredegar. There is also a Welsh language primary school in Rhymney.

==The Bells of Rhymney==

Rhymney is known to many outside of Wales due to folk singer Pete Seeger's song "The Bells of Rhymney".[tpl]cite web|title=The Bells of Rhymney|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/caerphilly/pages/bellsofrhymney.shtml|accessdate=2009-12-01[/tpl]  The lyrics to the song are drawn from a poem by Idris Davies who was born in Rhymney in 1905. The poem was first published in Davies' 1938 anthology Gwalia Deserta.  The poem was inspired by the failure of the 1926 General Strike and by the Marine Colliery disaster of 1 March 1927.[tpl]cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|year=1996|title=Mr. Tambourine Man (1996 CD liner notes)[/tpl]  In addition to Rhymney, the poem also refers to the bells of Merthyr, Rhondda, Blaina, Caerphilly, Neath, Brecon, Swansea, Newport, Cardiff and the Wye Valley.[tpl]cite web|title=The Bells of Rhymney Lyrics|publisher=Pete Seeger Appreciation Page|url=http://www.peteseeger.net/BellsofR.htm|accessdate=2009-12-01[/tpl]
The song has been covered by a number of acts over the years, including Judy Collins, Cher, The Alarm, The Ian Campbell Folk Group, John Denver, Robyn Hitchcock, Oysterband and Ralph McTell.[tpl]cite web|title=The Bells of Rhymney cover versions|publisher=Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/The+Bells+Of+Rhymney/order:default-asc|accessdate=2009-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Bells of Rhymney cover versions|publisher=Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Bells+Of+Rhymney/order:default-asc|accessdate=2009-12-01[/tpl]  Arguably the most widely known rendition of the song, however, was that recorded by the American band The Byrds for their 1965 album Mr. Tambourine Man.
