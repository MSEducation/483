</ref> This group was later expanded to include 26 potential members. Possible members include [[Beta Columbae]], [[Pi Mensae]], 14 Tauri and 68 Virginis. The typical space velocities of this group of stars is 105&ndash;114&nbsp;km/s relative to the Sun.<ref>
 &ndash; Gives space velocity components of U=+94, V=–53 and W=–7 for HD 201091/2.</ref>
Because of their wide angular separation (and correspondingly slow orbital motion), it was initially unclear whether the two stars in the 61 Cygni system were physically connected. The respective parallax measurements of 0.360″ and 0.288″ gave a separation of more than two light years. However, by 1917 refined measured parallax differences demonstrated that the separation was significantly less.[ref]
—See Table I, page 326[/ref] The binary nature of this system was clear by 1934, and orbital elements were published.[ref]
—on page 19, the authority is listed as Zagar (1934).[/ref]
An observer using 7×50 binoculars can find 61 Cygni two binocular fields south-east of the bright star Deneb. The angular separation of the two stars is slightly greater than the angular size of Saturn (16–20″).[ref]
