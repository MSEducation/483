[[Meccano Mind]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 albums

Meccano Mind is the first album and currently the only album of the electronic music duo Syntax, released by Illustrious Records in 2004. The album features the singles "Pray" (#28 UK), "Message" and "Bliss" (#69 UK).
The album suffered in terms of sales due to possibly a lack of support from their label - and a lack of overall recognition.
