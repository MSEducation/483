The Underage Festival is a music festival which takes place in Victoria Park, London. It is open to 13 to under 17 year olds,  and only those within this age limit are allowed entry to the festival. In the two years since its creation, the festival has taken place at the beginning of August each year. There are five main stages, the Converse Century Main Stage, the NME Stage, the Topman New Music Stage, the Domino Stage (aptly named the "Domino 15th Anniversary Stage" for the label's 15th anniversary of creation in 2008), and the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage. As well as this, some of the smaller features included the Habbo Dj Tent, the CM Tower Hamlets Music Space Stage, and the Artrocker Signing Tent. 2008's event also included a MySpace bus, where secret sets and interviews with bands took place.
The festival evolved out of a series of club nights held in the Elephant and Castle area of South London, hosted and organised by Sam Kilcoyne, (the teenage son of Barry 7 from Add N to (X) and current member of the band S.C.U.M) after he was refused admission to a Buzzcocks gig due to his age (he was fourteen years old at the time). These grew popular with preteens and teenagers, even receiving press coverage in broadsheet national newspapers (The Guardian, to name one) and the BBC's arts programmes who reported this as a "youthquake".
