[[Conjugate (algebra)]]

CATEGORIES: Algebra

In algebra, a conjugate is a binomial formed by negating the second term of a binomial. The conjugate of [tpl]nowrap|x + y[/tpl] is [tpl]nowrap|x − y[/tpl], where x and y are real numbers. If y is imaginary, the process is termed complex conjugation: the complex conjugate of [tpl]nowrap|a + bi[/tpl] is [tpl]nowrap|a − bi[/tpl], where a and b are real.

In a commutative ring, an expression of the form
can be factored to give
where one factor is the conjugate of the other. This can be useful when trying to rationalize a denominator containing radicals (√).
