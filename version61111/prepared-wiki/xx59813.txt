[[Arm贸nico]]

CATEGORIES: Guitar family instruments

An arm贸nico is a guitar-like instrument. It is a hybrid between the Spanish guitar and the Cuban tres. Formally known as trilina, the arm贸nico has seven strings, two of which form a doubled string.  That's six courses, five with one string, and one with two strings.  
Counting from the lowest-pitched, the first three strings, E, A and D, are tuned an octave higher than the equivalent strings on a guitar with standard tuning. The fourth string, G, is doubled as well as also being an octave higher than on a guitar. The remaining two, B and E, are at the same pitch as a standard guitar. http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/a.htm
The arm贸nico was invented by the famous Cuban composer/performer Compay Segundo who loved the instrument as it allowed him to exploit the possibilities of both the guitar and the tres.".[tpl]cite web | title = Compay Segungo's Biography | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | url = http://www.last.fm/music/Compay+Segundo/+wiki[/tpl]
