The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and businesses for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and intellectual property identification. The USPTO is "unique among federal agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users, and not on taxpayer dollars".[tpl]cite news | last = Bohle | first = Shannon  | title = A Four Part Series on Open Notebook Science (Part 4) |url=http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219191548/http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archivedate = 19 February 2014 | publisher = Nature.com | date = February 2014  | accessdate = 19 February 2014 [/tpl] Its "operating structure is like a business in that it receives requests for services—applications for patents and trademark registrations—and charges fees projected to cover the cost of performing the services it provides".[tpl]cite news | last = Bohle | first = Shannon  | title = A Four Part Series on Open Notebook Science (Part 4) |url=http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219191548/http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archivedate = 19 February 2014 | publisher = Nature.com | date = February 2014  | accessdate = 19 February 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = USPTO 2014-2018 Strategic Plan |url=http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/DRAFT_USPTO_2014-2018_Strategic_Plan.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122065152/http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/DRAFT_USPTO_2014-2018_Strategic_Plan.pdf | archivedate = 22 January 2014 | publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office | date = February 2014  | accessdate = 19 February 2014 [/tpl]
The USPTO is based in Alexandria, Virginia, after a 2006 move from the Crystal City area of neighboring Arlington, Virginia. The offices under Patents and the Chief Information Officer that remained just outside the southern end of Crystal City completed moving to Randolph Square, a brand-new building in Shirlington Village, on April 27, 2009.
The head of the USPTO is Michelle Lee. She took up her new role on January 13, 2014, and formerly served as the Director of the USPTO’s Silicon Valley satellite office.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/news/pr/2013/13-39.jsp |title=U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker Names Michelle K.

The USPTO cooperates with the European Patent Office (EPO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) as one of the Trilateral Patent Offices. The USPTO is also a Receiving Office, an International Searching Authority and an International Preliminary Examination Authority for international patent applications filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

==Mission==

The USPTO mission is to "maintain a permanent, interdisciplinary historical record of all U.S. patent applications in order to fulfill objectives outlined in the United States constitution".[tpl]cite news | last = Bohle | first = Shannon  | title = A Four Part Series on Open Notebook Science (Part 4) |url=http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219191548/http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/a-four-part-series-on-open-notebook-science-part-4/ | archivedate = 19 February 2014 | publisher = Nature.com | date = February 2014  | accessdate = 19 February 2014 [/tpl] The legal basis for the United States patent system is Article 1, Section 8, wherein the powers of Congress are defined.[tpl]cite news | title = The United States Constitution |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125111307/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html | archivedate = 19 February 2014 | publisher = The U.S. National Archives | date = January 2014  | accessdate = 19 February 2014 [/tpl]

==Structure==

The USPTO is headquartered at the Alexandria Campus, consisting of 11 buildings in a city-like development surrounded by ground floor retail and high rise residential buildings between the METRO stations of King Street station and Eisenhower Avenue station where the actual Alexandria Campus is located between Duke Street (on the North) to Eisenhower Avenue (on the South), and between John Carlyle Street (on the East) to Elizabeth Lane (on the West) in Alexandria, Virginia.USPTO CampusUSPTO Alexandia Campus map #1USPTO Alexandia Campus map #2 An additional building in Arlington, Virginia, was opened in 2009.
The USPTO was expected by 2014 to open its first ever satellite offices in Detroit, Dallas, Denver, and Silicon Valley to reduce backlog and reflect regional industrial strengths.Silicon Valley wins in securing U.S. patent office The first satellite office opened in Detroit on July 13, 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-03-01/pdf/CREC-2011-03-01-pt1-PgS1071.pdf#page=3  |title=Patent Reform Act of 2011 Amendment |work=Congressional Record 112th Congress (2011-2012) |format=pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.uspto.gov/news/pr/2010/10_65.jsp|title=USPTO to Open First Ever Satellite Office in Detroit |publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office |format=pdf|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2012/07/detroit_beats_silicon_valley_i.html |title=Detroit beats Silicon Valley in opening first-ever patent office outside Washington, D.C. |first1=Melissa |last1=Anders |date= July 13, 2012 |publisher=MLive.com|accessdate= July 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.inc.com/hot-spots-detroit/eric-markowitz/what-does-a-patent-office-mean-for-detroit.html |first1=Eric |last1=Markowitz |publisher=Inc.com |date=March 1, 2012|title=What Does a Patent Office Mean For Detroit? |accessdate=July 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120711/BIZ/207110377/1361/Patent-office-prepares-to-open-Detroit-location |date=July 11, 2012 |title=Patent office prepares to open Detroit location |author=Associated Press |work=The Detroit News|location=Detroit, Michigan |accessdate=July 11, 2012[/tpl] The 2013 sequestration has put the satellite office for Silicon Valley, which is home to the nation's top patent-producing cities, on hold indefinitely.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=217869885|title=Silicon Valley Patent Office Shelved|author=Associated Press[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2009|9|30|df=US[/tpl], the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year, the PTO had 9,716 employees, nearly all of whom are based at its five-building headquarters complex in Alexandria. Of those, 6,242 were patent examiners (almost all of whom were assigned to examine utility patents; only 99 were assigned to examine design patents) and 388 were trademark examining attorneys; the rest are support staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/ar/2009/2009annualreport.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |page=140 |accessdate=2010-01-16[/tpl] While the agency has noticeably grown in recent years, the rate of growth was far slower in fiscal 2009 than in the recent past; this is borne out by data from fiscal 2005 to the present:
Patent examiners make up the bulk of the employees at USPTO. They are generally newly graduated scientists and engineers, recruited from various universities around the nation.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] They hold degrees in various scientific disciplines, but who do not necessarily hold law degrees. Unlike patent examiners, trademark examiners must be licensed attorneys.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] All examiners work under a strict, "count"-based production system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1700_1705.htm |title=1705 Examiner Docket, Time, and Activity Recordation R-5 - 1700 Miscellaneous |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date= |accessdate=2010-01-29[/tpl] For every application, "counts" are earned by composing, filing, and mailing a first office action on the merits, and upon disposal of an application.

Prior to 2012, decisions of patent examiners may be appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, an administrative law body of the USPTO. Decisions of the BPAI could further be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or a civil suit may be brought against the Commissioner of Patents in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.35 U.S.C. § 145. The United States Supreme Court may ultimately decide on a patent case. Similarly, decisions of trademark examiners may be appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, with subsequent appeals directed to the Federal Circuit, or a civil action may also be brought.
Under the America Invents Act, the BPAI was converted to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or "PTAB".PTAB Submissions Have Commenced, USPTO Blog, Director's Forum, September 18, 2012
In recent years, the USPTO has seen increasing delays between when a patent application is filed and when it issues. To address its workload challenges, the USPTO has undertaken an aggressive program of hiring and recruitment. The USPTO hired 1,193 new patent examiners in Fiscal Year 2006 (year ending September 30, 2006),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2006/3020100_patentperfrm.html |title=Patent Performance for the year 2006 |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office [/tpl] 1,215 new examiners in fiscal 2007,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2007/2007annualreport.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=2009-04-23[/tpl] and 1,211 in fiscal year 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2008/2008annualreport.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=2009-04-23[/tpl] The USPTO expected to continue hiring patent examiners at a rate of approximately 1,200 per year through 2012; however, due to a slowdown in new application filings since the onset of the late-2000s economic crisis,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/04/economic-downturn-downturn-in-patent-filings.html |title=Economic Downturn => Downturn in Patent Filings |first=Dennis |last=Crouch |authorlink=Dennis Crouch |publisher=Patently-O |date=April 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-13[/tpl] and projections of substantial declines in maintenance fees in coming years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/03/23/patent-academy-closing-uspto-budget-crisis-deepening/ |title=Patent Academy Closing, USPTO Budget Crisis Deepening? |first=Gene |last=Quinn |publisher= IPWatchdog |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-13[/tpl] the agency imposed a hiring freeze in early March 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/03/02/pto-hiring-freeze-and-budget-problems/ |title=PTO Hiring Freeze and Budget Problems |first=Gene |last=Quinn |publisher= IPWatchdog |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-13[/tpl]
In 2006, USPTO instituted a new training program for patent examiners called the "Patent Training Academy". It is an eight-month program designed to teach new patent examiners the fundamentals of patent law, practice and examination procedure in a college-style environment.USPTO Annual Report 2006, The Nature of the Training Provided to USPTO Examiners Because of the impending USPTO budget crisis previously alluded to, it had been rumored that the Academy would be closed by the end of 2009. Focarino, then Acting Commissioner for Patents, denied in a May 2009 interview that the Academy was being shut down, but stated that it would be cut back because the hiring goal for new examiners in fiscal 2009 was reduced to 600.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/05/12/an-interview-with-the-acting-commissioner-for-patents/id=3381/ |title=An Interview with the Acting Commissioner for Patents |first=Gene |last=Quinn |publisher= IPWatchdog |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-24[/tpl] Ultimately, 588 new patent examiners were hired in fiscal year 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/ar/2009/2009annualreport.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |page=14 |accessdate=2010-01-16[/tpl]

==Fee diversion==

For many years, Congress has "diverted" about 10% of the fees that the USPTO collected into the general treasury of the United States.  In effect, this took money collected from the patent system to use for the general budget. This fee diversion has been generally opposed by patent practitioners (e.g., patent attorneys and patent agents), inventors, the USPTO,[ref]
