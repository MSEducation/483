Warith Deen Mohammed (born Wallace D. Muhammad; October 30, 1933 – September 9, 2008), also known as "W. Deen Mohammed" or "Imam W. Deen Muhammad", was a progressive African American Muslim leader, theologian, philosopher, Muslim revivalist and Islamic thinker (1975–2008) who disbanded the original Nation of Islam in 1976 and transformed it into an orthodox mainstream Islamic movement, the World Community of Al-Islam in the West which later became the American Society of Muslims.In 1989, Mohammed changed the spelling of his surname Muhammad to Mohammed to reflect the spelling on his birth certificate.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Mohammed was born Wallace Delaney Muhammad on Yeman Street in Hamtramck, Michigan in 1933.Essien-Udom, E. U.  (1962) Black Nationalism: A Search for an Identity in America, New York City: Dell Publishing Company, p. 93 (In 1980 he would change his name to Warithuddin Muhammad, Warith Deen Muhammad, which translates to 'Inheritor of the Religion of Muhammad'.Gardell, Mattias.

Named to honor Wallace Fard Muhammad (Fard), the founder of the Nation of Islam, Mohammed grew up in Chicago, one of seven siblings.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/us/10mohammed.html?_r=0 | title = W.

Eric. (1994)The Black Muslims in America, Third Edition, William B. (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans Publishing Company) page 264 He studied Arabic as a youth under Professor Jamal Diab, a Palestinian who had been hired by his father to teach at the M.U.I. in Chicago.Lincoln, C. Eric. (1994)The Black Muslims in America, Third Edition, William B. (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans Publishing Company) page 263
Mohammed became a minister under his father in late 1958 and served  in Philadelphia during the late 1950s and early 1960s.E. U. Essien-Udom (1962) Black Nationalism: A Search for an Identity in America, p. 88, (New York, NY: Dell Publishing Company)."W. DEEN MOHAMMED: A leap of faith", Chicago Tribune.
In 1961, on his 28th birthday, Mohammed began a term in federal prison for having refused induction into the United States military. He could have served community service, but his father pressed him to accept the jail time. He spent most of that time studying the Qur'an, the scripture of Islam.Magida, Arthur J. (1996) Prophet of Rage: A Life of Louis Farrakhan and His Nation, First Edition, (Basic Books/Harper Collins Publishers Inc.) page 74 & 75 He became convinced that the Nation of Islam had to change. In 1963 he was released from prison."W. DEEN MOHAMMED: A leap of faith", Chicago Tribune Close to Malcolm X, who was also questioning the NOI, he found that by this time his viewpoints deviated significantly from those of his father, whom he no longer believed was a prophet. Because of this conclusion, he was excommunicated five times, but by 1974, he was returned permanently to the church.

==Religious leadership and Ministry==

===Reforming the Nation of Islam===

Upon the death of his father on February 25, 1975, Mohammed was unanimously chosen as the leader of the Nation of Islam and introduced to the NOI membership as such at the annual Saviours' Day convention on February 26, 1975."Warith Deen Mohammed", This Far By Faith, Public Broadcasting ServiceEvolution of a Community, WDM Publications 1995 Among the first changes Mohammed instituted, he dropped the title Supreme Minister and took the title Chief Imam, or simply Imam, in 1976.Gardell, Mattias. In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. Duke University Press, 1996, page 110Lincoln, C. Eric. (1994)The Black Muslims in America, Third Edition, William B.

In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. Duke University Press, 1996 page 112
These were just two of the many reforms Mohammed introduced. Among others, he eliminated the NOI dress code, disbanded the military branch of the NOI, clarified the concept of the devil, and, through his Muhammad Speaks newspaper and public speeches, introduced and explained Islam's Five Pillars.Gardell, Mattias. In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. Duke University Press, 1996, page 108 He stated that Fard was not divine and that his father was not a prophet.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/warith-deen-mohammed-imam-who-preached-a-moderate-form-of-islam-to-black-americans-930887.html | title = Warith Deen Mohammed: Imam who preached a moderate form of Islam to black Americans | work = The Independent | date = 15 September 2008 | accessdate = 11 January 2014[/tpl] All of the over 400 temples were converted into traditional Islamic Mosques. He also renamed the community several times before finally settling on the American Society of Muslims to reflect the new thinking.Lincoln, C. Eric.  (1994) The Black Muslims in America, Third Edition, (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company), p. 265.Evolution of a Community, WDM Publications, 1995 Mohammed was frank about his intentions to evolve the movement. On November 19, 1978 he spoke on the "Evolution of the Nation of Islam" at the American academy of Religion in New Orleans, Louisiana."As The Light Shineth From The East," WDM Publications, Chicago, Illinois, 1980.
Mohammed's changes reached deep into the philosophy of the movement his father had led for so long. He rejected literal interpretations of his father's theology and Black-separatist views and on the basis of his intensive independent study of Islamic law, history, and theology, he accepted whites as fellow worshipers."Black Muslims Alter View of White 'Devil'" By Paul Delaney, September 2, 1975, New York Times News Service"White Muslims?", TIME, 20 Jun 1975 However, he also encouraged African Americans (Bilalians) to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon them to change the surname given to them by the caucasian slave master.Book of Muslim Names, The Honorable W. D. Muhammad,  1976, Chicago, Illinois He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Latinos.Essien-Udom, E. U. (1962) Black Nationalism: A Search for an Identity in America, New York City: Dell Publishing Company, p. 93, He also decentralized power. On September 10, 1978 in an address in Atlanta, Georgia he resigned as Chief Imam and appointed a six member council to lead the Community.Imam W. Deen Muhammad speaks from Harlem, N.Y. Book 1, W. D. M. Publications, 1984Evolution of a Community, WDM Publications 1995 page 20
Mohammed felt quite keenly his role in reform. In an interview published in the Muhammad Speaks newspaper and conducted by his brother Jabir Herbert Muhammad, Mohammed described his role as successor to their father as that of a Mujeddid,Gardell, Mattias.

Warith Deen Mohammed gained widespread support among the international Muslim community, but his changes to the Nation of Islam were not universally accepted.Farrakhan berated by W. Deen Mohammed - Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. The Christian Century, Vol. 112, No. 34 A number of dissident groups resisted, most notably those who followed Louis Farrakhan in breaking ranks with Mohammed. This group revived the name 'Nation of Islam' in 1977."W. DEEN MOHAMMED: A leap of faith",Chicago Tribune In 1995 Mohammed released a statement expressing concern about Farrakhan's motivations and the racial divisiveness of his ministry.In The Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, Mattias Gardell, Duke University Press, Durham, N.C. 1996. The pair embraced publicly and declared reconciliation at the annual Saviours' Day convention on February 25, 2000, but in August 10, 2007, Mohammed repeated his frustration with the separatist stance of the current Nation of Islam, stating that its leaders had, "for the last 10 years or more,...just been selling wolf tickets to the white race and having fun while they collect money and have fancy lifestyles.""Warith Deen Mohammed Condemns the Nation of Islam", Anti-Defamation League He predicted a quiet evolution in the NOI towards unity with the mainstream American Muslim community.

===Building ties within the Muslim community===

Mohammed was intent on strengthening bonds between his movement and the wider American Muslim faith as well as with followers of Islam abroad. It was his goal to align American Muslims with Sunni Islam.  In 1976, he took a delegation to Guyana on an official State Visit to meet with Prime Minister L. Forbes Burnham, and the then President of Guyana Arthur Chung, during which he forged ties with the Muslim communities in the region.Focus on Al-Islam, Zakat Publications, Chicago, Illinois, Dec. 1988, Library of Congress Card Number: 89-090728, page 24 In 1985, he met in Geneva, Switzerland with Dr. Muhammad Ahmad Al-Sharif, Secretary General of the Islamic Call Society of Libya and Dr. Abdul Hakim Tabibi, an Afghan mujahid, to discuss areas of future cooperation with the Islamic Call Society and the Muslim Community of America.

==Islamic beliefs and ideology==

===Fiqh===

While emphasizing unity within the Muslim church, Warith Deen Mohammed called upon the American Muslim community to establish a new school of "Fiqh", a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam.Imam W. Deen Muhammad speaks from Harlem, N.Y.: Challenges that Face Man Today, pp. 34-38. He told ISLAMICA magazine in 2008 that he felt that the Madhhab—the schools of thought within Fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that "I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. We are getting a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation I think that we will be getting a much stronger sense of it. It is coming more and more.''[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/2811/ | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120509204959/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2008/09/if_we_become_independent_thinkers_we_can_make_a_contribution/ | title = Imam Warith Deen Mohammed: "If we become independent thinkers, we can make a contribution" | publisher = Patheos | date = 11 September 2008 | archivedate = 9 May 2012 | accessdate = 6 January 2014[/tpl]

===Imagery and color symbolism===

Mohammed was sensitive to the potential impact caused by the use of images and symbols in religion. In a 1975 article, he explored this topic and in 1976 published the first article on the subject in the Bilalian News (later the Muslim Journal). Titled "A Message of Concern", this article has run in every copy of the publication since.Sharif, Imam Sidney Rahim. The African American (Bilalian) Image in Crisis, New Mind Productions, Jersey City, New Jersey, page 115Mohammed Speaks, WDM Publications, Chicago, Illinois, 1999 He spoke about the subject, as well. For instance, in a June 17, 1977 Friday service, he taught on "The meaning of colors in Scripture and the Natural Powers of Black and White", describing ancient scriptural symbolism and its effect on modern-day scriptural and religious interpretation. He also elaborated on how colors in scripture have triggered racist influences in religious societies. In 1977 he formed the Committee for the Removal of All Images that Attempt to Portray the Divine (C.R.A.I.D.).[tpl]cite web| url = http://masjidfreehaven.org/imam.htm | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20111006190102/http://masjidfreehaven.org/imam.htm | title = The Imam's Corner: Imam Murad Abdul-Zahir | publisher = Masjid Freehaven | archivedate = 6 November 2011 | accessdate = 6 January 2014[/tpl]Gardell, Mattias.
