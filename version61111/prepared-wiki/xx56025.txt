[[Marcus Duronius]]

CATEGORIES: 1st-century BC Romans, Roman tribunes of the plebs

Marcus Duronius was a tribune of the plebs, most likely in 97 BC. He abrogated a sumptuary law, one of the Leges Liciniae.Aulus Gellius 2.24.10; Macrobius 3.17.7; T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 7. In retaliation, the Roman censors Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Antonius expelled him from the Senate. Duronius then brought an accusation of ambitus against Antonius.Cicero, De Oratore 2.274; Valerius Maximus 2.9.5; Broughton, MRR1, pp. 6â€“7.
