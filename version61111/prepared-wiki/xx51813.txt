A spork (also known as a foon) is a hybrid form of cutlery taking the form of a spoon-like shallow scoop with three or four fork tines.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.articlearchives.com/travel-hospitality-tourism/restaurants-food-service/471277-1.html|title=The splendid spork a marvel to behold|last=Shepard|first=Helen-Marie|date=27 May 2002|publisher=The Register Guard|accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl] Spork-like utensils, such as the terrapin fork or ice cream fork,[tpl]cite book|last = Petroski|first = Henry|publisher = Knopf|isbn = 0-679-41226-3| year = 1992| title = The Evolution of Useful Things| page = 135| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zZtRAAAAMAAJ&q=terrapin&pgis=1[/tpl] have been manufactured since the late 19th century;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prices4antiques.com/silver-gold/flatware/Terrapin-Forks-12-Sterling-Gorham-Imperial-Chrysanthemum-Pattern-Engraved-D9814231.htm|title = Terrapin Forks (1890 - 1900)|publisher = Prices 4 Antiques[/tpl] patents for spork-like designs date back to at least 1874, and the word "spork" was registered as a trademark in the US and the UK decades later. They are used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, the military, backpackers and in airline meals.
The word spork combines spoon and fork. Similarly, the word foon is a blend of fork and spoon. The word "spork" appeared in the 1909 supplement to the Century Dictionary, where it was described as a trade name and "a 'portmanteau-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork".

==History==

In the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued US Patent 147,119 in February 1874.[tpl]US-patent|147,119[/tpl] Other early patents predating the modern spork include US Patent 904,553,[tpl]US-patent|904,553[/tpl] for a "cutting spoon", granted on November 24, 1908 to Harry L. McCoy and US Patent 1,044,869,[tpl]US-patent|1,044,869[/tpl] for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term "spork". Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These design patents do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978[tpl]US-patent|D247,153[/tpl] and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998.[tpl]US-patent|D388,664[/tpl]
The word spork originated in the early 20th century to describe such devices. In 1951, Hyde W. Ballard of Westtown, Pennsylvania filed an application with the United States Patent Office (USPO; now the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to register "Spork" as a trademark for a combination spoon and fork made of stainless steel.U.S. trademark application, serial no. 609,277, filed January 26, 1951.

In the UK, Plastico Limited registered Spork as a trademark in relation to cutlery with effect from September 18, 1975 (reg. no. 1052291). The registration is now in the name of another company and remains in force. The trademark is also registered in the UK in relation to gardening tools in the name of the same UK based individual who owns US trademark registration no. 2514381. Another British company, Lifeventure, sells titanium and plastic versions using the name "Forkspoon".
In an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1999 where the company Regalzone sought to invalidate Plastico Limited's UK registration for Spork, Justice Neuberger wrote:[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Materials and uses==

Materials such as stainless steel, silver, aluminum, titanium, and polycarbonate plastic have been used in spork manufacture. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the United States because they are difficult to form into weapons[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]. Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by backpackers and other outdoors enthusiasts as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.
