The United Kingdom held a national preselection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1976. It took place on 25 February 1976 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. For the first time since 1964 a single act did not perform each of the nominated songs with rather each song being performed by a different act. Michael Aspel acted as presenter for the event.
