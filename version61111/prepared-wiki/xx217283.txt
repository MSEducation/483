</ref> Proprietary software can be distributed at no cost or for a fee, and [[free software]] can be distributed at no cost or for a fee.<ref name="jargon2003proprietary">
</ref>  The difference is that whether or not proprietary software can be distributed, and what the fee would be, is at the proprietor's discretion.  With free software, anyone who has a copy can decide whether, and how much, to charge for a copy or related services.<ref>

Proprietary software that comes for no cost is called freeware.
Proponents of commercial proprietary software argue that requiring users to pay for software as a product increases funding or time available for the research and development of software. For example, Microsoft says that per-copy fees maximise the profitability of software development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/05-03sharedsource.mspx|title=The Commercial Software Model|date=May 2001|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2007-03-05[/tpl]
Proprietary software generally creates greater commercial activity over free software, especially in regard to market revenues.

A related concept is closed platform or "walled garden".  The term "silo" is used to describe the even broader notion of "closed habitats that serve as private marketplaces that lock customers in and competitors out".

==Examples==

Well known examples of proprietary software include Microsoft Windows, Adobe Flash Player, PS3 OS, iTunes, Adobe Photoshop, Google Earth, Mac OS X, Skype, WinRAR, and some versions of Unix.
Software distributions considered as proprietary may in fact incorporate a "mixed source" model including both free and non-free software in the same distribution.[ref]
