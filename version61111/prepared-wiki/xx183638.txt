In 2001, Rosevear moved to the US, where he played with Albanian singer Simaku and then joined US band Cinderglass. After the demise of Cinderglass he returned to Newcastle and resumed playing with DV8 and also played with The Retro Rockets. In 2003 he set up his own music school called "Rosie's School of Rock" inspired from some of the Rock Schools he saw in USA. The school provides tuition on all Rock instruments and hosts concerts every term. The school's core aim is to provide a learning environment that creates confidence in kids by enabling them to create a 'cooler' image for themselves, including kids with disabilities. Many students form bands, perform, make and promote albums, get on radio and TV.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/02/06/2484422.htm |title=Craig 'Rosie' Rosevear, portrait of a 'rock and role model' |last1=Scully |first1=Anthony |last2=Russell |first2=Garth |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2011 [/tpl] With Retro Rockets, Rosevear released a third album, Cars, Guitars and Girls from Mars in 2007. In 2009, Peter Sesselmann's portrait of Rosevear was entered into the Archibald Prize as Rock and role model and was "symbolic of the rock drummer's transition from touring musician to educator over the past few years". In 2011, DV8 released a live album, Live at the Wicko.
