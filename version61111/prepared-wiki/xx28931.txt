Belinda ([tpl]IPAc-en|b|ɨ|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|d|ə[/tpl] [tpl]Respell|bə|LIN|də[/tpl]) is an inner satellite of the planet Uranus. Belinda was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 13 January 1986 and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 5.[tpl]sfn|IAUC 4164[/tpl] It is named after the heroine of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.

Belinda belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Juliet, Cupid, Rosalind and Perdita.[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Hubble|2001[/tpl] These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties.[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Hubble|2001[/tpl] Other than its orbit,[tpl]sfn|Jacobson|1998[/tpl] radius of 45 km[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Voyager|2001[/tpl] and geometric albedo of 0.08[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Hubble|2001[/tpl] virtually nothing is known about it.
The Voyager 2 images show Belinda as an elongated object with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The moon is very elongated, with its short axis 0.5 ± 0.1 times the long axis.[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Voyager|2001[/tpl] Its surface is grey in color.[tpl]sfn|Karkoschka, Voyager|2001[/tpl]
