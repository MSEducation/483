A reference work is a book or serial publication to which one can refer for confirmed facts.[tpl]cite web|last=Farlex|title=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|url=http://wwwxcom/reference+work|accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl] The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. Indexes are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually (e.g. Whitaker's Almanack, Who's Who). Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists).[tpl]cite web|last=The University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|title=The Reference Materials|url=http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl] Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as software packages or online through the Internet.

==Reference book==

In comparison, a reference book or reference-only book in a library is one that may only be used in the library and not borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense) which are usually used only briefly or photocopied from, and therefore do not need to be borrowed. Keeping them in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Other reference-only books are books that are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from circulating items.
Some libraries consist entirely or to a large extent of books which may not be borrowed; these include national libraries and many special libraries.

==Electronic resources==

An electronic resource is a piece of information stored in the form of electrical signals and is usually found on a computer. This includes information available on the internet.[tpl]cite web|last=AllWords.com|title=Electronic Resources|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-electronic+resource.html[/tpl] Libraries offer many types of electronic resources, including subject research guides, indexes, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings and image databases.[tpl]cite web|last=The University of Chicago Library|title=Types of Electronic Resources|url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/net/types.html|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]

Sheehy's Guide is less international in its scope than Walford: "It seems that Walford is a somewhat better balanced work than Winchell, and is certainly much more comprehensive"--American Reference Books Annual, quoted in Walford, A.
