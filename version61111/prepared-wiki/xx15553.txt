[[Resistojet rocket]]

CATEGORIES: Spacecraft propulsion

A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion (electric propulsion) that provides thrust by heating a (typically non-reactive) fluid. Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.Electric Propulsion article in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology, 3rd Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, v.5, pp. 125-141, 2002
Resistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military Vela satellites, however they became used in commercial applications in 1980 with launch of first satellites in the INTELSAT-V program. Nowadays resistojet propulsion is used for orbit insertion, attitude control, and deorbit of LEO satellites, including satellites in the Iridium satellite constellation and do well in situations where energy is much more plentiful than mass, and where propulsion efficiency needs to be reasonably high but low thrust is acceptable.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
