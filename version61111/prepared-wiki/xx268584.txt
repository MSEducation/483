[[UltraMar Festival]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic music festivals

The UltraMar Festival is an electronic music festival in Latin America. It takes place during the first week of January, usually in various parts of the city of Cartagena, Colombia from 2004 until the present year, which is characterized by its duration format.
More than 130 international artists have participated in the festival, among whom are Armin Van Buuren, David Guetta, Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Roger Sanchez, Sasha, Deep Dish, Richie Hawtin and Axwell. In 2008, the Ultramar Festival joined with Summer Dance Festival, another important festival of the city of Cartagena, to form a unique event called UltraSummer Festival. 
The creator of the Ultramar Festival was DJ Moss, who shared has the console with artists such as Carl Cox, Armin Van Buuren, Sasha, Roger Sanchez, John Digweed, Paul Van Dyk, Tiesto, David Guetta, Hernan Cattaneo, Sharam, Sander Kleinenberg, Mauro Picotto, Marco Carola, Joy Kitikonti, Wally LÃ³pez, Paco Osuna, Chus & Ceballos, among many others. This helped him achieve international fame as a DJ and producer.
In 2011, the UltraMar Festival was canceled due to lack of organization of the site. Tickets for the event were sold before a deal with the site had been reached, and were later reimbursed. The 2012 edition of the festival is expected to take place in the city of Cartagena, Colombia.
