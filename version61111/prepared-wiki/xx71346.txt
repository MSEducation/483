==Early life and education==

Higgs was born in the Elswick district of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to an English father and Scottish mother.Staff (29 November 2012) Peter Higgs: Curriculum Vitae The University of Edinburgh, School of Physics and Astronomy, Retrieved 9 January 2012Sample, Ian. "The god of small things", The Guardian, 17 November 2007, weekend section.Macdonald, Kenneth (10 April 2013) Peter Higgs: Behind the scenes at the Universe. BBC. His father worked as a sound engineer for the BBC, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family moving around because of his father's job and later World War II, Higgs missed some early schooling and was taught at home. When his father relocated to Bedford, Higgs stayed behind with his mother in Bristol, and was largely raised there. He attended Cotham Grammar School in Bristol from 1941–46,The Cotham Grammar School, a High-Performing Speicalist Co-operative Academy The Dirac-Higgs Science Centre Retrieved 10 January 2013 where he was inspired by the work of one of the school's alumni, Paul Dirac, a founder of the field of quantum mechanics.
In 1946, at the age of 17, Higgs moved to City of London School, where he specialized in mathematics, then in 1947 to King's College London where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Physics in 1950 and achieved a master's degree in 1952. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,1851 Royal Commission Archives  and studied for his doctorate in molecular physics under the supervision of Charles Coulson and Christopher Longuet-Higgins. He was awarded his PhD in 1954 for a thesis entitled 'Some problems in the theory of molecular vibrations'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/peterhiggs.aspx|title=Professor Peter Higgs|author=King's College London|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl] He became a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh during his time there (1954–56), then held various posts at Imperial College London and University College London where he also became a temporary lecturer in Mathematics. He returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1960 to take up the post of Lecturer at the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics, allowing him to settle in the city he had enjoyed while hitchhiking to the Western Highlands as a student in 1949.Mackenzie, Kate (2012) "It Was Worth The Wait" The Interview, The University of Edinburgh Alumni Magazine, Winter 2012/13 He was promoted to Reader in 1970 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1983.
Higgs was promoted to a personal chair of Theoretical Physics at Edinburgh in 1980. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983, was awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize in 1984, and became a Fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1991. He retired in 1996 and became Emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh. In 2008 he received an Honorary Fellowship from Swansea University for his work in particle physics.

==Research career==

===Work in theoretical physics===

At Edinburgh Higgs first became interested in mass, developing the idea that particles – massless when the universe began – acquired mass a fraction of a second later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became known as the Higgs field). Higgs postulated that this field permeates space, giving mass to all elementary subatomic particles that interact with it.[ref]"Higgs particle", ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007.
[/ref]
The Higgs mechanism postulates the existence of the Higgs field which confers mass on quarks and leptons.[tpl]Cite doi |10.1007/s12045-012-0110-z[/tpl] However this causes only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass.
The original basis of Higgs' work came from the Japanese-born theorist and Nobel Prize laureate Yoichiro Nambu from the University of Chicago. Professor Nambu had proposed a theory known as spontaneous symmetry breaking based on what was known to happen in superconductivity in condensed matter; however, the theory predicted massless particles (the Goldstone's theorem), a clearly incorrect prediction.
Higgs is reported to have come up with the basic fundamentals of his theory after coming back to his Edinburgh New Town apartment from a failed weekend camping trip to the Highlands,Martin, Victoria (14 December 2011) Soon we’ll be able to pinpoint that particle The Scotsman, Retrieved 10 January  2013[ref]

although he has also said that there was no "eureka moment" in the development of the theory.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-17161657 | work=BBC News | title=Meeting the Boson Man: Professor Peter Higgs | date=24 February 2012[/tpl] He wrote a short paper exploiting a loophole in Goldstone's theorem (massless Goldstone particles need not occur when local symmetry is spontaneously broken in a relativistic theory) and published it in Physics Letters, a European physics journal edited at CERN, in Switzerland, in 1964.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0031-9163(64)91136-9[/tpl]
Higgs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (now called the Higgs mechanism), but the paper was rejected (the editors of Physics Letters judged it "of no obvious relevance to physics"). Higgs wrote an extra paragraph and sent his paper to Physical Review Letters, another leading physics journal, which published it later in 1964. This paper predicted a new massive spin-zero boson (now known as the Higgs Boson).Staff (5 January 2012) Brief History of the Higgs Mechanism The Edinburgh University School of Physics and Astronomy, Retrieved 10 January 2013[tpl]cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.508[/tpl]

[/ref]
had reached similar conclusions about the same time. In the published version Higgs quotes Brout and Englert and the third paper quotes the previous ones. The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Brout, and Englert were each recognized as milestone papers by Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://prl.aps.org/50years/milestones#1964 |title=Physical Review Letters – 50th Anniversary Milestone Papers |publisher=Prl.aps.org |date= |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl] While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy. The mechanism had been proposed in 1962 by Philip Anderson although he did not include a crucial relativistic model.[tpl]cite doi|10.1103/PhysRev.130.439[/tpl]
On 4 July 2012, CERN announced the ATLAS and CMS experiments had seen strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (GeV).
Speaking at the seminar in Geneva, Higgs commented "It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime."[ref][tpl]Cite news|title=Higgs boson-like particle discovery claimed at LHC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455|work=BBC|date=4 July 2012[/tpl]
[/ref] Ironically, this probable confirmation of the Higgs Boson was made at the same place where the editor of Physics Letters rejected Higgs paper.

==Other recognition==

===Civic award===

Higgs was the recipient of the Edinburgh Award for 2011. He is the fifth person to receive the Award, which was established in 2007 by the City of Edinburgh Council to honour an outstanding individual who has made a positive impact on the city and gained national and international recognition for Edinburgh.
Higgs was presented with an engraved loving cup by the Rt Hon George Grubb, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in a ceremony held at the City Chambers on Friday 24 February 2012. The event also marked the unveiling of his handprints in the City Chambers quadrangle, where they had been engraved in Caithness stone alongside those of previous Edinburgh Award recipients.
Prof Higgs was awarded with the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne on 4th September 2014.  The award was presented at the full meeting of Newcastle City Council on 2nd April 2014.  He was also honoured with a brass plaque installed on the Newcastle Quayside as part of the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative Local Heroes Walk of Fame.

===Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics===

On 6 July 2012, Edinburgh University announced a new centre named after Professor Higgs to support future research in theoretical physics. The Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics
brings together scientists from around the world to seek "a deeper understanding of how the universe works". The centre is currently based within the James Clerk Maxwell Building, home of the University's School of Physics and Astronomy. The university has also established a chair of theoretical physics in the name of Peter Higgs.

===Nobel Prize in Physics===

On 8 October 2013, it was announced that Peter Higgs and François Englert would share the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics "for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/press.pdf |title=Press release from Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl] Higgs did not know he had won the prize until a woman congratulated him in the street, since he did not have a mobile phone or any way of being contacted.Peter Higgs was told about Nobel Prize by passing motoristProf Peter Higgs did not know he had won Nobel Prize (BBC News)

==Political and religious views==

Higgs was an activist in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) while in London and later in Edinburgh, but resigned his membership when the group extended its remit from campaigning against nuclear weapons to campaigning against nuclear power too. He was a Greenpeace member until the group opposed genetically modified organisms.
Higgs was awarded the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (sharing it with Brout and Englert), but he refused to fly to Jerusalem to receive the award because it was a state occasion attended by the then president of Israel, Moshe Katsav, and Higgs is opposed to Israel's actions in Palestine.
Higgs is an atheist.[tpl]cite news|title=The god of small things|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/nov/17/sciencenews.particlephysics|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2013|first=Ian|last=Sample|date=17 November 2007|quote=The name has stuck, but makes Higgs wince and raises the hackles of other theorists. "I wish he hadn't done it," he says. "I have to explain to people it was a joke. I'm an atheist, but I have an uneasy feeling that playing around with names like that could be unnecessarily offensive to people who are religious."|location=London[/tpl] He has described Richard Dawkins as having adopted a “fundamentalist” view of non-atheists,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9770707/Has-Richard-Dawkins-found-a-worthy-opponent-at-last.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nigel | last=Farndale | title=Has Richard Dawkins found a worthy opponent at last? | date=29 December 2012[/tpl] (although Higgs had said that Dawkins in a way is almost a fundamentalist himself).

Usually this nickname for the Higgs boson is attributed to Leon Lederman, the author of the book The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?, but the name is the result of the insistence of Lederman's publisher: Lederman had originally intended to refer to it as the "goddamn particle".[tpl]Cite news |work=The Guardian |title=Father of the 'God Particle' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/jun/30/higgs.boson.cern |date=30 June 2008 |first=James |last=Randerson |location=London[/tpl]

==Family life==

Higgs has two sons — Chris, a computer scientist, and Jonny, a jazz musician. He also has two grandchildren, and all live in Edinburgh.
