Mordecai Place Historic District is an early 20th-century suburb located near downtown Raleigh, NC. The land was originally home to a plantation house built by Joel Lane in 1785. About 1824 the house underwent significant alterations that resulted in the Greek Revival dwelling that is today a house museum.
Beginning in 1916, land south of the house was sold and subdivided for residential development. When the Mordecai family sold the land, it made multiple stipulations. The neighborhood was named in honor of the plantation, and only whites could live on most of the land (about eighteen acres near the railroad could either be sold for residences for African Americans or used for factories).
Mordecai Place Historic District features a rich variety of the architectural styles popular in the first decades of the twentieth century, including the Craftsman Bungalow and Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Spanish Mission Revival, Tudor Revival, and Italian Renaissance Revival. There are also a few examples of a more typically rural vernacular style, the two-story, side-gabled I-house. Towards the middle of the twentieth century, smaller Cape Cods and Minimal Traditional houses were built. Mordecai Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 1998.
