Julis ([tpl]lang-ar|جولس[/tpl], [tpl]lang-he-n|ג'וּלִס[/tpl])Palmer, 1881, p.43 is a Druze village and local council in the Northern District of Israel. 

==Etymology==

According to local legend, the name is derived from "Julius," the name of a Roman commander who camped in the area. Others say it is from the Arabic word for "sitting" - "jalis", as it is located on lower hills than the surrounding villages, and thus seems to be sitting. 

==History==

According to the 1596 Ottoman  tax records  Julis had a predominantly Muslim (Druze?) population, with a total of 79 households. The taxable produce comprised  wheat, barley, "summer crops", fruit trees, and "goats and bees". Julis also had a press for olive oil or grape syrup.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977,  p. 191. Quoted in  Petersen, 2001, p. 191  During the 16th century there was also a small Jewish population.[tpl]cite book | author = Alex Carmel, Peter Schäfer and Yossi Ben-Artzi | title = The Jewish Settlement in Palestine, 634–1881 | series = Beihefte zum Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients : Reihe B, Geisteswissenschaften; Nr. 88 | location = Wiesbaden | publisher = Reichert | year = 1990 | page = 94[/tpl]
In the early part of the 18th century Julis was one of the major cotton producing villages in the area.Cohen, 1973, p. 12. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p.191 Later in the same century it was one of five villages in nahiya ("subdistrict") Sahil Akka (Acre coast), which were owned directly by the governor of Acre, and were exempt from the usual Ottoman taxes.Cohen, 1973, p. 126, 133. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 191
In 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called Djoules.Guérin, 1880, p. 8 He noted that "before arriving at Julis I came upon a small plateau pierced by many
cisterns. The cisterns and the cut stones which are built up in the modern houses show that
the place is the site of an ancient town or village. On a neighbouring hill a waly is consecrated to the Sheikh Aly.'"Guérin, 1880, p. 8, as translated by Conder and Kitchner, 1881, p. 169 In the late nineteenth century, Julis  was described as "a village built of stone containing about 200 Druzes, surrounded by olives and arable land."Conder and Kitchener, 1881,  I:146. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p.191

==Modern era==

Julis was captured by the Israeli army during Operation Dekel, 8-14 July 1948. Unlike many of the neighbouring villages the inhabitants were allowed to remain in their homes.Morris, Benny (1987) The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947-1949. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-33028-9. p.198
Julis was declared a local council in 1967. The head of the local council is Salman Hino. The population was estimated at 5,400 residents at the end of 2007.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2009/table3.pdf|publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Table 3 - Population of Localities Numbering Above 1,000 Residents and Other Rural Population|date=2008-06-30|accessdate=2008-10-04[/tpl] The annual population growth rate was 1.8%. All of the residents adhere to the Druze faith.
In 2000, a high percentage (72.1%, compared to 60.3% in Tel Aviv) of all high school students received a matriculation certificate. The mean income was NIS 5,067 per month (over the year 2007), compared to a national average of NIS 6,743.
