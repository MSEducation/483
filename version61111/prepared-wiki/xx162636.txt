[[Le Fort fracture of skull]]

CATEGORIES: Bone fractures, Injuries of head, Eponymous fracture classifications

Le Fort fractures are types of facial fractures involving the maxillary bone and surrounding structures in a usually bilateral and either horizontal, pyramidal or transverse way. LeFort fractures are classic in facial trauma. The Le Fort fracture was named after French surgeon René Le Fort (1869–1951.) Historically, Dr. Le Fort discovered these types of fracture patterns by examining break patterns of crush injuries of cadavers.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made based on physical exam findings with confirmation by axial CT.  The patient is taken for radiography of the head and neck then after obvious fracture signs the patient is taken to CT scan for more specific anatomic information.  To qualify for LeFort Fractures the pterygoid plates must be involved. These are seen posterior to the maxillary sinuses on axial CT and inferior to the orbital rim on coronal slices. Also, the palate is usually mobile on physical exam.

==Classification==

There are three types of Le Fort fractures:  

==Signs and Symptoms==

Lefort I - Slight swelling of the upper lip, ecchymosis is present in the buccal sulcus beneath each zygomatic arch, malocclusion, mobility of teeth. Impacted type of fractures may be almost immobile and it is only by grasping the maxillary teeth and applying a little firm pressure that a characteristic grate can be felt which is diagnostic of the fracture. Percussion of upper teeth results in cracked pot sound. Guérin's sign is present characterised by ecchymosis in the region of greater palatine vessels.
Lefort II and Lefort III (common) - Gross edema of soft tissue over the middle third of the face, bilateral circumorbital ecchymosis, bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, epistaxis, CSF rhinorrhoea, dish face deformity, diplopia, enophthalmos, cracked pot sound.
Lefort II - Step deformity at infraorbital margin, mobile mid face, anesthesia or paresthesia of cheek.
Lefort III - Tenderness and separation at frontozygomatic suture, lengthening of face, depression of occular levels, enophthalmos, hooding of eyes, tilting of occlusal plane with gagging on one side.
