==Biography==

Gary P. Nunn (born December 4, 1945)"Telling Stories, Writing Songs: An Album of Texas Songwriters" by Kathleen Hudson, University of Texas Press, Jul 5, 2010 is a Texas Country singer/songwriter. He was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma and moved to Brownfield, Texas as a sixth grader."Gary P. Nunn: West Texas Walk of Fame Member Returns to The Blue Light Live," Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, May 14, 2010. Nunn began his musical career as a 7th grader in a garage band in Brownfield, TX, where he was an honor student and all-around athlete. Upon graduation from high school, he attended Texas Tech University and South Plains College, while he also played with a Levelland, Texas rock band The Sparkles during the 1960s. In addition to the Sparkles, he played in such bands as the Shucks with former Cricket J.I. Allison, and the Night Spots with Don Caldwell. "I always had fun in Lubbock," said Nunn, "and I always enjoy going back there."
In 1968 he transferred to the University of Texas at Austin where he was a pharmacy major."Songs of Sheer Nunnsense: Gary P. Nunn Invites Us To Go Dancing," Dallas Morning News, Dec 4, 1997. Nunn was there at the start of the “cosmic cowboy” movement with one of Austin’s favorite bands, The Lavender Hill Express, with the late Rusty Weir."Off the Record Music News," Austin Chronicle, Oct 16, 2009 Nunn immersed himself further in the local music scene, playing bass for Michael Martin Murphey, Jerry Jeff Walker and Willie Nelson. From there he became a member of the Lost Gonzo Band that backed Walker and Murphy both on stage and in the studio.
Jerry Jeff Walker and the Lost Gonzo Band (including Nunn) released six albums through MCA Records over the course of four years."All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music" by Hal Leonard, Backbeat Books, 2003
The Lost Gonzo Band parted ways with Walker in 1977, after which they produced three albums for MCA and Capitol Records, finally disbanding in 1980.http://www.kbec.com/index.php/component/content/article/204-garypnunnbio Nunn then moved on to pursue a solo career."Gary P. Nunn," St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan 12, 2014.
In 1985, Nunn moved to a family farm in Oklahoma, running an 800-acre cattle ranch at the same time as his musical career. He established the Terlingua North Chili Cook-Off and Music Festival there, where now-popular acts like Pat Green and Cross Canadian Ragweed played early in their careers. “It seems every time we had a young and upcoming band up there, it was like they hit a diving board and just sprung into the air,” Nunn notes. And within today’s thriving Texas and Red Dirt (Music) scene, he’s a revered elder statesman to countless performers and songwriters who teethed and grew up on his music. “They’ve let me know I inspired them and showed them how it could be done.”http://www.liveatfloores.com/event/345355/  Nunn moved back to the Austin area in 2003.
Nunn's songs have been recorded by various nationally-known country artists, including Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Murphy, Tracy Nelson, David Alan Coe, Rosanne Cash, Willie Nelson and many others. With a continuing array of successful solo albums and an army of fans, Nunn has made a permanent mark on the Texas/Southwestern/Country/Folk music scene.
Along with being a touring performer, he has appeared on countless programs such as Nashville Now, The Nashville Network's Texas Connection, music videos and special appearances on TNN, Austin City Limits, Texas Rangers (baseball) games (singing the National Anthem), and other appearances too numerous to mention.http://www.texasmusicawards.org/images/Gary%20P%20Bio.doc
