WHMI-FM is a radio station broadcasting at 93.5 FM in Howell, Michigan.  The station broadcasts a classic rock hits format with local news, sports, traffic and weather and bills itself as Livingston County's Own 93-5. WHMI is owned by the Livingston Radio Company with Greg Jablonski serving as the President and CEO.
WHMI's signal covers Livingston County, Michigan, including Howell, Brighton, Fowlerville, Hamburg, and Hartland, and reaches the outskirts of the Detroit, Ann Arbor, Flint and Lansing markets. South of Detroit and Ann Arbor, however, WRQN in Bowling Green, Ohio, interferes, as does London, Ontario's CBCL in northern parts of the Detroit area.
WHMI began as an AM radio station at 1350 kHz in 1957. The call letters could be said to stand for both "Howell, Michigan" and "Heart of Michigan", a reference to an ad campaign of the late 1950s which promoted Livingston County as a good place to live.  An FM signal at 93.5 was added in 1977, simulcasting the AM.  Originally, WHMI was a small-town station typical of its era, with adult contemporary/MOR music and a strong news commitment.  
The AM signal, which was inferior to the FM signal, was silenced in 1995. Since then WHMI has been solely on FM. During the late 1990s, WHMI's music programming gradually evolved from hot AC into the current "classic hits" format.
In 2001, WHMI moved out of its longtime studios on Grand River Avenue in Howell into a state-of-the-art facility at 1277 Parkway Drive in Genoa Township, Michigan.
