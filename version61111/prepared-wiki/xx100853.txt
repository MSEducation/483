==Diving career==

Taylor represented Great Britain at three Summer Olympic Games and was a member of the Great Britain team for 16 years wining medals at all major international championships.http://www.leontaylor.co.uk/html/athlete.php In the diving events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he won the Silver medal in the men's synchronised 10 metre platform, with partner Peter Waterfield. It was Britain's first Olympic diving medal since Brian Phelps in 1960. He had come fourth in the same competition in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
Other achievements include Silver in the men's 10 m platform at the 2002 Commonwealth Games (he had won Bronze in 1998), and Bronze in the 10 m synchro at the 1999 European Aquatics Championships. At a national level, Taylor held both the 10 m platform and 10 m synchro titles from 1994 to 2006.http://www.leontaylor.co.uk/html/athlete.php
