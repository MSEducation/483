ISBN 0-306-80255-4 (pbk.), pp 549 and 550 (August, 1864) “August 1, Monday … McCausland’s cavalry, successful in its expedition against Chambersburg, Pa., … was now in trouble with more Federals closing in. … August 2, Tuesday Early’s cavalry under McCausland … sought to recross the Potomac after their Chambersburg raid … skirmishing at Old Town, Md., … August 3, Wednesday …  McCausland had made good his escape from Maryland to West Virginia with part of Early’s command.” McCausland’s and his element of the Army of Northern Virginia’s salvation is credited to a single, heroic, well placed artillery shot directed at perilously close range by Maryland Line (CSA) Lt. John R. McNulty from his Baltimore Light Artillery command, which was supporting Brigadier Bradley Tyler Johnson’s 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA. Lieutenant (later Major) McNulty’s shot has been called “one of the most brilliant achievements of the war.”Scott C.
