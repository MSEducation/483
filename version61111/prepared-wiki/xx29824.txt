Walther Hermann Nernst, ForMemRS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1942.0010[/tpl] (25 June 1864 – 18 November 1941) was a German physical chemist and physicist who is known for his theories behind the calculation of chemical affinity as embodied in the third law of thermodynamics, for which he won the 1920 Nobel Prize in chemistry.  Nernst helped establish the modern field of physical chemistry and contributed to electrochemistry, thermodynamics, solid state chemistry and photochemistry. He is also known for developing the Nernst equation.

Nernst was born in Briesen in West Prussia (now Wąbrzeźno, Poland) as son of Gustav Nernst (1827-1888) and Ottilie Nerger (1833-1876).http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz71086.html His father was a country judge. Nernst had three older sisters and one younger brother. The third sister died due to cholera. Nernst went to elementary school at Graudenz. He studied physics and mathematics at the universities of Zürich, Berlin, Graz and Würzburg, where he received his doctorate 1887. In 1889, he finished his habilitation at University of Leipzig.

===Personal Attributes===

It was said that Nernst was mechanically minded in that he was always thinking of ways to apply new discoveries to industry. Nernst's hobbies included hunting and fishing.[tpl]cite web|title=Walther Hermann Nernst|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/nernst.html|publisher=foundationNobel Prize|accessdate=25 Apr 2012[/tpl]

===Family History===

Nernst married in 1892 to Emma Lohmeyer with whom he had two sons and three daughters. Both of Walther's sons died fighting in World War I. He was a colleague of Svante Arrhenius, and suggested setting fire to unused coal seams to increase the global temperature. He was a vocal critic of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, and three daughters married Jewish men.  In 1933, the rise of Nazism led to the end of Nernst's career as a scientist.  Nernst died in 1941 and is buried near Max Planck in Göttingen, Germany.

===Career===

After some work at Leipzig, he founded the Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Göttingen. Nernst invented, in 1897 an electric lamp, using an incandescent ceramic rod. His invention, known as the Nernst lamp, was the successor to the carbon lamp and the precursor to the incandescent lamp.  Nernst researched osmotic pressure and electrochemistry. In 1905, he established what he referred to as his "New Heat Theorem", later known as the Third law of thermodynamics (which describes the behavior of matter as temperatures approach absolute zero).  This is the work for which he is best remembered, as it provided a means of determining free energies (and therefore equilibrium points) of chemical reactions from heat measurements. Theodore Richards claimed Nernst had stolen the idea from him, but Nernst is almost universally credited with the discovery.[tpl]cite book | last=Coffey | first=Patrick  | pages=78–81 | title=Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2008 | isbn=0-19-532134-0[/tpl]
In 1911, with Max Planck, he was the main organizer of the first Solvay Conference in Brussels. One year later, Max Liebermann portrayed Nernst.
In 1918, after studying photochemistry, he proposed the atomic chain reaction theory. The atomic chain reaction theory stated that when a reaction in which free atoms are formed and can decompose molecules into more free atoms which results in a chain reaction. His theory is closely related to the natural process of Nuclear Fission.
In 1920, he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in recognition of his work in thermochemistry. In 1924, he became director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry at Berlin, a position from which he retired in 1933. Nernst went on to work in electroacoustics and astrophysics.
Nernst developed an electric piano, the "Neo-Bechstein-Flügel" in 1930 in association with the Bechstein and Siemens companies, replacing the sounding board with radio amplifiers. The piano used electromagnetic pickups to produce electronically modified and amplified sound in the same way as an electric guitar.
His device, a solid-body radiator with a filament of rare-earth oxides, that would later be known as the Nernst glower, is important in the field of infrared spectroscopy. Continuous ohmic heating of the filament results in conduction. The glower operates best in wavelengths from two to 14 micrometers.
