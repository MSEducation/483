==Semi-Finals==

The teams qualifying for the semi-finals from group A were South Africa and New Zealand, while from Group B Australia and the West Indies went through. 
The results mean that for the first time since the 1975 World Cup, there is no team from the Indian subcontinent present in the semi-finals of a major cricketing trophy. http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6093794.stm

===1st Semi-Final: [tpl]cr|AUS[/tpl] v [tpl]cr|NZL[/tpl] (1 November)===

Daniel Vettori, New Zealand's No. 8, top scored with 79 in the match, but New Zealand were still beaten by Australia in the first semi-final at Mohali, Chandigarh. Earlier, Kyle Mills took four for 38 including both openers, while Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds both made 58 for Australia. New Zealand were at 35 for six, Glenn McGrath taking three and Nathan Bracken two wickets, when Vettori came in to bat, but he shared a century stand with Jacob Oram that lasted for more than 20 overs. With 15 overs remaining, New Zealand required 103 with four wickets in hand, but Oram was dismissed next ball and New Zealand bowled out with four overs remaining.

===2nd Semi-Final: [tpl]cr|RSA[/tpl] v [tpl]cr|West Indies[/tpl] (2 November)===

Chris Gayle made the highest score of the tournament thus far, batting through 44 overs unbeaten as West Indies won with six wickets and six overs to spare. He batted together with Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the first 26 overs, adding 154 runs before Chanderpaul retired hurt, and South Africa did get some wickets near the end. Earlier, Herschelle Gibbs and Abraham de Villiers put on 92 for South Africa's fourth wicket, after they were 96 for three in the 23rd over.

==Final: Australia v West Indies (5 November)==

Australia beat West Indies by eight wickets to win the Champions Trophy for the first time. West Indies were 65 for one in the eighth over, but Nathan Bracken took three wickets, and only Dwayne Bravo of the middle order batsmen passed 10 (21 off 47 balls). West Indies were bowled out for 138, Glenn McGrath and Shane Watson also taking two wickets each, before West Indies took two wickets in the first four overs. Shane Watson and Damien Martyn batted through without loss, however, only interrupted by the rain delay which also reduced Australia's target to 116 under the Duckworthâ€“Lewis method.
