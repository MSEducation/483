==Text==

The Greek text of this codex is representative of the Byzantine text-type, with a number of Caesarean readings.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, "The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration", Oxford University Press, (New York — Oxford, 2005), p. 77. According to Tischendorf its text is close to Codex Cyprius. According to Hermann Von Soden it is a result of Pamphil's recension.Frederik Wisse, The profile method for the classification and evaluation of manuscript evidence, as Applied to the Continuous Greek Text of the Gospel of Luke, William B. Eerdmans Publishing (Grand Rapids, 1982), p. 52, 64, 100.
Kurt and Barbara Aland gave the following textual profile of it 21, 21/2, 82, 3s.  This means the text of the codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 202 times, it agrees 7 times with the original text against the Byzantine and it agrees both with the Byzantine and original text 106 times. There are 12 independent or distinctive readings in this codex. On the basis of this profile, Alands considered the quality of the text to suit his Category III. Commonly, it is included in Family 1424 group of New Testament manuscripts.
In Matthew 1:11 it has the additional text also found in manuscripts Codex Koridethi, Σ, f1, 33, 258, Minuscules: 478, 661, 791, 954, 1216, 1230, 1354, 1604, ℓ 54, syrh and other manuscripts.NA26, p. 2; UBS3, p. 2. This variation was observed by Bernard de Montfaucon.[tpl]Cite book | author = Bernard Montfaucon | title = Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum | url = http://en.calameo.com/read/0001070443b15b4eb3655 | location = Paris | year = 1708 | page = 261[/tpl]
It contains the text of the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11), just as Γ, f1, 892, 1049, 1220, and 2661 also do.http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-John-PA.pdf In John 8:11 it has the reading:
which translates to "But this they said tempting him, that they might have to accuse him;" a dislocation of verse 6.NA26, p. 274  John 8:11 is usually quoted as "She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more".[tpl]cite book|title=Holy Bible, King James Version, Cambridge Edition|year=1900|location=John 8:11[/tpl]

==History==

Bernard de Montfaucon dated the manuscript to the 10th or 11th century, because of palaeographical similarities to the manuscripts housed in Italian libraries.[tpl]Cite book | author = Bernard Montfaucon | title = Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum | url = http://en.calameo.com/read/0001070443b15b4eb3655 | location = Paris | year = 1708 | page = 260[/tpl] Tischendorf dated it to the last half of the 9th century, because of similarities between liturgical notes of the codex and the Oxforder manuscript of Plato dated to the year 895. Tregelles dated it to the end of the 9th century or beginning of the 10th century. Currently it is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) to the 9th century.
The manuscript was brought from the East[tpl]where?|date=April 2012[/tpl] to Paris. It was called Campianus after François de Camps, who gave it to Louis XIV in 1707.Constantin von Tischendorf, Novum Testamentum Graece. Editio Septima, Lipsiae 1859, p. CLIX. It was used by the scholar Kuster in 1710 and reprinted by him for Mill's Novum Testamentum Graecum. The text was collated by S. P. Tregelles. It was examined and described by Bernard de Montfaucon, who gave its first description and first facsimile, and by Giuseppe Bianchini, who collated its text.G. Bianchini, Evangeliarium quadruplex latinae versionis antiquae seu veteris italicae (Rome, 1749)
It was added to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by the Swiss theologian, Wettstein, who gave siglum "M" to it.
In 1908 C. R. Gregory gave it the siglum "021".
Some non-biblical material of the codex, such as Synaxarion and Menologion, was published by Scholz[tpl]who|who is this?|date=April 2012[/tpl] in the same place as those of the Codex Cyprius, but with carelessness according to Tischendorf. Dean Burgon has observed that its "Harmony of the Gospels" is of the same type as in Codex Basilensis.
According to 19th century scholars like Tregelles, "it contains many good readings" and Scrivener said the manuscript has a good text. In the 20th century the manuscript remains largely neglected by scholars and its text is classified as "low valuable" (using the V Aland's Catalog).
Russell Champlin examined its text in the Gospel of Matthew and its relationship to the textual family E.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Russell Champlin | title = Family E and its Allies in Matthew | journal = S & D | volume = XXVIII | location = Salt Lake City | year = 1967 | pages = 163–169[/tpl][tpl]elucidate| annnnd? what did he find??|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Currently the codex is located in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.
The manuscript was cited in at least one critical edition of the Greek New Testament, UBS3.The Greek New Testament, ed. K. Aland, A. Black, C. M. Martini, B. M. Metzger, and A. Wikgren, in cooperation with INTF, United Bible Societies, 3rd edition, (Stuttgart 1983), p. XVI. It is not cited in UBS4,The Greek New Testament, ed. B. Aland, K. Aland, J. Karavidopoulos, C. M.
