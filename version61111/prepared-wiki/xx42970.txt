When the Our Miss Brooks TV series, which starred Eve Arden, underwent a change in format, his character Walter Denton was written off this series. Then, Crenna joined the cast of the comedy series, The Real McCoys as Luke McCoy. Kathleen Nolan was cast as his young wife, Kate McCoy in this series.  Later, Crenna became one of the four directors of the series during its six-year run (1957-1963).
Crenna portrayed the state senator James Slattery of  California in the TV series Slattery's People (1965–66), and for his acting in this series, he was twice nominated for Emmy Awards with slightly different names: for "Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment", in 1965, and for "Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series", in 1965. Crenna was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for "Best TV Star - Male" in 1965, for this same role.
