The new building was a project of the Public Works Administration, and at the time of its founding was on the fringes of developed Salem. The name of Salem High School was changed in 1954 to North Salem High School when South Salem High School opened that year.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.salemhistory.net/education/overview.htm |title= A General History of Education in Salem |publisher= Salem Online History (Salem Public Library) |accessdate= March 5, 2009[/tpl]  Over the years, many additions have been made to the building, with the latest addition, the West Wing, being completed in 2001.
