==Transport links==

London bus routes 1, 4, 26, 59, 68, 76, 77, 139, 168, 171, 172, 176, 188, 211, 243, 341, 381, 507, 521, RV1, X68 and night buses N1, N68, N76, N171, N343 and N381. Some buses call at stops by the side of the station on Waterloo Road, others at Tenison Way, a short distance from the Victory Arch. These stops replace a former bus station at the lower (Waterloo Road) level where there are now retail outlets and an expanded entrance to the Underground.

==Services==

===Waterloo Main===

The main part of the railway station complex is known as "Waterloo Main" or simply Waterloo. This is the London terminus for services towards the south coast and the south-west of England. Waterloo has 19 terminal platforms in use, making it the joint biggest station in the UK in terms of platform numbers with [tpl]stnlnk|London Victoria[/tpl]. The intention is to bring platform 20 of the former International Station into use as part of Waterloo Main early in 2014. The station is managed by Network Rail, and all regular trains are operated by South West Trains.

===Waterloo International===

Waterloo International was the terminus for Eurostar international trains from 1994 until 2007, when they transferred to new international platforms at [tpl]stnlnk|St. Pancras[/tpl]. Waterloo International's five platforms were numbered 20 to 24.

===Waterloo East===

Adjacent to the main station is a through station called "Waterloo East", the last stop on the South Eastern Main Line towards London before the terminus at Charing Cross. This has four platforms, known as A to D to avoid confusion with the numbered platforms in the main station among staff who work at both stations. Waterloo East is managed and branded separately from the main station. Trains go to southeast London, Kent and parts of East Sussex. As of 2008 all regular services are operated by Southeastern (Southern withdrew its services to Charing Cross due to capacity constraints on the South Eastern Main Line west of London Bridge).

==Waterloo Underground station==

Waterloo is served by the Bakerloo, Jubilee, Northern (Charing Cross branch) and Waterloo & City lines. It is one of only two London terminals without a close connection to the Circle Line, the other being London Bridge.
The Waterloo and City Line is open Mondays to Saturdays only as it is intended almost exclusively for commuters who work in the City of London.

==Future==

===Platform lengthening project===

In order to increase capacity on South West Trains' overcrowded suburban services into Waterloo, there have for several years been plans to increase train lengths from 8 cars to 10. This would require the lengthening of platforms and in particular platforms 1 to 4, which will be a technically complex operation as it will entail a substantial repositioning of track-work and points. SWT also says it would need to have access to at least three of the currently disused international platforms 20 to 24 (see below). Further progress depends on decisions by the Government, and SWT says that until then it cannot proceed with ordering longer trains.[tpl]cite news |title= 10-car SWT hangs in balance |work=Modern Railways |location=London |page=52 |date=December 2010[/tpl]

===Former international platforms===

Since the transfer of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20-24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and there are proposals to convert the former international station to domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services, including the removal of equipment such as customs control facilities, at an estimated cost of between £50,000 and £100,000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3042 |title=8 year wait till commuters can use all Waterloo Eurostar platforms |date=1 December 2007| work=London SE1 community website |accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl]
However, the conversion of the remaining platforms has been delayed as it would require further alterations to the station infrastructure. It is now intended to reuse the international platforms for Windsor services. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1 million.
The project has been criticised for its delayed completion date;[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3567 |title=Waterloo International terminal platform reopening delayed |date=21 October 2008 |work=London SE1 community website |accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl] in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23742350-details/Delayed%3A+platforms+for+Waterloo+commuters+will+not+arrive+until+2014/article.do |title=Delayed: platforms for Waterloo commuters will not arrive until 2014 |last=Waugh |first=Paul |date=10 September 2009|newspaper=London Evening Standard|accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl]
In December 2011, South West Trains confirmed that platform 20 will be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These will be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock.[tpl]cite press release |publisher = South West Trains | title =London commuters to benefit from longer peak time trains |date=23 December 2011 |url=http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/extracapacity.aspx[/tpl]
From 4 July 2010 to 2 January 2011, two of the disused platforms hosted a theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience is seated either side of the actual railway track. The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.[ref]

===Heathrow Airport links===

Waterloo station was to be the central London terminus for the proposed Heathrow Airtrack rail service. This project, promoted by BAA, envisaged the construction of a spur from [tpl]stnlnk|Staines[/tpl] on the Waterloo to Reading Line to Heathrow Airport, creating direct rail links from the airport to Waterloo, [tpl]stnlnk|Woking[/tpl] and Guildford. Airtrack was planned to open in 2015, but was abandoned by BAA during 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/page/Heathrow%5EGeneral%5EOur+business+and+community%5EHeathrow+transformation%5EHeathrow+AirTrack/100046e4daa55110VgnVCM10000036821c0a/448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a/ |title=Heathrow Airtrack |publisher=BAA|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] However in October 2011 Wandsworth Council proposed a revised plan called Airtrack-Lite, which would provide trains from Waterloo to Heathrow via the same proposed spur from Staines to Heathrow, but by diverting or splitting current services the frequency of trains over the existing level crossings would not increase. BAA's earlier plan had controversially proposed more trains over the level crossings, leading to concerns that they would be closed to motorists and pedestrians for too long.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/site/scripts/news_article.php?newsID=10776 |title=New Airtrack plan to connect Heathrow |publisher=Wandsworth Council |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 May 2012[/tpl]

===Crossrail 3===

Crossrail 3, backed by former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and incumbent Boris Johnson would include a [tpl]convert|4|km|0|disp=flip[/tpl] underground section in new tunnels connecting London Euston station and Waterloo, connecting the West Coast Main Line corridor with services to the south.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/livingstone-backs-plans-for-two-more-crossrails/8614690.article |work=New Civil Engineer |location =London |author=Hansford, Mark |title= Livingstone backs plans for two more Crossrails |date=12 May 2011[/tpl] However, Crossrail 3 is an unofficial proposal and not within the remit of Cross London Rail Links Ltd (and is not safeguarded as Crossrail 2 is).

In the 1990s, after Waterloo station was chosen as the British terminus for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/208881.stm |title=UK Waterloo insult to French visitors | work= BBC News Online | location =London| date=6 November 1998[/tpl]. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).

===Film===

===Television===

Waterloo has frequently appeared in television productions, including Waking the Dead, The Commander, Spooks, The Apprentice, The Bill, Top Gear, and Only Fools and Horses.

===Art===

Two of the most famous images of the station are the two Southern Railway posters "Waterloo Station - War" and "Waterloo Station - Peace", painted by Helen McKie for the 1948 centenary of the station. The two pictures show hundreds of busy travellers all in exactly the same positions and poses, but with altered clothing and roles. The preparatory sketches for these were drawn between 1939 and 1942.The Watercolours + Works on Paper Fair: The evolution of Helen McKie's iconic posters
Other famous paintings of the station include the huge 1967 work by Terence Cuneo, in the collection of the National Railway Museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nationalrailwaymuseum.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/moving-waterloo-station|title=Moving Waterloo Station|date=22 July 2010|publisher=National Railway Museum|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl] A statue of Terence Cuneo by Philip Jackson was installed on the concourse in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=latest&id=7133|accessdate=25 January 2013|publisher=London Borough of Lambeth|year=2004|title=Statue of Terence Cuneo, Waterloo Station[/tpl]
In 1981, Shell UK commissioned a work of art to be exhibited above the Shell exit on a poster site which had been acquired from Esso, Shell’s great rival. The massive canvas measured 26 ft long x10 ft high. The artist commissioned to paint the mural was Jane Boyd,Jane Boyd biography a recent graduate from Camberwell College of Arts. The work, entitled The Generation of Alternatives, was selected by a panel of judges comprising artists David Gentleman, John Piper and Gillian Ayres and it was viewed during execution and for a further six months by the quarter of a million people who passed through London Waterloo Station everyday – including several thousand Shell UK staff, bound for Shell Centre and Shell Mex House through what was known as the Shell Exit. One important element of the project was said by commission organiser John Collyer to be "the pleasure and interest enjoyed by Waterloo commuters as the painting was created before their eyes. Having acquired the site we wanted a project to intrigue and entertain. A mural being painted above travellers’ head seem to fit the bill”.The New Standard, 11 June 1981; SUKO News January 1981

===Books===

In Jerome K Jerome's 1889 comic novel, Three Men in a Boat, the protagonists spend some time in the station, trying to find their train to Kingston upon Thames:
After being given contradictory information by every railway employee they speak to, they eventually bribe a train driver to take his train to their destination.
In Robert Louis Stevenson & Lloyd Osbourne's novel The Wrong Box, much of the farcical plot revolves around the misdelivery of two boxes at Waterloo station, and the attempts by the various protagonists to retrieve them. This description of the station on Sunday is from the novel:
