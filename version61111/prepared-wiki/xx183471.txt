The 1999 Indianapolis Colts were the only other team to accomplish a 10-game turnaround, winning 13 games after winning 3 in 1998. Additionally, Miami won the AFC East, becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division after only having one win the previous season.

With a league-worst 1–15 record in 2007,[tpl]cite web|title = 2007 NFL Regular Season Standings|publisher=NFL |url = http://www.nfl.com/standings?category=div&season=2007-REG&split=Overall|accessdate =March 3, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080309022542/http://www.nfl.com/standings?category=div&season=2007-REG&split=Overall| archivedate= March 9, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] the Dolphins held the first pick in the 2008 NFL Draft and selected Michigan offensive tackle Jake Long. The offseason also saw the departure of two Pro Bowlers and long-time Dolphins with the release of linebacker Zach Thomas and trade of defensive end Jason Taylor.

==Offseason personnel moves==

===Front office===

On December 27, 2007, Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga hired former NFL head coach and ESPN analyst Bill Parcells as Executive Vice President of Football Operations. Parcells signed a four-year deal with the Dolphins less than a day after turning down a similar offer from the Atlanta Falcons.[tpl]cite web | title = Parcells signs four-year deal to head Dolphins' football operations |publisher=ESPN | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3162909 | accessdate =January 2, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071230020223/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3162909| archivedate= December 30, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Just a few days after Parcells' hiring, three men were dismissed from the Dolphins' front office.[tpl]cite web | title = Three Leave Dolphins | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5617 | accessdate =January 2, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080103113349/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5617 |archivedate = January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The most notable of which was general manager Randy Mueller, who was hired by the team in 2005.[tpl]cite news | title = Randy Mueller hired as Dolphins GM |work=USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/dolphins/2005-06-06-mueller-hired_x.htm | accessdate =January 2, 2008 | date=June 6, 2005[/tpl] Also dismissed were Assistant Director of Player Personnel Mike Baugh and College Scouting Coordinator Rick Thompson.
Three days after Mueller's dismissal, Parcells hired Jeff Ireland as the team's new general manager. Ireland had worked for the Dallas Cowboys the past seven years, including the last three as Vice President of College and Pro Scouting. Ireland had worked with Parcells previously, when the latter was head coach of the Cowboys from 2003 to 2006. Although Ireland was officially given final say on personnel decisions, it was speculated that Parcells was actually in control, and did not hold the title of General Manager so that the team may hire a front office executive from another team.[tpl]cite web | title =  Tuna helper on the menu for afternoon introduction | work = DolphinsInDeth.blogspot.com | url = http://dolphinsindepth.blogspot.com/2007/12/tuna-helper-on-menu-for-afternoon.html | accessdate =January 6, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071230150656/http://dolphinsindepth.blogspot.com/2007/12/tuna-helper-on-menu-for-afternoon.html| archivedate= December 30, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
On January 15, the Dolphins reeled in another former Cowboys executive when they hired Brian Gaine as Assistant Director of Player Personnel.[tpl]cite web | title =  Brian Gaine Named Assistant Director Of Player Personnel | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5634 | accessdate =January 16, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080119103615/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5634 |archivedate = January 19, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Gaine had previously spent the past three seasons as the Cowboys' Assistant Director of Pro Scouting, working with both Parcells and Ireland during that time.
Following the 2008 NFL Draft, it was reported on May 1 that the Dolphins had fired scouts Ellis Rainsberger, Jack Glowik and Roger Pollard.[tpl]cite web | title =  Fins Firing Scouts | work = ProFootballTalk.com | url = http://www.profootballtalk.com/2008/05/01/fins-firing-scouts/ | accessdate =May 5, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080502105516/http://www.profootballtalk.com/2008/05/01/fins-firing-scouts/| archivedate= May 2, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The team's vice president of media relations, Harvey Greene, said Rainsberger had retired and did not comment on the other two reported firings.

===Coaches===

====Head coach====

Just one day after hiring of Jeff Ireland as general manager, the Dolphins fired head coach Cam Cameron after just one season on the job. Cameron led the Dolphins to an NFL worst 1–15 record in 2007, which was also the worst in franchise history.[tpl]cite web | title = 2007 NFL Regular Season Standings |publisher=NFL  | url = http://www.nfl.com/standings?category=div&season=2007-REG&split=Overall | accessdate =January 3, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080101021836/http://www.nfl.com/standings?category=div&season=2007-REG&split=Overall| archivedate= January 1, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Miami Dolphins Team Encyclopedia | work = pro-football-reference.com | url = http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/ | accessdate =January 3, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071221065403/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/| archivedate= December 21, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Additionally, all but two members of the coaching staff were dismissed. The only coaches retained were assistant special teams coach Steve Hoffman and linebackers coach George Edwards. Both Hoffman and Edwards were coaches for the Dallas Cowboys during Ireland's tenure with the team.[tpl]cite web | title = Profile – Steve Hoffman | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_hoffman_s.asp | accessdate =January 3, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019161508/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_hoffman_s.asp |archivedate = October 19, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Profile – George Edwards | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_edwards_g.asp | accessdate =January 3, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090226012635/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_edwards_g.asp |archivedate = February 26, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

====Assistants====

Parcells and Ireland made their first coaching staff addition on January 7, luring Ole Miss offensive coordinator David Lee to be quarterbacks coach. Lee, who briefly followed Houston Nutt to Ole Miss after serving as his offensive coordinator at Arkansas in 2007, worked with Parcells and Ireland as the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach from 2003 to 2006. The addition fueled speculation that Sparano was indeed going to the next head coach of the Miami Dolphins.
Two days after hiring Sparano as their head coach, the Dolphins made their second assistance coach hiring. On January 18, Mike Maser was named the team's new offensive line coach. Maser had previously served in the same capacity for the Carolina Panthers from 2003 to 2006, and worked with Sparano when both were assistants for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2002.
Over the next week, the Dolphins filled various positions on Sparano's staff. On January 22, former Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach James Saxon was hired in the same capacity for the Dolphins.[tpl]cite web | title = Dolphins Add Marcus And Saxon To Coaching Staff | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5646 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229044800/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5646 |archivedate = February 29, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Also hired that day was former Atlanta Falcons strength and conditioning coach Evan Marcus, who took the same job with Miami.
On January 23, the Dolphins added four more assistant coaches to their staff when they named Paul Pasqualoni as their defensive coordinator, Todd Bowles as assistant head coach/secondary, Kacy Rodgers as defensive line coach and David Corrao as defensive quality control coach.[tpl]cite web | title = Dolphins Add Four Coaches To Staff | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5650 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080221183736/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5650 |archivedate = February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Pasqualoni, Bowles and Rodgers all came from the Dallas Cowboys' staff, while Corrao was most recently linebackers coach at the University of Mississippi.
A day later, former UCLA head coach Karl Dorrell was named the team's new wide receivers coach.[tpl]cite web | title = Karl Dorrell Named Dolphins' Wide Receivers Coach | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5652 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229044805/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5652 |archivedate = February 29, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Five more coaches were added to the staff on January 28 when the Dolphins named John Bonamego as their special teams coordinator, George DeLeone as their tight ends coach, David Puloka as assistant strength and conditioning coach, Jim Reid as outside linebackers coach and Steve Bush as offensive quality control coach.[tpl]cite web | title = Dolphins Hire Five Coaches | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5657 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080201143022/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5657 |archivedate = February 1, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
The Dolphins made their final addition to the staff on February 4, hiring Dan Henning as offensive coordinator.[tpl]cite web | title = Dolphins Tab Dan Henning As Offensive Coordinator | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5670 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080209120547/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5670 |archivedate = February 9, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Henning, who had most recently served as offensive coordinator for the Carolina Panthers from 2002 to 2006, had previous worked for the Dolphins under Don Shula as quarterbacks and wide receivers coach in 1979–1980.

====Final staff====

When the Dolphins' coaching staff was completed with the hiring of offensive coordinator Dan Henning on February 14, only two of the 17 assistant coaches under Sparano (Edwards and Hoffman) were holdovers from the previous season's staff.[tpl]cite web | title = Sparano Completes Staff Of "Idea People" | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5676 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080211064616/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5676 |archivedate = February 11, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Three of the new coaches (Bowles, Pasqualoni and Rodgers) had experience with Parcells, Ireland and Sparano in Dallas.
