==Controversy==

A controversy has erupted over the state government's proposed move to rename Ujjayanta Palace, erstwhile royal abode of the Manikya kings, to Tripura State Museum.
Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra, has written to Vice President Hamid Ansari (who will inaugurate the new museum) protesting against the move, INPT objected to the move saying deletion of the word 'Ujjayanta' is aimed at hurting sentiments of tribal populace of the state.
Ujjayanta Palace served as the Tripura state legislative assembly till 2011. The royal family is reported to have spent Rs 1 million despite financial constraints at the time. Martin & Burn Company was assigned to build the palace which was completed in 1901.
The government also said it had already decided to build a statue of Maharaj Radha Kishore Manikya at the museum premises.
