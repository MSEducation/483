Sir Thomas Harries or Harris, 1st Baronet (died around 1649) was an English lawyer.
He was the eldest of four sons of John Harries, of Cruckton in Shropshire. He became a serjeant-at-law in 1589 and was knighted. In 1603 he bought Tong Castle from Sir Edward Stanley, and on 12 April 1623 was created a Baronet, of Tong Castle.George Edward Cockayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900
He was married to Eleanor, daughter of Roger Gifford, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, but died without surviving male issue, when the baronetcy became extinct. Tong Castle passed to the family of his daughter Elizabeth, who married William Pierrepont; in 1764 Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull sold it to George Durant.
