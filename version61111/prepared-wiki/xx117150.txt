CATEGORIES: Ecclesiastical provinces of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America

Province 8 (VIII) is one of nine ecclesiastical provinces making up the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It is composed of sixteen dioceses in the nine states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Also part of the province are the Episcopal Diocese of Taiwan, which has been a diocese of the Church since 1960; and the Navajoland Area Mission which was established in 1979 to serve the specific spiritual and cultural needs of the Navajo Nation.
The province encompasses more than a third of the land mass of the United States, and nearly twenty percent of the country's population. Because of its sheer size, the province claims to contain the most demographically diverse population in the world.
