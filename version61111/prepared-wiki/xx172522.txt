Indigenous Australians are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country |title=About Australia:Our Country |publisher=Australian Government |quote=Australia's first inhabitants, the Aboriginal people, are believed to have migrated from some unknown point in Asia to Australia between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. [/tpl] Recent findings indicate that Indigenous Australians are  descended from the first humans to migrate out of Africa. They migrated from Africa to Asia around 70,000 years agohttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6052/94.full and arrived in Australia around 50,000 years ago."Aboriginal Australians descend from the first humans to leave Africa, DNA sequence reveals", Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).http://www.illumina.com/documents/icommunity/article_2012_04_Aboriginal_Genome.pdf The Torres Strait Islanders are indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are at the northernmost tip of Queensland near Papua New Guinea. The term "Aboriginal" is traditionally applied to only the indigenous inhabitants of mainland Australia and Tasmania, along with some of the adjacent islands, i.e.: the "first peoples". Indigenous Australians is an inclusive term used when referring to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders.
The earliest definite human remains found to date are that of Mungo Man, which have been dated at about 40,000 years old (although comparison of the mitochondrial DNA with that of ancient and modern Aborigines indicate Mungo Man is unrelated to Australian Aborigines). However, the time of arrival of the ancestors of Indigenous Australians is a matter of debate among researchers, with estimates dating back as far as 125,000 years ago."When did Australia's earliest inhabitants arrive?", University of Wollongong, 2004.

===Terminology===

Though Indigenous Australians are seen as being broadly related as part of what has been called the Australoid race,Huxley, Thomas. On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006.  there are significant differences in social, cultural and linguistic customs between the various Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups.
The word aboriginal has been in the English language since at least the 16th century, to mean, "first or earliest known, indigenous". It comes from the Latin word aborigines, derived from ab (from) and origo (origin, beginning).Aborigine - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31). Retrieved 2 August 2013. The word was used in Australia to describe its indigenous peoples as early as 1789. It soon became capitalised and employed as the common name to refer to all Indigenous Australians.
Strictly speaking, Aborigine is the noun and Aboriginal the adjectival form; however the latter is often also employed to stand as a noun. Use of either Aborigine(s) or Aboriginal(s) as a  to refer to individuals has acquired negative connotations in some sectors of the community, and it is generally regarded as insensitive and even offensive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2004/pdf/aboriginal_terms.pdf |title=Communicating Positively: A guide to appropriate Aboriginal terminology |publisher=NSW Health |accessdate=3 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/dead_reckoning/private_archives/a-f/aboriginal_people|title = Dead Reckoning: a guide to family history research in WA: Aboriginal People|publisher = State Library of Western Australia|accessdate = 3 August 2013[/tpl] The more acceptable and correct expression is Aboriginal Australians or Aboriginal people. The term Indigenous Australians, which also includes Torres Strait Islander peoples, has found increasing acceptance, particularly since the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|title=Appropriate Terminology, Indigenous Australian Peoples|url=http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/community/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf|work=General Information Folio 5|publisher=Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia|accessdate=10 May 2011|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Regional groups===

The broad term Aboriginal Australians includes many regional groups that often identify under names from local Indigenous languages. These include:
These larger groups may be further subdivided; for example, Anangu (meaning a person from Australia's central desert region) recognises localised subdivisions such as Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara, Ngaanyatjarra, Luritja and Antikirinya. It is estimated that, prior to the arrival of British settlers, the population of Indigenous Australians was approximately 318,000–750,000 across the continent.

===Torres Strait Islanders===

The Torres Strait Islanders possess a heritage and cultural history distinct from Aboriginal traditions. The eastern Torres Strait Islanders in particular are related to the Papuan peoples of New Guinea, and speak a Papuan language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ulk |title=Ethnologue report for language code: ulk |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=9 August 2009[/tpl] Accordingly, they are not generally included under the designation "Aboriginal Australians." This has been another factor in the promotion of the more inclusive term "Indigenous Australians".
Six percent of Indigenous Australians identify themselves fully as Torres Strait Islanders. A further 4% of Indigenous Australians identify themselves as having both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal heritage.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, Australian Bureau of Statistics 2004. Retrieved 21 June 2007.
The Torres Strait Islands comprise over 100 islandsPlaces – Torres Strait Islands ABC Radio Australia website, 2005. Retrieved 21 June 2007. which were annexed by Queensland in 1879. Many Indigenous organisations incorporate the phrase "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander" to highlight the distinctiveness and importance of Torres Strait Islanders in Australia's Indigenous population.
Eddie Mabo was from Mer or Murray Island in the Torres Strait, which the famous Mabo decision of 1992 involved.

===Black===

The term "blacks" has been used to refer to Indigenous Australians since European settlement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4219798 |title=08 Nov 1828 - Classified Advertising |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] While originally related to skin colour, the term is used today to indicate Aboriginal heritage or culture in general and refers to people of any skin pigmentation.[tpl]cite news|author=Dylan Bird |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html |title=Andrew Bolt On Trial On Racism Charges |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] In the 1970s, many Aboriginal activists, such as Gary Foley proudly embraced the term "black", and writer Kevin Gilbert's ground-breaking book from the time was entitled Living Black. The book included interviews with several members of the Aboriginal community including Robert Jabanungga reflecting on contemporary Aboriginal culture.

==History==

===Arrival and occupation of Australia===

Most scholars date the arrival of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, with a possible range of up to 125,000 years ago.
The earliest anatomically modern human remains found in Australia (and outside of Africa) are those of Mungo Man which have been dated at 42,000 years old.[tpl]cite journal| author = Bowler JM, Johnston H, Olley JM, Prescott JR, Roberts RG, Shawcross W, Spooner NA. |title = New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia | journal = Nature |volume = 421 |issue = 6925 | year = 2003 | pages = 837–40 | pmid = 1259451 | doi = 10.1038/nature01383|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..837B [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author = Olleya JM, Roberts RG, Yoshida H and Bowler JM |title =Single-grain optical dating of grave-infill associated with human burials at Lake Mungo, Australia | journal =Quaternary Science Reviews |volume = 25 |issue =19–20 | year = 2006 | pages = 2469–2474 |doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2005.07.022 |bibcode = 2006QSRv...25.2469O [/tpl] The initial comparison of the mitochondrial DNA from the skeleton known as Lake Mungo 3 (LM3) with that of ancient and modern Aborigines indicated that Mungo Man is not related to Australian Aborigines.[tpl]cite journal|author = Adcock GJ, Dennis ES, Easteal S, Huttley GA, Jarmiin LS, Peacock WJ, Thorne A|title = Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins | journal = PNAS |volume= 98|issue = 2|pages=537–542 |year =2001|pmid = 11209053|doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.2.537|pmc = 14622|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..537A [/tpl] However these findings have been met with a general lack of acceptance in scientific communities, the sequence is criticized as there has been no independent testing and these results may be due to posthumous modification and thermal degradation of the DNA.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cooper A, Rambaut A, Macaulay V, Willerslev E, Hansen AJ, Stringer C | title = Human origins and ancient human DNA | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5522 | pages = 1655–6 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11388352 | doi = 10.1126/science.292.5522.1655 | url = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The thermal history of human fossils and the likelihood of successful DNA amplification |doi=10.1016/S0047-2484(03)00106-4 |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/c_smithpdf/Smith_et_al_Therma_ageJHE03.pdf |format=PDF|year=2003|author=Chamberlain, C |journal = Journal of Human Evolution|volume=45|pages=203–17|pmid=14580590|last2=Chamberlain|first2=AT|last3=Riley|first3=MS|last4=Stringer|first4=C|last5=Collins|first5=MJ|issue=3[/tpl]The spread of people to Australia Australian MuseumForum Abstract, critiques and authors response.

It is generally believed that Aboriginal people are the descendants of a single migration into the continent, split from the first modern human populations to leave Africa, 64,000 to 75,000 years ago,Aboriginal culture one of world's oldest, Australian Geographic, 23 September 2011 although a minority propose that there were three waves of migration,Keith Windschuttle and Tim Gillin, Quadrant Magazine, June 2002: The extinction of the Australian pygmies. most likely island hopping by boat during periods of low sea levels (see Prehistory of Australia). Aboriginal people seem to have lived a long time in the same environment as the now extinct Australian megafauna.Australia's Megafauna Coexisted With Humans. ScienceDaily. 31 May 2005.
Genetically, while some Indigenous Australians have a Melanesian and Papuan admixture, most are more closely related to Central and South Asian populations.[tpl]cite journal |title=Whole-Genome Genetic Diversity in a Sample of Australians with Deep Aboriginal Ancestry |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |year=2010 |volume=87 |pages=297–305 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.07.008 |author=McEvoy et al. |pmc=2917718 |issue=2, number 2[/tpl] "Some individuals are close to the Oceanic cluster, composed of MEL and PAP individuals but most occupy a wide range on PC2 between Europeans and East Asians, generally falling in an area occupied by Central and South Asian populations." Research indicates a single founding Sahul group with subsequent isolation between regional populations which were relatively unaffected by later migrations from the Asian mainland. The research also suggests a divergence from other global lineages ~32,000 years ago with a rapid population expansion about 5000 years ago. A 2011 genetic study found evidence that Aboriginal peoples carry some of the genes associated with the Denisovan peoples of Asia suggesting that modern and archaic humans interbred in Asia before the migration to Australia.[ref]An Aboriginal Australian genome reveals separate human dispersals into Asia.

Aboriginal people mainly lived as hunter-gatherers, hunting and foraging for food from the land. Although Aboriginal society was generally mobile, or semi-nomadic, moving due to the changing food availability found across different areas as seasons changed, the mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region, and there were permanent settlements[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/budj-bim/|title = National Heritage Places - Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape|publisher = Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|accessdate = 13 August 2013[/tpl] and agricultureFlood, Josephine (1984), "Archaeology of the Dreamtime" (Uni of Hawaii Press) in some areas. The greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the River Murray valley in particular.
There is evidence that some Aboriginal populations in northern Australia regularly traded with Makassan fishermen from Indonesia before the arrival of Europeans.Macknight, C.C.

At the time of first European contact, it is generally estimated that the pre-1788 population was 314,000, while recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 500,000 to 750,000 could have been sustained, with some ecologists estimating a population of up to a million people was possible.Population Distribution, Migration and Climate Change in Australia: An Exploration NCCARF March 2012Neil Thomson, pp153, Indigenous Australia: Indigenous Health in James Jupp (ed), The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their Origins, Cambridge University Press, 2001. ISBN 052180789 This article says the likely aboriginal population of Australia in 1788 was around 750,000 or even over a million. There was also a chart from the Australian Bureau of Statistics – Experimental Projections of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population, Canberra, ABS, 1998 – with estimated populations for each state and for Australia as a whole total being 418,841. The population was split into 250 individual nations, many of which were in alliance with one another, and within each nation there existed several clans, from as few as 5 or 6 to as many as 30 or 40. Each nation had its own language and a few had several.[tpl]cite web|title=Gadian Society|url=http://www.gadian.org/Aboriginal.htm|work=Aboriginal|publisher=Gadian Society|accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl]

===Since British settlement===

British colonisation of Australia began with the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in 1788.
One immediate consequence of British settlement was a series of European epidemic diseases such as measles, smallpox and tuberculosis. In the 19th century, smallpox was the principal cause of Aboriginal deaths.
A smallpox epidemic in 1789 is estimated to have killed up to 90% of the Darug people. Some scholars have attributed the outbreak to European settlers,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneybarani.com.au/sites/aboriginal-people-and-place-2/ |title=Aboriginal People and Place|author=Sydney Barani|publisher=City of Sydney|work=Barani: Sydney's Aboriginal History|year=2013|accessdate=August 1, 2013[/tpl]History.

Warren (2013) proposed that the British had no choice but to deploy the virus as a form of defence as they were confronted with dire circumstances when, among other factors, they ran out of ammunition for their muskets.
A consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources, which continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as rural lands were converted for sheep and cattle grazing. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

During the 1860s, Tasmanian Aboriginal skulls were particularly sought internationally for studies into craniofacial anthropometry. Truganini, the last Tasmanian Aborigine, had her skeleton exhumed within two years of her death in 1876 by the Royal Society of Tasmania, and later placed on display. Campaigns continue to have Aboriginal body parts returned to Australia for burial.

===20th and 21st centuries===

By 1900 the recorded Indigenous population of Australia had declined to approximately 93,000[tpl]cite web| title =Year Book Australia, 2002 | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | year =2002 | url =http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument | accessdate =23 September 2008 [/tpl] although this was only a partial count as both mainstream and tribal Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders were poorly covered with desert Aboriginal peoples not counted at all until the 1930s. The last uncontacted tribe left the Gibson Desert in 1984.Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932–84, National Museum of Australia During the first half of the 20th century, many Indigenous Australians worked as stockmen on sheep stations and cattle stations. The Indigenous population continued to decline, reaching a low of 74,000 in 1933 before numbers began to recover. By 1995 population numbers had reach pre-colonisation levels and in 2010 there were around 563,000 Indigenous Australians.
Although, as British subjects, all Indigenous Australians were nominally entitled to vote, generally only those who "merged" into mainstream society did so. Only Western Australia and Queensland specifically excluded Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders from the electoral rolls. Despite the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 that excluded "Aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa and Pacific Islands except New Zealand" from voting unless they were on the roll before 1901, South Australia insisted that all voters enfranchised within its borders would remain eligible to vote in the Commonwealth and Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders continued to be added to their rolls albeit haphazardly.
Despite efforts to bar their enlistment, around 500 Indigenous Australians fought for Australia in the First World War.Sarah Larsen, (24 April 2007), Aboriginal Anzacs, Behind The News (episode 08), ABC TV. Abc.net.au (2007-04-24). Retrieved 20 November 2011.

In 2007, Prime Minister John Howard and Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough launched the Northern Territory National Emergency Response, in response to the Little Children are Sacred Report into allegations of child abuse among indigenous communities. The government banned alcohol in prescribed communities in the Territory; quarantined a percentage of welfare payments for essential goods purchasing; dispatched additional police and medical personnel to the region; and suspended the permit system for access to indigenous communities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-policy-two-camps--the-takeover-rift/2007/10/26/1192941339555.html |title=SMH.au |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date= 27 October 2007|accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] In 2010, a United Nations Special Rapporteur, found the Emergency Response to be racially discriminatory, and said that aspects of it represented a limitation on "individual autonomy".[tpl]cite web|title=Observations On The Northern Territory Emergency Response In Australia|url=http://www.un.org.au/files/files/United%20Nations%20Special%20Rapporteur%20-%20Feb%202010.pdf|first=James|last=Anaya|date=February 2010|accessdate=18 June 2011|year=2010[/tpl]The World Today – UN rapporteur raps NT intervention 24/02/2010.

In the general election of 2010, Ken Wyatt of the Liberal Party became the first indigenous Australian elected to the Australian House of Representatives.
On 23 December 2010 the federal government appointed a panel comprising Indigenous leaders, other legal experts and some members of parliament (including Ken Wyatt) to provide advice on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the federal constitution.  On 16 May 2010 the panel issued a discussion paper and launched a website, under the heading "You Me Unity". These invited submissions and participation in consultation sessions.  More than 3,500 submissions were received and more than 200 public consultations and other meetings were held, including meetings in remote communities. An interim communiqué in December 2010 indicated majority support for constitutional recognition and for removing the sections of the federal constitution that permit discrimination on the basis of race.  The panel provided the final report to the federal government in January 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html|title=Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution: Report of the Expert Panel|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=January 2012|accessdate=25 October 2012[/tpl] The panel made a number of recommendations for constitutional reform.  The recommendations included the deletion of Section 25 of the Constitution of Australia which permits any State to disqualify "persons of any race" from voting (and excluding those people when "reckoning the number of the people") and Section 51(xxvi) which empowers the federal parliament to make special laws for people of any particular race. The repeal of these sections would remove the word "race" from the Constitution of Australia entirely. It was also recommended that three new sections be included: sections 51A, 116A and 127A to ensure meaningful recognition and further protection from discrimination. The Federal Government is not bound by the panel's recommendations and their adoption will depend on whether they receive the necessary political and public support for success at the proposed 2013 Referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution.For a discussion of the recommendations, see: Asmi Wood, ‘Constitutional Reform 2013: What are we trying to achieve?’ (2012) 37(3) Alternative Law Journal 156; http://www.altlj.org/publications/back-issues/2012-vol-37/product/775-constitutional-reform-2013-what-are-we-trying-to-achieve/category_pathway-108
On 23 November 2011, the Stronger Futures policy legislation was introduced to the Parliament by Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The policy intends to address key issues that exist within Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory such as unemployment, school attendance and enrolment, alcohol abuse, community safety and child protection, food security and housing and land reforms. The policy has been criticized by organizations such as Amnesty International and Concerned Citizens of Australia. The Stand for Freedom campaign leads the public movement against this legislation and criticizes many measures of the legislation since they maintain "racially-discriminatory" elements of the Northern Territory Emergency Response Act and continue the control of the  Australian Government over "Aboriginal people and their lands."[tpl]cite web|title=About- Stand for Freedom|url=http://standforfreedom.org.au/about/|publisher=Our Generation|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Stand for Freedom|year=2012[/tpl] However, several prominent members of the Australian Government continue to voice support for the Stronger Futures policy.

==Culture==

There are a large number of tribal divisions and language groups in Aboriginal Australia, and, correspondingly, a wide variety of diversity exists within cultural practices. However, there are some similarities between cultures.

===Languages===

There were more than 250 languages spoken by Indigenous Australians prior to the arrival of Europeans. Most of these are now either extinct or moribund, with only about fifteen languages still being spoken by all age groups.Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, "Aboriginal languages deserve revival", The Australian Higher Education, 26 August 2009.
Linguists classify many of the mainland Australian languages into one large group, the Pama–Nyungan languages. The rest are sometimes lumped under the term "non-Pama–Nyungan". The Pama–Nyungan languages comprise the majority, covering most of Australia, and are generally thought to be a family of related languages. In the north, stretching from the Western Kimberley to the Gulf of Carpentaria, are found a number of non-Pama–Nyungan groups of languages which have not been shown to be related to the Pama–Nyungan family nor to each other.[tpl]cite book|title = The non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia: comparative studies of the continent's most linguistically complex region|last = Evans|first = Nicholas|publisher = Australian National University|year = 2003|isbn = 9780858835382|location = Canberra Australia|pages = [/tpl]
While it has sometimes proven difficult to work out familial relationships within the Pama–Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists feel there has been substantial success.Bowern, Claire and Harold Koch (eds.). 2004. Australian Languages: Classification and the comparative method. John Benjamins, Sydney ISBN 90-272-4761-7 Against this some linguists, such as R. M. W. Dixon, suggest that the Pama–Nyungan group – and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area – is rather a sprachbund, or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a genetic language family.R. M. W. Dixon (1997) The Rise and Fall of Languages. Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-62654-4
It has been suggested that, given their long presence in Australia, Aboriginal languages form one specific sub-grouping. The position of Tasmanian languages is unknown, and it is also unknown whether they comprised one or more than one specific language family.

===Belief systems===

Religious demography among Indigenous Australians is not conclusive because the methodology of the census is not always well-suited to obtaining accurate information on Aboriginal people.Tatz, C. (1999, 2005). Aboriginal Suicide Is Different. Aboriginal Studies Press. AIC.gov.au In the 2006 census, 73% of the Indigenous population reported an affiliation with a Christian denomination, 24% reported no religious affiliation and 1% reported affiliation with an Australian Aboriginal traditional religion.[tpl]cite web|title=Australian Bureau of Statistics, 4713.0 - Population Characteristics, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2006, Religion|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5AD6E895236F6CDECA2578DB00283CBD?opendocument|accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl]  A small but growing minority of Aborigines are followers of Islam.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2902315.stm | title = Aborigines turn to Islam |work=BBC |date=31 March 2003 | author=Phil Mercer | accessdate =25 May 2007[/tpl]
Aboriginal people traditionally adhered to animist spiritual frameworks. Within Aboriginal belief systems, a formative epoch known as 'the Dreamtime' stretches back into the distant past when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples travelled across the land, creating and naming as they went.Andrews, M. (2004) 'The Seven Sisters', Spinifex Press, North Melbourne, p. 424 Indigenous Australia's oral tradition and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime.
The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with its own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Major ancestral spirits include the Rainbow Serpent, Baiame, Dirawong and Bunjil.

===Music===

Music has formed an integral part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of people through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day, and has existed for 50,000 years.[tpl]cite book|title=Aboriginal Australia & the Torres Strait Islands: Guide to Indigenous Australia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W7uSQAAACAAJ|accessdate=13 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=978-1-86450-114-8[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Fiona Richards|title=The Soundscapes of Australia: Music, Place And Spirituality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QKdEMNzz-t4C&pg=PR7|accessdate=13 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-4072-1[/tpl][tpl]Cite jstor|23164573[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1080/03007760008591767[/tpl]
The various Indigenous Australian communities developed unique musical instruments and folk styles. The didgeridoo, which is widely thought to be a stereotypical instrument of Aboriginal people, was traditionally played by people of only the eastern Kimberley region and Arnhem Land (such as the Yolngu), and then by only the men.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalarts.co.uk/historyofthedidgeridoo.html |title=History of the Didgeridoo Yidaki |publisher=Aboriginalarts.co.uk |accessdate=9 August 2009[/tpl]

===Art===

Australia has a tradition of Aboriginal art which is thousands of years old, the best known forms being rock art and bark painting. Evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia can be traced back at least 30,000 years.[ref]
