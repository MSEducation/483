==History==

Cahill opened its doors at 120 Broadway in 1919 as a small firm that quickly built a national reputation in the financial and corporate areas. By the end of the Depression, it had expanded to handle bankruptcies, reorganizations, and regulatory matters. During and after the Second World War, under the leadership of John T. Cahill, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the firm grew dramatically. As Cahill Gordon Reindel & Ohl, it moved to 80 Pine Street, where it remains. Partner John Ohl, a tax specialist, retired in 1976.[tpl] cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EEDA1331F930A25752C0A962958260|title=John P. Ohl, 84, Dies; A Retired Tax Lawyer|publisher=The New York Times|date=1994-01-13[/tpl] The firm established its Paris office in 1928, though it closed in 2000 when the firm opened its London office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=102955|title=Cahill shuts in Paris as it opens in City|publisher=The Lawyer|date=2000-06-12[/tpl]  Today, Cahill maintains offices in London and Washington D.C., though by far its largest office is in New York City.  Renowned for its corporate finance practice and work in high stakes lawsuits, Cahill remains a successful law firm with approximately 350 attorneys.

==Prominent litigation work==

Cahill's litigation practice is one of the more prominent in the United States, handling high-profile securities, antitrust and first amendment litigation. The firm's partners have made frequent appearances before the United States Supreme Court.  For instance, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States helped establish the power and authority of the Federal Communications Commission.  Another case, Times-Picayune v. United States, is among the Court's most important antitrust rulings.
On behalf of Cahill, Floyd Abrams successfully defended The New York Times in the landmark New York Times Co. v. United States case.  In that 1971 case the Supreme Court of the United States refused to permit the Nixon Administration to stop the publication of thousands of pages of Vietnam War-related government documents. Thereafter, Abrams and Cahill became prominent defenders of the media and First Amendment rights. On September 9, 2009, Abrams argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of Senator Mitch McConnell in the highly publicized re-argument ordered by the Court on the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold, defending the rights of corporations and unions to donate unlimited amounts of money to political allies in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.  Cahill attorneys have appeared before the Supreme Court on behalf of the press in numerous cases of national importance.
In late 2005, David N. Kelley joined the firm as a senior litigator, having retired as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Under his leadership, successful convictions for securities violations were obtained against Martha Stewart, Bernie Ebbers in the collapse of MCI Worldcom, and John Rigas for his role at Adelphia.
