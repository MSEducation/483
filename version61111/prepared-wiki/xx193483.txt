===Peron Homestead Artesian Bore===

The Peron Historical Homestead is near Denham.  It includes a visitor center.  Peron Peninsula is part of the Carnarvon Basin, a geological structure lacking permanent fresh surface water. During the 1900s artesian bores were sunk to provide a greater quantity and quality of water.  The resulting water comes up hot (35-60 °C) and has high salt and mineral content.Tourism website
