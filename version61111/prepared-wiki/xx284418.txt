Solitude is a historic home located on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, Montgomery County, Virginia.  The earliest section was built about 1808, and expanded through the mid-19th century.  It is a two-story, "L"-shaped, five bay, log and frame dwelling with a hipped roof.  Also on the property are the contributing stone spring house with log superstructure and log kitchen or office.  In 1872, the Solitude land became the central campus of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, and the house, after the death of its owner in the following decade, was used for faculty housing until the 1970s, when it became a classroom and office facility.  The house is situated in a landscaped park adjacent to the central campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Montgomery/150-0100-0003_Solitude_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Solitude |author=Gibson Worsham| date=January 1988|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl] and Accompanying photo
