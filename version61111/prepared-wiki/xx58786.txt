CATEGORIES: Prime Ministers of Romania, History of Romania

The Prime Minister of Romania is the head of the Government of Romania. Initially, the office was styled President of the Council of Ministers ([tpl]lang-ro|Președintele Consiliului de Miniștri[/tpl]), when the term "Government" included more than the Cabinet, and the Cabinet was called The Council of Ministers (Consiliul de Miniștri). The title was officially changed to Prime Minister during the communist regime.
