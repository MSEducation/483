 It has been said that this machine was used in preparation for [[Operation Chastise]], otherwise known as the "Dam Busters raid" (e.g. in 
), but see [tpl]cite web|last=Irwin|first=William|url=http://amg.nzfmm.co.nz/differential_analyser_explained.html|title=The Differential Analyser Explained|work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=Auckland Meccano Guild|date=July 2009 | quote = It is rumoured that a differential analyser was used in the development of the "bouncing bomb" by Barnes Wallis for the "Dam Busters" attack on the Ruhr valley hydroelectric dams in WW2. This was first mentioned in MOTAT literature in 1973. However after extensive enquiries and literature searches over the last few years, no evidence can be found that the analyser held by MOTAT, nor any other differential analyser, was used for this purpose. Considering the secrecy surrounding war time activities at the time it could still be possible, but most people from that era are now deceased. Two remaining personalities still alive from that era were consulted, namely Arthur Porter and Maurice Wilkes, but neither could substantiate the rumour[/tpl][/ref] After a lengthy period of neglect, a restoration effort began in 2003, and a successful "full run through" of this machine was completed on December 16, 2008.
In 2005, Tim Robinson displayed his own Meccano differential analyser at the Computer History Museum, at Mountain View, California, USA, and Robinson has also built and exhibited two models of Charles Babbage's difference engine, also using Meccano.Robinson, Tim, Tim Robinson's Differential Analyzer (10 February 2005), Robinson's Difference Engine #1 (3 April 2006), Robinson's Difference Engine #2 (7 May 2006).

In 1990, Meccano S.A. built a giant Ferris Wheel, in France. It was modelled after the original 1893 wheel built by George Ferris at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago and was shipped to the United States to promote "Erector Meccano" after Meccano S.A. had bought out the "Erector" trade name and began selling Meccano sets in the U.S.A. It went on display in New York City after which it was purchased by Ripley's Believe It or Not! and put on display in their St. Augustine, Florida museum. The model, (at the time) the largest (by size) is 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) high, weighs 544 kilograms (1,200 pounds), was made from 19,507 pieces, 50,560 nuts and bolts, and took 1,239 hours to construct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dalefield.com/nzfmm/gm20c/gm2.html |title=Greatest Meccano Models of the Twentieth Century |work=The New Zealand Federation of Meccano Modellers |accessdate=2007-07-17[/tpl] At this mass and size, some deviation from Meccano-only parts was a necessity, to prevent it collapsing (mainly in the structural spokes). The largest model by mass would certainly be in contention but some models have topped 600 kg.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
A recent large model, weighing approximately 500 kg and 23m long, was built in September 2009 by TV presenter James May and a team of volunteers from the engineering department of the University of Liverpool, who created a Meccano bridge spanning the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Liverpool. As with other models of this size and weight some non-Meccano parts were used.  It was built from "about 100,000 pieces of real Meccano", taking 1,100 hours, and consisted of a 9 metre (29.5 ft) "swing bridge" section, and a 12 metre (39.4 ft) "drawbridge" section.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nwmg.org/james%20may%20meccano%20bridge.html |title=Meccano bridge challenge |date=2009-08-08 |accessdate=2013-02-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120502054951/http://nwmg.org/james%20may%20meccano%20bridge.html |archivedate=2012-05-02[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8191273.stm | work=BBC News | title=May builds Meccano canal bridge | date=2009-08-08 | accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] See James May's Toy Stories.
Meccano remains a very versatile constructional medium. Almost any mechanical device can be built with it, from structures, to complex working cranes, automatic gearboxes or clocks. Meccano is frequently used to prototype new ideas and inventions. Model realisation using Meccano is limited mainly by the imagination and ingenuity of the builder.

==Popularity==

Frank Hornby launched the Meccano Guild in 1919, to encourage boys of all ages—as well as early clubs—to become part of a central organisation, which oversaw club formation, and set guidelines for club proceedings. The Meccano Magazine was used as a means to keep Guild clubs informed of each other's activities (as well as encourage the sales of Meccano).
The International Society of Meccanomen was founded in 1989 in England, nine years after the Liverpool factory closed. This organisation is considered the modern replacement of the Guild system and now has some 600 members in over 30 countries.
Today, over a hundred years since its inception, there are thousands of Meccano enthusiasts worldwide, many clubs and hundreds of websites covering Meccano history, model building instructions and nostalgia. Individuals and companies worldwide still manufacture parts, some long out of production. There are annual Meccano exhibitions around the world, notably in France (at a different venue around May each year) and at Skegness in England (around July every year). Many notable shows also take place in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand each year to name a few.
Publications devoted fully or in part to Meccano included Meccano Magazine from 1916 to 1981, and numerous Special Model Leaflets aimed at serious enthusiasts, on how to construct very large, complex models and machines. Some models use many more parts than an entire Set 10. The original large models from the 1930s model leaflets are called the Meccano Super Models, often popular at Meccano and other model engineering exhibitions and sometimes used as nostalgic showpieces by retailers. Modern dedicated publications include: Constructor Quarterly, The International Meccanoman and the ModelPlans series of instructions. These feature large model instructions and ideas for enthusiasts. There are also a myriad of club-generated periodicals, featuring Meccano content and keeping enthusiasts in touch.
