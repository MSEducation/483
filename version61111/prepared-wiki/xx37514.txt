It's That Man Again (or, commonly, ITMA) was a BBC radio comedy programme which ran from 1939 to 1949. The title refers to a contemporary phrase concerning the ever more frequent news-stories about Hitler in the lead-up to World War II, and specifically a headline in the Daily Express written by Bert Gunn.Charles Wintour, "Gunn, Herbert Smith", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography This was humorously transferred to Tommy Handley, the popular comedian around whom the programme was developed. The scripts were written by the prolific Ted Kavanagh. ITMA is believed to have played a major role in sustaining morale on the UK's "home front" during World War II.

==History==

The headline which inspired the name of the show appeared in the Daily Express of 2 May 1939, on the bottom of the front page, above a story about Adolf Hitler leaving his Chancellery on a mystery journey.[tpl]cite news |title=It's That Man Again . . . ! |publisher=Daily Express |date=2 May 1939 |page=1[/tpl] The first show was broadcast on 12 July 1939, part of an initial run of four shows which were fortnightly.Roger Wilmut, "Kindly leave the stage!: The story of variety, 1919-1960", Methuen, 1985, p. 132.
The show was broadcast for much of the war from the BBC Wales studios in Bangor, Caernarfonshire in Wales, where the BBC's Light Entertainment Department was based during World War II after an initial brief relocation to Bristol.
ITMA followed the adventures of Tommy Handley as he undertook a series of (fictional) bizarre jobs that involved working with strange characters. The first series began with Handley working on a private radio station, but he later moved on to work as Minister of Aggravation and Mysteries at the Office of Twerps; the Mayor of seedy seaside resort Foaming at the Mouth; and Governor of the South Sea island Tomtopia.
Other performers in the show included Jack Train, a master of voices; Clarence Wright, who played the commercial traveller and the man from the ministry; Deryck Guyler, and Joan Harben (sister of Philip Harben) as Mona Lott. Hattie Jacques, who played Sophie Tuckshop (the earliest of Jacques' roles dependent upon her physical size) joined the cast towards the end of the run. The programme featured dozens of other characters, such as Mrs Mopp and Colonel Chinstrap. The speed at which the performances were delivered is still considered remarkable, even given later technical developments. Many gags were dependent on breaking news – Ted Kavanagh once admitted to being unable to understand some jokes in earlier scripts.
Some years later, Train reprised the role of Colonel Chinstrap for a couple of guest appearances on The Goon Show including the episode "Shifting Sands". Train would recount how the character was created. Shortly before the show started he was in the office of senior announcer John Snagge having a chat when the door opened and a slightly bleary-eyed gentleman entered. They were introduced, the man being a retired Indian army officer. He then turned to Snagge and said, "John. I have just done the most marvellous piece of business. I’ve bought a water-heater on ten year’s hire-purchase and what the gas company doesn’t know is I am drinking myself to death".
Train, along with scriptwriter Kavanagh, developed this into Colonel Chinstrap. The officer on whom Chinstrap was based heard the programme and reputedly totally failed to connect the character with himself but commented: "Wonderful character. I knew silly buggers like that in India".
Then, nine years and five months after the first meeting, Train received a telegram saying: THE COLONEL BEAT THE GAS COMPANY BY SEVEN MONTHS SNAGGE.
ITMA ran for over 300 episodes between 1939 and 1949. When Handley died from a sudden stroke, announced immediately after the usual second repeat, it was cancelled because he was considered irreplaceable as its star. 
Mrs Mopp is referenced in the Kinks song "The Village Green Preservation Society" from their 1968 album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society.

==Film adaptation==

In 1943 a film adaptation was made of the series, also titled It's That Man Again.
==Catchphrases== 
ITMA is remembered for a number of catchphrases, some of which entered popular vocabulary.[tpl]citation |date=July 2002 |chapter=ITMA catchphrases |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/journey/stars/tommy_handley/catchphrases.shtml |title=Local History Liverpool |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] 

==“D’oh!” and Diana Morrison==

More ejaculation than catchphrase, D'oh! was the explosive parting shot of the character Miss Hotchkiss as played by Diana Morrison in numerous episodes from 1945 (series 8/166 onwards)The ITMA Years, A Compilation of Scripts: 2/13, 4/28, 5/8, 8/34, 9/17, 12/6 (Woburn Press, 1974) to the demise of the programme in January 1949.The Last ITMA Script, Author Kavanagh (Riddle Books, 1949)
‘D’oh!’ was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2004, largely in response to the much later publicizing of it in the television programme The Simpsons, although ITMA is credited with the earliest recorded use of the term.

Diana Morrison was already a cast member before the advent of the character Miss Hotchkiss in 1945. Miss Hotchkiss was Tommy Handley’s stentorian and authoritarian secretary. Authoritarian she may have been but she was susceptible to the amorous blandishments of Handley which however would lead on to an inevitable put-down.BBC Sound Archive 1947.12.04 (BBC Audiobooks Ltd ISBN0563504390 ℗1988, ©1988 & 2005) The explosive ‘d’oh!’ would signal her exasperated exit.British Library Sound Catalogue Find Formats Morrison T5636R 1947.12.04, C353/17 1945.5.10 and T3670W 1947.11.07, 1948.09.23 & 1949.01.06

==Twerps!==

On Wednesday 19 February 1947 Mrs Jean Mann, MP for Coatbridge, introduced the epithet "twerp" to the House of Commons when referring to Tommy Handley during a debate on, of all things, supplementary estimates.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/feb/19/broadcasting#S5CV0433P0_19470219_HOC_504http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2708136  She was apparently taking exception to the risqué character of Handley’s jokes that, according to her, were based on the kind that made families feel they should switch off the radio. The next day ITMA responded by opening the show with the overture revamped to "It’s That Twerp Again".
