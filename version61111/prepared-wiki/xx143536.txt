Sextus Festus was a Late Roman historian (and proconsul of Africa) whose breviary (summary of the history of Rome, one source was the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte) was commissioned by the emperor Valens in preparation for war against Persia.
Festus is author of the historical work known as Breviarium rerum gestarum populi Romani. It was completed about 379 AD.
Breviarium covers all history of the Roman state from foundation of the City till 369 AD. The book consists of 30 small parts, that's why events of Roman history are described very briefly. Festus is mainly focused on political and (especially) military history of Rome.
The Festus' Breviarium is estimated as work of very low quality.[tpl]Citation|last=Baldwin |first=B. |chapter=Festus |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium |volume=2 |location=Oxford |year=1991 |page=784[/tpl]
