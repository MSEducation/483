==History==

Although Spennithorne dates from Saxon times, there are very few facts recorded relating to its history. At the period of the Norman Conquest, Alan Rufus, to whom the Conqueror gave the whole of Richmondshire, distributed his vast lands among his retainers in feudal fashion, and in this division Spennithorne and Middleham were allotted to his brother, Ribal Fitzrandolph.[tpl]cite web|title=SPENNITHORNE: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1890|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Spennithorne/Spennithorne90.html|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] 
In Domesday Book Spennithorne is referred to as “Speningtorp” which Dr. Whitaker explains as the thorp or village of the “Spening’, or a prickly thorn.
In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's "Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales" described Spennithorne as:

The township lies on the river Ure, near the Leyburn railway, 2 miles SE by E of Leyburn; and has a station on the railway, and a post-office under Bedale. Acres, 1,280. Real property, £2,457.

==Landmarks== 
St Michaels Church, a Grade I listed building is said to have been erected by Robert Fitzrandolph in A.D 1166. The Church was completely demolished to make way for its Norman successor with only two or three small fragments being discovered: two stones with Runic ornament which have been built into the east wall of the chancel; and a Saxon monument recently discovered under the floor of the chancel which has now been placed in the wall of the vestry. The interior of the church also contains tablets to the family of Chaytor.[tpl]cite web|last=Hinson|first=Colin|title=Spennithorne: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1868|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Spennithorne/Spennithorne68.html|accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] By the mid 12th century, St Michael and All Angels Church had been built and enlarged. The existing church tower dates back to around the 14th century when the aisles were also widened to their current width, along with the channel being rebuilt and extended eastwards to its present length with the vestry being added on the north side. In 1872 the church was again thoroughly restored, costing around £2,000. The work was carried out under plans prepared by Mr. Fowler Jones of York who preserved all the old fabric which was capable of restoration, with all construction done in strict conformity with the style of the original building.[tpl]cite web|title=SPENNITHORNE: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1890.|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Spennithorne/Spennithorne90.html|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] The structure of the church now resembles a medieval building of which majority remains in the 21st century.
