Brighton [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Brighton.ogg|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən[/tpl] is a town on the south coast of Great Britain.OS Explorer map 122: Brighton and Hove. Scale: 1:25 000. Publisher:Ordnance Survey – Southampton B2 edition. Publishing Date:2009. ISBN 978 0319240816 It makes up half of the city and unitary authority of Brighton and Hove (formed from the previous towns of Brighton, Hove, Portslade and several other villages). Formerly part of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex, it remains part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex, within the historic county of Sussex.
The ancient settlement of "Brighthelmstone" dates from before Domesday Book (1086), but it emerged as a health resort featuring sea bathing during the 18th century, was used as a seaside getaway by the Prince Regent, and became a highly popular destination for day-trippers from London after the arrival of the railway in 1841. Brighton experienced rapid population growth, reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961.Carder, Timothy (1990). The Encyclopaedia of Brighton. p. 127. East Sussex County Libraries. ISBN 0-86147-315-9
Modern Brighton forms part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&More=Y|title=KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas|accessdate=11 April 2007[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Brighton's earliest name was Bristelmestune, recorded in the Domesday Book. Although more than 40 variations have been documented, Brighthelmstone (or Brighthelmston) was the standard rendering between the 14th and 18th centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56961|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 – The Rape of Lewes. The Borough of Brighton|last=Salzman|first=L.F. (ed)|authorlink=Louis Francis Salzman|year=1940|work=Victoria County History of Sussex|publisher=British History Online|pages=244–263|accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=44.[/tpl]  Brighton was originally an informal shortened form, first seen in 1660; it gradually supplanted the longer name, and was in general use from the late 18th century.  Brighthelmstone was still the town's official name until 1810, though.  The name is of Saxon origin. Most scholars believe that it derives from Beorthelm + tūn—the homestead of Beorthelm, a common Saxon name associated with villages elsewhere in England.  The tūn element is common in Sussex, especially on the coast, although it occurs infrequently in combination with a personal name.[tpl]Harvnb|Leslie|Short|1999|pp=32–33.[/tpl]  An alternative etymology taken from the Saxon words for "stony valley" is sometimes given but has less acceptance.  Brighthelm gives its name to, among other things, a church[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=39.[/tpl] and a pub in Brighton[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-bright-helm|title=The Bright Helm|year=2009–2013|publisher=J D Wetherspoon plc|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M5DqKxkb|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl] and some halls of residence at the University of Sussex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/residences/oncampus/brighthelm|title=Brighthelm|publisher=University of Sussex|year=2013|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M5DxNeew|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
Brighton has several nicknames. Poet Horace Smith called it "The Queen of Watering Places", which is still widely used,[tpl]Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=3.[/tpl] and "Old Ocean's Bauble".[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 16.[/tpl]  Novelist William Makepeace Thackeray referred to "Doctor Brighton", calling the town "one of the best of Physicians".  "London-by-Sea" is well-known, reflecting Brighton's popularity with Londoners.  "The Queen of Slaughtering Places", a pun on Smith's description, became popular when the Brighton trunk murders came to the public's attention in the 1930s.  The mid 19th-century nickname "School Town" referred to the remarkable number of boarding, charity and church schools in the town at the time.[tpl]Harvnb|Sampson|1994|p=56.[/tpl]

==History==

Anthony Seldon identified five phases of development in pre-20th century Brighton.[tpl]Harvnb|Seldon|2002|loc=Ch. 2.[/tpl]  Until 1730, it was a fishing and agricultural settlement. It was founded by Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name Bristelmestune; a rent of 4,000 herring was established.  Its importance grew from the Norman era onwards, and by the 14th century there was a parish church, a market and rudimentary law enforcement (the first town constable was elected in 1285).[tpl]Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=32.[/tpl]  Sacked and burnt by French invaders in the early 16th century—the earliest depiction of Brighton, a painting of [tpl]circa[/tpl] 1520, shows Admiral Pregent de Bidoux's attack of June 1514—the town nevertheless recovered strongly on the back of a thriving mackerel-fishing industry. By the mid-17th century, Brighton was Sussex's most populous and important town.[tpl]Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=33.[/tpl]  Over the next few decades, though, events severely affected its local and national standing, such that by 1730 "it was a forlorn town decidedly down on its luck": more foreign attacks, storms (especially the devastating Great Storm of 1703), a declining fishing industry and the emergence of nearby Shoreham as a significant port.
From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The contemporary fad for drinking and bathing in seawater as a purported cure for illnesses was enthusiastically encouraged by Dr Richard Russell from nearby Lewes. He sent many patients to "take the cure" in the sea at Brighton, published a popular treatise[tpl]#tag:ref|De Tabe Glandulari, sive, De usu aquæ marinæ in morbis glandularum dissertatio (1750); translated into English in 1753 as Glandular Diseases, or a Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Affections of the Glands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56302?docPos=4|title=Oxford DNB article: Russell, Richard|last=Farrant|first=John H.|date=September 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/56302|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] [tpl]ODNBsub[/tpl]|group=note[/tpl] on the subject, and moved to the town soon afterwards (the Royal Albion, one of Brighton's early hotels, occupies the site of his house).[tpl]Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=34.[/tpl]  Others were already visiting the town for recreational purposes before Russell became famous, though, and his actions coincided with other developments which made Brighton more attractive to visitors. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France; road transport to London was improved[tpl]Harvnb|Seldon|2002|pp=34–35.[/tpl] when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770;[tpl]Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=98.[/tpl] and spas and indoor baths were opened by other entrepreneurial physicians such as Sake Dean Mahomed and Anthony Relhan (who also wrote the town's first guidebook).
From 1780, development of the Georgian terraces had started and the fishing village became the fashionable resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783.Carder (1990), p. 71 He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion during the early part of his Regency. In this period the modern form of the name Brighton came into common use.Mawer, A. and F.M. Stenton, The Place-Names of Sussex, Part II, Cambridge 1930, p. 291.
The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to over 120,000 by 1901.Carder (1990), p. 127 Many of the major attractions were built during the Victorian era such as the Grand Hotel (1864), the West Pier (1866) and the Palace Pier (1899). Prior to either of these structures the famous Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown. It lasted from 1823 to 1896, and featured in paintings by both Turner and Constable.
Because of boundary changes, the land area of Brighton expanded from 1,640 acres (7 km2) in 1854 to 14,347 acres (58 km2) in 1952.Carder (1990), p. 13 New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including Moulsecoomb, Bevendean, Coldean and Whitehawk. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of Patcham, Ovingdean and Rottingdean, and much council housing was built in parts of Woodingdean after the Second World War.
Gentrification since then has made Brighton more fashionable again. Recent housing in North Laine, for instance, has been designed in keeping with the area.
In 1997, Brighton and Hove were joined to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, which was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000.

==Geography and topography==

Brighton lies between the South Downs and the English Channel to the north and south respectively. The Sussex coast forms a wide, shallow bay between the headlands of Selsey Bill and Beachy Head; Brighton developed near the centre of this bay around a seasonal river, the Wellesbourne (or Whalesbone), which flowed from the South Downs above Patcham.[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 15.[/tpl]  This emptied into the English Channel at the beach near the East Cliff, forming "the natural drainage point for Brighton".[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=246.[/tpl]  Behind the estuary was a stagnant pond called the Pool or Poole, so named since the medieval era.[tpl]#tag:ref|The name was documented as Poole in 1296 and 1497.|group=note[/tpl]  This was built over with houses and shops from 1793, when the Wellesbourne was culverted to prevent flooding,[tpl]Harvnb|Dale|1976|p=95.[/tpl] and only the name of the road (Pool Valley, originally Pool Lane)[tpl]Harvnb|Dale|1976|p=8.[/tpl] marks its site.  One original house survives from the time of the pool's enclosure.  Behind Pool Valley is Old Steine (historically The Steyne), originally a flat and marshy area where fishermen dried their nets. The Wellesbourne occasionally reappears during times of prolonged heavy rain; author Mark Antony Lower referred to an early 19th-century drawing of the Royal Pavilion showing "quite a pool of water across the Steyne".[tpl]Harvnb|Lower|1864|p=248.[/tpl]  Despite 16th-century writer Andrew Boorde's claim that "Bryght-Hempston is among the noble ports and havens of the realm",[tpl]Harvnb|Lower|1864|p=247.[/tpl] Brighton never developed as a significant port.
The East Cliff runs for several miles from Pool Valley towards Rottingdean and Saltdean, reaching [tpl]convert|80|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. The soil beneath it, a mixture of alluvium and clay with some flint and chalk rubble, has experienced erosion for many years.[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 56.[/tpl]  The cliff itself, like the rest of Brighton's soil, is chalk.  Below this are thin layers of Upper and Lower Greensand separated by a thicker band of Gault clay.[tpl]Harvnb|Leslie|Short|1999|p=3.[/tpl]  The land slopes upwards gradually from south to north towards the top of the Downs. Main transport links developed along the floor of the Wellesbourne valley, from which the land climbs steeply—particularly on the east side. The earliest settlement was by the beach at the bottom of the valley, which was partly protected from erosion by an underwater shale-bar. Changes in sea level affected the foreshore several times: [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha[/tpl] disappeared in the first half of the 14th century,[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 43.[/tpl] and the Great Storm of 1703 caused widespread destruction. The first sea defences were erected in 1723, and a century later a long sea-wall was built.

===Climate===

Brighton has a temperate climate: its Köppen climate classification is Cfb. It is characterised by mild, calm weather with high levels of sunshine, sea breezes and a "healthy, bracing air" attributed to the low level of tree cover.[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 40.[/tpl]  Average rainfall levels increase as the land rises: the 1958–1990 mean was [tpl]convert|740|mm|in[/tpl] on the seafront and about [tpl]convert|1000|mm|in[/tpl] at the top of the South Downs above Brighton.  Storms caused serious damage in 1703, 1806, 1824, 1836, 1848, 1850, 1896, 1910 and 1987. Snow is rare, but particularly severe falls were recorded in 1881 and 1967.

===Boundaries and areas===

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Brighton was in the Rape of Lewes and the Hundred of Welesmere. The new Hundred of Whalesbone, which covered the parishes of Brighton, West Blatchington, Preston and Hove, was formed in 1296. Parishes moved in and out several times, and by 1801 only Brighton and West Blatchington were included in the Hundred.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56959|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 – The Rape of Lewes. The hundred of Whalesbone|last=Salzman|first=L.F. (ed)|authorlink=Louis Francis Salzman|year=1940|work=Victoria County History of Sussex|publisher=British History Online|page=241|accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl]
Brighton's ecclesiastical and civil parish boundaries were coterminous until 1873. Since then, the latter have changed several times as the urban area has expanded.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=34.[/tpl]  In its original form, Brighton covered about [tpl]convert|1640|acre|ha[/tpl] between the English Channel, Hove, Preston, Ovingdean and Rottingdean. The civil parish was first extended from 31 October 1873, when [tpl]convert|905|acre|ha[/tpl] was annexed from Preston. Its ecclesiastical parish was not affected. On 1 October 1923, [tpl]convert|94|acre|ha[/tpl] were added to Brighton from Patcham parish: Brighton Corporation was developing the Moulsecoomb council estate there at the time. On 1 April 1928, Brighton became a county borough and grew by nearly five times by adding Ovingdean and Rottingdean parishes in their entirety and parts of Falmer, Patcham and West Blatchington.  From 1 April 1952, more of Falmer and part of the adjacent Stanmer parish were added; 20 years later, land and marine territory associated with the new Brighton Marina development also became part of Brighton. Except for a small addition of rural land in 1993 (from Pyecombe parish), Brighton Borough's boundaries remained the same until it was joined to Hove Borough in 1997 to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=35.[/tpl]
The old boundary between Brighton and Hove is most clearly seen on the seafront, where the King Edward Peace Statue (1912) straddles the border, and in a twitten called Boundary Passage which runs northwards from Western Road to Montpelier Road.[tpl]Harvnb|Dale|1986|p=57.[/tpl]  There is a Grade II-listed parish boundary marker stone in this passageway.[tpl]NHLE|desc=Boundary Stone Approximately 40 Metres North of Western Road, Boundary Passage, Brighton|num=1380005|grade=II|accessdate=19 August 2013[/tpl]  Between Western Road and the seafront, the boundary runs between Western Street (to the east, in Brighton) and Waterloo Street, but it is not visible.    Northwards from Western Road, it runs to the west of Norfolk Road, Norfolk Terrace, Windlesham Road and Windlesham Gardens in the Montpelier area, then along the south side of Davigdor Road to Seven Dials. From there it runs along the west side of Dyke Road as far as Withdean Road in Withdean, at which point it crosses Dyke Road so that the section north of that is part of Hove parish. The boundary then continues to follow Dyke Road towards Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.[tpl]cite map|publisher=G.I.

==Governance and politics==

Brighton is covered by two constituencies in the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Brighton Kemptown and Brighton Pavilion. Both are marginal constituencies[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] which were held by Labour from 1997 to 2010. At the 2010 general election, Brighton Kemptown elected the Conservative MP Simon Kirby, while Brighton Pavilion elected Caroline Lucas, the first Green Party MP elected to Westminster. Lucas won 16,238 votes (31.3%), compared with Labour's 14,986 votes (28.9%) and the Conservative's 12,275 votes (23.7%).[tpl]cite news|title=BBC News Election 2010 Constituency Brighton Pavilion|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a69.stm|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] In European elections, Brighton is part of the European Parliament constituency of South-East England.
As of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl], there are 21 wards in the city of Brighton and Hove, of which 12 are in Brighton. Regency, St Peter's & North Laine, Preston Park, Withdean, Patcham, Hollingdean & Stanmer and Hanover & Elm Grove are part of the Brighton Pavilion constituency; Moulsecoomb & Bevendean, Queen's Park, East Brighton, Woodingdean and Rottingdean Coastal are covered by the Brighton Kemptown constituency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Councillor%20Ward%20Map_aug2013.pdf|title=Ward Map|date=August 2013|publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council|format=PDF|accessdate=6 January 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MQJn8K5r|archivedate=6 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The newly created Borough of Brighton consisted of six wards in 1854: St Nicholas, St Peter, Pier, Park, Pavilion and West. When the territory was extended to include part of Preston parish in 1873, the new area became a seventh ward named Preston. The seven were split into 14 in 1894: Hanover, Kemp Town (renamed King's Cliff in 1908), Lewes Road, Montpelier, Pavilion, Pier, Preston, Preston Park, Queen's Park, Regency, St John, St Nicholas, St Peter, and West. Preston ward was extended in 1923 to incorporate the area taken into the borough from Patcham parish in 1923 for the construction of the Moulsecoomb estate, and in 1928 the ward was divided into four: Hollingbury, Moulsecoomb, Preston and Preston Park. Elm Grove and Patcham wards were created at the same time, bringing the total to 19. There were further changes in 1952, 1955 and 1983, at which time there were 16 wards.[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§47.[/tpl]  This situation continued until 1 April 1997, when Hove and its wards became part of the new unitary authority of Brighton and Hove.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=156.[/tpl]
Brighton Town Hall occupies a large site in The Lanes. Medieval Brighthelmston had a town hall, although it was called the Townhouse and functioned more like a market hall. A later building (1727) known as the Town Hall was principally used as a workhouse. Work on the first purpose-built town hall began in 1830; Thomas Read Kemp laid the first stone, and Thomas Cooper designed it on behalf of the Brighton Town Commissioners (of which he was a member). Brighton Corporation spent £40,000 to extend it in 1897–99 to the Classical design of Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May. Despite this, the building was too small for municipal requirements by the mid-20th century, and extra council buildings were built in various locations throughout Brighton Borough Council's existence: the most recent, Bartholomew House and Priory House next to the town hall, were finished in 1987.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=341–342.[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=72.[/tpl]  The town hall ceased to be responsible solely for Brighton's affairs when Brighton and Hove were united in 1997, but it is still used by Brighton & Hove City Council—particularly for weddings and civil ceremonies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/community-and-life-events/births-deaths-and-marriages/ceremonies-brighton-town-hall|title=Ceremonies in Brighton Town Hall|year=2013|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M52A0wx0|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The political campaigning group Justice? and its SchNEWS newspaper are based in Brighton,[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=214.[/tpl] at the Cowley Club libertarian social centre. This was named after Harry Cowley (1890–1971), "one of the earliest and best-loved proponents of 'people power' activism in Brighton".[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=90.[/tpl]  Also operating locally is a branch of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The presence of a British subsidiary of the United States arms company EDO Corporation on the Home Farm Industrial Estate in Moulsecoomb has been the cause of protests since 2004. The premises were significantly damaged in January 2009 when protesters broke in.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=205.[/tpl]

==Economy==

In 1985, the Borough Council described three "myths" about Brighton's economy. Common beliefs among outsiders, it was stated, included that most of the working population commuted to London every day; that tourism provided most of Brighton's jobs and income; or that the borough's residents were "composed entirely of wealthy theatricals and retired businesspeople" rather than workers.[tpl]Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=51.[/tpl]  In reality, Brighton has been an important centre for commerce and employment since the 18th century. It is home to several major companies, some of which employ thousands of people locally; as a retail centre it is of regional importance; creative, digital and new media businesses are increasingly significant; and although Brighton was never a major industrial centre, its railway works contributed to Britain's rail industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in the manufacture of steam locomotives. Since the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove, economic and retail data has been produced at a citywide level only. Examples of statistics include: Brighton and Hove's tourism industry contributes £380m to the economy and employs 20,000 people directly or indirectly; the city has 9,600 registered companies; and a 2001 report identified it as one of five "supercities for the future".[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=113.[/tpl]  In December 2013, Brighton was the third highest ranked place on the UK Vitality Index Report, which measures the economic strength of towns and cities in the United Kingdom. It was "among the top performing towns and cities on almost all" of the 20 measures used by the index.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20131217.529022.htm|title=Brighton ranks number 3 in UK for economic vitality|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Brighton & Hove Economic Partnership|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M5LyntuW|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]

In 2012, it was reported that about 1,500 of Gatwick Airport's 21,000 workers lived in the city of Brighton and Hove.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10100845.Thousands_of_jobs_at_Gatwick/|title=Thousands of jobs at Gatwick|date=11 December 2012|work=The Argus|publisher=Newsquest Media Group|accessdate=11 December 2012[/tpl]
Brighton is a popular destination for conferences, exhibitions and trade fairs, and has had a purpose-built conference centre—the Brighton Centre—since 1977. Direct income from the Brighton Centre's 160 events per year is £8 million,[tpl]#tag:ref|2009 figures.|group=note[/tpl] and a further £50 million is generated indirectly by visitors spending money during their stay. Events range from political party conferences to concerts.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|p=56.[/tpl]
The Hollingbury Industrial Estate is one of the largest such facilities in Brighton; in its early days about 6,000 people were employed, principally in industrial jobs, but in the late 20th and early 21st centuries its focus has switched to commercial and retail development,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20110409.990853.htm|title=IKEA fails to get Hollingbury site|date=9 April 2011|publisher=Brighton & Hove Economic Partnership|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M57pqvNN|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl] limiting Brighton's potential for industrial growth. Brighton Corporation laid out the estate on [tpl]convert|18|acre|ha[/tpl] of land around Crowhurst Road in 1950. By 1956, large-scale employment was provided at a bakery, a typewriter factory and a machine tools manufacturer among others. Most of the large factories closed during the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, employment fell to 1,000, and structural changes started in the mid-1980s with a move towards small-scale industrial units (the Enterprise Estate was finished in October 1985) and then retail warehouses.

Examples include Midnight Communications, Madgex, Makemedia and Brightplace (an e-learning provider), which have all won or been nominated for various local and national awards.  Cogapp started in 1985 and was initially focused on floppy disk manufacture, but it now deals with all aspects of information technology and has been involved with the Apple iPad.

By the early 21st century, the market for office accommodation in the city was characterised by fluctuating demand and a lack of supply of high-quality buildings. As an example, the Trafalgar Place development ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1990), "now considered a prime office location", stood partly empty for a decade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/ldf/Tall_Buildings_Study_Final.pdf|title=Brighton & Hove Tall Buildings Study|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council (in association with Gillespies and GVA Grimley)|date=October 2003|issue=C|format=PDF|section=9.2.2|page=28|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M56m68fM|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]  Exion 27 (built in 2001), a high-tech, energy-efficient office development at Hollingbury, remained empty for several years and is still not in commerical use: it houses some departments of the University of Sussex.

===Retail===

The Lanes form a retail, leisure and residential area near the seafront, characterised by narrow alleyways following the street pattern of the original fishing village. The Lanes contain predominantly clothing stores, jewellers, antique shops, restaurants and pubs. The North Laine area is a retail, leisure and residential area immediately north of the Lanes. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon "Laine" meaning "fields". The North Laine contains a mix of businesses dominated by cafés, independent and avant-garde shops, bars and theatres.
Churchill Square is a shopping centre with a floor space of [tpl]convert|470,000|ft2|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] and over 80 shops, several restaurants and 1,600 car-parking spaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.churchillsquare.co.uk/index.php?id=271|title=Churchill Square Shopping Centre: Churchill Square Food|accessdate=20 August 2007[/tpl] It was built in the 1960s as an open-air, multi-level pedestrianised shopping centre, but was rebuilt and enlarged in 1998 and is no longer open-air. Further retail areas include Western Road and London Road.

===Economic history===

The mainstay of Brighton's economy for its first 700 years was fishing. Open land called the Hempshares (the site of the present Lanes) provided hemp for ropes; sails were made from flax grown in Hove;[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=124.[/tpl] nets were dried and boats were kept on the open land which became Old Steine;[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=224.[/tpl] and fishermen lived and worked on the foreshore below the East Cliff, in an area known as Lower Town.  Herring and mackerel were sometimes used in ecclesiastical and manorial transactions, a tradition which ended in the 19th century.  As Brighton grew, many fishermen moved to the Carlton Hill area and used its many warehouses and workshops to cure and smoke their catches.[tpl]Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=386.[/tpl]  The industry was so important in the town's early history that in 1579 a commission of important residents, formed at the Privy Council of England's request, commanded the fishermen to document how they worked and how they divided and distributed their catches and profits. These customs were then enshrined in law. Two original copies of The Book of All The Auncient Customs heretoforeused amonge the fishermen of the Toune of Brighthelmstone [tpl]sic[/tpl] survive.[tpl]Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§2.[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=124–125.[/tpl]  In 1580, the year it was published, Brighton's 80-boat, 10,000-net fleet was the largest in southern England and employed 400 men. Herring and mackerel were the main products, but plaice, cod and conger eels were also fished. By 1790 there were 100 boats, but this declined to 48 by 1948. A fish market established below King's Road in 1864, replacing the ancient open-air market on the beach, moved to Carlton Hill in 1960 but closed in 2005. The present, much smaller fleet is based at Brighton Marina.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=125.[/tpl]
In the 18th century the economy diversified as the town grew. Small-scale foundries were established, especially in the North Laine area; coal importers such as the Brighthelmston Coal Company set up business to receive fuel sent from Newcastle; and the rise of tourism and fashionable society was reflected in the proliferation of lodging house keepers, day and boarding school proprietors, dressmakers, milliners and jewellers. Many women worked: more than half of working women in Brighton in the late 18th century were in charge of lodging houses, and domestic service and large-scale laundries were other major employers.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=111.[/tpl]  Brewing was another of Brighton's early specialisms. The industry started in the 17th century and took off after 1800. Major names included the Kemp Town Brewery (1840s–1964),[tpl]#tag:ref|This is not the same as the present Kemp Town Brewery, founded in 1988 and based at the Hand in Hand pub in Kemptown.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=38.[/tpl]|group=note[/tpl] Cannon Brewery (1821–1969), Griffiths (later Rock) Brewery (1809–1960), the Albion, the Longhurst and the Bristol Steam Brewery. Many others failed to survive the 19th century. The Black Lion Brewery in The Lanes, founded by Dirick Carver in 1545, stopped brewing in 1901 but its buildings survived until 1968. The biggest brewery was Tamplins (1821–1973), which owned over 200 pubs in Brighton at one time and bought many smaller breweries such as the Smithers (1851) and West Street (1767) companies.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=36–38.[/tpl]

The West Pier was built in 1866 and is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the United Kingdom. It has been closed since 1975.

The Brighton Wheel opened with some controversy, directly north east of the Brighton Marine Palace and Pier in October 2011 after a previous attempt to locate it in a more central location near the Metropole Hotel, at which time it was to have been the "Brighton O" – a special spokeless design[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jasonkitcat.com/2009/11/brighton-o-k-or-o-no/ |title=OK or O no |publisher=Jasonkitcat.com |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] rather than the traditional spoked wheel eventually purchased from its previous home in South Africa.

===Churches and places of worship===

The 11th century St Nicholas Church is the oldest building in Brighton, commonly known as "The Mother Church".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.regencybrighton.com/outabout/st_nicholas/|title=St. Nicholas Church – Out & About – Regency Square Area Society|accessdate=11 April 2007[/tpl] Other notable churches include the large brick-built St Bartholomew's, St Peter's and St. Martin's, noted for its decorated interior. Brighton's Quakers run the Friends' Meeting House in the Lanes.

===Beaches===

The seafront has bars, restaurants, nightclubs, sports facilities and amusement arcades, principally between the piers. Being less than an hour from London by train has made the city a popular destination.[tpl]cite web|author=DoStagDo |url=http://www.dostagdo.co.uk/brighton/ |title=Brighton Stag Do |accessdate=19 May 2012[/tpl] Brighton beach has a nudist area (by Kemptown near the easterly edge of the promenade).

The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath heads west along the seafront above the beach.
Since the 1978 demolition of the Black Rock open-air lido at the eastern end of Brighton's seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe's largest marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall, and further development is planned including a high-rise hotel which has aroused debate, mirroring proposals for the King Alfred leisure centre in Hove, which were shelved in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1153045 |title=Developments in Brighton and Hove |publisher=Brighton-hove.gov.uk |accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] Part of the beach adjoining Madeira Drive, to the east of the city centre, has been redeveloped into a sports complex and opened to the public in March 2007, with courts for pursuits such as beach volleyball and ultimate Frisbee among others.

There are also two multiplex cinemas.

===Festivals and rallies===

Each May the city hosts the Brighton Festival, the second largest arts festival in the UK (after Edinburgh). This includes processions such as the Children's Parade, outdoor spectaculars often involving pyrotechnics, and theatre, music and visual arts in venues throughout the city, some brought into this use exclusively for the festival. The earliest feature of the festival, the Artists' Open Houses, are homes of artists and craftspeople opened to the public as galleries, and usually selling the work of the occupants. Since 2002, these have been organised independently of the official Festival and Fringe.
Brighton Fringe runs alongside Brighton Festival, and has grown to be the second largest fringe festival in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitbritain.com/VB3-en/experiences/cities/focus_on/brighton_fringe.aspx|title=Brighton Fringe Festival 2006 – Cities – VisitBritain|accessdate=20 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Together with the street performers from Brighton Festival's "Streets of Brighton" events, and the Royal Mile-esque outdoor performances that make up "Fringe City", outdoor spectacles and events more than double during May.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/press/index.asp?ID=122|title=Brighton Fringe Festival 2007. 5–28 May 2007.|accessdate=20 August 2007[/tpl]

Brighton is the terminus of a number of London-to-Brighton rides, and runs, such as the veteran car run and bike ride. Transport rallies are also hosted on the seafront. Groups of mods and Rockers still bring their scooters and motorbikes to the town, but their gatherings are now much more sedate than the violent 1960s confrontations depicted in Quadrophenia.
Food and drink related festivals include the traditional Blessing of the Fisheries, where barbecued mackerel are eaten on the beach and the more recent Fiery Foods Chilli Festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fieryfoodsuk.co.uk/ |title=Fiery Foods Chilli festival, Brighton, 2012 |publisher=Fieryfoodsuk.co.uk |date=16 September 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] There is also a twice-yearly general food festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brightonfoodfestival.com/ |title=Brighton Food Festival |publisher=Brighton Food Festival |accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] The main Sussex beer festival is held in nearby Hove, and there is a smaller beer festival in the Hanover area.

==Transport==

Brighton has several railway stations, many bus routes, coach services and taxis. A Rapid Transport System has been under consideration for some years.  Trolleybuses, trams, ferries and hydrofoil services have operated in the past.
Brighton is connected to the national road network by the A23 (London Road) northwards, and by two east–west routes: the A259 along the coast and the A27 trunk route inland. The A23 joins the M23 motorway at Pease Pottage near Gatwick Airport.[tpl]Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=49.[/tpl]  The A27 originally ran through the urban area along Old Shoreham Road and Lewes Road, but it now follows the route of the Brighton Bypass (opened in 1990) and the old alignment has become the A270. A bypass was first proposed in 1932, six routes were submitted for approval in 1973, and the Department of the Environment published its recommended route in 1980. Public enquiries took place in 1983 and 1987, construction started in 1989 and the first section—between London Road at Patcham and the road to Devil's Dyke—opened in summer 1991.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=48.[/tpl]  By 1985 there were about 5,000 parking spaces in central Brighton. The largest car parks are at London Road, King Street, and the Churchill Square/Regency Road/Russell Road complex.[tpl]Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=10.[/tpl] In 1969, a 520-space multi-storey car park was built beneath the central gardens of Regency Square.[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=273.[/tpl]

A wider range of long-distance destinations was served until 2007–08 when rationalisation caused the ending of InterCity services via Kensington (Olympia) and Reading to Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.  Twice-daily long-distance services to Bristol and Great Malvern are operated by First Great Western via the West Coastway Line.
Until deregulation in 1986, bus services in Brighton were provided by Southdown Motor Services and Brighton Borough Transport under a joint arrangement called "Brighton Area Transport Services". Southdown were part of the nationalised NBC group and were based at Freshfield Road in the Kemptown area; Brighton Borough Transport were owned by the council and used the former tram depot at Lewes Road as their headquarters. Joint tickets were available and revenue was shared.[tpl]Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|pp=48, 50.[/tpl]  The Brighton & Hove Bus Company, owned by the Go-Ahead Group since 1993, now runs most bus services in Brighton.

The only park and ride facility in Brighton is based at the Withdean Stadium. It does not offer a dedicated shuttle bus service: intending passengers must join the Brighton & Hove Bus Company's route 27 service to Saltdean—which travels via Brighton railway station, the Clock Tower and Old Steine—and pay standard fares.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/park-ride-1|title=Park & Ride|year=2013|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M5Q4IpeJ|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]  The 20-year City Plan released in January 2013 ruled out an official park-and-ride facility, stating it would be an "inefficient use of public money, particularly in an era of declining car use". Councillors and residents in Woodingdean and Rottingdean have claimed that streets and car parks in those areas have become unofficial park-and-ride sites: drivers park for free and take buses into the city centre.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10593091.Woodingdean_being_turned_into_unofficial__park_and_ride__claim_residents/|title=Woodingdean being turned into unofficial "park and ride" claim residents|last=Ridgway|first=Tim|date=6 August 2013|publisher=Newsquest Media (Southern) Ltd|work=The Argus|accessdate=23 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M5Q7Xn1Y|archivedate=23 December 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
