Shawn Murphy, PC, MP, QC (born July 27, 1951 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island) is a Canadian politician. 
Murphy attended the University of Prince Edward Island, and later the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law, graduating with a law degree in 1976. He returned to Prince Edward Island and joined a local law practice, working alongside future Premier Joe Ghiz. In 1997, he was made a Queen's Counsel.  Murphy is married and has three adult children: Kevin, Paul, and Brian.
Murphy was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Charlottetown since the election of 2000.  During the Martin government, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans with special emphasis on the Oceans Action Plan.  
He was re-elected with nearly 50% of the vote in the 2004 federal election.
Despite rumours of his vulnerability in the 2006 federal election, Murphy was reelected with slightly more than 50% of the vote. With the Liberals now in opposition, Murphy became the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  Murphy was re-elected in the 2008 federal election, again winning by a comfortable margin. He announced on October 13, 2010 that he would not be running in the next election.Shawn Murphy leaving politics The Guardian. October 13, 2010
