[[Malingering]]

CATEGORIES: Forensic psychology, Communication of falsehoods

In medicine, malingering is fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of "secondary gain" motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences; or simply to attract attention or sympathy.  Malingering is different from somatization disorder and factitious disorder.R. Rogers Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception 3rd Edition, Guilford, 2008.

==History==

In the Hebrew Bible, David feigns insanity to escape from a king who views him as an enemy.I Sam 21:10-15 Odysseus was stated to have also feigned insanity in order to avoid participating in the Trojan War.Hyginus Fabulae 95. Cf. Apollodorus Epitome 3.7. Malingering has been recorded historically as early as Roman times by the physician Galen, who reported two cases. One patient simulated colic to avoid a public meeting, while the other feigned an injured knee to avoid accompanying his master on a long journey."Galen on Malingering, Centaurs, Diabetes, and Other Subjects More or Less Related", Proceedings of the Charaka Club, X (1941), p52-55  In his social-climbing manual, Elizabethan George Puttenham recommends that would-be courtiers have "sickness in his sleeve, thereby to shake off other importunities of greater consequence" and suggests feigning a "dry dropsy ... of some such other secret disease, as the common conversant can hardly discover, and the physician either not speedily heal, or not honestly bewray.""The Art of English Posey: a Critical Edition." George Puttenham. Ed. Frank Whigham & Wayne A. Rebhorn. (2007) 379-380.
Because malingering was widespread throughout the Soviet Union to escape sanctions or coercion, physicians were limited by the state in the number of medical dispensations they could issue.Structured Strain in the Role of the Soviet Physician, Mark G. Field, 1953 The American Journal of Sociology, v.58;5;493-502 
With thousands forced into manual labour, doctors were presented with four types of patients:
This dependence upon doctors by poor labourers altered the doctor-patient relationship to one of mutual mistrust and deception.

==Symptoms==

Some conditions are thought to be easier to feign than others. For example, virtually everyone has experienced pain and knows how a person in pain should appear to others.[tpl]cite journal |author=McDermott BE, Feldman MD |title=Malingering in the medical setting |journal=Psychiatr Clin North Am |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=645–62 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2007.07.007 |pmid=17938038 [/tpl]
