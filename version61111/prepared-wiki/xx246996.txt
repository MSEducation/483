==Publication history==

===Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition (2008-)===

The Raven Queen appears as one of the deities described in the Players Handbook for fourth edition (2008).Heinsoo, Rob, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. Player's Handbook. (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) Although she is an original creation for the 4th edition pantheon, Divine Power and the 4th edition Manual of the Planes establish that she was once the mortal consort of the original god of the dead, Nerull. She overthrew the tyrannical Nerull and claimed his portfolio by absorbing the powers of every tormented soul in his dominion, leading the other deities to revoke her power over deceased souls; hence, she can only claim dominion over death itself, and not over those who have died.
The Raven Queen would later solidify her power base during the War of Winter, when she demanded the portfolio of winter in exchange for slaying the rebel goddess Khala.Heinsoo, Rob, Richard Baker, Logan Bonner, and Robert J. Schwalb. Divine Power. (Wizards of the Coast, 2009)[tpl]rp|67[/tpl] The Raven Queen thus joined the ranks of those gods who control the seasons, the others being Corellon (spring), Pelor (summer) and Sehanine (autumn). At some point, the Raven Queen assisted Corellon in his war against Lolth; as a reward, she demanded power over fate, which had previously been in Lolth's portfolio.Schwalb, Robert J., ''Deities & Demigods: the Raven Queen's Misbegotten in Dungeon Magazine #171.(Wizards of the Coast, 2009)
The Raven Queen counts few personal enemies (or friends) among the gods. She is the only god on "friendly" terms with Torog, but even she keeps the King That Crawls at arm's length. Her most hated foe is Orcus, the Demon Prince of the Undead, who constantly schemes to slay her and take her portfolio.Mearls, Mike, Stephen Schubert, and James Wyatt. Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2008)[tpl]rp|206[/tpl] Dragon #374 implies that she may be romantically interested in the coldhearted Archfey known as the Prince of Frost.Baker, Keith. The Court of Stars: The Prince of Frost in Dragon Magazine #374, page 54 (Wizards of the Coast, 2009)
