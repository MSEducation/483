The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is a 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon. The facility is located in Eastern Oregon in both Morrow and Gilliam counties, near Arlington. Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. The wind farm was built by Caithness Energy using General Electric (GE) 2.5 MW wind turbines, and it supplies electricity to Southern California Edison. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon. It is one of the largest land-based wind farms in the world. It officially opened in September 2012.

The wind farm is located in Eastern Oregon in both Morrow and Gilliam counties, with the majority of the turbines to be in Gilliam County.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.bluemountainalliance.org/news/Shepards%20Flat%20farm%20lifts%20off.pdf |title=Shepherds Flat farm lifts off |last=Mills|first=Erin |date=July 12, 2009 |work=East Oregonian |accessdate=11 December 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Oregon provided tax incentives to the developer to help land the facility,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2009/11/tax_dollars_blow_away_in_wind.html |title=Tax dollars blow away in wind projects |last=Sickinger|first=Ted |date=November 28, 2009 |work=The Oregonian |accessdate=11 December 2009[/tpl] but the project is expected to provide Gilliam County with about $5 million annually in taxes and fees when it is operating.

The project design now includes 338 GE2.5XL turbines built by GE Wind Energy, each with a capacity to produce 2.5 megawatts, and used for the first time in USA. These turbines and a ten-year service contract cost a total of $1.4 billion, the largest expense on the estimated $2 billion project.  In December 2010, the Department of Energy (DOE) offered a $1.3 billion loan guarantee for the project. The insurance fee for the loan guarantee would be paid from federal stimulus money through the Financial Institution Partnership Program.DOE LPO finalizes deal on the World’s largest Wind Project to date United States Department of Energy, 17 December 2010.

Once operational, the facility will have about 35 permanent employees.

==Concerns==

There are concerns that have been raised by taxpayer watchdog groups and various blogs. They point out that large private ranch owners in the area will receive up to $12,000 annually per turbine leased on their land while they have already received tens of millions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies over the years and then benefiting from taxpayer subsidies of the wind energy industry. Some local ranchers due to benefit or already benefiting from the partially government subsidized wind energy projects were published as receiving nearly $1 million in government agricultural subsidies in 2008 alone.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/15/AR2010041503120.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Juliet | last=Eilperin | title=Pentagon objections hold up Oregon wind farm | date=16 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergyreport.com/2010/04/15/faa-and-air-force-ground-wind-farm-development/|title=FAA and Air Force Ground Wind Farm Development[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://trueslant.com/timzimmermann/2010/04/19/priority-smackdown-alternative-energy-vs-the-pentagon/|title=Priority Smackdown: Alternative Energy Vs.
