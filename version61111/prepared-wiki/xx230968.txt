[[Time-dependent gate oxide breakdown]]

CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device defects

Time-dependent gate oxide breakdown (or time-dependent dielectric breakdown, TDDB) is a failure mechanism in MOSFETs, when the gate oxide breaks down as a result of long-time application of relatively low electric field (as opposite to immediate breakdown, which is caused by strong electric field). The breakdown is caused by formation of a conducting path through the gate oxide to substrate due to electron tunneling current, when MOSFETs are operated close to or beyond their specified operating voltages.

==Test method==

A general test method used for measuring this failure mechanism is called "charge to breakdown" (QBD).
