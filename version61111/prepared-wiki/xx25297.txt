==Early life==

Hearst was born in San Francisco, California, the third of five daughters of Randolph Apperson Hearst and Catherine Wood Campbell. She grew up primarily in Hillsborough. She attended Crystal Springs School for Girls in Hillsborough and the Santa Catalina School in Monterey. Among her few close friends she counted Patricia Tobin, whose family founded the Hibernia Bank, a branch of which Hearst would later aid in robbing.

===Kidnapping and the SLA===

On February 4, 1974, the 19-year-old Hearst was kidnapped from her Berkeley, California apartment, which she shared with her fiancé Steven Weed, by a left-wing urban guerrilla group called the Symbionese Liberation Army.FBI — Patty Hearst Kidnapping. Fbi.gov. Retrieved on April 15, 2014. When the attempt to swap Hearst for jailed SLA members failed, the SLA demanded that the captive's family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian – an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst's father arranged the immediate donation of $6 million worth of food to the poor of the Bay Area. After the distribution of food, the SLA refused to release Hearst because they deemed the food to have been of poor quality. (In a subsequent tape recording released to the press, Hearst commented that her father could have done better.) On April 3, 1974, Hearst announced on an audiotape that she had joined the SLA and assumed the name "Tania"[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/timeline/timeline2.html | title = Timeline: Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst | publisher = American Experience | date = August 8, 2006 [/tpl] (inspired by the nom de guerre of Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider, Che Guevara's comrade)."Cuba honors the remains of 10 Guevara comrades" JOSE LUIS MAGANA.

===Trial and imprisonment===

While being booked into jail, she listed her occupation as "Urban Guerilla" and asked her attorney to relay the following message: "Tell everybody that I'm smiling, that I feel free and strong and I send my greetings and love to all the sisters and brothers out there."[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,913456,00.html | title = Patty's Twisted Journey | work = Time | date = September 29, 1975 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] However, according to Hearst interviewer Margaret Singer, a noted authority on prisoners of war and other victims, including Maryknoll priests[tpl]cite news|last=West|first=Louis Jolyon|title=Psychiatrist pleads for Patty Hearst's release|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19781229&id=hAQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3277,8989206|accessdate=January 28, 2013|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=December 29, 1978[/tpl]  released from the People's Republic of China in the 1950s, this is not unusual in such cases. Singer strongly pleaded for understanding on Hearst's behalf before, during and after the trial. Court-appointed doctor Louis Jolyon West as well as interviewers Drs. Robert Jay Lifton and Martin Theodore Orne agreed. Lifton went so far as to state after a 15-hour interview with Hearst that she was a "classic case," about two weeks being needed for almost all persons undergoing that level of mind control to shuck off a good deal of the "gunk" that has filled the mind, as happened in his opinion with Hearst's case. "If (she) had reacted differently, that would have been suspect" and Hearst was "a rare phenomenon (in a first-world nation)… the first and as far as I know the only victim of a political kidnapping in the United States" were direct quotes from Hearst's autobiography attributed to the doctor. Dr. West firmly asserted that while Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze and other movement members had used a rather coarse version, they did employ the classic Maoist formula for thought control; Hearst was young and apolitical enough to be at extreme risk and, in his professional experience, it would have even broken many experienced soldiers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg02163.html |title=CTRL Fwd: MC Patty Hearst on Joly West & his friends |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=January 10, 1999 |accessdate=May 8, 2010[/tpl]
In her trial, which commenced on January 15, 1976 (and in her dozens of previous interviews by FBI agents Charles Bates and Lawrence Lawler—any reference to which was not allowed by the presiding judge to be included in the trial), Hearst's attorney F. Lee Bailey claimed that Hearst had been blindfolded, imprisoned in a narrow closet and physically and sexually abused. Hearst's defense claimed that her actions were the result of a concerted brainwashing program.
The prosecution countered with two experts:  Dr. Joel Fort, who, unsolicited, had previously offered favorable testimony in paid service to the defense team, which was refused; and Dr. Harry L. Kozol, noted expert on neurological disorders, sex offenders and high-profile mentally ill criminals. He formerly had been the long term doctor for Eugene O'Neill and evaluated the confessed Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, a case defended in 1967 by Bailey. Kozol claimed Hearst was "a rebel in search of a cause" and that the robbery had been "an act of free will."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/health/research/01kozol.html | work=The New York Times | title=Harry L. Kozol, Expert in Patty Hearst Trial, Is Dead at 102 | first=Benedict | last=Carey | date=September 1, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] During a pre-trial interview, Hearst accurately described the apartment where the SLA was captured, but neglected to mention the narrow closet where she was allegedly confined. In Kozol’s view, Hearst’s omission confirmed the prosecution’s thesis: returning the embrace of the SLA, she had ceased to be a victim. The rebel had come out of the closet.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/magazine/28kozol-t.html?adxnnl=1&partner=rss&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1280566991-UdEMvM5giWaVsydc6JiCng | work=The New York Times Magazine | title=Harry L.

"Harry never lost the spirit of the law," Dr. Harold W. Williams, then a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, told The New York Times in 1976, when prosecutors asked Dr. Kozol to examine Hearst. "Harry is very much in personality a lawyer."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2008/08/31/harry_kozol_exposed_dark_side_of_human_behavior_102/| work=The Boston Globe | title=Harry Kozol, exposed dark side of human character 102| first=Brian | last=Marquard | date=August 31, 2008 | accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]
Bailey argued that she had been coerced or intimidated into taking part in the bank robbery. However, she refused to give evidence against the other captured SLA members. This was seen as complicity by the prosecution team.
Hearst was convicted of bank robbery on March 20, 1976. She was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment, but her prison sentence was later commuted to two years by President Jimmy Carter, and Hearst was released from prison on February 1, 1979, having served 22 months. She was granted a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001.

==Personal life==

After her release from prison, she married her former bodyguard, Bernard Shaw and had two children: Gillian and Lydia Hearst-Shaw.  They resided in Garrison, New York. Hearst has occasionally granted interviews to national media regarding the SLA incidents and taken minor acting parts.
