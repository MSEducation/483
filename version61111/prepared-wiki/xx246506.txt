She wants him to "speed it up," and states that [tpl]nihongo3|dare ni mo norasenai.|誰にも 乗らせない|"nobody else can ride (him)"[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title= FAST CAR 安室奈美恵 歌詞情報 - goo 音楽| url=http://music.goo.ne.jp/lyric/LYRUTND87037/index.html| accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Amuro describes the lyrics as being a "playful adult love song," where a woman is teasing a boy by saying that he is hers.

She liked it for its "analog atmosphere," and said it reminded her of the Sofia Coppola film "Marie Antoinette."[tpl]cite web | title= 安室奈美恵『驚きのコラボで話題のミュージックビデオについて語る！』 | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/interview/091215_01.html | publisher=Oricon Style Music |date=2009-12-16 | accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl]

==Music video==

The music video was shot by director Shigeaki Kubo,[tpl]cite web | title= 安室奈美恵 FAST CAR (from「PAST ＜ FUTURE」)| url=http://www.spaceshowertv.com/search/detail.cgi?mu=0077445&ch=0| accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] and was shot over two days.[tpl]cite web | title= 安室奈美恵 ニュー・アルバムのジャケットを解禁！！ | url=http://www.vibe-net.com/news/?news=2001046 |date=2009-11-26 | accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] The video has a "gorgeous bourgeois world" theme, and was given the concept after Amuro's first impressions of listening to a demo of the song., The video made its TV Primere November 26, 2009.
The video centers around scenes shot in four different Palace of Versailles-inspired rooms: a bedroom, a hallway, a main hall, and a more contemporary striped alcove. In the bedroom, she performs a dance with hand-held fans, with four female dancers on a four poster bed. In the hallway scene, she walks in from the door at the end and performs a contemporary style dance with four male dancers in a bourgeois/cabaret-inspired outfit. The main hall dance begins in a contemporary style with all eight dancers, and transitions to a ballroom style. In the red alcove, she poses in a black dress and leather stilettos without dancing, instead mouthing the song's lyrics and making small posture changes. The majority of scenes in the last minute focus on the main hall dance.
Amuro found the video the most difficult music to create in her 17 year music career, due to the clothing and choreography. She calls the video the highlight of the Past Future session videos.
The video won the award for Best Female Video at the 2010 MTV World Stage VMAJ, as well as the Best Video of the Year award and Best Art Direction Video award at the 14th Space Shower Music Video Awards.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/4673248/ | title=「SPACE SHOWER MUSIC VIDEO AWARDS」、大賞に安室奈美恵、ベストアーティストに椎名林檎 | publisher=Barks | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-03-23[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
