Joseph Gallison (born March 9, 1935) is an American actor who worked steadily in television soap operas for twenty-seven years.  He is probably best known for his role as Dr. Neil Curtis on Days of our Lives (1974-1991).
Gallison is also well known for playing the character of William (Bill) Matthews, Jr., on Another World (1964-1969).  Other soap roles have included Tom Edwards on One Life to Live (1969-1971) and Steven Cord on Return to Peyton Place (1972-1974). He is also heard in the You're Under Arrest series, dubbing the voice of Inspector Tokuno.
Gallison was one of the few actors in Days of our Lives to be fired without an explanation as to what happened to the character. In his final scene, Neil excused himself from his conversation with Victor Kiriakis, saying that he had "patients to see -- lots of patients". He never returned and his absence was never explained.
On April 22, 1962, Gallison, under the name Evan McCord appeared as Jim Martin, Jr., in the episode "The Youngest" of the ABC-Warner Brothers western series, Lawman. In the story line, "Ma" Martin (Olive Carey) bullies her three sons, particularly the youngest, Jim, Jr., to take revenge on Marshal Troop for the rightful shooting death of their father, who pulled a gun while involved in a crooked poker game. Jim, however, decides to stand up to his mother with the realization that his father provoked the shooting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630076/|title="The Youngest" (April 22, 1962)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=June 13, 2013[/tpl]
