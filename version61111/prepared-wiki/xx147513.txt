Kosta Čavoški (Serbian Cyrillic: Коста Чавошки) (born 1941 in Banatsko Novo Selo) is a professor at the University of Belgrade's Law School. He is an outspoken critic of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
He was one of the thirteen initiators of the re-establishment of the Democratic Party in Serbia on December 11, 1989. He was one of the leading members of the Founding Committee of the Democratic Party who drafted the first party political program of the Democratic Party published as the Letter of Intent (Pismo o namerama) on 18 January 1990.  However, within a year he left the Democratic Party along with Professor Nikola Milošević and others to found his own political entity, the Serbian Liberal Party.
Kosta Čavoški had been a dissident since the 1970s when as an assistant law professor at University of Belgrade in 1973 he published an article critical of the communist system entitled "Which values are protected by our laws?”. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and thrown out of the Law School. In 1990 he was readmitted to the Law School as a full-time professor, and at the beginning of 1996 the President of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska Radovan Karadžić appointed him a Senator of the entity.
On February 23, 2007, Čavoški was briefly questioned by the police in Republika Srpska after visiting the family of Radovan Karadžić, a fugitive accused of war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War.
In June 2008 he was declared persona non grata by Bosnia-Herzegovina because of his connections, and he was banned from entering the country again.Bosnia to expel Serbian professor, B92, June 4, 2008
