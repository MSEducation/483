Aymon (1291–1343), nicknamed the Peaceful, was Count of Savoy from 1329 to 1343. 
Aymon was born in  Chambéry.  His father was Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, and he was the younger brother of Edward, Count of Savoy.
He contested the title Count of Savoy with his niece, Joan of Savoy since Savoy operated under Salic law and had never had a female ruler. Joan with the support of her husband, John III, Duke of Brittany defended Joan's claim. John and Joan had no issue.

Aymon married Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrato granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and had 5 children, only 2 lived to adulthood:
