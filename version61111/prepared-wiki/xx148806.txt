[[Psion Siena]]

CATEGORIES: Psion devices

The Psion Siena is a personal digital assistant made by Psion PLC and was released in 1996.
Two versions of the Siena were released, one containing 512KB of memory and the second with 1MB.
The main power is provided by two AAA batteries and the backup power by one cell-style CR1620 battery. The batteries are held in a compartment below a detachable casing in the top of the device. It does not have a socket for an external power source.
The Siena was of the same generation as the Psion 3 series but it has a smaller size screen (240x160 pixels) and an additional numeric pad next to the screen. The Siena uses the same 16bit NEC V30 processor as its predecessor the Series 3a. Although the Siena shares binary compatibility with the Series 3 many programs had to be modified due to the lower memory availability and smaller screen sizes.
Unlike the Series 3, the Siena does not have a bay for removable solid state disk drives; however, an external drive device is available which connects via an RS-232 serial port. The serial port also provides PC connectivity if used with the separately available PsiWin software and dial up access via the Travel modem accessory.  Additional connectivity was available via the included infrared port, alongside the serial port.

The device was used as a model for a gadget in Anarky (vol.1) #3, Metamorphosis: The Economics of The Madhouse, a DC comic book.  The character, Anarky, is seen tracking Batman's movements using the small PDA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rzero.com/books/Anarky.html |title=Anarky |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=VerBeek |first=Todd |work=Beek's Books|quote=As a years-long user of Psion's wonderful pocket-sized computers, I got a kick out of seeing that Anarky uses a Psion Siena personal organiser. But like much of the hardware we see, it's boxy and awkward, instead of the sleek little gadget it is.[/tpl]
