Compressed air filters, often referred to as line filters, are used to remove contaminates from compressed air after compression has taken place.
Air leaving a standard screw or piston compressor will generally have a high water content, as well as a high concentration of oil and other contaminants. There are many different types of filters, suitable for different pneumatics applications.
==Working principle== 
Unfiltered compressed air frequently contains dust, oil, rust, moisture and other harmful substances, and therefore requires filtration. In the first stage of filtration, the compressed air passes through a tube-shaped mesh filter, which creates a coalescence effect. Here bigger particles are adsorbed on the filter and the water will condense into larger droplets, which can then pass into the separation chamber. The compressed air is slowed down, which makes the particles condense on a honeycomb-like pad, allowing the water droplets to travel to the bottom of the drainage system and through an automatic or electric drain valve to the discharge. In the first filtration stage more than 95% of the water droplets, oil and large particles are removed. 
In the second filtration stage the air is passed through fiber made of cotton, generating thousands of small vortices and accelerating the air. 

==Types of filters==

===Particulate filters===

Particulate compressed air filters are used to remove dust and particles from the air.

===Activated carbon filters===

Activated carbon filters utilize a composite carbon material to remove gases and odors from the air.[tpl]cite web|title=Terminology|url=http://www.vokesair.com/air-filter-guide/terminology|author=Vokes Air|accessdate=August 3, 2013[/tpl] They are used in factories where food is produced or for breathing gas.

===Coalescing filters===

High oil compressed air coalescing filters remove water and oil aerosols by coalescing the aerosols into droplets. This happens partially because of torturous path and pressure drop. Coalescers remove both water and oil aerosols from the air stream, and are rated at particulate contamination through direct interception. Filtration of oil, water aerosols, dust and dirt particles to 0.01 µm the best achievable in industry.

===Cold coalescing filters===

Cold coalescing filters are coalescing filters operated at around [tpl]convert|35|F|C[/tpl], allowing them to be more effective at removing moisture.1213

===Compressed intake filters===

Intake filters are the first line of defense in filtering. These filters can remove contaminates down to 0.3 µm and can remove chemical contaminants.
