==Career summary==

Lloyd, whose elder brother Wally also rode, took up speedway in 1936, first riding at Wembley before gaining further experience at Birmingham, before signing with Bristol Bulldogs. When speedway resumed in 1945 he returned, and was one of the top riders in the Northern League in 1946.Storey, Basil (1948), The Story of Speedway, WDS, p. 9 He joined the Newcastle Diamonds in 1946, and finished the season averaging over ten points per match in the Northern League. 
In 1947 it was expected that he would be signed by a higher division team but he started the season with the Diamonds. A few weeks into the season, the New Cross Rangers signed Lloyd for a transfer fee of [tpl]GBP[/tpl]1,000 (at the time the highest transfer fee in British speedway), with Ken Le Breton transferring in the opposite direction. By then end of the next season, he had won the National League championship.Jacobs, N. (2008) Out of the Frying Pan, The History Press LTD ISBN 978-0-7524-4476-5
Lloyd was selected to represent England in the test series against Australia in the 1948 Ashes series.Foster, P. (2005) History of the Speedway Ashes, The History Press Ltd. ISBN 0-7524-3468-3
1950 saw Lloyd start the season with the Rangers but midway through the season he was transferred to the Harringay Racers, a move that was not popular with the New Cross fans. Whilst with the Racers he qualified for the Speedway World Championship final three times and was a member of the team that won the National Trophy in 1952.Jacobs, Norman (2001). Speedway in London.
