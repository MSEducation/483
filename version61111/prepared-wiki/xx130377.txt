William Klein (born April 19, 1928) is an American-born French photographer and filmmaker noted for his ironic approach[tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles1.html|title= William Klein|work=Photography of the 20th Century|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles2.html|title= Text by John Heilpern|work=William Klein: Photographs|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl] to both media and his extensive use of unusual photographic techniques in the context of photojournalism and fashion photography. He was ranked 25th on Professional Photographer's list of 100 most influential photographers.[tpl]cite web |publisher= Professional Photographer Magazine|url= http://www.professionalphotographer.co.uk/magazine/photographic-inspiration/100-most-influential-photographers-of-all-time|title= Professional Photographer Magazine|work=Top 100 Most influential photographers Century|accessdate= 2012-01-28[/tpl]
Trained as a painter, Klein studied under Fernand Léger and found early success with exhibitions of his work. However, he soon moved on to photography and achieved widespread fame as a fashion photographer for Vogue and for his photo essays on various cities. Despite having no training as a photographer, Klein won the Prix Nadar in 1957 for New York, a book of photographs taken during a brief return to his hometown in 1954. Klein's work was considered revolutionary for its "ambivalent and ironic approach to the world of fashion", its "uncompromising rejection of the then prevailing rules of photography" and for his extensive use of wide-angle and telephoto lenses, natural lighting and motion blur. Klein tends to be cited in photography books along with Robert Frank as among the fathers of street photography, one of those mixed compliments that classifies a man who is hard to classify.[tpl]cite news | first=Katherine | last=Knorr | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=William Klein's Street Life | date=1996-10-26 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/26/style/26iht-klein.t.html | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | language = [/tpl] The world of fashion would become the subject for Klein's first feature film, Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, which, like his other two fiction features, Mr. Freedom and The Model Couple, is a satire.
Klein has directed numerous short and feature-length documentaries and has produced over 250 television commercials.[tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles4.html|title= Klein, William|work=Photography Encyclopedia|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl]
Though American by birth, Klein has lived and worked in France since his late teens. His work has sometimes been openly critical of American society and foreign policy; the film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum once wrote that Klein's 1968 satire Mr. Freedom was "conceivably the most anti-American movie ever made."[tpl]cite web |publisher= Chicago Reader|url= http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mr-freedom/Film?oid=1051221|title= Mr. Freedom|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl] On French TV show Des mots de minuit, William Klein defended the openly far-right and antisemitic comedian and political activist Dieudonné.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xb1epk_patrick-timsit-compare-dieudonne-a_news
