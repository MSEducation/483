[[Kudu gas field]]

CATEGORIES: Oil fields of Namibia, Natural gas fields in Namibia, ǁKaras Region

The Kudu gas field is an offshore gas field in Namibia approximately [tpl]convert|170|km[/tpl] north-west from the city of Oranjemund. It is located in the Orange Sub-basin in [tpl]convert|170|m|ft[/tpl] of water.

==History==

Discovered in 1974, the license has been held by a number of companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Texaco and Energy Africa. In 2004, Tullow Oil acquired Energy Africa for US$570 million and with its 90% interest in the license. Later Tullow Oil sold 20% of the project to Itochu.  The remaining 10% is held by Namibian state oil company Namcor.
On Tuesday, 18 September 2007, shares of Tullow Oil declined by more than 3.0% after the group announced that it had to abandon the Kudu-8 exploration well offshore Namibia and that a second well planned nearby won't be drilled.
In 2010, Namcor and Russian gas company Gazprom agreed to establish a special purpose company to take a majority stake in the Kudu gas field.

==Reserves==

The field is estimated to contain  [tpl]convert|1.3|Tcuft[/tpl] of proven natural gas reserves however more recent exploration and analysis suggests that reserves could reach [tpl]convert|3|Tcuft[/tpl] with potential up to [tpl]convert|9|Tcuft[/tpl].  These figures though are dependent on further work that is yet to be carried out by Tullow Oil on different parts of the field with other geological settings.

==Development==

Suggested development of the field has been for a subsea tie back which would potentially make it one of the world's longest. The tie back would connect it to an 800-megawatt power plant to be located near Oranjemund.  The field would be crucial in meeting Namibia's growing energy demand.
