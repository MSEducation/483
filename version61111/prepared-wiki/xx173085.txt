[[Dorres]]

CATEGORIES: Communes of Pyrénées-Orientales

Dorres is a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southern France.
This place is known for its sulphurous hot spring that gushes out at 42 ° C, and in which there is little swim in summer and winter. Being almost naked in the middle of the snow provides some amazing sensations. And a few years ago, when the source was not yet fully "tamed" and turned into a simulated pool, we could swim at night in a pool of 4m x 2m. Frost, moon, semi-underground and super heat source have caused much turmoil."French Wikipedia"
