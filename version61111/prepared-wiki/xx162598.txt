==History==

The Gippsland League has roots dating back to the Central Gippsland Football League which was founded in 1902. The CGFL morphed into the Latrobe Valley Football League in 1954. The promoters of the LVFL wanted to have a league that consisted of towns along the Orbost railway line, from Warragul to Sale. Three clubs from south Gippsland towns, Leongatha, Korumburra and Mirboo North, were therefore barred from joining the new league and went on to form the South Gippsland FL.
The LVFL changed its name, in 1995, to the Gippsland Latrobe FL.
At the end of 2001, The West Gippsland FL and the Gippsland Latrobe FL had an administrative merger. This created a two-division competition and a name change to West Gippsland Latrobe FL.
From 2002 until 2004, the league comprised a premier division, consisting mainly of the former Gippsland-Latrobe clubs, and a western division, comprising most of the former WGFL clubs.
After the 2004 season, the western division was dissolved, with Warragul, Drouin and Garfield joining the premier league. The remaining clubs from the western division moved to other competitions, such as the Alberton Football League, Ellinbank & District Football League and the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.
In 2009 Garfield left the GFL for the Ellinbank & District Football League, whilst Wonthaggi[tpl]cite news|title=Australian rules football: West Gippsland Latrobe Football League becomes Gippsland Football League as Wonthaggi concedes move|url=http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Australian_rules_football:_West_Gippsland_Latrobe_Football_League_becomes_Gippsland_Football_League_as_Wonthaggi_concedes_move&oldid=1064132|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=December 10, 2009|author=Wikinews contributors[/tpl] and Bairnsdalehttp://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football:_Bairnsdale_join_Gippsland_League,_will_play_first_game_in_Warragul joined the GFL in 2010 and 2011 respectively.
