Warchalking is the drawing of symbols in public places to advertise an open Wi-Fi network.
Inspired by hobo symbols, the warchalking marks were conceived by a group of friends in June 2002 and publicised by Matt Jones who designed the set of icons and produced a downloadable document containing them.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-10-09 | title=Let's Warchalk | publisher= Matt Jones[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2144279.stm | title=Chalk points to wireless internet | accessdate=2008-10-09 | date=2002-07-22 | publisher=BBC[/tpl] Within days of Jones publishing a blog entry about warchalking, articles appeared in dozens of publications and stories appeared on several major television news programs around the world.
The word is formed by analogy to wardriving, the practice of driving around an area in a car to detect open Wi-Fi nodes. That term in turn is based on wardialing, the practice of dialing many phone numbers hoping to find a modem.[tpl] cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1639661.stm| title=Welcome to the era of drive-by hacking | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2008-10-09 | date=2001-11-06[/tpl] 
Having found a Wi-Fi node, the warchalker draws a special symbol on a nearby object, such as a wall, the pavement, or a lamp post. Those offering Wi-Fi service might also draw such a symbol to advertise the availability of their Wi-Fi location, whether commercial or personal.[tpl]expand section|Cites establishing either A) warchalking was actually used in the field, or B) the opposite.
