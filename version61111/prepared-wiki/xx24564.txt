[[List of Aragonese monarchs]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Spanish monarchs, Aragonese monarchs, Crown of Aragon, Counts of Barcelona

This is a list of the rulers of Aragon, now a region of north-eastern Spain. The Kingdom of Aragon included the present-day autonomous community of Aragon. Later Kings of Aragon also ruled the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Sicily, the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica, and assorted territories in the south of France, including the city of Montpellier. This state is referred to as the Crown of Aragon, as opposed to the Kingdom of Aragon (i.e. Aragon proper).

==Monarchs of Aragon==

===House of Jiménez, 1035–1164===

With the death of Sancho III of Navarre, Aragon fell to his son Ramiro, who quickly elevated it into an autonomous state.

Nevertheless, Spanish monarchs up to Isabella II, while styling themselves king/queen of Spain on coins, still used some of the traditional nomenclature of the defunct Crown of Aragon in their official documents: King/Queen of Castile, Leon, 'Aragon, both Sicilies, Jerusalem, Navarra, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Sardinia, Cordova, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, the Algarve, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, the Eastern & Western Indias, the Islands & Mainland of the Ocean sea; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Milan; Count of Habsburg, Flanders, Tyrol, Barcelona'; Lord of Biscay, Molina.
