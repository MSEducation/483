[[Thoughtcrime]]

CATEGORIES: Nineteen Eighty-Four, Political correctness, Words originating in fiction, Thought

A thoughtcrime is an occurrence or instance of controversial or socially unacceptable thoughts. The term is also used to describe some theological concepts such as disbelief or idolatry,Papers in Ethics and Social Philosophy: - Volume 3 - Page 107, David Lewis - 2000 or a rejection of strong social or philosophical principles.Evidence, Policy and Practice: Critical Perspectives in Health and Social Care, Jon Glasby - 2011, p 22
The term was popularized in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, wherein thoughtcrime is the criminal act of holding unspoken beliefs or doubts that oppose or question the ruling party. In the book, the government attempts to control not only the speech and actions, but also the thoughts of its subjects. To entertain unacceptable thought is known as  crimethink in Newspeak, the ideologically purified dialect of the party.[tpl]Citation |last=Orwell |first=George |last2=Rovere |first2=Richard Halworth |title=The Orwell Reader: Fiction, Essays, and Reportage |page=409 |year=1984 |origyear=1956 |location=San Diego |publisher=Harcourt, Brace |isbn=0-15-670176-6 [/tpl].

==Summary==

Some modern publishers have described people who were being prosecuted and burned at the stake for heresy in various Abrahamic religions, as being victims of thought-crime laws. Such victims of thought-crime laws would sometimes be offered the chance to repent for their thought-crimes.Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare, Stephen Greenblatt - 2012
People were similarly executed, or imprisoned in concentration camps, for thoughtcrime during the 20th century in totalitarian regimes, such as Stalinist Russia, Maoist China, and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.
The word is also used in instances where people are prevented from voicing opinions which are politically incorrect or which are abhorrent to others. This prevention may affect speech, writing, and other forms of expression. The punishment of apostasy in sharia law is sometimes interpreted as being the death penalty, which has been described as a thought-crime.Critique: Review of the Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices- Page 330, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, 1992

==Nineteen Eighty-Four==

The Thought Police (thinkpol in Newspeak) are the secret police of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. It is their job to uncover and punish thoughtcrime. The Thought Police use surveillance and psychological monitoring to find and eliminate members of society who challenge the party's authority and ideology.[tpl]Citation |last=McCormick |first=Donald |title=Approaching 1984 |page=21 |year=1980 |location=Newton Abbot, Devon, England |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=0-7153-7654-3 [/tpl].
The Thought Police of Orwell and their pursuit of thoughtcrime were based on the methods used by the totalitarian states and ideologies of the 20th century.
The term "Thought Police", by extension, has come to refer to real or perceived enforcement of ideological correctness.

===Technology and thoughtcrime===

Technology played a significant part in the detection of thoughtcrime in Nineteen Eighty-Fourâ€”with the ubiquitous telescreens which could inform the government, misinform and monitor the population. The citizens of Oceania are watched by the Thought Police through the telescreens. Every movement, reflex, facial expression, and reaction is measured by this system, monitored by the Ministry of Love.
At times, it seems as if the telescreen is constantly watching each citizen.  Winston Smith recognises that he has no idea who is behind the technology, watching him or anyone else.
Because of this system of surveillance, the Thought Police and the Ministry of Love become universally feared by any member of the Outer Party or any one of the 'Proles' who is capable (or felt by the Party to be capable) of thoughtcrime.

===Crimestop===

"Crimestop" means to rid oneself of unwanted thoughts, i.e., thoughts that interfere with the ideology of the Party. This way, a person avoids committing thoughtcrime.
In the novel, we hear about crimestop through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith:

Orwell also describes crimestop from the perspective of Emmanuel Goldstein in the book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism:
