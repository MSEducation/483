The idea of starting this research came from Heather horst’s 'dissertation worked in Mandeville, Jamaica, which explored the imagination, construction and transformation of the meanings of ‘home’ among Jamaicans who migrated to Britain after World War II and returned to Jamaica to retire in the 1990s.'[tpl]cite web|title=About Heather Horst|url=http://heatherhorst.org/about.html[/tpl]  In this research, Heather Horst works on the relationship between material culture, property and personhood by understanding the materiality of the house assert, recognize and negotiate personhood in colonial and postcolonial Jamaica.research-Heather Horst Accessed: 24 September 2011
In order to examine the relationship between new media in this research, Heather Horst began to study on the 'global and transnational processes involved in the construction of the ‘digital divide’ as part of a multi-national comparative study funded by the British Department for International Development (DFID) to examine the implications of new information and communication technologies in Ghana, India, Jamaica and South Africa working with Daniel Miller.'[tpl]cite web|publisher=http://heatherhorst.org/about.html[/tpl]  Also, over the past four years, Horst’s study focuses on 'social change and the power dynamics surrounding the provisioning, access to and use of new media and technology by shifting my attention to the heart of the global technology industry.'[tpl]cite web|url=http://heatherhorst.org/about.html[/tpl]

===Digital YouthFinal Report Accessed: 24 September 2011===

During the time at University of California, Berkley prior to joining University of California, Irvine, Heather Horst was holding a position of a research called Digital Youth which is to address the gap between in-school and out-school experience with a targeted set of ethnographic investigations into three emergent modes of informal learning that young people are practicing using new media technologies: communication, learning, and play by exploring how kids use digital media in their everyday lives. 
This study aims to understand the role of digital media in children and youths’ communication, learning, knowledge, play and, in turn, how digital media may affect their relationships with their peers, siblings, parents or other household members.
