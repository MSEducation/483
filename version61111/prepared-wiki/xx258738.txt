Line 3 of the Beijing Subway ([tpl]zh|s=北京地铁3号线|p=běijīng dìtiě sān hàoxiàn[/tpl]) is a rapid transit rail line under planning in Beijing. The line is part of the planned network of the Beijing Subway for 2020, and is slated to run east-west through the city centre, parallel to Line 6. 

==History==

Line 3's route has undergone substantial changes on the planners' drawing board. In the late 1990s, one draft of the subway plan showed Line 3 running from Xiaomeichang to Cuigezhuang. Half of that route was then folded into Line 6.On October 9, 2008, Zhou Nansen, the deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Planning Committee, indicated that planning work had begun for Lines 3, 11, 12, and 16.
