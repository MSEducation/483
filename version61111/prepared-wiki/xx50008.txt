[[List of grunge albums]]

CATEGORIES: Grunge albums, Lists of albums by genre

This article is a list of grunge albums with articles on Wikipedia. They appear on at least one cited album list and are described as "grunge" by AllMusic (http://www.allmusic.com). Although citations could be found describing each of these as "grunge", in some cases the designation would be controversial, particularly for those bands that are considered Post-grunge.
