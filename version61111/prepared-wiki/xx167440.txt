==Chief Scout Executive==

As Chief Scout Executive Love introduced the BSA campaign against the five "unacceptables": hunger, illicit drugs, child abuse, youth unemployment and illiteracy. The BSA also developed coeducational "Career Awareness" Exploring during the Ben Love years.[tpl]cite web |last=Willwerth |first=James |date=June 24, 2001 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,153312,00.html |title=Cimarron, New Mexico Bears, Bucks And Boy Scouts |work=Time |accessdate=August 2, 2007[/tpl]
It was Love's leadership during his tenure as Chief Scout Executive in defending the BSA during the Curran Case, the Randall case and later the Dale case that charted the course for the Boy Scouts eventual legal victories, but loss of public support. His attitude at the time is evidenced by his quote, "A homosexual," says Love, "is not the role model I would want as the leader of my son's troop - and neither is an atheist."[tpl]cite web |last=Whitman |first=David |date=January 11, 1991 |url= http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/bsa_identity_crisis.html |title= Beyond thrift and loyalty: An identity crisis looms for  the Boy Scouts |work=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=[/tpl]
