CATEGORIES: Canoes, Canoeing and kayaking equipment

A canoe is a lightweight narrow boat, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel using a single-bladed paddle.[tpl]cite web|title=Canoe|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/canoe|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=20 October 2012[/tpl]
Canoes are used for racing, whitewater canoeing, touring and camping, freestyle, and general recreation. The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape and construction material.
Historically, canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame,[tpl]cite web|title=Dugout Canoe|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/dugout-canoe|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl] but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as Fiberglass. Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, but then transitioned to recreational or sporting use. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936.  In countries where the canoe played a key role in history, such as Canada and New Zealand, the canoe remains an important theme in popular culture.
Canoes can be adapted to many purposes, for example with the addition of sails, outboard motors, and outriggers.

==History==

The word canoe comes from the Carib kenu (dugout), via the Spanish canoa.[tpl]cite web|title=The history of the canoe|url=http://www.canoe.ca/AllAboutCanoes/|publisher=canoe.ca|accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl]
Constructed between 8200 and 7600 BC, and found in the Netherlands, the Pesse canoe may be the oldest known canoe. Excavations in Denmark reveal the use of dugouts and paddles during the Ertebølle period, (ca 5300 BC – 3950 BC).[tpl]cite web|title=Dugouts and paddles|url=http://www.abc.se/~pa/publ/tybrind.htm#logboats|accessdate=8 October 2012[/tpl]
Australian Aboriginal people made canoes using a variety of materials, including bark and hollowed out tree trunks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=7049 |title=Carved wooden canoe, National Museum of Australia |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25[/tpl] The indigenous people of the Amazon commonly used Hymenaea trees.
Many indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes. They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame, but other types could be used if birch was scarce. At a typical length of [tpl]convert|14|ft|m[/tpl] and weight of [tpl]convert|50|lb|kg[/tpl], the canoes were light enough to be portaged, yet could carry a lot of cargo, even in shallow water. Although susceptible to damage from rocks, they are easily repaired.[tpl]cite web|title=Bark canoes|url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/watercraft/wab01eng.shtml|publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization|accessdate=8 October 2012[/tpl] Their performance qualities were soon recognized by early European immigrants, and canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America,[tpl]cite web|title=Our Canoeing Heritage|url=http://www.canoemuseum.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=119&Itemid=83|publisher=The Canadian Canoe Museum|accessdate=8 October 2012[/tpl] with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in 1615. René de Bréhant de Galinée a French missionary who explored the Great Lakes in 1669 declared: "The convenience of these canoes is great in these waters, full of cataracts or waterfalls, and rapids through which it is impossible to take any boat. When you reach them you load canoe and baggage upon your shoulders and go overland until the navigation is good; and then you put your canoe back into the water, and embark again.[tpl]cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Louise Phelps|title=Early Narratives of the Northwest. 1634–1699|year=1917|location=New York|pages=172–173[/tpl] American painter, author and traveler George Catlin wrote that the bark canoe was "the most beautiful and light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented."[tpl]cite book|last=Catlin|first=George|title=Letters and Notes on the Manners. Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians|year=1989|edition=reprint|location=New York|page=415[/tpl]
Native American groups of the north Pacific coast made dugout canoes in a number of styles for different purposes, from western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) or yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), depending on availability.[tpl]cite book|last=Pojar and MacKinnon|title=Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast|year=1994|publisher=Lone Pine Publishing|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|isbn=1-55105-040-4[/tpl]  Different styles were required for ocean-going vessels versus river boats, and for whale-hunting versus seal-hunting versus salmon-fishing. The Quinault of Washington State built shovel-nose canoes, with double bows, for river travel that could slide over a logjam without portaging.  The Kootenai of British Columbia province made sturgeon-nosed canoes from pine bark, designed to be stable in windy conditions on Kootenay Lake.[tpl]cite book|last=Nisbet|first=Jack|title=Sources of the River|year=1994|publisher=Sasquatch Books|location=Seattle, Washington|isbn=1-57061-522-5[/tpl]
The first explorer to cross the North American continent, Alexander Mackenzie, used canoes extensively, as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
In the North American fur trade the Hudson's Bay Company's voyageurs used three types of canoe:[tpl]cite web|title=The Canoe|url=http://www2.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/transportation/canoe/|publisher=The Hudson's Bay Company|accessdate=6 October 2012[/tpl]
The birch bark canoe was used in a [tpl]convert|6500|km[/tpl] supply route from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean and the Mackenzie River, and continued to be used up to the end of the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|title=Canoeing|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/canoeing|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=8 October 2012[/tpl]
In 19th-century North America, the birch-on-frame construction technique evolved into the wood-and-canvas canoes made by fastening an external waterproofed canvas shell to planks and ribs at Old Town Canoe in Maine, at the Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company[tpl]cite web|title=A Venerable Chestnut|url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/canoes7.cfm|publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum|accessdate=8 October 2012[/tpl]  in New Brunswick.
Although canoes were once primarily a means of transport, with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft. John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books, and in 1866 founded the Royal Canoe Club in London and in 1880 the American Canoe Association. The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in 1900, and the British Canoe Union in 1936.
Flatwater canoeing was a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.[tpl]cite web|title=Canoe / kayak sprint equipment and history|url=http://www.olympic.org/canoe-kayak-sprint-equipment-and-history?tab=History|publisher=olympic.org|accessdate=29 September 2012[/tpl] The International Canoe Federation was formed in 1946 and is the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide.

==Hull design==

Hull design must meet different, often conflicting, requirements for speed, carrying capacity, maneuverability, and stability[tpl]cite book|title=Canoeing : outdoor adventures|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=0-7360-6715-9[/tpl] The canoe's hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion.

==Materials and construction==

===Modern===

===Traditional===

These materials and techniques are used by artisans and produce boats that some consider more attractive, but which are more fragile than those made with modern methods.[tpl]cite web|title=Buying The Right Canoe - Materials|url=http://www.outdoorplaces.com/Features/Paddle/pickcanoe/newcanoe2.htm|accessdate=6 October 2012[/tpl]

==Symbolism==

In Canada, the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore, and is a symbol of Canadian identity.[tpl]cite web|title=The Canoe|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/nwc/history/12.htm|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl]  From 1935 to 1986 the Canadian silver dollar depicted a voyageur and an aboriginal paddling a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background.
The Chasse-galerie is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a night of heavy drinking on New Year's Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil. Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe.
In John Steinbeck's novella The Pearl set in Mexico, the main character's canoe is a means of making a living that has been passed down for generations and represents a link to cultural tradition.[tpl]cite web|title=The Pearl: Themes, Motifs, & Symbols|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pearl/themes.html|publisher=Spark Notes|accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl]
The Māori, indigenous Polynesian people arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe voyage. Canoe traditions are important to the identity of Māori. Whakapapa (genealogical links) back to the crew of founding canoes served to establish the origins of tribes, and defined tribal boundaries and relationships.[tpl]cite web|title=Story: Canoe traditions|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canoe-traditions/|publisher=The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl]

==Types==

Modern canoe types are usually categorized by the intended use. Many modern canoe designs are hybrids (a combination of two or more designs, meant for multiple uses). The purpose of the canoe will also often determine the materials used. Most canoes are designed for either one person (solo) or two people (tandem), but some are designed for more than two people.

===Sprint===

Sprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing. The paddler kneels on one knee, and uses a single-blade paddle.[tpl]cite web|title=Canoe sprint|url=http://www.canoeicf.com/icf/Aboutoursport/Canoe-Sprint.html|publisher=International Canoe Federation|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl] Canoes have no rudder, so the boat must be steered by the athlete’s paddle using a j-stroke. Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered. The minimum length of the opening on a C1 is 280 cm. Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam, which makes them very unstable.  A C4 can be up to 9 metres long and weigh 30 kg.[tpl]cite web|title=Canoe Sprint Overview|url=http://www.canoeicf.com/icf/London2012/Canoe-Sprint-Section/Canoe-Sprint-Overview.html|publisher=International Canoe Federation|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl] ICF classes include C1 (solo), C2 (crew of two), and C4 (crew of four). Race distances at the 2012 Olympic Games were 200 and 1000 metres.

===Slalom and wildwater===

In ICF whitewater slalom paddlers negotiate their way down a 300m of  whitewater  rapids, through a series of up to 25 gates. The colour of the poles indicates the direction in which the paddlers must past through gates. Categories are C1 (solo) and C2 (tandem), the latter being open to men only.[tpl]cite web|title=About Canoe Slalom|url=http://canoeicf.com/icf/Aboutoursport/Canoe-Slalom/More-on-Canoe-Slalom.html|publisher=International Canoe Federation|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl] C1 boats must have a minimum weight and width of 10 kg and 0.65 m and be not more than 3.5 m long. C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 15 kg and 0.75 m, and be not more that 4.1 m. Rudders are prohibited. Canoes are decked, propelled by single-bladed paddles and inside which the competitor must kneel.[tpl]cite web|title=Rules for Canoe Slalom|url=http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Rules-and-Statutes/2011-Rules/ICF-Canoe-Slalom-Rules-2011/ICF%20Canoe%20Slalom%202011.pdf|publisher=International Canoe Federation|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl]
In ICF wildwater canoeing athletes paddle a course of class III to IV whitewater (using the international scale of river difficulty), passing over waves, holes and rocks of a natural riverbed in events lasting either 20 – 30 minutes ("Classic" races) or 2 – 3 minutes ("Sprint" races). Categories are  C1 and C2, for both women and men. C1s must have a minimum weight and width of 12 kg and 0.7 m, and a maximum length of 4.3 m. C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 18 kg and 0.8 m, and a maximum length of 5 m. Rudders are prohibited. Canoes are decked boats which must be propelled by single bladed paddles and inside which the paddler kneels.[tpl]cite web|title=Wildwater Competition rules 2011|url=http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Rules-and-Statutes/2011-Rules/ICF-Wildwater-Canoeing-Rules-2011/Wildwater%20Canoeing%20Rules%202011.pdf|publisher=International Canoe Federation|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl]

===Marathon===

Marathons are long-distance races which may include portages. Under ICF rules minimum canoe weight is 10 and 14 kg for C1 and C2 respectively. Other rules can vary by race, for example in the Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie athletes race in C2s, with a maximum length of [tpl]convert|18|ft|6|in|m|1[/tpl], minimum width of [tpl]convert|27|in|cm|0[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|3|in|cm|0[/tpl] from the bottom of the centre of the craft, minimum height of [tpl]convert|15|in|cm|0[/tpl] at the bow and [tpl]convert|10|in|cm[/tpl] at the centre and stern.[tpl]cite web|title=La Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie: Rules and Regulations|url=http://www.classiquedecanots.com/en/la-classique/rules-and-regulations|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] The Texas Water Safari, at [tpl]convert|262|mi|km[/tpl], includes an open class, the only rule being the vessel must be human-powered, and although novel setups have been tried, the fastest so far has been the six-man canoe.[tpl]cite web|title=Texas Water Safari: History|url=http://www.texaswatersafari.org/history/|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl]

===General recreation===

A square-stern canoe is an asymmetrical canoe with a squared off stern for the mounting of an outboard motor. Meant for lake travel or fishing.

===Touring and camping===

In North America, a "touring canoe" is a good tracking boat, good for wind blown lakes etc. A "tripping canoe" is a touring canoe with larger capacity for wilderness travel and is often designed with more rocker for better maneuverability on whitewater rivers but requiring some skill on the part of the canoeist in open windy waters when lightly loaded. Touring canoes are often made of lighter materials and built for comfort and cargo space. Tripping canoes such as the Chestnut Prospector derivates, and the Old Town trippers, are typically made of heavier and tougher materials, and are usually a more traditional design. A Prospector canoe is a generic name for copies of the Chestnut model, a popular type of tripping canoe marked by a symmetrical hull and a relatively large amount of rocker, giving a nice balance for wilderness tripping. This model also has the ability to carry large amounts of gear while being maneuverable enough for rapids. This makes it a superb large capacity wilderness boat, but requires skill on windy, broad waters when lightly loaded. It is made in a variety of materials. For home construction, 4 mm plywood is commonly used, mainly marine ply, using the "stitch and glue" technique. Commercially built canoes are commonly built of fibreglass, HDPE, Kevlar, Carbon Fiber, and Royalex which is although relatively heavy, very durable.
A touring canoe is sometimes covered with a greatly extended deck, forming a "cockpit" for the paddlers. A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwale can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily, and the rim of the boat can be higher keeping the boat dryer.

===Freestyle===

A canoe specialized for whitewater play and tricks. Most are identical to short, flat-bottomed kayak playboats except for internal outfitting. The paddler kneels and uses a single-blade canoe paddle. Playboating is a discipline of whitewater canoeing where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot), as opposed to downriver where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river (although whitewater canoeists will often stop and play en-route). Specialised canoes known as playboats can be used.
