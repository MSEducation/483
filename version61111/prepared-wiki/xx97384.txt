==Biography==

Abbruzzese dropped out of North Mesquite High School at an early age and began to focus on playing more than ever.Wen, Howard. "Un-rock Star". Dallas Observer. October 24, 1996. [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wWepbk46|date =2011-02-15[/tpl] He started playing in the Texas music scene, performing in such bands as Segueway, Flaming Hemorrhoids, and Course of Empire, and along the way, he formed a band called Dr. Tongue, a three-piece, funk-influenced band that gigged in the Dallas and Denton area.

===Pearl Jam===

In 1991, Abbruzzese got a call from drummer and friend Matt Chamberlain, whom Abbruzzese knew through the Texas music scene, in regard to filling in for him in the band Pearl Jam when he left. Chamberlain had his eyes set on G. E. Smith's band on Saturday Night Live. Abbruzzese left for Seattle, Washington to meet and become acquainted with the members of Pearl Jam. Although his musical tastes were far diverse from the other members, Abbruzzese chose to join Pearl Jam, playing his first show on August 23, 1991. Initially, Abbruzzese was reluctant to join the band full-time. Then after his second show with Pearl Jam, Abbruzzese went straight down to his local tattoo parlor and had bassist Jeff Ament's stick figure drawing from the sleeve of the "Alive" single tattooed onto his left shoulder.Neely, Kim.

[tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wWerAUGG|date =2011-02-15[/tpl] Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the Ten album. Abbruzzese toured extensively for Ten and performed on MTV Unplugged and a Saturday Night Live appearance. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge.
With Abbruzzese, the band recorded its second studio album, Vs., released in 1993. Upon its release, Vs. set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308749,00.html | title=Pearl's Jam | accessdate=2007-08-31 | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=1993-11-19|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wWesFoHQ |archivedate = 2011-02-15|deadurl=no[/tpl] and spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard 200. Vs. was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From Vs., the song "Daughter" received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song "Go" received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DD113CF935A15751C0A963958260 |title=POP VIEW; Playing Grammy Roulette |publisher=The New York Times |author=Pareles, Jon |accessdate=2008-08-03 | date=February 26, 1995[/tpl] Abbruzzese toured extensively for Vs. and performed on a Saturday Night Live appearance. Abbruzzese wrote the music for the Pearl Jam songs "Go," "Last Exit" and "Angel" (from the 1993 fan club Christmas single). He played with Pearl Jam through April 17, 1994. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster.DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 978-0-306-81271-2, pg. 58 Although Abbruzzese performed on the band's third studio album, Vitalogy, he was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members, four months before the album was released.Weisbard, Eric, et al. "Ten Past Ten" Spin. August 2001. [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wWeuPDnJ|date =2011-02-15[/tpl] Ament stated, "Dave was a different egg for sure. There were a lot of things, personality wise, where I didn't see eye to eye with him. He was more comfortable being a rock star than the rest of us. Partying, girls, cars. I don't know if anyone was in the same space." Guitarist Stone Gossard said, "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." Abbruzzese stated, "I didn't really agree with what was going on. I didn't agree with the Ticketmaster stuff at all. But I don't blame anyone or harbor any hard feelings. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't furious and hurt for a long time. But now I just wish there was more music from the band I was a part of."

==Other musical projects==

On September 30, 1997, Abbruzzese's newly formed band, the Green Romance Orchestra, released Play Parts I & V. The album saw Abbruzzese bring his own songs to the drawing board, as well as play the role of a producer. Play Parts I & V is a release of Free Association Records, which was formed by Abbruzzese in 1996.
In 1997, Abbruzzese rehearsed with Axl Rose during the making of Guns N' Roses' 2008 album, Chinese Democracy."Chinese Democracy". gnrsource.com.

==Musical style and influences==

Abbruzzese has cited John Bonham, Sly & the Family Stone, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as influences. Abbruzzese's trademarks include heavy use of splash cymbals, the double-stroke roll, and a fast right foot. Abbruzzese refused to use two bass drums or a double-kick pedal, instead concentrating on playing the best he could with a single pedal. Abbruzzese is also known to be a particularly hard hitter, which may be reflected in him having suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome at one time.[tpl]cite web | last = Crowe | first = Cameron | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world | title = Five Against the World | work = Rolling Stone | date = 1993-10-28 | accessdate = 2007-06-23 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5nDbpZ1TD |archivedate = 2010-02-01|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Equipment==

On his earlier, pre-Vs. Pearl Jam recordings, such as the tracks recorded for the Singles soundtrack and the video version of "Even Flow", Abbruzzese is known to have used Ludwig drums. As of the Vs. record, he endorsed and used Drum Workshop drums, Sabian cymbals, and seemed to favor an 8x12 Brady snare drum. Abbruzzese also had his own line of signature drumsticks, manufactured and marketed by Pro-Mark, but the model bearing his name appears to have been discontinued."TX2BLN: Hickory 2BL Nylon Tip".
