Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme (22 April 1518 – 17 November 1562) was head of the House of Bourbon from 1537 to 1562, and jure uxoris King of Navarre from 1555 to 1562. He was the father of Henry IV of France.

==Family==

He was born at La Fère, Picardy, France, the second son of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme (1489–1537), and his wife, Françoise of Alençon (d. 1550).Trevor Dupuy, Curt Johnson and David L. Bongard, The Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography, (Castle Books: Edison, 1992), 98. He was the older brother of Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Condé.

==Marriage==

On 20 October 1548, at Moulins, he married Jeanne III, Queen regnant of Navarre, daughter of Henry II of Navarre and his wife Margaret of Angoulême.Dupuy, Trevor, 98. By his marriage, he became King of Navarre, Count of Foix, of Bigorre, of Armagnac, of Périgord, and Viscount of Béarn. It was reported that Jeanne was much in love with him,Robin, Larsen and Levin. p. 2. but his subsequent actions show that he had little loyalty to her. The Kingdom of Navarre had been occupied by the Spanish since 1512, and Antoine tried to re-establish it. He was ready to sacrifice anything to his political interests.

==Religion==

Antoine appears not to have had real religious conviction and officially changed religions several times.Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562–1629, (Cambridge University Press: New York, 2005), 52. His reconversion to Catholicism separated him from his wife and he threatened to repudiate her.Robin, Larsen and Levin. p. 3. He had an affair with Louise de La Béraudière de l'Isle Rouhet, "la belle Rouet," with whom he had a son, Charles III de Bourbon (1554–1610) who became archbishop of Rouen.David Bryson, Queen Jeanne and the Promised Land, (Koninklijke Brill NV:Leiden, 1999), 219.
Although his brother Louis was the head of the Protestant faction, Antoine spent most of his life fighting for the King of France. Catherine de' Medici, regent for her son Charles IX, named him lieutenant general of the kingdom in 1561.Duruy, Victor, John Franklin Jameson and Mabell Shippie Clarke Smith, A History of France, (Thomas Y. Crowell Co.:New York, 1920), 338. When his wife allowed the Huguenots to sack the chapel of Vendôme and the churches of the town in 1562, he threatened to send her to a convent.Bryson, David, 299. She took refuge in Béarn.
Antoine was vain and unstable. He often disappointed his followers and was manipulated by his superiors and out-witted by his adversaries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
He laid siege to Rouen and was mortally wounded on 13 November 1562. He died at Les Andelys, Eure.
