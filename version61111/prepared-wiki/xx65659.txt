==History==

===Post-war origins===

Calls for the establishment of a national university in Australia began as early as 1900.[tpl]cite web|url=http://heritage.anu.edu.au/?pid=7|title=History of ANU|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] After the location of the nation's capital, Canberra, was determined in 1908, land was set aside for the university at the foot Black Mountain in the city designs by Walter Burley Griffin. Planning for the university was disrupted by World War II but resumed with the creation of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction in 1942, ultimately leading to the passage of the Australian National University Act 1946 by the Parliament of Australia on 1 August 1946.
A group of eminent Australian scholars returned from overseas to join the university, including Sir Howard Florey (co-developer of medicinal penicillin),  Sir Mark Oliphant (a nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project), Sir Keith Hancock (the Chichele Professor of Economic History at Oxford) and Sir Raymond Firth (a professor of anthropology at LSE). Economist Sir Douglas Copland was appointed as ANU's first Vice-Chancellor and former Prime Minister Stanley Bruce served as the first Chancellor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.anu.edu.au/profile/history/chancellors-vcs|title=Chancellors & Vice-Chancellors|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] ANU was originally organised into four centres—the Research Schools of Physical Sciences, Social Sciences and Pacific Studies and the John Curtin School of Medical Research.
The first resident's hall, University House, was opened in 1954 for faculty members and postgraduate students. Mount Stromlo Observatory, established by the federal government in 1924, became part of ANU in 1957. The first locations of the ANU Library, the Menzies and Chifley buildings, opened in 1963. The Australian Forestry School, located in Canberra since 1927, was amalgamated by ANU in 1965.

===Canberra University College===

Canberra University College (CUC) was the first institution of higher education in the national capital, having been established in 1929 and enrolling its first undergraduate pupils in 1930.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ord/1929-20/19291219-49059/pdf/1929-20.pdf|title=Ordinance establishing Canberra University College|work=ACT Legislation Register|publisher=Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] Its founding was led by Sir Robert Garran, one of the drafters of the Australian Constitution and the first Solicitor-General of Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ch1018.pdf|title=Canberra University College|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] CUC was affiliated with the University of Melbourne and its degrees were granted by that university. Academic leaders at CUC included historian Manning Clark, political scientist Finlay Crisp, poet A. D. Hope and economist Heinz Arndt.
In 1960, CUC was integrated into ANU as the School of General Studies, initially with faculties in arts, economics, law and science. Faculties in Oriental studies and engineering were introduced later. Bruce Hall, the first residential college for undergraduates, opened in 1961.

===Modern era===

The Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art were amalgamated by ANU in 1992.
ANU established its Medical School in 2002, after obtaining federal government approval in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://medicalschool.anu.edu.au/about-us/history|title=History of ANU Medical School|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl]
On 18 January 2003, the Canberra bushfires largely destroyed the Mount Stromlo Observatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/mount-stromlo-observatory|title=Mount Stromlo Observatory|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] ANU astronomers now conduct research from the Siding Spring Observatory, which contains 10 telescopes including the Anglo-Australian Telescope.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/siding-spring-observatory/telescopes|title=Telescopes|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl]
In February 2013, financial entrepreneur and ANU graduate Graham Tuckwell made the largest university donation in Australian history by giving $50 million to fund an undergraduate scholarship program at ANU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/tertiary-education/billionaire-gives-back-with-50m-uni-donation-20130205-2dvfk.html|title=Billionaire gives back with $50m uni donation|publisher=The Canberra Times|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl]

==Awards and prizes==

===Phoenix Prize for spiritual art===

The Phoenix Prize for spiritual art is a biennial open art prize with a value of A$5,000, based at the Australian National University, awarded first in 2005. The exhibition is at the ANU School of Art Gallery.
The Phoenix Prize for spiritual art arose from the winding up of the Christian Media Association ACT Inc., an organization that provided video advertisements on local, commercial television channels that were played in the nature of public service announcement. In 2003, the committee of the Christian Media Association ACT Inc. decided to fund an ongoing cultural prize for artists, managed by the ANU. It is intended to be complementary to the Blake Prize for Religious Art.
