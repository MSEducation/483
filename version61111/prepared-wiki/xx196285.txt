Andrzej Czabański (born November 5, 1959 - died April 21, 1988) was a Polish murderer, who holds the distinction of being the last person executed in Poland.
At age of 29 he was convicted and sentenced to death for a brutal rape and murder of a woman in Tarnów. He also attempted to kill her two daughters.
After the Council of State refused to commute his death sentence, he was executed by hanging at 05.10 p.m. in Kraków Montelupich Prison.
Soon after his execution a moratorium was introduced. Although until 1996 10 people were sentenced to death in Poland (all for murder), no executions took place and capital punishment was finally abolished in 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/europe.html |title=The end of capital punishment in Europe. |publisher=capitalpunishmentuk.org |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-03-04[/tpl]
