Crotalus triseriatus is a venomous pit viper species found in Mexico. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.[tpl]ITIS |id=585832 |taxon=Crotalus triseriatus |accessdate=1 August 2007[/tpl]

==Description==

Adult male specimens commonly grow to lengths greater than [tpl]convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], with females somewhat smaller. The maximum recorded length is [tpl]convert|68.3|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Geographic range==

The species is found in Mexico, along the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau in the highlands of the Transverse Volcanic Cordillera, including the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacán, Morelos, México, Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz. The type locality given is "Mexico". A restriction to "Alvarez, San Luis Potosí, Mexico" was proposed by H.M. Smith and Taylor (1950).

==Habitat==

Crotalus triseriatus occurs in pine-oak forest, boreal forest, coniferous forest and, bunchgrass grasslands. On Volcán Orizaba, it is found at very high altitudes. There, the snow line comes down to about [tpl]convert|4,572|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], while green plants can be found up to [tpl]convert|4,573|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]: the species has been found within this zone. However, they are most common at [tpl]convert|2700|to|3350|m|ft[/tpl] in elevation.

==Conservation status==

This species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2001).[tpl]Redlist species|no=64338|genus=Crotalus|species=triseriatus|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl] Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007.[tpl]Redlist CC2001|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl]

==Feeding==

Prey reportedly found in the stomachs of this snake include a frog, a murid rodent (Neotomodon alstoni), lizards, other small mammals, crickets, and salamanders.
