==History==

Backety-Back Scenic Railway was built in 1909 by Pennsylvanian John H. Brown and construction of the coaster cost $50,000.[tpl]cite book |last=Hirsch |first=Rose Ann |authorlink= |title=Western New York Amusement Parks |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xtrLDCJYVsAC |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location= |isbn=0738574562 |page=[/tpl] Backety-Back Scenic Railway was the only roller coaster Brown would ever build.[tpl]cite RCDB|coaster_name=List of John H.

==Track layout and ride experience==

Being a shuttle roller coaster, Backety-Back Scenic Railway traveled over its course both forwards and backwards. The coaster had two lift hills and also necessitated the operation of a switchman when the coaster had reached the end of its forward progress. Following this reversal, the train would engage a second reversal and continue on its way. The course of the roller coaster was a twister layout[tpl]cite book |last=Rossi |first=Erno |authorlink= |title=Crystal Beach: The Good Old Days |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DGCOnKjHvicC |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Seventy Seven Publishing |location= |isbn=0920926045 |page=[/tpl] and the roller coaster had a curved tunnel in its course as well. Trains had 2 cars of 5 rows apiece, with each row having two riders.
The coaster had a large station which resembled a riverboat in shape. Inside this station was a ticket office (tickets were sold for 10 cents) and the queue for the ride itself.

==Incidents==

In 1910, a 17-year-old girl, Louise Koch was killed after falling from the Backety-Back Scenic Railway. The coaster had minimal safety features, and the only restraints were the sides of the cars themselves.
