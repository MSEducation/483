Retford Oaks Academy is a secondary school with academy status in the market town of Retford, Nottinghamshire, England, situated in the (mainly former) coal-mining district of Bassetlaw.

==Admissions==

The school admission policy follows that of the LEA and there are a number of available places in all years at the school. Anyone wishing to join the school should contact the school office for an appointment.

==Facilities==

The school has modern facilities and moved into new buildings in March 2007.

==Academic performance==

The school has improved from a poor starting point since opening in 2003. The number of students achieving 5 or more A* to C grades at GCSE has risen from 20% in 2006 to 49% in 2011. The opening of the separate sixth form centre with The Elizabethan Academy, effectively operating as a sixth form college, has produced A level results above the England average.
Neighbouring Lincolnshire (Gainsborough – fourteen minutes on the train) still has the grammar school system, and attracts a few applicants from east Nottinghamshire, potentially distorting Retford's schools' results.

==Ofsted==

Retford Oaks has maintained a grading of "satisfactory" in its recent inspections although with several areas classed as good.Ofsted Reports for Retford Oaks. Ofsted.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.

==History==

The school was established in 2003 with the amalgamation of two of the schools in Retford. His HRH Duke of Kent formally opened the school in October 2008. In September 2009 the school was designated as a specialist sports college with its second subject being Mathematics. In September 2011 the school officially became academy as part of the Diverse Academies Learning Partnership - a collaboration of three academies, Tuxford Academy, National C of E academy and Retford Oaks.
The collaboration with the other schools is enabling Retford Oaks to move rapidly towards its target of "outstanding" by 2014.

===Older schools: King Edward VI Grammar School (with list of headmasters) and the Girls' High School===

The King Edward VI School was on London Road. It was previously known as the King Edward VI Grammar School and the oldest part of the school buildings (opened in August 1857) was designed by Decimus Burton. The Grammar School magazine was called The Retfordian. The school motto was Ex Pulvere Palma. In later years the school’s senior houses were Edward, Foljambe, Gough, and Overend.  The junior houses were Bescoby, Darrell, Laycock, and Mason (all named after school benefactors).
The school usually traced its original foundation back to Thomas Gunthorpe of Babworth in 1519 although there are references to a still earlier school in the town. It was refounded around 1551 during the reign of King Edward VI.  It subsequently had a chequered history, twice coming close to collapse during the 19th century. The school accepted boarders from at least the 17th century onwards, but the last boarders left in 1938. During  the Second World War a number of boys from the Great Yarmouth Grammar School were evacuated to Retford (from 1940–44).

So it seems probable that he actually arrived earlier than the suggested 1669 date

===Previous schools up to 2003===

Before 1979, the former Sir Frederick Milner Secondary School (an all male secondary modern school) was on Pennington Walk,Pennington Walk. Nottinghamshire.gov.uk (2011-01-05). Retrieved on 2011-09-30. with around 500 boys, in the east of the town. This became part of the King Edward VI School, a voluntary controlled school, and was used as the sixth form site prior to the new Post-16 centre being opened in 2007. The former site will become residential properties. Sir Frederick Milner was the Conservative MP from 1890–1906 for Bassetlaw.
The former Retford Oaks School was on a site towards Ordsall near the former leisure centre, which was the former Ordsall Hall School on Ordsall Road (now the Post-16 Centre). This merged with the King Edward VI School in 2003 forming the current school.

===Regeneration===

Similar to five other schools in Bassetlaw (two in Worksop and one in Tuxford, Bircotes and The Elizabethan High School in Retford), the school underwent an extensive rebuilding programme under PFI funding. It was not possible to develop the King Edward VI School site as a Post-16 Centre (even though the county council wanted to), because the county council did not own the property so an entirely new site was built on Babworth Road. This site is for ages 11–16. On the former Ordsall Hall site, a new leisure centre was built (nextdoor) in January 2008 and a separate Post-16 (sixth form) Centre was built in September 2007, when the 11–16 site opened as well. Worksop has also had a new sixth form (and leisure centre) built under the same PFI contract.
