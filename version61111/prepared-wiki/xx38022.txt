[[Loose Nut]]

CATEGORIES: Black Flag (band) albums, 1985 albums, SST Records albums

Loose Nut is the fifth full-length album released in 1985 by Black Flag on SST Records. The album is noteworthy in the Black Flag catalogue for introducing a more commercial sound to their already gestating jazz heavy metal hybrid. In some ways, it is a fusion of the jazz punk style of Slip It In and the jazz metal of In My Head.[tpl]Fact|date=December 2013[/tpl]
