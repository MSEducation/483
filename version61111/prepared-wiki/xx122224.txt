Farrington began his career with Everton, for whom he played in the 1983 FA Youth Cup final. He failed to secure a professional contract with the Toffees and was signed by the club that had defeated Everton in that FA Youth Cup final â€“ Norwich City.
After 18 appearances (and two goals) for the Canaries, he transferred to Cardiff in 1985 but was sacked for breach of club discipline and went abroad, playing in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium before returning to England with Brighton & Hove Albion. He played out his career in non-league before retiring.
