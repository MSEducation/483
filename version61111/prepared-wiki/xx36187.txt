The Ray and Maria Stata Center [tpl]IPAc-en|s|t|eɪ|t|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|STAY|ta[/tpl] or Building 32 is a [tpl]convert|720000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] academic complex designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Frank Gehry for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The building opened for initial occupancy on March 16, 2004. It sits on the site of MIT's former Building 20, which housed the historic Radiation Laboratory, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Major funding for the project was provided by Ray Stata (MIT class of 1957) and Maria Stata. Other major funders include Bill Gates, Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. (MIT class of 1954), Charles Thomas "E.B" Pritchard Hintze (an MIT graduate, and of JD Edwards, now Oracle Corporation) and Morris Chang of TSMC. Above the fourth floor, the building splits into two distinct structures: the Gates tower and the Dreyfoos tower.
Contained within the building are the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, as well as the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. Academic celebrities such as Noam Chomsky and Ron Rivest have offices there. World Wide Web Consortium founder Tim Berners-Lee and free software movement founder Richard Stallman also have offices within.
Several MIT classes, including many taught by the computer science and electrical engineering department (Course VI), are held inside. The Forbes Family Café is also located in the Stata Center, serving coffee and lunch to the public.
In contrast to the trend at MIT of referring to buildings by their numbers rather than their official names, the complex is usually referred to as "Stata", or "the Stata Center". The two towers are often called "G Tower" and "D tower".

==Building 20==

The Stata Center necessitated the removal of the much-beloved Building 20 in 1998. Building 20 was erected hastily during World War II as a temporary building that housed the historic Radiation Laboratory. Over the course of fifty-five years, its "temporary" nature allowed research groups to have more space, and to make more creative use of that space, than was possible in more respectable buildings (including providing permanent rooms for official Institute clubs and groups, most notably the Tech Model Railroad Club). Professor Jerome Y. Lettvin once quipped, "You might regard it as the womb of the Institute. It is kind of messy, but by God it is procreative!"[tpl]cite journal |last=Garfinkel |first=Simpson |title=Building 20: the Procreative Eyesore|journal=Technology Review|volume=94|issue=November/December 1991|pages=MIT11|nopp=true[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|title=Quotes and Stories about Building 20|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/building20/quotes.html#lettvin|publisher=MIT Libraries, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=1998-03-02|accessdate=2007-09-23[/tpl]

==Critical response==

Boston Globe architecture columnist Robert Campbell wrote a glowing appraisal of the building on April 25, 2004. According to Campbell, "the Stata is always going to look unfinished. It also looks as if it's about to collapse. Columns tilt at scary angles. Walls teeter, swerve, and collide in random curves and angles. Materials change wherever you look: brick, mirror-surface steel, brushed aluminum, brightly colored paint, corrugated metal. Everything looks improvised, as if thrown up at the last moment. That's the point. The Stata's appearance is a metaphor for the freedom, daring, and creativity of the research that's supposed to occur inside it." Campbell stated that the cost overruns and delays in completion of the Stata Center are of no more importance than similar problems associated with the building of St. Paul's Cathedral.[tpl]cite news |author=Robert Campbell |title=Dizzying heights - In Frank Gehry's remarkable new Stata Center at MIT, crazy angles have a serious purpose|work=The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2004/04/25/dizzying_heights/ |date=April 25, 2004[/tpl] The 2005 Kaplan/Newsweek guide  How to Get into College, which lists twenty-five universities its editors consider notable in some respect, recognizes MIT as having the "hottest architecture", placing most of its emphasis on the Stata Center.[tpl]cite news |author=Kantrowitz, Barbara |title=America's 25 Hot Schools|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/|work=Newsweek via MSNBC.com|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|date=August 2004|accessdate=2007-09-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070903110639/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/  |archivedate = 2007-09-03[/tpl]
Though there are many who praise this building, and in fact from the perspective of Gehry's other work it is considered by some as one of his best, there are certainly many who are less enamored of the structure. Mathematician and architectural theorist Nikos Salingaros has harshly criticized the Stata Center:
[tpl]quote|An architecture that reverses structural algorithms so as to create disorder—the same algorithms that in an infinitely more detailed application generate living form—ceases to be architecture. Deconstructivist buildings are the most visible symbols of actual deconstruction. The randomness they embody is the antithesis of nature's organized complexity. This is despite effusive praise in the press for "exciting" new academic buildings, such as the Peter B. Lewis Management Building at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the Vontz Center for Molecular Studies at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, and the Stata Center for Computer, Information, and Intelligence Sciences at MIT, all by Frank Gehry. Housing a scientific department at a university inside the symbol of its nemesis must be the ultimate irony.[tpl]cite book|title=Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction|last=Salingaros|first=Nikos|year=2007|publisher=Umbau-Verlag|isbn=3-937954-09-0[/tpl][/tpl]
Former Boston University president John Silber said the building "really is a disaster".[tpl]cite book |title=Architecture of the Absurd: How "Genius" Disfigured a Practical Art |last=Silber |first=John |year=2007 |publisher=Quantuck Lane |isbn=978-1-59372-027-8[/tpl] Architecture critic Robert Campbell praised Gehry for "breaking up the monotony of a street of concrete buildings" and being "a building like no other building".  The style of the building has been likened to the German Expressionism of the 1920s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2521.htm |title=No. 2521: Radical Buildings |work=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2012-03-24[/tpl]

==Lawsuit==

On October 31, 2007, MIT sued architect Frank Gehry and the construction companies, Skanska USA Building Inc. and NER Construction Management, for "providing deficient design services and drawings" which caused leaks to spring, masonry to crack, mold to grow, drainage to back up, and falling ice and debris to block emergency exits.[tpl]cite news|author=Murphy, Shelley|title=MIT sues Gehry, citing leaks in $300m complex; Blames famed architect for flaws at Stata Center|work=The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/11/06/mit_sues_gehry_citing_leaks_in_300m_complex/|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-06[/tpl] A Skanska spokesperson said that, prior to construction, Gehry ignored warnings from Skanska and a consulting company regarding flaws in his design of the amphitheater, and rejected a formal request from Skanska to modify the design.
In an interview, Mr. Gehry, whose firm was paid $15 million for the project, said construction problems were inevitable in the design of complex buildings.  "These things are complicated," he said, "and they involved a lot of people, and you never quite know where they went wrong. A building goes together with seven billion pieces of connective tissue. The chances of it getting done ever without something colliding or some misstep are small." "I think the issues are fairly minor," he added. "M.I.T. is after our insurance."  Mr. Gehry said value engineering—the process by which elements of a project are eliminated to cut costs—was largely responsible for the problems. "There are things that were left out of the design," he said. "The client chose not to put certain devices on the roofs, to save money."[tpl]cite news|author=Robin Pogrebin and Katie Zezima|title=M.I.T.
