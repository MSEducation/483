==History==

Prior to the establishment of Israel, the Negev Bedouins were a semi-nomadic society that had been through a process of sedentariness since the Ottoman rule of the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localeconomyseminar.net/?p=88|author=Dor Fridman|title=About the Negev Bedouins|publisher=LocalEconomySeminar[/tpl] During the British Mandate period, no legal framework was established to justify and preserve land ownership. Thus Israel’s land policy was adopted to a large extent from the Ottoman land regulations of 1858 as the only legal precedent.  
Israel has continued the Ottoman policy of sedentarization of Negev Bedouins. In the 1950s Israel re-settled two-thirds of the Negev Bedouin in an area that was under a martial law. Several townships were built for them, offering better living conditions, infrastructure, sanitation, health and education, and municipal services. 
As of today, according to the information of Israel Land Administration, over 60% of the Negev Bedouin live in seven settlements in the Negev desert with approved plans and developed infrastructure: Hura, Lakiya, Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev), Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom), Tel as-Sabi (Tel-Sheva), Kuseife and the city of Rahat, the largest among them).State of Israel.

The village was established following Government Resolution 881 on 29 September 2003, which created eight new Bedouin settlements (seven of which were to be located in the now defunct Abu Basma Regional Council).Government resolutions passed in recent years regarding the Arab population of Israel The Abraham Fund Initiative
At first the Bedouin were reluctant to relocate there, only a part of the tribe settled in it. But at the end of 2011 as a result of fruitful negotiations, the rest of the Tarabin tribe living in an unrecognized village nearby moved into the newly built locality with empty land plots waiting for them.
