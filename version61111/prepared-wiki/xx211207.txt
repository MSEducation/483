Nashlyn was once a small hamlet in Reno Rural Municipality No. 51, Saskatchewan, Canada. The former townsite is located 15 km west of Highway 18, about 10 km south of the village of Consul and the Highway 13.

==Population==

Robsart, like so many other communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a semi ghost town, with few if any residents.

==Education==

Nashlyn no longer has a school, but those who live in Nashlyn and area are sent to the neighboring village of Consul which has a school that covers Kindergarten to Grade 12 serving approximately 100 students.
