[[File:Active separatist movements in the European Union.png|right|thumb|Map of active separatist movements in the European Union. Red names indicate regions with movements that only claim greater autonomy within the actual state. Black names indicate regions with important secessionist movements, although both categories include moderate movements. The nations highlighted in colours are the territories claimed by the local nationalist groups, including areas out of the state's borders and cases of annexation to other states (click to enlarge).

Ethnic separatism is based more on cultural and linguistic differences than religious or racial differences, which also may exist.  Notable ethnic separatist movements include:

===Racial===

Some groups seek to separate from others along racialist lines.  They oppose inter-marriage with other races and seek separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions or even separate societies, territories and governments.thumb|Territories considered for "Aztl√°n"

===Geographic/socioeconomic===

===Gender and sexuality===

Separatist feminism is women's choosing to separate from ostensibly male-defined, male-dominated institutions, relationships, roles and activities.Marilyn Frye, "Some Reflections on Separatism and Power" in Feminist Social Thought: A Reader, Diana Tietjens Meyers (ed.) Routledge, 1997, 406-414. Lesbian separatism advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.  Some separatist feminists and lesbian separatists have chosen to live apart in intentional community, cooperatives, and on land trusts.Joyce Cheney, Lesbian Land, Word Weavers Press, 1976. "Gay" separatism including both lesbians and gay men holds they should form a community distinct and separate from other groups.Mark K. Bloodsworth-Lugo, In-Between Bodies: Sexual Difference, Race, and Sexuality, SUNY Press, 2007, ISBN 0-7914-7221-3Richard D.
