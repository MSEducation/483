The Electrologica X8 (or EL X8) was a digital computer designed as a successor to the Electrologica X1 and manufactured in the Netherlands by Electrologica NV from 1965 onwards.[tpl]Fact|date=August 2007[/tpl]
Like its predecessor, the X1, the X8 system included core memory, 27-bit word length with 15-bit addressing, and drum memory as secondary storage (not as primary storage).  The X8 included an independent peripheral processor called CHARON (Centraal Hulporgaan Autonome Regeling Overdracht Nevenapparatuur, or Central Coprocessor Autonomous Regulation Transfer Peripherals) which handled I/O.  Other features included up to 48 input/output channels designed for low speed devices such as paper tape, plotters and printers. Unlike the X1, the arithmetic unit of the X8 included floating point arithmetic, with a 40-bit mantissa and 11-bit exponent.
The system is most notable as the target processor for Edsger Dijkstra's implementation of the THE multiprogramming system.
