[[Prion (bird)]]

CATEGORIES: Pachyptila, Bird genera

The Prions (or whalebirds) are small petrels in the genera Pachyptila and Halobaena. They form one of the four groups within the Procellariidae (also referred to as the prions), along with the gadfly petrels, shearwaters and fulmarine petrels.
They are found in the Southern Ocean and breed on a number of subantarctic islands. Prions grow [tpl]convert|20|to(-)|27|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and have blue-grey upper parts and white underparts. Three species of prion have flattened bills with a fringe of lamellae that act as strainers for zooplankton.Maynard, B. J. (2003) All prions are marine and feed on small crustacea such as copepods, ostracods, decapods, and krill, as well as some fish such as myctophids and nototheniids.

In addition, fossil remains of some hitherto undescribed prehistoric species have been found. The oldest comes from the Late Miocene (Tortonian, some 7 to 12 million years ago) of the Bah√≠a Inglesa Formation in Chile.
