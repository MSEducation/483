Married... with Children is an American sitcom that aired for 11 seasons. It featured a dysfunctional family living in a fictional Chicago suburb. The show, notable for being the first prime-time television series to air on Fox, ran from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997. It was created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt. The show was known for handling nonstandard topics for the time period, which garnered the then-fledgling Fox network a standing among the Big Three television networks.
The series' 11-season, 259-episode run makes it the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on the Fox network. Its famous theme song is "Love and Marriage"  by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production Our Town.
The first season of the series was videotaped at ABC Television Center in Hollywood. From season 2 to season 8, the show was taped at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, and the remaining three seasons were taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The series was produced by Embassy Communications on its first season and the remaining seasons by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television (and eventually Columbia TriStar Television).
In 2008, the show placed #94 on Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'s[/tpl] "New TV Classics" list.[tpl]cite web|title=The New Classics: TV|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 21, 2012|date=June 18, 2007[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

The show follows the lives of Al Bundy, a once glorious high school football player turned hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his obnoxious wife, Peggy; their attractive, promiscuous, and dim daughter, Kelly; and their girl-crazy, wisecracking son, Bud (who will become the only Bundy to attend college). Their neighbors are the upwardly-mobile Steve Rhoades and his wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her "trophy husband" and Al's sidekick. Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck. His rivalry with and loathing for Marcy play a significant role in most episodes.

==Episodes==

During its eleven-season run on the Fox network, Married ... with Children aired 258 episodes. A 259th episode, "I'll See You in Court" from season 3, never aired on Fox (see below) but premiered on FX and has since been included on DVD and in syndication packages.  The episode counts in the chart below include it. There were also three specials that aired following the series' cancellation, including a cast reunion.

==Nielsen ratings==

Despite the show's enduring popularity and loyal fanbase, Married ... with Children was never a huge ratings success. Part of the reason was the simple fact that Fox, being a new startup network, did not have the affiliate base of the Big Three television networks, thus preventing the series from reaching the entire country. In an interview for a special commemorating the series' 20-year anniversary in 2007, Katey Sagal stated that part of the problem the series faced was that many areas of the country were able to get Fox only through low-quality UHF channels well into the early 1990s while some areas of the country did not receive the new network at all.
Another problem lay in the fact that many of the newly developed series on Fox were unsuccessful, which kept the network from building a popular lineup to draw in a larger audience. In its original airing debut, Married ... with Children was part of a Sunday lineup that competed with the popular Murder, She Wrote and Sunday-night movie on CBS. Fellow freshman series included The Garry Shandling Show, Duet, and The Tracey Ullman Show, which were canceled in 1988, 1989, and 1990 respectively. The success of The Simpsons, which debuted on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, helped draw some viewers over to Fox, allowing Married ... with Children to sneak into the top 50 of television shows for seasons 4 through 8 doing its best overall rating at number 29 for its sixth season. Although these ratings were small in comparison with the other three networks, they were good enough for Fox to keep renewing the show.

===Rakolta boycott===

In 1989, Terry Rakolta, a housewife from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led a boycott[tpl]cite web|last=Poniewozik |first=James |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652601,00.html |title=Married ...

After advertisers began dropping their support for the show and while Rakolta made several appearances on television talk shows demanding the show's cancellation, Fox executives refused to air the episode titled "I'll See You in Court".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bundyology.com/hpg/308.html |title=Bundyology—Episode "I'll See You in Court" |publisher=Bundyology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14[/tpl] This episode would become known as the "Lost Episode" and was aired on FX on June 18, 2002, with some parts cut. The episode was packaged with the rest of the third season in the January 2005 DVD release (and in the first volume of the Married ... With Children Most Outrageous Episode DVD set) with the parts cut from syndication restored.
Rakolta has been referenced twice on the show: "Rock and Roll Girl",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bundyology.com/hpg/414.html |title=Bundyology—Episode "Rock and Roll Girl" |publisher=Bundyology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14[/tpl] when a newscaster mentioned the city Bloomfield Hills, and "No Pot to Pease In",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bundyology.com/hpg/909.html |title=Bundyology—Episode "No Pot to Pease in" |publisher=Bundyology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14[/tpl] when a television show was made about the Bundy family and then was cancelled because (according to Marcy) "some woman in Michigan didn't like it".

The DVD box sets from season 3 onward do not feature the original "Love and Marriage" theme song in the opening sequence.
