==Management career==

===Ilkeston Town===

Hurst and former Rotherham team mate Rob Scott were appointed joint managers of Northern Premier League outfit Ilkeston Town in January 2009. The pair led Ilkeston from ninth in the league to second, and ultimately promotion to Conference North via the play-offs. Afterwards, uncertainty surrounded whether or not they would remain at the helm of the Derbyshire club due to the club's worrying financial position, and eventually they moved to York Street to sign as joint managers of Boston United.

===Boston United===

In their first season at United they gained a second successive promotion to the Conference North with a win in the play-off final,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/8656395.stm | title=Boston United clinch promotion with play-off final win | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 May 2010 | accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl] this was to complete a treble of trophies as they had already collected the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup and Lincolnshire Senior Cup.

On 22 March 2011, both Hurst and Scott resigned from Boston[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/Duo-resign-Boston-United-roles/story-11539555-detail/story.html|newspaper=Grimsby Telegraph|title=Duo resign from Boston United roles | date=22 March 2011|accessdate=5 August 2012[/tpl] and the following morning they were both announced as the new management team of Grimsby Town, replacing the sacked Neil Woods.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/12817450|title=Grimsby Town appoint Rob Scott and Paul Hurst|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=5 August 2012[/tpl]
Grimsby who had suffered relegation from the Football League[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/08/grimsby-town-relegated-league-two | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Lutz | title=League Two: Grimsby Town relegated after Burton defeat | date=8 May 2010[/tpl] in the previous season had hoped for an instant return but following a mid-season slump that led to the sacking of the previous manager, Hurst and Scott could only manage to salvage an 11th place spot come the end of the 2010–11 campaign. During the summer months the duo bolstered Grimsby's ranks in order for a promotion push but were hit by a blow as previous seasons top scorer and player of the year Alan Connell left to join Swindon Town.http://thewashbag.com/2011/07/16/alan-connell-set-to-join-paolos-revolution-at-swindon/ The eventual signing of Liam Hearnhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13809749 was a more than suitable replacement as he scored 32 times during the 2011–12 season, a year which saw The Mariners slide away out of the contention of a play-off spot in the final few months of the season. Grimsby, like the year previously finished 11th in the Conference National.
The 2012–13 season started slowly, but by Christmas Grimsby were top of the league and leading a closely contested pack of Newport County, Wrexham and Forest Green Rovers. On 6 January 2013 speculation about the pairs future at Blundell Park came into light when rumours circulated a potential move to Football League One side Doncaster Rovers surfaced. Rovers who had lost manager Dean Saunders earlier that day to Wolverhampton Wanderers were rumoured to have placed Scott and Hurst on their managerial shortlist. The rumour was quashed the following day with Hurst saying that the pair were focused on earning promotion with Grimsby.http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/Grimsby-Town-joint-bosses-deny-truth-Doncaster/story-17782745-detail/story.html Grimsby went on to reach the final of the FA Trophy but were defeated on a penalty shootout after drawing 1-1 with Wrexham at Wembley Stadium. The Mariners also despite leading the Conference for part of the season had dropped off towards the end of the year and had to settle for 4th place, eventually losing to Newport County in the play-off semi finals.
On 6 September 2013 Scott was suspended amongst circumstances not released by the club, leaving Hurst in sole charge.http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/Paul-Hurst-takes-sole-charge-team-matters-Grimsby/story-19763047-detail/story.html#axzz2e6wRedSx On 19 September 2013 Grimsby confirmed Scott had been sacked for gross misconduct and that Hurst would remain in sole permanent charge.http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/news/article/gtfc-statement-1064367.aspx On 07 January 2014 Hurst signed an improved deal reflecting the fact that he was now sole manager.http://thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8502547
