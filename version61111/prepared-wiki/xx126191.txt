==Name==

There are many names for the Lyuli: Jughi, Multani or Luli. However, they refer to themselves as Mugat or Mughat ([tpl]lang-fa|مغان, derives from Old Persian magi[/tpl]), which means "fire-worshipper", as well as Ghurbat (Arabic: غربات), which means "lonely". The term Multani signifies a person who originates from the city of Multan (in modern-day Pakistan), because some of the Lyuli emigrated from Multan around 1380 AD. According to Professor Khol Nazarov, the ancestors of the Lyuli belonged to a caste of singers, musicians and dancers. Faced with hardship in their homeland, they were forced to leave, and dispersed worldwide.

==Lyuli in Kyrgyzstan==

The Lyuli live in the south of Kyrgyzstan, in Osh Province. Their living standard is extremely low due to discrimination. Many children are devoid of education in their mother tongue and many Lyuli have no documents. Lyuli society is working towards improvement of their living standards and preservation of their culture.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Интернет-Журнал "Оазис" Народ без прав

==Lyuli in Russia==

In the beginning of the 1990s, Lyuli started migrating into Russian cities, placing especially near railway stations and markets. At first, Russians mistakenly identified them as Tajik refugees, ethnically Tajiks and Uzbeks, due to their dress in traditional Oriental robes. Russian Roma emphasize that the Lyuli are a population distinct from them. However, Russians consider the Lyuli to be Romanies, because of the resemblance with the Roma. They are a frequent target of Russian far right skinheads.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10008515 |title=Russia's far-right on rise |author=Osborne, Andrew |date=29 January 2005 |agency=The Independent |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl]Russia 2004 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=BlevintronBot[/tpl]
