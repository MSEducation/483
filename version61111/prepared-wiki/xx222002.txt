Barbara Ingram School for the Arts is a magnet high school that opened its doors for gifted art students in August 2009. Currently there are seven different majors: Theatre, Musical Theatre, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, Dance, Literary Arts, and Visual Arts. The Literary Arts program was added at the start of the 2011-2012 school year. The school building is located adjacent to the Maryland Theatre in the arts and entertainment district of downtown Hagerstown, Washington County, Maryland, United States. Despite being a public school, applications and auditions are part of a process needed in order to be accepted and then enrolled. Barbara Ingram School is also unique in that it will accept students not only from all of Washington County but also from proximate Maryland counties and areas in nearby Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Rob Hovermale is the current Principal. There are no sports teams originating from the school.
