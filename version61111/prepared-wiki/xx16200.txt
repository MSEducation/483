The 2002 Winter Olympics, officially the XIX Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XIXes Jeux olympiques d'hiver), were a winter multi-sport event that was celebrated in February 2002 in and around Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Approximately 2,400 athletes from 78 nations participated in 78 events in fifteen disciplines, held throughout 165 sporting sessions. The 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2002 Paralympic Games were both organized by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC).[tpl]cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=35 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Utah became the fifth state in the United States to host the Olympic Games, and the 2002 Winter Olympics are the most recent games to be held in the United States.
The opening ceremony was held on February 8, 2002, and sporting competitions were held up until the closing ceremony on February 24, 2002. Music for both ceremonies was directed by Mark Watters.[tpl]cite web|title=Air Edel | Composers | MARK WATTERS|url=http://www.air-edel.co.uk/representation/composers/18/mark-watters/|accessdate=May 14, 2011[/tpl] Salt Lake City became the most populous area ever to have hosted the Winter Olympics, although the two subsequent host cities' populations were larger.Salt Lake population figures[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] by the United States Census Following a trend, the 2002 Olympic Winter Games were also larger than all prior Winter Games, with 10 more events than the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan;[tpl]cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=36 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] this became a trend with more and more events held in subsequent Games.
The Salt Lake Games faced a bribery scandal and some local opposition during the bid, as well as some sporting and refereeing controversies during the competitions. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, this was one of the most successful Winter Olympiads in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours.[tpl]cite book |title=Marketing Matters |last=International Olympic Committee |year=2002 |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_456.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010[/tpl] The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues. U.S. Federal subsidies amounted to $1.3 billion.2002 Olympics to Cost US Taxpayers $1.3 Billion (accessed October 22, 2012)

==Host city selection==

Salt Lake City was chosen over Quebec City, Canada, Sion, Switzerland, and Östersund, Sweden, on June 16, 1995, at the 104th IOC Session in Budapest, Hungary.IOC Vote History Salt Lake City had previously come in second during the bids for the 1998 Winter Olympics, awarded to Nagano, Japan, and had offered to be the provisional host of the 1976 Winter Olympics when the original host, Denver, Colorado, withdrew. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately awarded to Innsbruck, Austria.

==Highlights==

==Opening ceremony==

Prior to the ceremony, the turf inside the stadium was removed and a giant, abstract shaped ice rink was installed, covering a large part of the stadium floor. Performers would later perform on ice skates, rather than shoes.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
An American flag rescued from the World Trade Center Site on September 11 was carried into the stadium by an honor guard of American athletes and was carried in by firefighters and police officers. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, clad in white sweaters, performed The Star Spangled Banner, the US national anthem, as the flag was raised. The parade of the 2,300 athletes was led by the Child of Light and began traditionally with Greece and ending with the host nation, the United States of America. As the artistic section kicked off, the five native Utah Native American tribes arrived together on horseback and performed several traditional "Welcome" stomp dances. The Dixie Chicks also performed.
The beauty of the Utah landscape was showcased as huge puppets of native Utah animals, including a 15-foot-long bison and the American Bald Eagle (the national bird and animal of the U.S.), entered the stadium, as well as  dancing pioneer settlers as two trains came together on, symbolizing the US railroad industry which was beneficial to Utah's economy beginning in the 1860s, as well as economically linking the Western U.S. and the Eastern U.S. At the end of their performance, the performers unfurled a giant quilt that covered the entire stadium floor with the 2002 Winter Olympics logo in the center.  Two figure skaters, Olympians Kristi Yamaguchi and Scott Hamilton performed on the over-sized ice rink as "Light the Fire Within," the 2002 Winter Olympic's theme song was sung by LeAnn Rimes.[tpl]cite web |url= http://saltlake2002legacy.com/ceremonies/  |title=CEREMONIES Salt Lake 2002 |author=N/A |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |archiveurl = http://saltlake2002legacy.com/ceremonies/ |archivedate = December 26, 2012[/tpl]
After speeches by Jacques Rogge, President over the IOC and Mitt Romney, the CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, the Olympic flame, which had traveled [tpl]convert|13500|mi|km[/tpl] was carried into the stadium by gold medalists Dorothy Hamill and Dick Button. They passed the flame to other pairs U.S. Olympic heroes, who either ran or skated their short relay. Gold medalists in Nagano 1998 Picabo Street and Cammi Granato carried the flame up the steps to the towering cauldron where they were met by Mike Eruzione, captain of the miracle on ice hockey team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1980. Eruzione summoned the other members of the team, who together lit the Olympic cauldron.Salt Lake City Flame Lighting. YouTube (February 19, 2011). Retrieved on August 16, 2013.  The Opening Ceremony would win seven Emmy Awards.
While there was a lot of international sympathy for the US in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, there were complaints that the Games were being conducted in an overtly patriotic manner. President Bush received some criticism for departing from the Olympic charter by extending the declaration to open the Games, saying “On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation” before the traditional formula, “I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City”.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/feb/15/usa.olympicgames/print|title=Chariots of ire: is US jingoism tarnishing the Olympic ideal?|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=February 15, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2008  | first=Duncan | last=MacKay[/tpl] In addition, the President opened the Games standing among the US athletes, while previous heads of state opened the Games from an official box. NBC's Bob Costas applauded the move during the network's coverage of the Opening Ceremony.
The official box was occupied by the President's Olympic delegation:

==2002 Olympic Symbols==

===Olympic Emblem===

The 2002 Olympic emblem is a snowflake, which consisted of three separate sections. The yellow top section symbolizes the Olympic Flame, and represents the athletes' courage. The orange center section symbolizes the ancient weaving styles of Utah's Native Americans, and represents the region's culture. The blue/purple bottom section symbolizes a snow-capped mountain, and represents the contrast of Utah's mountain and desert areas. The orange/yellow colors above the blue/purple bottom section also gave the appearance of a sun rising from behind a mountain.

===Theme colors===

An official palette of colors, which ranged from cool blues to warm reds and oranges, was created for the Salt Lake 2002 games. The palette became part of the official design theme named Land of Contrast – Fire and Ice, with the blues representing the cooler, snowy, mountainous regions of Northern Utah, and the oranges and red representing the warmer, rugged, red-rock areas of Southern Utah.[tpl]cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=206 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Pictograms===

As with all Olympic games, pictograms, which easily identified the venues, sports, and services for spectators without using a written language, were specifically designed for the Salt Lake 2002 games. The pictograms for these games mimicked the designs of branding-irons found in the western United States, and used the Fire and Ice theme colors of the Salt Lake 2002 Games. The line thickness and 30-degree angles found in the pictograms mirror those found in the snowflake emblem.

===The mascots===

The mascots represent three of the indigenous animals of the Western United States, and are named after natural resources which have long been important to Utah's economy, survival, and culture. All three animals are major characters in the legends of local Native Americans, and each mascot wears a charm around its neck with an original Anasazi or Fremont-style petroglyph.

===The Olympic Torch and relay===

The 2002 Olympic Torch is modeled after an icicle, with a slight curve to represent speed and fluidity. The Torch measures [tpl]convert|33|in|cm[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|3|in|cm[/tpl] wide at the top, [tpl]convert|0.5|in|cm[/tpl] at the bottom, and was designed by Axiom Design of Salt Lake City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.saltlake2002.com/sloc/beyond_sport/torch_relay/tr_index.html  |title=Olympic Torch Relay |author=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011024135215/http://www.saltlake2002.com/sloc/beyond_sport/torch_relay/tr_index.html |archivedate = October 24, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Olympic Torch Design |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=February 21, 2001 |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-3320i.php?p=1 |accessdate=October 27, 2010[/tpl] It was created with three sections, each with its own meaning and representation.
The torch relay was a 65-day run, from December 4, 2001 to February 8, 2002, which carried the Olympic flame through 46 of the 50 states in the United States.[tpl]cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=246 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105050321/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= November 5, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The torch covered [tpl]convert|13500|mi|km[/tpl], passed through 300 communities, and was carried by 12,012 Torchbearers.

===The Olympic Cauldron===

The Olympic Cauldron was designed with the official motto Light the Fire Within and the Fire and Ice theme in mind. It was designed to look like an icicle, and was made of glass which allowed the fire to be seen burning within. The actual glass cauldron stands atop a twisting glass and steel support, is [tpl]convert|12|ft|m[/tpl] high, and the flame within burns at [tpl]convert|900|F|C|1[/tpl].[tpl]cite news |title=Cauldron creation detailed in book |author=Lisa Riley Roche |newspaper=Deseret News |date=January 31, 2004 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/590040014/Cauldron-creation-detailed-in-book.html |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] Together with its support the cauldron stands [tpl]convert|117|ft|m[/tpl] tall and was made of 738 individual pieces of glass. Small jets send water down the glass sides of the cauldron, both to keep the glass and metal cooled (so they would not crack or melt), and to give the effect of melting ice.[tpl]cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=207 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The cauldron was designed by WET Design of Los Angeles, its frame built by Arrow Dynamics of Clearfield, Utah, and its glass pieces created by Western Glass of Ogden, Utah. The cauldron's cost was 2 million dollars, and it was unveiled to the public during its original install at Rice-Eccles Stadium (2002 Olympic Stadium) on January 8, 2002.[tpl]cite news |title=Caldron Unveiled |author=John Daley |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=January 8, 2002 |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-3656i.php?p=1 |accessdate=November 3, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100927204416/http://2002.ksl.com/news-3656i.php?p=1| archivedate= September 27, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Following the completion of the 2002 Winter Olympics the cauldron was installed at the permanent Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park, next the 2002 Olympic Stadium in Salt Lake City.
A second Olympic cauldron burned at the Awards Plaza in downtown Salt Lake City during the games. It was known as the Hero's Cauldron and was in the backdrop of every awards ceremony. This was the first time two cauldrons were used during the same Olympic Games.[tpl]cite news |title= Two Cauldrons Burning |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-4796i.php |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=January 9, 2011[/tpl]

==Concerns and controversies==

===Bribery to bring the games to Salt Lake City===

In 1998, several IOC members were forced to resign after it was uncovered that they had accepted bribes from Salt Lake Bid Committee co-heads Tom Welch and Dave Johnson in return for voting for Salt Lake City to hold the Games. In response to the scandal and a financial shortfall for the games, Mitt Romney, then CEO of the private equity firm Bain Capital (and future presidential candidate), was hired as the new President and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, leaving him and IOC President Dr. Jacques Rogge to contend with the public outcry and financial mess.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=Kirk|title=In Olympics Success, Romney Found New Edge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/us/politics/19romney.html|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=September 19, 2007[/tpl]  Romney, Kem C. Gardner, a Utah commercial real estate developer, and Don Stirling, the Olympics' local marketing chief, raised "millions of dollars from Mormon families with pioneer roots: the Eccles family, whose forebears were important industrialists and bankers" to help rescue the games, according to a later report.Jim, Rutenburg, "Mormons’ First Families Rally Behind Romney", The New York Times, web pp. 2 & 3, July 16, 2012. Retrieved July 17, 2012. An additional $410 million was received from the federal government.Karl, Jonathan, http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/exclusive-in-02-romney-touted-d-c-connections-federal-funds/, "EXCLUSIVE: In ’02 Romney Touted D.C. Connections, Federal Funds"], ABC News, web pp. 1, March 2, 2012. Retrieved July 27, 2012.

===Disqualifications for doping===

The 2002 games were the first Winter Olympics held after formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency; as a result there were a large number of athletes disqualified following the new testing.[tpl]cite news |title=Expect illegal drugs at 2012 Olympics |author=Bob Weiner & Caitlin Harrison |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/50948868-82/drug-games-olympics-athletes.html.csp |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl]
Athletes in cross-country skiing were disqualified for various reasons, including doping by two Russians and one Spaniard, leading Russia to file protests and threaten to withdraw from competition.

===Judging controversies===

In the first week of the Games, a controversy in the pairs' figure skating competition culminated in the French judge's scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier being awarded a second gold medal. Allegations of bribery were leveled against many ice-skating judges, leading to the arrest of known criminal Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov in Italy (at the request of the United States). He was released by the Italian officials.

==Security measures==

These Olympic games were the first since September 11, 2001, which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for the Games. The Office of Homeland Security (OHS) designated the Olympics a National Special Security Event (NSSE).
Aerial surveillance and radar control was provided by the U.S. Marines of Marine Air Control Squadron 2, Detachment C, from Cherry Point, North Carolina.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI and NSA arranged with Qwest Communications to use intercept equipment for a period of less than six months around the time of  the 2002 Winter Olympics. The agencies monitored the content of all email and text communications in the Salt Lake City area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.html|title=New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation's Traffic, Can Snare Emails|author=Siobhan Gorman|author2=Jennifer Valentino-Devries|date=August 20, 2013|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=August 21, 2013[/tpl].
