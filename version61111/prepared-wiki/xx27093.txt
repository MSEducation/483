The London School of Economics and Political Science (informally the London School of Economics or LSE) is a public research university specialised in social sciences located in London, United Kingdom, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and first issued degrees to its students in 1902.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/informationAbout/aboutLSE/Default.htm |title=About LSE – LSE Website |accessdate=13 January 2008[/tpl] Despite its name, LSE conducts teaching and research across a range of social sciences, as well as in mathematics, statistics, philosophy and history.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/directoriesAndMaps/academicDepartments.aspx#subjectsTaughtAtLSE|title=Subjects taught at LSE|accessdate=14 December 2011|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

The London School of Economics was founded in 1895[tpl]cite web|title = LSE history|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/informationAbout/LSEHistory/Default.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl] by Beatrice and Sidney Webb,[tpl]cite web|title = Beatrice and Sidney Webb|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/LSEHistory/webbs.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|year = 2000|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl] initially funded by a bequest of £20,000[tpl]cite web|title = London School of Economics|url =http://www.lse.ac.uk/informationAbout/LSEHistory/[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=C.

The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, William de Mattos and William Clark.
LSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw. The proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895 and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi,[tpl]cite web|title = LSE 1895|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/LSEHistory/lse.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|year = 2000|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl] in the City of Westminster.

===20th century===

The School joined the federal University of London in 1900, becoming the university's Faculty of Economics and awarding degrees of the University from 1902. Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920; the building was opened in 1922.
The 1930s economic debate between LSE and Cambridge is well known in academic circles. Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)
The dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser. LSE and Cambridge economists worked jointly in the 1920s—for example, the London and Cambridge Economic Service—but the 1930s brought a return to the dispute as LSE and Cambridge argued over the solution to the economic depression.
LSE's Lionel Robbins and Friedrich Hayek, and Cambridge's John Maynard Keynes were chief figures in the intellectual disagreement between the institutions. The controversy widened from deflation versus demand management as a solution to the economic problems of the day, to broader conceptions of economics and macroeconomics. Robbins and Hayek's views were based on the Austrian School of Economics with its emphasis on free trade and anti-interventionism, while Keynes advanced a brand of economic theory now known as Keynesianism which advocates active policy responses by the public sector.
During World War II, the School decamped from London to University of Cambridge, occupying buildings belonging to Peterhouse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg|title=Peterhouse Images|publisher=Peterhouse, Cambridge|accessdate=23 July 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529001601/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg |archivedate = 29 May 2008[/tpl]
The School's arms,[tpl]cite web|first = Arnold|last = Plant|authorlink = Arnold Plant|title = File:"Coat of arms of the London School of Economics and Political Science"|url = http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/1-6%20original.jpg|publisher=Institute of Education|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl] including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922,[tpl]cite web|title = London School of Economics|url = http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begslse.html|work=Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster|publisher=Institute of Education|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl] on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.[tpl]cite web|title = London School of Economics Online Community – Member Services|url = http://www.alumni.lse.ac.uk/olc/pub/LHE/filemanager/annualfund/giftclubs/beaversclub/default.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate =23 July 2009[/tpl]  The Latin motto, "Rerum cognoscere causas", is taken from Virgil's Georgics. Its English translation is "to Know the Causes of Things" and it was suggested by Professor Edwin Cannan.  The beaver mascot was selected for its associations with "foresight, constructiveness and industrious behaviour".

===21st century===

LSE continues to have a wide impact within British society, through its relationships and influence in politics, business and law.  The Guardian describes such influence when it stated:
 Once again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers.... The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: Mervyn King, was a former LSE professor. The chairman of the House of Commons education committee, Barry Sheerman, sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer Lord (Frank) Judd. Also on the board are Tory MPs Virginia Bottomley and Richard Shepherd, as well as Lord Saatchi and Lady Howe.[tpl]cite news |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/columnist/story/0,,1515788,00.html |title=A Time Honoured Tradition a|publisher=The Guardian Online | location=London | date=27 June 2005 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl]

The Sunday Times' recent profile of LSE for the 2008 Sunday Times University Guide commented:
 There are many who have achieved in the world of politics, business or academia who can trace their success to the years they spent at LSE. Inspired by tuition from academics who are often familiar faces, if not household names, LSE students take their first steps to greatness in the debating chambers, cafes, bars – and even occasionally in their seminar groups – during three or four years of studying.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article2496158.ece |title=2008 Sunday Times University Guide – LSE Profile |work=The Times |location=London  | date=23 September 2007 | accessdate=4 April 2010 |first=Patrick |last=Kidd[/tpl]

Professor Craig Calhoun took up the post of Director in September 2012. Its previous Director, Professor Judith Rees, is also chair of the school's Grantham Institute on Climate Change, an adviser to the World Bank as well as sitting on the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation and the International Scientific Advisory Council (ISAC).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/j.rees@lse.ac.uk | title=Judith Rees – Research Experts | date=2 May 2011 | accessdate=2 May 2011[/tpl]  She is also a former Convenor of the Department of Geography and Environment, and served as Deputy Director from 1998–2004.
Calhoun's predecessor, Sir Howard Davies stepped down after controversy regarding the school's links to the Libyan regime. In February 2011, LSE had to face the consequences of awarding a PhD to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons, while accepting a £1.5m donation to university from his family.[tpl]cite news | title = LSE embroiled in row over authorship of Gaddafi's son's PhD thesis and a £1.5m gift to university's coffers | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lse-embroiled-in-row-over-authorship-of-gaddafis-sons-phd-thesis-and-a-15m-gift-to-universitys-coffers-2226894.html |location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Jonathan | last=Owen | date=27 February 2011[/tpl]

==Campus and estate==

LSE moved to its present day central London campus at Clare Market and Houghton Street in Westminster, off the Aldwych and next to the Royal Courts of Justice and Temple Bar in 1902.  In 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the Old Building, which remains the principal building on campus.
Over the years the School has gradually increased its ownership of adjacent buildings, creating an almost continuous campus between Kingsway and the Royal Courts.  It now comprises approximately thirty buildings on the Aldwych campus as well as twelve halls of residence across the capital, two public houses, a nursery school, West End theatre (the Peacock), medical centre and sports grounds in Berrylands, south London.  It is also noted for its numerous statues and public art, including Richard Wilson’s Square the Block,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/09/RichardWilson.aspx|title=LSE unveils new Richard Wilson sculpture, Square the Block|accessdate=8 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl] Blue Rain[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/08/Bluerain.aspx|title=Blue Rain at LSE|accessdate=8 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl] and the campus’ unofficial mascot, the Penguin.
In the early 2000s, the LSE campus began a period of renewal beginning with the £35 million renovation of the Lionel Robbins Building by Sir Norman Foster to house the British Library of Political and Economic Science (BLPES), the world's largest social science and political library, containing over 4.7 million volumes. This also makes it the second largest single entity library in Britain, after the British Library at King's Cross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/guides/VisitorsLibraryGuide.pdf |title=LSE.ac.uk |publisher=LSE.ac.uk |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl]
A recent fund-raising scheme, called the “Campaign for LSE” raised over £100 million in one of the largest university fund-raising exercises ever seen in Britain.  In 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway, and engaged Sir Nicholas Grimshaw to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over £45 million - increasing the size of the campus by [tpl]convert|120000|sqft|m2[/tpl].  The building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 5 November 2008.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/estatesDivision/lseEstate/campusBuildings/newAcademicBuilding/Home.aspx|title=New Academic Building|accessdate=24 August 2012|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl]
The School now has an ongoing capital investment project, purchasing a number of sites to add to its portfolio.  In November 2009, LSE purchased the freeholds of both Sardinia House, overlooking the New Academic Building, and the Old White Horse public house.  In October 2010 it was announced the School had been successful in acquiring for freehold of the grade-II listed Land Registry Building at 32 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, which was reopened in March 2013 by HRH The Princess Royal as the new home for the Department of Economics and its associated research centres.
The first new building on the site in 35 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre, opened in January 2014 providing new accommodation for the Students’ Union, accommodation office and careers service as well as a bar, events space, gymnasium, rooftop terrace, learning café, dance studio and media centre.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/students/campusLondonLife/sweeHockStudentCentre/Home.aspx|title=Saw Swee Hock Student Centre|accessdate=11 March 2014|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl]  The building, designed as a showpiece for the City of Westminster and Midtown was recognised as having a low environmental impact receiving an ‘Outstanding’ status under BREEAM, and in 2012 was one of three winners of the New London Award in the Education category.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/students/campusLondonLife/newStudentsCentre/environmentAndSustainability/environmentAndSustainability.aspx|title=New Students' Centre awarded 'Outstanding' BREEAM rating|accessdate=24 August 2012|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl]

LSE is incorporated under the Companies Act as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the Charities Act 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/financeDivision/pdf/2011AnnualAccounts.pdf|title=Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2011|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate=12 August 2012[/tpl] The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the Academic Board; and the Director and Director’s Management Team.
The LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the school. It has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including: the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; "educational character and mission", and student experience. The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees which report directly to it.
The Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activities. The court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of court, its subcommittees and of the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the School; the amendment of the Memorandum and Articles of Association; and the appointment of external auditors.
The Academic Board is LSE's principal academic body, and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the School and its development. It is chaired by the director, with staff and student membership, and is supported by its own structure of committees. The Vice Chair of the Academic Board serves as a non-director member of the council and makes a termly report to the Council.

===Director===

The director is the head of LSE and its chief executive officer, responsible for executive management and leadership on academic issues. The director reports to and is accountable to the Council. The director is also the accountable officer for the purposes of the Higher Education Funding Council for England Financial Memorandum. The School’s current director is Craig Calhoun.

===Finances===

In the financial year ended 31 July 2011, LSE had a total income (including share of joint ventures) of £233.7 million (2009/10 – £220.92 million) and total expenditure of £214.84 million (2009/10 – £201.69 million).

==Academic profile==

===Admissions===

Admission to LSE is highly competitive.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] In  In 2012, the school received 17,500 applications for 1,200 undergraduate places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/howtoapply/lseentryrequirements.aspx|title=LSE's entry requirements| publisher = LSE|accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl] This means that there were approximately 14.6 applicants per place, with UCAS permitting undergraduate applicants to apply to no more than five institutions. Most programmes have typical offers of A*A*A-AAA at A level, with new undergraduates in 2013 arriving with an average of 551 UCAS points (equivalent to over AAAA at A level).
Entry standards are also high for postgraduate students, who are required to have (for taught Master's programmes) a First Class or high Upper Second Class UK honours degree, or its foreign equivalent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/study/graduate/pdfs/graduateProspectus2012.pdf |title=Graduate Prospectus 2012|publisher=LSE|accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl]  The applications success rate for postgraduate programmes varies, although most of the major courses, including Economics and Law, consistently have an acceptance rate below 7%.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Some of the very top premium programmes such as the MSc Finance and the MSc Financial Mathematics have admission rates below 5%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/taughtProgrammes/MScFinance_(fulltime).aspx |title=MSc Finance (full-time) – Taught programmes – Graduate Prospectus for entry in 2010 – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/taughtProgrammes/MScFinancialMathematics.aspx |title=MSc Financial Mathematics – Taught programmes – Graduate Prospectus for entry in 2010 – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]

===Programmes and degrees===

LSE is dedicated solely to the study and research of social sciences, and is the only university in the UK to be so. LSE awards a range of academic degrees spanning bachelors, masters and PhDs. The postnominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities.
The School offers over 140 MSc programmes, 5 MPA programmes, an LLM, 30 BSc programmes, an LLB and 4 BA programmes (including International History and Geography).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/undergraduateProspectus2007/indexOfCourses.htm |title=LSE Undergraduate Prospectus |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |accessdate=26 April 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602092424/http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/undergraduateProspectus2007/indexOfCourses.htm |archivedate = 2 June 2008[/tpl] LSE is the only British university to teach a BSc in Economic History. Other subjects pioneered by LSE include anthropology, criminology, social psychology, sociology and social policy; with international relations being first taught as a discipline at LSE.thegooduniversityguide[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] Courses are split across more than thirty research centres and nineteen departments, plus a Language Centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/language/ |title=LSE Language Centre |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] Since programmes are all within the social sciences, they closely resemble each other, and undergraduate students usually take at least one course module in a subject outside of their degree for their first and second years of study, promoting a broader education in the social sciences. At undergraduate level, certain departments are very small (90 students across three years of study), ensuring small lecture sizes and a more hands-on approach than other institutions. Since September 2010, it has been compulsory for first year undergraduates to participate in LSE 100: Understanding the Causes of Things alongside normal studies.
In conjunction with New York University's Stern School and HEC Paris LSE also offers an executive global MBA called TRIUM. This is globally ranked second by the Financial Times and strives to meld the strong social sciences, management strategy and financial accumen providing senior executives a well rounded view.
From 1902, following its absorption into the University of London, and up until 2007, all degrees were awarded by the federal university, in common with all other colleges of the university. This system was changed in 2007 in order to enable some colleges to award their own degrees. LSE was granted the power to begin awarding its own degrees from June 2008. Students graduating between June 2008 and June 2010 have the option of receiving a degree either from the University of London or the school. All undergraduate students entering from 2007 and postgraduate students from 2009 received an LSE degree.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
LSE does not award annual honorary degrees in common with other universities. In its 113-year history, the school has awarded fifteen honorary doctorates to established figures such as Nelson Mandela (Doctor of Science, Economics).

===Research===

In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, LSE had the highest percentage of world-leading research of any British higher education institution.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lse-beats-oxford-and-cambridge-to-become-best-research-centre-1202324.html |work=The Independent |location=London  | title=LSE beats Oxford and Cambridge to become best research centre | first=Richard | last=Garner | date=18 December 2008 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] The Independent Newspaper placed LSE first in the country for its research, on the basis that 35% of its faculty were judged to be doing world leading work, compared to 32% for both Oxford and Cambridge respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/RAE2008/home.aspx |title=Research Assessment Exercise 2008 – RAE 2008 – Research and expertise – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, according to the Times Newspaper, LSE ranks as joint-second (with Oxford) by grade point average across the fourteen units of assessment submitted, behind only Cambridge.[tpl]cite news| url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/gug/gooduniversityguide.php |location=London |work=The Times  | first=Roland | last=Watson |title= Good University Guide[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/stug/universityguide.php?sort=RESEARCH |work=The Times |location=London  | accessdate=4 April 2010 |title=. |first=Patrick |last=Kidd[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article2497779.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=How the guide was compiled | date=21 September 2008 | accessdate=4 April 2010 | first=Patrick | last=Kidd[/tpl] According to these RAE results, LSE is the UK's top research university in Anthropology, Economics, Law, Social Policy and European Studies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submissions.aspx?id=36&type=uoa |title=RAE 2008 : Submissions : Submissions list |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-2008-business-and-management-studies |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=RAE 2008: business and management studies results | date=18 December 2008 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl]

====Centres and think tanks====

The School houses a number of notable centres and think tanks, including LSE IDEAS, the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion, the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, LSE Global Governance, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, the Crisis States Research Centre and the LSE Public Policy Group.
The influence of these centres is diverse and significant, with much of the research they generate feeding into the formulation of high level policy. For example, in a global survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, LSE IDEAS and the LSE Public Policy Group were jointly ranked as world's second-best university think tanks, after Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2014/01/ThinkTankAward.aspx

===Partnerships===

LSE has university-wide partnerships in teaching and research with Columbia University in New York, Tsinghua, Peking University and Sciences Po Paris, with whom it offers various joint degrees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2010/05/CapeTown.aspx | title=lse.ac.uk[/tpl] For example, the International History department offers a joint MA in International and World History with Columbia University and an MSc in International Affairs with Peking University, with graduates earning degrees from both institutions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/internationalHistory/degrees/masters/Home.aspx |title=Masters Programmes – Masters Programmes – Programmes and courses – International History – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] LSE also offers various joint degrees with other universities.

===Libraries and archives===

The main library of LSE is the British Library of Political and Economic Science (BLPES), located in the Lionel Robbins Building.
It is the home of the world's largest social and political sciences library.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Founded in 1896, it is also the national social science library of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth and all its collections have been recognised for their outstanding national and international importance and awarded 'Designation' status by the Museums Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).
BLPES responds to around 7,500 visits from students and staff each day. In addition, it provides a specialist international research collection, serving over 12,000 registered external users each year.
The Shaw Library, housed in an impressive room in the Old Building contains the university's collection of fiction and general readings for leisure and entertainment. The Fabian Window, also located within the library, was unveiled by Tony Blair in 2003.
In 2013, the school purchased the Women's Library, Britain's main library and museum resource on women and the women's movement and a UNESCO classified resource.  It will open at the school's main site in summer 2013.
Additionally, students are permitted to use the libraries of any other University of London college, and the extensive facilities at Senate House Library, situated in Russell Square.

===LSE Summer School===

The LSE Summer School was established in 1989 and has expanded extensively with more than 4,400 participants in 2011. The Summer School offers over 60 courses, from the Accounting & Finance, Economics, English Language, Law, International Relations, Government & Society and Management departments, and takes place over two sessions of three weeks, in July and August each year. LSE also offers LSE-PKU Summer School in collaboration with Peking University. Courses from both summer schools can be used as credit against other qualifications. In 2011 the Summer School accepted students from over 115 countries, from some of the top colleges and universities in the world, as well as professionals from several national banks and major financial institutions. As well as the courses, accommodation in LSE halls of residence is available, and the Summer School provides a full social programme including guest lectures and receptions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/summerSchool/ |title=LSE Summer School – LSE Summer School – Summer schools – Study – Home |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]

===Rankings and reputation===

LSE ranked 3rd overall in the Sunday Times University Guide cumulative ranking over a ten-year period (1997–2007),[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article2511354.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Performance over 10 years | date=22 September 2007 | accessdate=4 April 2010 | first=Patrick | last=Kidd[/tpl] and ranked 3rd in the Complete University Guide 2014.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings |title=Rankings| work=Complete University Guide 2012 | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl] A number of departments also ranked among the top three in subject rankings, including but not limited to Law (2nd), Philosophy (2nd), Economics (2nd), Accounting and Finance (2nd), History (3rd) and Geography (2nd). Its Department of International Relations has also been ranked amongst the top ten in the world in recent years, and second only to Harvard in 2013 according to THE-QS World University Rankings, making it the best such department in Europe.http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2013/politics
In the THE-QS World University Rankings, the School was ranked 11th in the world in 2004 and 2005, but dropped to 66th and 67th in the 2008 and 2009 edition. The school administration asserts that the fall was due to a controversial change in methodology which hindered social science institutions.http://www2.lse.ac.uk/.../LSEServices/.../LSEInvestigationsIntoTheTHEandQSleaguetables.aspx [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] In January 2010, THE concluded that their existing methodology system with Quacquarelli Symonds was flawed in such a way that it was unfairly biased against certain schools, including LSE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/divisionsAndDepartments/ERD/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx |title=LSE in university league tables – External Relations Division – Administrative and academic support divisions – Services and divisions – Staff and students – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  A representative of Thomson Reuters, THE's new partner, commented on the controversy: "LSE stood at only 67th in the last Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings – some mistake surely? Yes, and quite a big one." 
Nevertheless, the school was the only one of its type to finish in the top 200 universities, and was thus stated to be the best "medium sized specialised research university" in the world. LSE is ranked 25th globally for Reputation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013/reputation-ranking |title=Top Universities by Reputation 2013 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=20 June 2012[/tpl]  and often scores well in the social science specific section of the ranking.

==Student life==

===Student body===

In the 2011–12 academic year there were 9,300 full-time students and around 700 part-time students at the school. Of these, approximately two-thirds came from outside the United Kingdom. LSE has a highly international student body, with over 145 countries represented.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/studentsAndStaff.aspx|title=Students and Staff|accessdate=24 August 2012|publisher=London School of Economics[/tpl]
Over half of LSE's students are postgraduates,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/informationAbout/aboutLSE/introductionToTheSchool.htm |title=About LSE – About LSE – Home |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] an unusually high proportion in comparison with other British institutions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] There is approximately an equal split between genders with 51% male and 49% female students.

===Students' Union===

LSE has its own students' union (LSESU), which is affiliated to the National Union of Students and the National Postgraduate Committee, as well as to the University of London Union. The students' union is often regarded as the most politically active in Britain – a reputation it has held since the well documented LSE student riots in 1966–67 and 1968–69,[tpl]cite news |title=BBC website: LSE Student Protests |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6299579.stm | date=31 May 2007 | accessdate=6 January 2010 |work=BBC News   | first=Lucy | last=Wilkins[/tpl] which made international headlines.
In 2013, LSESU moved into a purpose-built new building on the Aldwych campus,[tpl]cite web|title=Saw Swee Hock Student Centre|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/students/campusLondonLife/sweeHockStudentCentre/Home.aspx|publisher=LSE|accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl] having moved out of its former East Building and Clare Market sites.
The Union is responsible for the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies, as well as student welfare and issues regarding accommodation and other matters. As of 2013, there are over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group.
The Media Group is a collective of four distinct outlets, each with their own history and identity. A weekly student newspaper The Beaver, is published each Tuesday during term time and is amongst the oldest student newspapers in the country. The Union's radio station Pulse! has existed since 1999, and the television station LooSE Television has existed since 2005. The Clare Market Review one of Britain's oldest student publications was revived in 2008 and has gone on to win many national awards. Students also get access to London Student, which is published by the University of London Union.
In various forms, RAG Week has been operating since 1980, when it was started by then Student Union Entertainments Officer and now New Zealand MP Tim Barnett.
Affiliated with LSESU, LSE Athletics Union is the body responsible for all sporting activity within the university. It is a member of British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS). In distinction to the "blues" awarded for sporting excellence at Oxford and Cambridge, LSE's outstanding athletes are awarded "purples".

===Student housing===

There are 12 LSE halls of residence in and around central London, of which 10 are owned and operated by LSE and one is operated by Shaftesbury Student Housing. Together, these residences accommodate over 3,500 students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/accommodation/RES_intro.htm |title=Accommodation – Accommodation for students – Life at LSE – Home |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  In addition, there are also eight intercollegiate halls shared with other constituent colleges of the University of London, which accommodate approximately 25% of LSE's first-year undergraduate students.
The School guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students, regardless of their present address. Many of the school's larger postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living. Whilst none of the residences are located at the Houghton Street campus, the closest, Grosvenor House is within a five-minute walk from the school in Covent Garden, whilst the farthest residences (Nutford and Butler's Wharf) are approximately forty-five minutes by Tube or Bus.
Each residence accommodates a mixture of students both domestic and foreign, male and female, and, usually, undergraduate and postgraduate. New undergraduate students (including General Course students) occupy approximately 36% of all spaces, with postgraduates taking approximately 56% and continuing students about 8% of places.
The largest LSE student residence, Bankside, opened in 1996 and accommodates 617 students across eight floors overlooking the River Thames and located behind the popular Tate Modern art gallery on the south bank of the River. The second-largest residence is based in High Holborn, was opened in 1995 and is approximately 10 minutes walk from the main campus. Other accommodation is located well for London's attractions and facilities – Butler's Wharf is situated next to Tower Bridge, Rosebery Hall is located in the London Borough of Islington close to Sadler's Wells, and Carr-Saunders Hall, named after LSE professor is approximately 5 minutes from Telecom Tower in the heart of Fitzrovia.
Since 2005, the school has opened three new residences to provide accommodation for all first-year students. Lilian Knowles, independently operated in Spitalfields, is home for approximately 360 students and opened in 2006.  It is located in a converted Victorian night refuge; the remnants of which can still be seen on the outside facade.  It is a common stop on Jack the Ripper tours as one of his victims is commonly believed to have been a one-time resident. Planning permission was sought to convert Northumberland House, on Northumberland Avenue into a new residence on 2 June 2005, and the accommodation opened to students in October 2006.
The newest accommodation development is Northumberland House, a Grade II listed building, located between the Strand and Thames Embankment. It was formerly a Victorian grand hotel and lately government offices.
The closest residence to the Houghton Street campus is reserved for postgraduate students and is located on the eastern side of Drury Lane at the crossroads of Great Queen Street and Long Acre. Grosvenor House, converted from a Victorian office building, opened in September 2005. The residence is unique in that all of its 169 rooms are small, self-contained studios, with private toilet and shower facilities and a mini-kitchen.
There are also eight intercollegiate halls and some students are selected to live in International Students House, London.
