==Controversy==

Buckler has a reputation as a "swipe" artist,Cooke, Jon B. "Dan Adkins' Strange Tales: The Artist on his Visits to the World of Wood and the House of Ideas", Comic Book Artist Collection TwoMorrows Publishing, 2005, p. 42. with his early work in particular filled with "homages" to artists such as Jack Kirby,O'Neill:[tpl]blockquote|Question: What did you do as Buckler's assistant? Pérez: Basically, I helped him with layout. Or I'd go through his swipe file — batches of comics — looking for suitable swipes for the story he was doing. Since at the time he was doing Thor and Fantastic Four, that meant lots of Jack Kirby books.[/tpl] John Buscema, and Neal Adams.Gillis, Peter B. Letter about Rich Buckler swipes, The Comics Journal #45 (March 1979), pp. 22. After being publicly accused of the practice by The Comics Journal in 1983,"Plagiarism: Rich Buckler Signs his Name to Jack Kirby's Work," The Comics Journal #83 (Aug. 1983), pp. 33-35. Buckler denied the charges"Rich Buckler Answers His Critics," The Comics Journal #86 (November 1983), pp. 28-31. and sued the magazine for libel."Rich Buckler Sues Comics Journal and two of its Writers for Libel," The Comics Journal #88 (Jan. 1984), p. 13. He later dropped the suit."Buckler Drops Comics Journal Libel Suit," The Comics Journal #93 (Sept. 1984), pp. 11-12.
