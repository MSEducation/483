==History==

Memphis Municipal Airport opened on a [tpl]convert|200|acre|adj=on[/tpl] plot of farmland just over seven miles (11 km) from downtown Memphis. During its early years the airport had three hangars and an unpaved runway; passenger and air mail service was provided by American Airlines and Chicago and Southern Air Lines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1953). In 1939 Eastern Air Lines arrived; that March Eastern had one departure a day to Muscle Shoals and beyond, American had four east/west and C&S had four north/south.
During World War II the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command 4th Ferrying Group used Memphis while sending new aircraft overseas. In April 1951 the runways were 6000-ft 2/20, 6530-ft 9/27, 4370-ft 14/32 and 4950-ft 17/35 (the airport was all north of Winchester Rd during the 1950s1956 airport diagram)
The April 1957 OAG shows 64 weekday departures: 25 on Delta, 18 American, 7 Southern, 5 Eastern, 4 Braniff, 3 Trans-Texas and 2 Capital. American DC-6s flew nonstop to Washington and New York, but westward nonstops didn't reach beyond Ft Worth and Kansas City until American started Los Angeles in 1964. The first scheduled jets were Delta 880s ORD-MEM-MSY and back, starting in July–August 1960.
The current terminal was designed by Mann & Harrover and cost $6.5 million. It opened on June 7, 1963 and Memphis Municipal changed its name to Memphis International in 1969, but the airport had no non-stop international flights until 1985-86 when Republic Airlines began flights to Mexico. The terminal was expanded for $31.6 million in 1974, adding two new concourses and extending the others, which were designed by Roy P. Harrover & Associates.[tpl]cite book |last1=Clute|first1=Eugene|last2=Fenimore|first2=Russell|last3=Reid|first3=Kenneth|title=Progressive Architecture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrJHAQAAIAAJ&q=en&sa=X&ei=3WzaT8CYFOTi2QX_pY2IBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA|accessdate=June 14, 2012|volume=54|year=1973|publisher=Reinhold Publishing Corporation|page=46[/tpl] The airport had no non-stop inter-continental flights until 1995 when KLM began service to Amsterdam.
