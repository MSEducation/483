An opponent of Prohibition, Messmer issued a pastoral letter in 1918, declaring, "People fail to see the absolutely false principle underlying the movement and the sinister work of the enemies of the Catholic Church trying to profit by this opportunity of attacking her in the most sacred mystery entrusted to her."[tpl]cite news|date=June 25, 1918|work=The New York Times|title=PRELATE ASSAILS DRY LAW[/tpl] In 1921, he prohibited Catholic children in Milwaukee from participating in a Fourth of July Pilgrim pageant, which he described as "exclusively a glorification of the Protestant Pilgrims," but later withdrew his objections. He was also opposed to women's suffrage. He denounced the labor movement as being tinged with socialism, and drew criticism from Polish Catholics after condemning the Kuryer Polski newspaper.[tpl]cite news|work=Dictionary of Wisconsin History|title=Messmer, Sebastian Gebhard 1847 – 1930|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2327&term_type_id=1&term_type_text=People&letter=M[/tpl]
