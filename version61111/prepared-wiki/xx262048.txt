The South African Open, formerly the South African Championships, was an annual tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts from 1891 to 2011. The tournament was not played from 1900 to 1902 due to the Boer War, from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I, and from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II. The women's tournament was stopped in 1987 and was not played in any of the editions of the Open that followed, except for 1990.
Sets were played on advantage until 1971; "lingering death" tie-breaks at six games all were subsequently adopted. All matches were the best-of-three-sets. 
The most successful female player at the South African Championships – played from 1891 to 1967 during the Amateur Era – was Mrs H.A. Kirby, who won six titles between 1904 and 1912. She also shares the overall record for the most consecutive titles won with Miss H. Grant. Both players won four consecutive titles – Grant won the first four South African titles from 1891 to 1894 and Mrs Kirby won four titles between 1904 and 1907. Margaret Court and Brigitte Cuypers share the record for the most wins at the tournament in the Open Era. Court won three titles in 1968, 1970 and 1971 and Cuypers won in 1976, 1978 and 1979.
The following comprises the full list of South African Open women's singles champions.
