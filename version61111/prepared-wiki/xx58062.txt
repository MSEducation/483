"Himno Nacional de El Salvador" (National Anthem of El Salvador) is the national anthem of El Salvador. 

==Development==

The lyrics were indited by General Juan José Cañas in 1856, with music composed by the Italian Juan Aberle in 1879. The anthem was adopted as the national musical composition on September 15, 1879, and officially apperceived by the regime on December 11, 1953.
Commonly, only the chorus (which is reiterated) is played and sung at sporting events and official diplomatic ceremonies, the anthem is ended afore the first verse (the slow music) due to the chorus being the most vigorous musical part of the anthem. It is officially considered the second longest national anthem in the world (the longest being Uruguay's, at five minutes).
