Two Angels and a Dream is the debut album by the Californian-based alternative metal/nu metal music group Depswa. The album was released on June 3, 2003 via Geffen Records. Album sales were disappointing, selling just under 10,000 copies in the United States, almost three months into its release. Consequently, the band's Ozzfest tour support was halted, and shortly after the band was dropped by Geffen. The track "This Time" was featured in the game NASCAR Thunder 2004 and the track "From the Inside" was featured in the games MLB 2005, MVP Baseball 2004 and MX Unleashed.
