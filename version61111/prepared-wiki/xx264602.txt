==The poem==

==Rough translation==

Climbing to the cold distance of this winding stony path,  
leading to a place of white clouds where people live,  
I stop my carriage and sit in appreciation and love of the evening maple trees,  
where frosted leaves are as red as the February flowers (spring flowers).
