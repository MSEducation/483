Algherese (Standard Catalan: Alguerès, [tpl]IPA-ca|əɫɣəˈɾɛs|IPA[/tpl]; Algherese: Alguerés, [tpl]IPA-ca|alɣaˈɾes|IPA[/tpl]) is the variant of the Catalan language spoken in the city of Alghero (L'Alguer in Catalan), in the northwest of Sardinia, Italy.
Catalan invaders repopulated the town and expelled the indigenous mixed population (Sardinian, Ligurian, Corsican and Tuscan) in 1372, after several revolts.L'Alguer and Alguerese Catalan - Oral Corpus of Alguerese 
Catalan was replaced as the official language by Spanish, then by Italian in mid 18th century, but its use remained widespread until at least the 1960s. Today it has semi-official status alongside Italian.Alghero official website
According to recent linguistic research, 22.4% of the population in Alghero are first language speakers and above 90% have some knowledge of the language.Linguistic data from Generalitat de Catalunya
