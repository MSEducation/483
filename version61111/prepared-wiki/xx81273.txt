Cadmium pigments are a class of pigments that have cadmium as one of the chemical components. Most of cadmium produced worldwide is used in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries, but about half the remaining consumption, which is about 2,000 tons annually, is used to produce colored cadmium pigments. The principal pigments are a family of yellow/orange/red cadmium sulfides and sulfoselenides as well as compounds with metals other than Cd.Hugo Müller, Wolfgang Müller, Manfred Wehner, Heike Liewald "Artists' Colors" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

==Artists' paints==

Brilliantly colored, with good permanence and tinting power, Cadmium Yellow, Cadmium Orange, and Cadmium Red are familiar artists' colors, as well as being frequently employed as architectural paints, since they can add life and vibrancy to renderings.  Their greatest use is in the coloring of plastics and specialty paints which must resist processing or service temperatures up to 3000°C.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cadmium.org/pg_n.php?id_menu=13 |title=Cadmium Pigments |accessdate=30 November 2010[/tpl] The color-fastness or permanence of cadmium requires protection from a tendency to slowly form carbonate salts with exposure to air.  Most paint vehicles accomplish this, but cadmium colors will fade in fresco or mural painting.
The following are commonly used as pigments in artists' paints:
When first introduced, there were hardly any stable pigments in the yellow to red range, with orange and bright red being very troublesome. The cadmium pigments eventually replaced compounds such as mercury sulfide (the original vermilion) with greatly improved light-fastness.
Cadmium pigments are known for excellent light-fastness, although the lighter shades can fade in sunlight.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/history/cdyellow.html |title=History of Cadmium Yellow |work=Pigments Through the Ages |author=Michael Douma, curator |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-07-31[/tpl]

==Safety==

Cadmium sulfide is not very toxic (LD50 > 5000 mg/kg) when used as a pigment, although acute exposure to cadmium vapors from welding is harmful.
The cadmium pigments have been partially replaced by azo pigments. These have significantly inferior lightfastness,[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.paintmaking.com/yellow.htm |title=Yellow |work=Making Artist's Paint |author=Tony Johansen |date=2006-05-06 |accessdate=2013-07-31[/tpl] but still good,[tpl]Citation |url=http://artschoolathome.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/yellow/ |title=Yellow |work=Art School at Home (blog) |author=Jill |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2013-07-31[/tpl] and they have the advantage of both being cheaper and non-toxic.  In some countries, consumer activists such as Michael Vernon in Australia were successful in banning the use of cadmium pigments in plastics that could be used for toy manufacture, owing to the toxicity of cadmium.
