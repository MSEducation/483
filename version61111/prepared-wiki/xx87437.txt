The MLC Centre is a skyscraper in Sydney, Australia. This office building is 228 metres (748 ft) high and has 60 storeys. It was designed by Sydney architect Harry Seidler, and remains one of his most definitive works. The building was awarded the Sir John Sulman medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.
The building is a stark white, modernist column in an octagonal floorplan, with eight massive load-bearing columns in the corners that taper slightly towards the top. It is one of the world's tallest reinforced concrete buildings and was the tallest building in the world outside North America at the time of its completion. The MLC Centre was Sydney's tallest office building from 1977 to 1992. The MLC Centre is jointly owned by the GPT Group and QIC. The MLC Centre was also Australia's tallest building for 9 years until losing the title to the Rialto Towers in Melbourne in 1986. 
Occupants include the Sydney Consulate of the United States of America. The podium of the building includes a shopping centre with several exclusive fashion labels and a 1,186 seat theatre, the Theatre Royal. The street address is 19-29 Martin Place Sydney.
The building is undergoing a $100m repair project which will install hybrid corrosion protection to the facade. The project is expected to retain the original appearance of the structure but remedy damage to exposed aggregate precast concrete facade panels caused by expansive corrosion of steel reinforcement.

==Site controversy==

The building's construction was controversial, since it brought about the demolition in 1971-2 of the famous 19th century Australia Hotel, the Theatre Royal, and the splendid Commercial Travellers Club building on the corner of Martin Place, all of which formerly stood on the site, as well as much of the historic Rowe Street precinct.
