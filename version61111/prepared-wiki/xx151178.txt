Barton Mine to the north produced molybdenum from 1907 to 1918 and Norrie Mine on the eastern shore of Net Lake was in development prior to 1920. There are known kimberlite pipes that are considered diamondiferous in the area that could lead to future mining.
Temagami North sits on the western shore of Net Lake, where people can go canoeing, fishing, and boating. The main arena of Temagami is situated near the shore of Net Lake and is used seasonally for hockey and curling. In 2005, the roof of the arena collapsed inward from snow weight during winter.
