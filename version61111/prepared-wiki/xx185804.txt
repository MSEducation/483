==Publication history==

An umbrella title that showcased a different heroic-adventure, science-fiction or sword-and-sorcery character in virtually every issue. The title introduced the Marvel Comics characters Dominic Fortune in issue #2, Star-Lord in #4, and Rocket Raccoon in #7. The vigilante character the Punisher, introduced as an antagonist in the comic book The Amazing Spider-Man, had his first solo story in issue #2.
The magazine had scheduling difficulties, with various "Next Issue" announcements proving unreliable. Issue #2 promised an adventure of the Marvel superhero Thor in #3, but a Blade story originally promoted as a serial for the cancelled Vampire Tales[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl] appeared, with the Thor story unseen until #10. As well, two different issues, #20 and #24, are dated "Winter 1980." Issue #20 was to have included photographs from a Japanese Spider-Man television program but instead featured Howard Chaykin's Dominic Fortune.[tpl]cite book|last=Saffel|first=Steve|title= Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon|publisher=Titan Books|year=2007|isbn= 978-1-84576-324-4|chapter= Amazing Friends and Secret Wars The 1980s|page= 124|quote= Since Marvel Preview was printed on cheap newsprint, it's possible that editorial staff decided the photos would look terrible when screened and printed.[/tpl] In addition, Robert A. Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover of Marvel Preview #11, which featured a blurb that described the Star-Lord content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein," leading to the issue being pulled and reprinted.
With #25 (March 1981), the title was changed to Bizarre Adventures, which published an additional ten issues before ending publication.Bizarre Adventures at the Grand Comics Database To offset the dark tone of most of the stories, editor Denny O'Neil had writer Steve Skeates produce a humor feature called Bucky Bizarre to close out each issue.[tpl]cite news | last = Schwirian | first= John | date = June 2009 | title = The Unique Voice and Vision of Steve Skeates, part 3 | work = Back Issue | issue = 34 | pages = 81-87 | publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing[/tpl] The final issue, #34, was a standard-sized color comic book, cover-blurbed "Special Hate the Holidays Issue", with anthological Christmas-related stories including one starring Howard the Duck.
