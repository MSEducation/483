Willy Wonka is a character in Roald Dahl's 1964 children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and the film adaptations of these books that followed. The book and the film adaptations both vividly depict an odd Wonka, a feature arising from his creative and eccentric genius. He bewilders the other characters with his antics, but Charlie enjoys Wonka's behavior. In the 2005 film adaptation, Willy Wonka's behavior is viewed more as a (sympathetic) character flaw. Wonka's reasons for giving away his fabulous factory is never revealed in the books, but in the 1971 film adaptation, Wonka tells Charlie he can't live forever, so he wanted to find a sweet child he could trust his candy making secrets to.

==Appearances==

===1971 film adaptation===

Candy maker Willy Wonka (portrayed by Gene Wilder) has hidden five Golden Tickets amongst his famous "Wonka Bars." The finders of these special tickets will be given a full tour of his tightly guarded candy factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate. The contest sets off a global craze with everyone desperately seeking out the tickets. They are eventually found by five different children from around the world (Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and Charlie Bucket). 
Charlie enters the chocolate factory too and among many things sees Oompa-Loompas, Willy Wonka's short orange workers whom he saved from the wild beasts of Loompaland. 
Eventually, Charlie Bucket is the only remaining child. Wonka informs him that the tour is over, politely dismisses him and Grandpa Joe, and disappears into his office without mentioning the promised prize of a lifetime supply of chocolate. Grandpa Joe and Charlie enter the office, where Wonka tells them that Charlie does not get the prize because he broke the rules. When questioned on the existence of the said rules, Wonka irritably reveals the forfeiture clause of the contract Charlie signed. Charlie's part in the theft of Fizzy Lifting drinks earlier in the movie means that he violated the contract, and therefore he receives nothing. Now obviously enraged, Wonka dismisses them with a furious "Good day!".
After this, Grandpa Joe angrily berates Wonka, causing him to repeat "I Said Good Day!"
When Charlie subsequently returns a gobstopper to Wonka that Grandpa Joe thought could be used as revenge, Wonka joyfully tells Charlie that he "won" and begs his guests' forgiveness. He reveals that the spy "Slugworth" is actually an employee named Wilkinson, whose offer to buy the gobstopper was a morality test for the Golden Ticket winners, and Charlie was the only one who passed. Wonka leads Charlie and Grandpa Joe to the "Wonkavator", a multi-directional glass elevator, and fly out of the factory in it. As they soar over the village, Wonka tells Charlie that his actual prize is not just the chocolate but the factory itself, as the Golden Ticket search was created to help Wonka search for an honest and worthy child to be his heir. Charlie and his family will reside in the factory and take over its operation when Wonka retires.

===2005 film adaptation===

Willy Wonka (portrayed by Johnny Depp this time), the owner of a famous chocolate factory, has long closed access to his factory due to problems concerning industrial espionage that ultimately led him to fire all his employees, among them Charlie's Grandpa Joe. One day, Wonka informs the world of a contest, in which five Golden Tickets have been placed in five random Wonka Bars worldwide, and the winners will be given a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one ticket holder will be given a special prize at the end of the tour. After all five of the tickets are found, Wonka greets Charlie and the other ticket holders outside the factory and leads the group into the facility. During the tour, Wonka tempts each of the bad children to disobey his orders with something related to their individual character flaws. Wonka then invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, and reveals that the purpose of the Golden Tickets and the tour was to make the "least rotten" child the heir of the factory itself, so he can have someone carry on his legacy when he gets too old. The only condition, however, is that Charlie must leave his family behind, because Wonka believes family is a hindrance to a chocolatier's creative freedom, a philosophy Wonka developed due to his dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka, denying his son candy because of the potential risk to his teeth. After secretly sampling some candy, Wonka was instantly hooked and ran away to follow his dreams. After being refused Charlie's offer, Wonka falls into a state of emotional depression and returns to Charlie to seek advice. Wonka soon reunites with his estranged father and allows Charlie's family to live in the factory, forever.

Early on in the production of the 2005 film, Nicolas Cage was under discussions for portraying Willy Wonka, but lost interest.[tpl]cite news | author = Waugh, Rob | title = Sweet Smell of Success | work = The Mail on Sunday | date = 3 April 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Greg Dean Schmitz | title = Greg's Preview — Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | work = Yahoo!

Burton and screenwriter John August worked together in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. "You want a little bit of the flavor of why Wonka is the way he is," Burton reasoned. "Otherwise, what is he? He's just a weird guy."[tpl]cite news | author = Nashawaty, Chris | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1073574,00.html | title = Cover Story: The Truth About 'Charlie' | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = 8 July 2005 [/tpl] Warner Bros. and Burton held differences over the characterization of Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie Bucket had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse.[tpl]cite news | author = Head, Steve | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/632/632453p1.html | title = Interview: Tim Burton | work = IGN | date = 8 July 2005 [/tpl] "In some ways," Burton protested, "he's more screwed up than the kids."[tpl]cite book | author = Salisbury, Mark and Burton, Tim | title = Burton on Burton | publisher =Faber and Faber | year = 2006 | pages = 223–245 | chapter = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | isbn = 0-571-22926-3 | location = London[/tpl] Prior to Burton's involvement, Warner Bros. considered or discussed Willy Wonka with Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith and Adam Sandler. Johnny Depp was the only actor Burton considered for the role, who signed on without reading the script under the intention on going with a completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1050844,00.html | title = Movie Preview: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = 18 April 2005 [/tpl] "Regardless of what one thinks of that film," Depp explained, "Gene Wilder's persona, his character, stands out."  Depp stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he based the character on what he believed an "incredibly stoned" George W. Bush would act like.[tpl]cite web|title=Depp's Wonka Inspiration|url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/05/08/depp-channeled-bush-willy-wonka|publisher=Breitbert|date=8 May 2012[/tpl]  
Comparisons were drawn between Willy Wonka and musician Michael Jackson. Burton joked, "Here's the deal. There's a big difference: Michael Jackson (d. 2009) likes children, Willy Wonka can't stand them. To me that's a huge difference." Depp explained that the similarities with Jackson never occurred to him. "I say if there was anyone you'd want to compare Wonka to it would be a Howard Hughes, almost. Reclusive, germaphobe, controlling."[tpl]cite news | author = Head, Steve | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20101204113925/http://movies.ign.com/articles/633/633236p1.html| title = Interview: Johnny Depp | work = IGN | date = 13 July 2005 [/tpl] Burton agreed with the Hughes similarities, and additionally supplied Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane as inspiration. "Somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world." Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed it would be too outrageous.

==Critical analysis==

Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka was well received and remains one of his best-known roles.

Regarding Wilder's effect, Anderson wrote "If you're a kid, Wonka seems magical, but watching it now, he has a frightening combination of warmth, psychosis, and sadism." Kevin Carr, of 7M pictures wrote "This is Gene Wilder's legacy.

Critical response to Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was more mixed. Critic Andrew Sarris, of The New York Observer, who did not enjoy the film's style in general, wrote "I wonder if even children will respond to the peculiarly humorless and charmless stylistic eccentricities of Mr. Burton and his star, Johnny Depp."The Candy Man Can’t: What Is Johnny Depp Up To?

Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip."[tpl]cite news | author = Hornaday, Ann | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/14/AR2005071402083.html | title = Sorry, Charlie | work = The Washington Post | date = 15 July 2005 [/tpl] Joe Lozito of Big Picture Big Sound questioned the intention as well, writing "Depp's Wonka exudes none of the gravity required for the role. It's as though he didn't take the role seriously.
