==Track listing==

==Critical reception==

AllMusic commented, "these songs resemble the ones on Confusion Is Sex, except that they're a bit more developed, especially the title track and 'Brother James'. Yr Idols'' results in a fascinating wade through Sonic Youth's early flashes of genius."

==Re-issue==

In 1995, the tracks on Kill Yr Idols not found on 1983's Confusion Is Sex were appended to the DGC reissue of that album.
