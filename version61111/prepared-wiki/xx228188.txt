===Malmö FF===

In 2006 Molins made his league debut for Malmö FF in Allsvenskan, he had a breakthrough in 2008 when he played 27 matches and scored 2 goals. He was the managers choice as right midfielder in the starting lineup throughout the 2009 season, however in the title winning season of 2010 he was challenged in some games by Jiloan Hamad. Molins proved to be a very skilled dribbler, he was involved in most attacks for Malmö in 2010. Molins continued to be challenged for a position in the starting eleven by Hamad and Jimmy Durmaz in the start of the 2011 season, partly due to minor injuries on Molins part. On 15 May 2011 Molins secured a 2–1 home win against Örebro SK with two powerful shots in the top left goal corner after the team had been down 0–1 in half time.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/article1467723/Molins-kanoner-gav-MFF-segern.html|title= Molins kanoner gav MFF segern|publisher=Sydsvenskan|accessdate= 2 June 2011|language=Swedish [/tpl] Malmö FF's director of sports Per Ågren announced on 26 May 2011 that he expected Molins to leave the club in the summer of 2011 because his contract was ending in November and Molins had declined to negotiate a renewal.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/article1478773/Molins-lamnar---och-kanske-Mehmeti.html|title= Molins lämnar MFF – Mehmeti också på väg|publisher=Sydsvenskan|accessdate= 2 June 2011|language=Swedish [/tpl] On 2 June 2011 several newspapers reported that Molins had started negotiations with Anderlecht, three days after former club partner Behrang Safari had signed for the Belgian club.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/article1485325/Rykten-placerar-Molins-i-Anderlecht.html|title= Rykten om Molins till Anderlecht|publisher=Sydsvenskan|accessdate= 2 June 2011|language=Swedish [/tpl] On 17 June 2011 Malmö FF reported that Molins had signed a four-year contract with Anderlecht.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2011-06-17_Guille_till_anderlecht.aspxl|title= Molins klar för Anderlecht|publisher=Malmö FF|accessdate= 17 June 2011|language=Swedish [/tpl]
