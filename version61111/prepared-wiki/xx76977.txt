The national emblem of Bangladesh ([tpl]lang-bn|বাংলাদেশের জাতীয় প্রতীক - Bānglādēśēr Jātīẏo Pratīk[/tpl]) was adopted shortly after independence in 1971.
Located on the emblem is a water lily, that is bordered on two sides by rice sheaves.  Above the water lilly are four stars and a three connected jute  leaves.  The water lily is the country's national flower, and is representative of the many rivers that run through Bangladesh.  Rice represents its presence as the staple food of Bangladesh, and for the agriculture of that nation.
