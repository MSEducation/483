The school was named after one of the historic Iroquoian-speaking Native American tribes in the Shenandoah Valley.
The current principal is John Nelson. Assistant Principals are Michael Smith, Karen McCoy, and Joanne Altendorf. Eli Jordan is the Director of Guidance. Jason Barbe is the Coordinator of Student Activities, with Susan Saylor being the Assistant Coordinator of Student Activities.
