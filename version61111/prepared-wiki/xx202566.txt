Daniel James "Dan" Curtin (14 February 1898 â€“ 4 February 1980) was an Australian politician. Born in Sydney, he was educated at a Catholic primary school before becoming a boilermaker and organiser of the Boilermakers' Society. In 1949, he was preselected by the Australian Labor Party to contest the safe Labor seat of Watson, displacing the sitting member, Max Falstein, who contested the seat as an independent. Curtin won the seat, which he held until 1955, when he transferred to the seat of Kingsford-Smith. He held Kingsford-Smith until 1969, when he retired from politics.
