Before joining Shonen Knife, Michie spent some time working as a cartoonist's assistant.
In 1995, Nakatani collaborated with Big Dipper's Gary Waleik on a project called The Japanese Beatles.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_SwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT22&lpg=PT22&dq=michie+nakatani+japanese+beetles&source=bl&ots=tCxfW9kfdn&sig=-Vz--wMvYMwwggapjBcQyVHzjAE&hl=en&ei=N4-DTfu6BfCH0QGBw5XHCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=michie%20nakatani%20japanese%20beetles&f=false |title=CMJ New Music Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl] They recorded one single.
In 1997, just as Shonen Knife were about to embark on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Michie came down with a bout of appendicitis. She was able to recover in time to join the band in Australia. During the New Zealand dates bass duties were handled by Atsushi Shibata.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shonenknife.com/aussie.html |title=Shonen Knife Tour - New Zealand/Australia, 1997 |publisher=Shonenknife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl]
She stayed with Shonen Knife from December 1981 until December 1999. In early 1999, when she decided to leave the band, Naoko and Atsuko tried to talk her out of it, but she was firm on her decision to leave so in the end they reluctantly had to let her go.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shonenknife.com/naoko99.html |title=Shonen Knife 2000 - A Conversation with Shonen Knife Naoko Yamano - July 16, 1999 |publisher=Shonenknife.com |date=1999-07-16 |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl]

==Quotes==

"I have frogphobia. I just don't like frogs. There's just something... I really
don't like frogs." [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/03.22/c970322.txt |title=ISSUE 103 - CONSUMABLE - March 22, 1997 |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl]
"We've always enjoyed writing songs about everyday things. Besides, there are already
enough bands out there singing about pollution, war and poverty. While we all care very
much about those things, we also feel that music should be fun." 
"I really love good pop music. The Beatles, Beach Boys, The Jam, Redd Kross, Cheap Trick."
