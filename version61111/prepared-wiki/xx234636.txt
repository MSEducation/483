[[Rhamphogyne]]

CATEGORIES: Astereae, Monotypic plant genera

Rhamphogyne is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It belongs to the tribe of typical daisies (Astereae), and therein is placed in the subtribe Lagenophorinae by those that recognize it. This genus resembles plants from the related ragwort tribe (Senecioneae) in some respects.
The type species, Rhamphogyne rhynchocarpa, was thus initially placed in Abrotanella. Presently the genus is monotypic[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2009[/tpl] and restricted[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2009[/tpl] to Rodrigues in the Mascarene Islands. Lagenocypsela papuana of New Guinea was formerly placed here; though the relationships of Rhamphogyne remain obscure, it is more likely to be related to Apodocephala or some other Mascarene lineage[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2009[/tpl] .
