[[Lights from the Valley]]

CATEGORIES: 1978 albums, Chilliwack (band) albums, Mushroom Records albums

Lights from the Valley  is the seventh album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in the summer of 1978; the album marked the recording debut of Brian MacLeod with the band.
Intended to consolidate the success of the precedent  Dreams, Dreams, Dreams album, Lights from the Valley was somewhat of a disappointment, the financial problems at Mushroom Records due to litigation with the rock band Heart causing Lights from the Valley to be underpromoted.
The album's title derives from the lyrics of its lead single "Arms of Mary", the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver song being the first outside material Chilliwack had recorded since the outfit had changed their name from the Collectors in 1970. "Arms of Mary" became the fourth single by Chilliwack to reach the Billboard Hot 100 but like the band's precedent Hot 100 entrants it failed to become a major hit peaking at #67. Chilliwack would subsequently be absent from the Hot 100 for three years until the autumn of 1981 when the band would score its US Top 40 breakthrough with "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)".
