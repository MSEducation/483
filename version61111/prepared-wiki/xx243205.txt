The Jewish Socialist Federation (JSF) was a secular Jewish Yiddish-oriented organization founded in 1912 which acted as a language federation in the Socialist Party of America (SPA).  Many of the founding members of the JSF had previously been members of the Bund in Eastern Europe and sought to bring Bundist politics to the socialist movement in the USA. The JSF split in 1921 over the question of the Bolshevik Revolution, the majority disaffiliating from the SPA and the minority forming the Jewish Socialist Verband (JSV) and affiliating to the SPA.  The JSF subsequently joined the Workers Party of America (which would later become the Communist Party USA).
