However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network  was decommissioned within three years.

===2000s===

Days after the two largest companies in the network, Granada and Carlton, announced that they would merge, the regional names were withdrawn from networked programming in an "attempt to make ITV1 more marketable nationally with a single generic brand." (Scottish, which doesn't trail any of the network shows under any ITV1 branding, Grampian, Ulster and Channel, each kept their own names but used their own versions of the new look.) Tyne Tees Television was rebranded as ITV1 Tyne Tees on 28 October 2002. The name "Tyne Tees" only appeared before regional programmes; the rest of the time, only the "ITV1" name was shown. The Tyne Tees logo continued to appear after its own programmes. Graeme Thompson was appointed MD and Controller of Programmes at ITV Tyne Tees in 2004, having been appointed Director of Broadcasting in December 1997 and then Controller of Programmes in 2001. He became Dean for Arts, Design and Media at the University of Sunderland in June 2009.[tpl]cite web |title=Former ITV boss appointed university Dean |work=University of Sunderland |url=http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/newsevents/news/news/index.php?nid=668 |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl]
In 2004, Granada plc and Carlton Communications merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales. Tyne Tees became part of ITV plc, the largest television production company in the world, which now owned 90 percent of ITV.[tpl]cite web |title=ITV Tyne Tees |work=SignPost BSL |url=http://www.signpostbsl.com/about/tyneTeesTV.aspx |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl]
On 9 February 2005, Ofcom issued a proposed timetable for ending analogue terrestrial television transmissions as part of the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its analogue signal in 2008.[tpl]cite news |first=Thomas |last=Baldwin |title=Digital switchover confusion is resolved |work=Berwick Advertiser |url=http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=970&ArticleID=1654750 |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080222001428/http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=970&ArticleID=1654750 |archivedate = 2008-02-22[/tpl]
In September 2007, Executive Chairman of ITV plc Michael Grade announced that as part of ITV's five-year business strategy, Tyne Tees' newsroom would merge with Border Television.[tpl]cite news |first=Joanne |last=Oatts |title=ITV plans £40m cut in regional news |work=Digital Spy |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a75535/itv-plans-gbp40m-cut-in-regional-news.html |date=12 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-16[/tpl] Politicians have expressed concern, however, that the merger would affect the quality of news for southern Scotland, in particular, would fail if it lost its customised bulletins.[tpl]cite news |title=ITV 'can cut' regional programmes |date=25 September 2008 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7635011.stm |accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] The changes would mean that aside from the merged Border-Tyne Tees regional news and political programmes, the station could broadcast only 25 minutes of dedicated North East news every weekday. In October 2008, the National Union of Journalists threatened industrial action if ITV tried to force any of the changes without discussion.[tpl]cite news |title=Strike threat over ITV job cuts |work=BBC News |date=1 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7646179.stm |accessdate=2008-10-09[/tpl] Between December 2008 and February 2009, around 50 staff at the station were made redundant or accepted voluntary redundancy, including presenters, journalists and production staff. The new merged ITV Tyne Tees & Border service launched on 25 February 2009.
In March 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported that there was bullying at Tyne Tees that lasted for six years. One manager was accused of using inappropriate language about people with disabilities, women reporters, Chinese people and gypsies.  The manager was disciplined after one inquiry, but then more journalists complained about the same manager. The manager defended himself by claiming he was using black humour. He finally left the company with a pay-off of about £50,000. The original whistle blower left the company in 2006 and was paid £80,000 after threatening to take his case to an employment tribunal.[tpl]cite news |last=Carter |first=Helen |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/18/tyne-tees-itv-bullying|title=ITV Tyne Tees newsroom's six years of bullying scandals |work=The Guardian |date=18 March 2009|accessdate=2009-03-18[/tpl] Following this incident, ITV adopted an anti-bullying programme. However, in 2008 three female journalists complained about bullying, sexism, and racism. One woman claimed she was called a "Gypo" and was physically pushed aside by one of two male colleagues. The alleged bullies left Tyne Tees with substantial pay-offs. Two of the women received a combined sum of more than £110,000. An ITV spokesman advised that the total cost of the five bullying investigations is £1 million.

===2010s===

On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce fully separate regional news services for the ITV Tyne Tees and ITV Border regions were approved by OFCOM. On 16 September 2013 both ITV News Tyne Tees and Lookaround were restored as two single 30-minute regional programmes on weekdays with separate shorter daytime and weekend bulletins reintroduced.OFCOM sets out licence terms for ITV, STV, UTV and Channel 5, OFCOM, 23 July 2013 Both services continue to be produced and broadcast from the Gateshead studios.

==Studios==

Tyne Tees's original studios were located on City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and were converted from two furniture warehouses purchased by the company. These new studios formed the basis of Tyne Tees operations and featured the company offices. The location was deliberately chosen because of its proximity to the telephone exchange in Carliol Square. Television signals were relayed by land-line from the studios to the switching centre; a distance between the studios and the exchange greater than [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] would have significantly increased the cost of receiving the networked programmes from the other ITV stations.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=8[/tpl]
The complex initially contained four studios, with a fifth built in 1981 to accommodate productions for Channel 4.[tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |title=City Road |work=City Road |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/studios/cityroad.php |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl] Two nearby pubs, The Egypt Cottage and Rose & Crown, became affectionately known as Studio 5 because of the amount of time that the station's staff spent in them. Scottish and Newcastle Breweries offered to sell the adjacent The Egypt Cottage to the station when it was established, but Tyne Tees declined. However, the upstairs room was used as rehearsal space, and the pub would regularly feature in the '80s music show The Tube.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=27[/tpl]
thumb|250px|alt=A building complex with a car park|Tyne Tees has been based on the Gateshead bank of the River Tyne, just south of the mouth of the River Derwent, since July 2005.The complex continued until 2004 following the merger of Granada and Carlton to form ITV plc. As a result of the merger, ITV plc had (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to save money, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs.[tpl]cite news |title=Regional TV firm reveals job cuts |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3995669.stm |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl] A documentary about the move to new premises, The Big Move, reflected that over the years the staff numbers had dropped by about 800, and around 170 people would be moving to the new site.The Big Move, pr. &  dir. Sheila Matheson, ITV Tyne Tees, 3 July 2005.
Tyne Tees moved to Television House at The Watermark, a new business park adjacent to the MetroCentre in Gateshead, in 2005. The first broadcast from their new base took place on 2 July 2005.[tpl]cite web |title=All about ITV Tyne Tees |work=itvlocal.com |url=http://www.itvlocal.com/tynetees/information/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071007190930/http://www.itvlocal.com/tynetees/information/ |archivedate=7 October 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl] Along with the move, news reporters had to learn a range of new skills, such as editing their own reports. The new practices contrasted with early reporting, which had an average crew of five. The new equipment required only a camera operator, who could also operate sound equipment, and a reporter. Television House also acts as a base for ITV SignPost, Britain's biggest supplier of British Sign Language (BSL) services for television, video, CD-ROM, DVD, film and the Internet.[tpl]cite web |title=About Us |work=SignPost BSL |url=http://www.signpostbsl.com/about/ |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl]
In 2010, the studios at City Road along with the neighbouring pub, the Egypt Cottage, were demolished with plans for a residential development on the site.
Tyne Tees also has smaller studios and offices in Billingham, York, London and within the Media Centre at the University of Sunderland.

==Sub-regions==

Tyne Tees operated two sub-regional news programmes for the latter part of its life. An opt-out was used from the main North East Tonight bulletin that would feature news from each area.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowden|first=Andrew|title=North East Tonight and Primetime|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/news/primetime.php|work=City Road, previously the Tyne Tees Ident page|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System|accessdate=22 August 2011[/tpl] Contains images of separate services and detailed narrative on it.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowden|first=Andrew|title=North East Tonight 6|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/news/northeasttonight6.php|work=City Road, previously the Tyne Tees Ident page|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System|accessdate=22 August 2011[/tpl] Contains images of the opt out services and a detailed narrative from resident of region.

As part of a cost saving initiative within ITV plc, Michael Grade announced in 2007 that the regional news service would be reduced from seventeen distinct news programmes and services to nine, affecting all the sub-regional services. As a result, all Tyne Tees sub-opts were ceased immediately. As part of the same plans, he also announced that Tyne Tees would be merged with Border Television, subject to Ofcom approval which occurred the following year, resulting in one large programme covering both regions. The two services were demerged in September 2013.[tpl]cite news|title=ITV to merge regional newsrooms|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6991206.stm|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Douglas|first=Torin|title=Analysis: Ofcom's regional news proposals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7635822.stm|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 September 2008[/tpl]

==Station identification==

The station identification, or idents for short, of Tyne Tees varied over time, however most focused around the letters TTTV arranged in a box format. The launch ident featured a white anchor which then gradually turned into three letter T's alongside each other.[tpl]cite web|last=Walker|first=Hayden|title=Tyne Tees Television Idents|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/itvnortheast/idents.html|publisher=TVARK: The Online Television Museum|accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl] Website contains genuine video recordings of Tyne Tees Idents and continuity announcements, retrieved from old video recordings. This ident was accompanied by shortened version of the station's signature tune "Three Rivers Fantasy", a specially commissioned work by composer and arranger Arthur Wilkinson. The musical overture merged several regional folk tunes, such as "Water of Tyne", ending in The "Blaydon Races".[tpl]harvnb|Vall|2007|p=191[/tpl] Part of the medley  was based upon "The Sailor's Hornpipe".
The arrival of colour to ITV in 1969 led the companies to re-evaluate their on-screen identities. Tyne Tees replaced the triple-T logo in 1970 with the basic layout of two letter Ts above 'TV', an icon which would be incorporated into many future redesigns. Commentator Andrew Bowden observes that this interlinked design remains strongly associated with the company.[tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/presentation/ident1970.php |title=1970 Ident |work=City Road |publisher=Transdiffusion |date=18 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl] The ident also introduced the blue and yellow colour scheme that would remain in use for many years. The dark blue was popular amongst ITV contractors because it closely approximated to black on a black and white television set. The version of the logo included the word 'COLOUR', boasting the new technology.
In 1979, the ident was modified once more to remove the word colour and to give it a more dynamic form up. The result was the yellow logo flying down onto a black background before the outline extended out towards the screen. The name 'Tyne Tees' then flew in below and the background colour faded to blue.
The ident was again redesigned in 1988, in which the colour scheme was reversed and lighter shades of blue and yellow used. The form up was also altered to water flowing along sand, before the water divided into the Tyne Tees logo. The logo used computer animation for the first time.[tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/presentation/ident1988.php |title=1988 Ident |work=City Road |publisher=Transdiffusion |date=18 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl]
However this bold new look was not to last, as Tyne Tees adopted the 1989 ITV generic look. The look consisted of the top left corner of the logo being inserted into the 'V' segment of the ITV logo, with the station name placed underneath the Tyne Tees ITV logo. However, not every ITV station embraced the new logo, and Tyne Tees abandoned it in 1991.[tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/presentation/ident1989.php |title=1989 ITV Generic Ident |work=City Road |publisher=Transdiffusion |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl]
The generic ident were replaced with ones produced by Tyne Tees, featuring a large reflective block which the viewpoint rotated around, before panning up to reveal it is the Tyne Tees logo. The music from the previous generic look was retained. Three variations were used, one with a black background, one with a multi coloured background and one with a grey background, with each version taking over from its predecessor after only a few months of use.[tpl]cite news |first=|last=|title= Region's TV names culled from network |date=October 23, 2002 |newspaper=The Journal |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=Newcastle Chronicle & Journal Ltd |page=7[/tpl][tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/presentation/ident1991.php |title=1991 Ident |work=City Road |publisher=Transdiffusion |date=18 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl]
In 1992, Tyne Tees dropped their logo which they had previously been using and opted instead for four separate letters stacked stacked atop each other like previously accomplished spelling TTTV. The form up was over a grey background with a line moving across the screen, forming the letters as they went.
When Tyne Tees adopted the Channel 3 North East branding in September 1996, the traditional "TTTV" logo arrangement was dropped in favour of a large '3', with the region written to the left of the '3'. The name "Tyne Tees Television" was only seen in small letters at the bottom of the screen, whereas Yorkshire, who also adopted the Channel 3 brand a month later, was allowed to keep its 'chevron' logo alongside the '3'.[tpl]cite web|last=Piercy|first=Robert|title=Yorkshire TV Idents|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/itvyorkshire/idents.html|publisher=TVARK: The Online Television Museum|accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl] Website contains genuine video recording of the Channel 3 Yorkshire Ident, retrieved from donated video recordings. On-screen announcements said, "This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting as Channel 3 in the North-East." The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with "Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)" by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences. Following Granada's takeover, the Channel 3 branding was scrapped. As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: "People never really grasped the name - it didn't exactly trip off the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it has been there for years." All other regions in the network had retained their own identities rather than conforming to the generic 'Channel 3' brand.
The "TTTV" logo returned to television screens in a new form, "three-dimensional gold metallic lettering on a blue background", on 9 March 1998. This logo was more stylised than the 1992 equivalent and kept the music used throughout the '3' era. However, dual branding with the "ITV" name was introduced a year later, as part of the 1999 generic look.[tpl]cite web |first=Andrew |last=Bowden |title=1999 ITV Generic Idents |work=City Road |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/cityroad/presentation/ident1999.php |date=18 April 2007 |publisher=Transdiffusion |accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl] In this, the Tyne Tees logo was reduced to minuscule lettering in a blue box at the top of the screen, with emphasis being placed on the station name and ITV logo. However, this ident was supplemented by an ident to introduce local programming. This ident featured a new logo: a TTTV variant that was simplified to strictly vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines only. An arc of circles also adorned the top right corner. The ident itself featured pictures from the region. However, despite the new logo, the new logo wasn't applied to the generic idents.
From 28 October 2002, all network programmes were introduced with a generic ITV1 ident. Regional programming used a generic ident with the name Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until 2004, after which no regional idents existed. The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production end boards until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption.[tpl]cite web|last=Walker|first=Hayden|title=Tyne Tees Television End Boards|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/itvnortheast/endcaps.html|publisher=TVARK: The Online Television Museum|accessdate=15 October 2011[/tpl] Website contains examples of Tyne Tees endboards, gained from genuine video recordings. .

==Programming==

The station's founding executives George and Alfred Black used their theatrical background to produce a lot of light entertainment programming on Tyne Tees in the early years. One of the best known was The One O'Clock Show, a 40-minute variety show broadcast on weekdays.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=94[/tpl] After 1,098 editions and more than five years on air, the final show was broadcast in March 1964.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=104[/tpl] Some editions of The One O'Clock Show were produced by David Croft, who would go on to co-write many BBC situation comedies. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the Ned's Shed and Mary Goes to Market admags, as well as producing his first sitcom, Under New Management, set in a derelict pub in the North of England.[tpl]harvnb|Morgan-Russell|2004|p=11[/tpl]
The bulk of Tyne Tees' output has been its regional programming, consisting of news, current affairs and local interest. Its longest running news programme was Northern Life, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is ITV News Tyne Tees. Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating EastEnders being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following News at Ten on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, Around the House, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions.
Tyne Tees was obliged to contribute programming for the ITV network, although the bulk of network programming was purchased from the largest stations.[tpl]cite episode |title=Business |series=The Story of ITV |credits=presented by Melvyn Bragg |network=ITV |airdate=2005[/tpl] Tyne Tees contributed game shows to the network, including Crosswits (1985–98) and Chain Letters (1987–97). Tyne Tees became a prolific producer of children's entertainment for the ITV network in the 1970s and 1980s. From the late 1970s, it produced series such as The Paper Lads, Quest of Eagles, Barriers and Andy Robson. This continued into the 1980s with How Dare You!, and weekday pop-music show Razzamatazz, a pop programme that attracted many major recording artists to appear in a 17:15 slot.[tpl]harvnb|Hobson|2008|p=113[/tpl] Tyne Tees also managed the production of Get Fresh, a  Saturday morning show hosted in various weeks by different ITV regions.[tpl]cite web |title=Times of slime! |work=Tiswas Online |url=http://www.tiswasonline.com/history.php?article_ref=howdareyou |accessdate=2007-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Get Fresh |work=Gareth Jones' Official Website |url=http://www.garethjones.tv/getfresh3.html |accessdate=2007-10-01[/tpl] Super Gran, based on a series of books about a grandmother with superhuman powers, was also successful in the mid-1980s.[tpl]cite web |title=Hollywood On Tyne: Supergran |work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/hollywood_on_tyne/supergran.shtml |accessdate=2007-09-21[/tpl]

The second dramatisation, The Black Velvet Gown, was the number one drama of 1991, winning an Emmy Award for best TV drama.[tpl]cite web |title=Hollywood on Tyne: Catherine Cookson Dramas |work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/hollywood_on_tyne/cookson_dramas.shtml |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl] Long-running soap opera Coronation Street was briefly produced at Tyne Tees' City Road studios in 1963 while all of the studios at the show's home, Granada Television in Manchester, were occupied by a production of the opera Orpheus in the Underworld.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=46[/tpl] However, not all of the station's output has been successful.

Tyne Tees has also produced a wide range of music programming. One of the first attempts at reaching the teenage audience was Young at Heart, hosted by Jimmy Savile and Valerie Masters in 1960.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|1998|p=25[/tpl] In 1979, Tyne Tees launched two national series, Alright Now and Check it Out, the latter a mix of rock music and segments on youth-oriented social issues; among performances by established acts, the two shows offered early exposure to bands linked to the North East, notably Dire Straits and The Police.[tpl]cite news |first=Sam |last=Wonfor |title=Top of the shocks |work=The Journal |date=12 August 2006 |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/tm_objectid=17551622&method=full&siteid=50081&headline=top-of-the-shocks-name_page.html |accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Check It Out |work=BFI Film & TV Database |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/21004 |accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]
The most famous music show from the station, though, derived its name from the studios themselves. Produced for Channel 4, and first broadcast three days after the new station's launch in November 1982, The Tube acquired its name from the architecture of the public entrance to Studio 5, from where the show was broadcast, at the City Road complex. Under the direction of Gavin Taylor, The Tube filmed rock band Queen's 1986 Wembley concert for later broadcast and video and DVD release.[tpl]cite web |title=Queen Biography |work=Queen Online |url=http://www.queenonline.com/biog.htm |archivedate=15 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071115095618/http://www.queenonline.com/biog.htm |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl] Cameras bearing the Tyne Tees logo can be seen throughout the concert.Queen - The DVD Collection: Live At Wembley Stadium (Two Disc Set) 1986, dir.

Whereas The Tube featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, Tyne Tees' The Roxy, concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart. The show suffered, however, from not having a regular slot on the ITV network. Also, unlike The Tube, which had gained a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Newcastle for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the BBC's more established Top of the Pops in the more accessible London.[tpl]cite web |first=Steve |last=Williams |title=It's still Number One, it's... |work=Off the Telly |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/totp.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221023728/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/totp.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |date=August 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl]
