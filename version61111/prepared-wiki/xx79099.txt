The Jacksonville Suns are a minor league baseball team based in Jacksonville, Florida. The team is a member of the Southern League and is the class Double-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins Major League Baseball (MLB) team. Two teams named the Suns have played in Jacksonville since 1962: a class Triple-A International League team from 1962–1968, and the current Double-A team from 1970 to the present. From 1985–1990 the team was known as the Jacksonville Expos, when they were affiliated with the Montreal Expos MLB team.
The modern Suns club has played in the Southern League longer than any other, and its 41-year association with its city is the longest in Double-A baseball.[tpl]cite book |title= The Ultimate Minor League Baseball Road Trip: A Fan's Guide to AAA, AA, A, and Independent League Stadiums|last= Pahigian |first= Josh|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007|publisher= Globe Pequot|location= |isbn= 1-59921-024-X|page= 201|pages= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1DaQ8oNXuE0C&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= January 11, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20070103&content_id=150375&vkey=team4_t564&fext=.jsp&sid=t564|title= Jacksonville Baseball History|author= |year= 2010|work= jaxsuns.com|publisher= |accessdate=October 27, 2010[/tpl] The Suns won the International League title in 1968 and the Southern League championship in 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2010.

==History==

Jacksonville has had minor league baseball nearly every year since the early 20th century. From 1904 to 1961 the city was home to minor league teams such as the Jacksonville Jays, the Jacksonville Tars, and the Jacksonville Braves, as well as the Jacksonville Red Caps of the Negro Leagues. The former three teams all played in the South Atlantic League (the "Sally League"), which became the modern Southern League in 1964.
The first team known as the Jacksonville Suns began play in the Triple-A International League in 1962. The team had been founded in Havana, Cuba, where they were known as the Havana Sugar Kings. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959 the team relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, but soon folded; the franchise was bought by the Cleveland Indians, who moved it to Jacksonville as the Jacksonville Suns in 1962.[tpl]cite book |title= Ballparks of North America|last= Benson|first= Michael|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1989 |publisher= McFarland|location=|isbn= 0-89950-367-5 |page= 187|pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] The president was local baseball fixture Sam W. Wolfson, previously the owner of the Jacksonville Braves; the Suns replaced the Jacksonville Jets Sally League club. During this period a number of later Major League stars played for the Suns, including Tommy John, Nolan Ryan, and Tom Seaver, and the team won the International League championship in 1968. Following that season the team's parent club, the New York Mets, decided to relocate the team to Virginia, where they became the team now known as the Norfolk Tides.
Jacksonville was without baseball in 1969, but in 1970 a new Suns team began play in the Double-A Southern League. The team was affiliated with both the Montreal Expos and the Milwaukee Brewers in its inaugural season, with the Cleveland Indians in 1971, and then with the Kansas City Royals from 1972–1984. Affiliation switched back to the Expos from 1985–1990, during which period the team was known as the Jacksonville Expos. Since then it has been affiliated with the Seattle Mariners (1991–1994), the Detroit Tigers (1994–2000), the Los Angeles Dodgers (2001–2008), and most recently the Miami Marlins (2008–present)."Jacksonville Suns". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved October 27, 2010. The Suns have appeared in the Southern League playoffs 14 times, and won the championship in 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2010. The 2009 and 2010 championships were only the third time in Southern League history that a championship was successfully defended, both other times by the Montgomery Biscuits.[tpl]cite news|periodical=2011 Jacksonville Suns Official Souvenir Program (1st Edition)|last=Elliott|first=Jeff|title=In Defense of a Title|year=2011|publisher=Brut Printing[/tpl] The Suns have played in the Southern League longer than any other team, and their 41-year period in Jacksonville has become the longest continuous association between any city and a class Double-A team.
The Suns played at Wolfson Park from 1962 until it was demolished in 2002. Since 2003 they have played at Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, an 11,000 seat, $34 million field created as part of the Better Jacksonville Plan. Since moving to the Baseball Grounds the Suns have consistently led the Southern League in attendance, drawing over one million fans in their first four years. The Suns' success has led to speculation that the team may move to class Triple A in the future.
