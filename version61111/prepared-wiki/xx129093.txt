Nathaniel Merriweather Presents... Lovage: Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By is the 2001 debut and so far only album of Lovage. Lovage is a studio supergroup featuring Dan the Automator producing, Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles on vocals, Kid Koala on the turntables, Brandon Arnovick (as Astacio the Nudist) on guitar, Daniels Spills on keyboards and SweetP on harpsichord & noseflute.
Dan the Automator provides trip hop beats while the vocals mostly consist of Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles engaging in sultry and provocative dialogue. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the album is tongue-in-cheek. The album cover is an homage to Serge Gainsbourg's second album. The song "Sex (I'm A)" was originally written and performed by 1980s New Wave band Berlin. The Lovage version differs significantly from the original. The album features many references to Alfred Hitchcock, most notably the titles of the songs "To Catch a Thief", "Lifeboat", and "Strangers on a Train", which were all named after the movies, and contain re-dubbed excerpts. The album title itself also refers to an album Hitchcock appeared on in 1956 titled Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Music to Be Murdered By.
