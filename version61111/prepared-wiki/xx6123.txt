[[Koalang]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional languages, Science fiction in Poland

Koalang is a term coined by Janusz A. Zajdel, Polish science fiction writer. It is the language used by people in a totalitarian world called Paradyzja, in Zajdel's 1984 book of the same name."Sztuczne języki przeżywają renesans", Gazeta Wyborcza The "ko-al" portion in "koalang" comes from the Polish words kojarzeniowo-aluzyjny, meaning "associative-allusive"."Noc Kultury 2009"
Because Paradyzja was a space station, where all activity was tracked by automatic cameras and analysed (mostly) by computers, the people there created an Aesopian language, full of metaphors, impossible for computers to grasp. The meaning of every sentence depended on the context. For example, the phrase "I dreamt about blue angels last night" meant "I was visited by the police last night".
The software analyzing sentences was also self-learning, so one phrase used metaphorically to describe something should not be used in the same context again.
Zajdel paid a tribute to George Orwell's newspeak and to Aldous Huxley by naming one of the main characters Nikor Orley Huxwell.
In 1980s the youth magazine Na Przełaj printed lyrics of rock songs in a column titled "KOALANG", hinting that the texts of the songs have content concealed from censorship.
