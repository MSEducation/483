A stored-program computer is one which stores program instructions in electronic memory.[tpl]Citation | last = Allison | first = Joanne | title = Stored-program Computers | year = 1997 | url = http://www.computer50.org/mark1/stored.html | accessdate = 24 August 2011 [/tpl] Often the definition is extended with the requirement that the treatment of programs and data in memory be interchangeable or uniform.[tpl]cite book|author1=William F.

A computer with a Von Neumann architecture stores program data and instruction data in the same memory; a computer with a Harvard architecture has separate memories for storing program and data.[tpl]cite book|author=Daniel Page|title=A Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84882-255-9|page=148[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Mark Balch|title=Complete digital design: a comprehensive guide to digital electronics and computer system architecture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uFSRT-OIxyoC&pg=PA149|accessdate=18 May 2011|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-140927-8|page=149[/tpl]
Stored-program computer is sometimes used as a synonym for von Neumann architecture,[tpl]cite book|author=Daniel Page|title=A Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84882-255-9|page=153|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X1m1tNcfWQYC&pg=PA153[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Ivor Grattan-Guinness|title=Companion encyclopedia of the history and philosophy of the mathematical sciences|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2hDvzITtfdAC&pg=PA705|year=2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7396-6|page=705[/tpl] however Professor Jack Copeland considers that it is "historically inappropriate, to refer to electronic stored-program digital computers as 'von Neumann machines'".[tpl]Citation | last = Copeland | first = Jack | author-link = Jack Copeland | title = A Brief History of Computing: ENIAC and EDVAC | year = 2000 | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#ACE | accessdate = 27 January 2010 [/tpl] Hennessy and Patterson write that the early Harvard machines were regarded as "reactionary by the advocates of stored-program computers".[tpl]cite book|author1=John L.

The stored-program computer idea can be traced back to the 1936 theoretical concept of a universal Turing machine.[tpl]cite book|author=B. Jack Copeland|title=Colossus: the secrets of Bletchley Park's codebreaking computers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gfL4ky-TQOMC&pg=PA104|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284055-4|page=104[/tpl] Von Neumann was aware of this paper, and he impressed it on his collaborators as well.[tpl]cite book|author=Christof Teuscher|title=Alan Turing: life and legacy of a great thinker|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0IIsoRqw9hgC&pg=PA321|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-20020-8|page=321–322[/tpl]
Many early computers, such as the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, were not reprogrammable. They executed a single hardwired program. As there were no program instructions, no program storage was necessary. Other computers, though programmable, stored their programs on punched tape which was physically fed into the machine as needed.
In 1936 Konrad Zuse also anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.[tpl]citation |title=Electronic Digital Computers |journal=Nature |date=25 September 1948 |volume=162 |page=487 |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |accessdate=2009-04-10 |doi=10.1038/162487a0[/tpl]Susanne Faber, "Konrad Zuses Bemuehungen um die Patentanmeldung der Z3", 2000
The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM)[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/162487a0[/tpl] is generally recognized as world's first electronic computer that ran a stored program—an event that occurred on 21 June 1948.[tpl]cite book|author1=Rául Rojas|author2=Ulf Hashagen|title=The first computers: history and architectures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nDWPW9uwZPAC&pg=PA379|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-68137-7|page=379[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Daniel Page|title=A Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84882-255-9|page=158[/tpl] However the SSEM was not regarded as full-fledged computer, more a proof of concept that was built on to produce the Manchester Mark 1 computer, which was first put to research work in April 1949. On 6 May 1949 the EDSAC in Cambridge ran its first program, and due to this event, some consider it "the first complete and fully operational regular electronic digital stored-program computer".[tpl]cite book|author=Mike Hally|title=Electronic brains: stories from the dawn of the computer age|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DKcqJJacxxwC&pg=PA96|year=2005|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-09630-0|page=96[/tpl] It is sometimes claimed that the IBM SSEC, operational in January 1948, was the first stored-program computer;[tpl]cite book|author=Emerson W. Pugh|title=Building IBM: shaping an industry and its technology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Bc8BGhSOawgC&pg=PA136|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-16147-3|page=136[/tpl] this claim is controversial, not least because of the hierarchical memory system of the SSEC, and because some aspects of its operations, like access to relays or tape drives, were determined by plugging.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/978-3-642-15199-6_17[/tpl]
