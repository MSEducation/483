==Career==

Stuart got her start on The Doctors[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fB0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4286,1776049&dq=anna-stuart&hl=en|title=Leave of Absence|date=September 15, 1981|work=Google Search|publisher=Times-News|accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl] as lab technician Toni Ferra, a role she played from 1971 to 1977. Her character was involved in a triangle with her husband, Dr. Mike Powers, and old boyfriend Dr. Alan Stewart. She followed up her work on The Doctors originating the role of Dr. Gina Dante Lansing on rival soap General Hospital (1977-1978) where she was reunited with her former "The Doctors" co-star Gerald Gordon who played her brother, Dr. Mark Dante.
In 1981, she filled in for Maeve Kinkead on Guiding Light as Vanessa Chamberlain while Kinkead was on maternity leave.  It was during this time that Vanessa was a prime suspect in the murder of Diane Ballard. This was Stuart's first time playing a schemer on the soaps, and lead to playing other sophisticated trouble-maker on practically every New York based soap.

==="Another World"===

Stuart is best known for her role as Donna Love Hudson on Another World, which she played from January 1983 to November 1986 and again from February 1989 to the show's final episode in June 1999. The role of Donna Love was originally written as a very complex society snob (resembling the much missed Iris Cory), and as Stuart became more popular, a major romance was created for her with Michael Hudson (Kale Browne).  The Michael/Donna pairing remains one of the show's top supercouples.
When Stuart left the show in 1986, the role of Donna was recast with Philece Sampler, who had previously played Renee Dumonde DiMera Banning Marshall on Days of our Lives in the early 1980s. The recast however was panned by soap periodicals and after two years, Sampler's contract was terminated when Stuart expressed interest in returning to Another World.
Stuart also took medical sabbaticals from her role as Donna in 1990 and 1993, during which former "GL" and "AW" co-star Sofia Landon briefly played the role. In the early 1990s, Donna began a Mayâ€“December romance with Matthew Cory (Matt Crane), which proved to be very popular. As the 1990s went on, however, the character was written in such a way that longtime viewers no longer recognize Donna. Stuart was quoted in Soap Opera Digest after Another World's cancellation as saying that if the show had not been canceled in 1999, she would have left the role due to her disapproval regarding her character's direction.
After the show's cancellation, Stuart and several other cast members played their characters on the soap opera As the World Turns in an attempt to lure fans of Another World to watch that program (also a Procter & Gamble soap). Stuart's appearance was initially to have lasted for two episodes, but she ended up recurring on the show for almost three years. 

===After "Another World"===

In April 2002 Stuart filled in for former Another World co-star Linda Dano as Rae Cummings on One Life to Live while Dano was on sick leave.
Immediately following this, she began the role of Mary Smythe (Greenlee's neglectful and self-centered mother) on All My Children where she played opposite former Another World castmate Mark Pinter. Ms. Stuart holds the distiniction of being one of the few actors to have appeared on three soaps in one calendar year.  Originally meant to be written in for only a short stint, the character became integral in a plotline in which Mary revealed that Jackson Montgomery was Greenlee's natural father, making her the latest in the long line of rivals to that show's reigning queen, Erica Kane.  Mary had a brief romance with Adam Chandler before disappearing off the canvas in 2005.  She returned to the show for two episodes in 2009.
In 2010, Stuart debuted on the internet based soap opera Gotham.
Miss Stuart attended the 2012 Oscars with James Cromwell.  Miss Stuart attended the 2013 Emmys with James Cromwell. On January 1, 2014, Stuart and Cromwell married at the home of her former Another World co-star Charles Keating.
