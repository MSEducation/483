[[Chess variant]]

CATEGORIES: Chess variants

A chess variant is a game related to, derived from or inspired by chess. The difference from chess might include one or more of the following:
Regional chess games, some of which are older than Western chess, such as chaturanga, shatranj, xiangqi and shogi, are typically called chess variants in the Western world. They have some similarities to chess and share a common game ancestor.
The number of possible chess variants is virtually unlimited. Confining the number to published variants, D. B. Pritchard, author of The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, estimates there are well over 2000.Pritchard (2000), p. 8."Most published ones (but none described here), are, in truth, forgettable."  D. B. Pritchard (2000). Popular Chess Variants, p. 8.
In the context of chess problems, chess variants are called fantasy chess, heterodox chess or fairy chess. Some chess variants are used only in problem composition and not in actual play.

==Chess-derived games==

These chess variants are derived from chess by changing the board, setup, pieces or rules.

===Chess with different starting positions===

In these variants, the starting position is different, but otherwise the board, pieces and rules are the same. In most of such variants the pawns are placed on their usual place, but position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these chess variants is to nullify established opening knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position has usually less harmony and balance than standard chess position.Pritchard (2000), p. 18

===Chess with different forces===

Some chess variants use different numbers of pieces for White and Black. All pieces in these games are standard chess pieces, there are no fairy chess pieces.

===Chess with different boards===

In these variants the same pieces and rules as in chess are used, but the board is different: It can be smaller or larger, non-square overall[ref]
</ref> or based on triangle or hexagon cells (instead of square cells), or even modular regarding shape or number of cells; it can even be extra-dimensional. The movement of pieces in some variants is modified in concurrence with the unusual property of the gameboard.

There are special rules for castling depending on the board. Polgar recommended these chess variants to train creativity and to speed up the game.

===Chess with unusual rules===

===Chess with incomplete information or elements of chance===

In these chess variants, luck or randomness sometimes plays a role. Still, like in poker or backgammon, good luck and bad luck even out over the long-term with clever strategy and consideration of probabilities being decisively important.

===Multimove variants===

In these variants one or both players can move more than once per turn. The board and the pieces in these variants are the same as in standard chess.

===Multiplayer variants===

These variants arose out of the desire to play chess with more than just one other person.

===Single-player variants===

Similar to card solitaires, there are a few chess variants for a single player. In difference to chess puzzles, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these variants are similar to permutation chess problems, for example the game Queen's Quadrille, which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998.Queen's Quadrille All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4×4 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen to one of the corners, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game Hippodrome, which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003.Hippodrome The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.

===Chess with unusual (fairy) pieces===

Most of the pieces in these chess variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess. However, these variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.

====Rook+knight and bishop+knight compounds====

There are a number of chess variants which use rook+knight and bishop+knight compound pieces. Several different names have been given to them. The rook and knight compound (R+N) is named chancellor, marshall, empress etc.The Piececlopedia: The Rook-Knight Compound by Fergus Duniho and David Howe. The bishop and knight compound (B+N) is called archbishop, cardinal, janus, paladin, princess, Prime Minister etc.The Piececlopedia: Bishop-Knight Compound by Fergus Duniho and David Howe. To adapt two new pieces, the orthogonal board is usually extended to 10×8 or 10×10 with two additional pawns added.

===Chess hybrids===

The pieces in these chess variants are borrowed from both chess and another game. The game goal and rules are either the same or very similar to those in chess. However, these chess variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.

===Games inspired by chess===

These chess variants are very different from chess and may be classified as abstract strategy board games instead of chess variants (by restrictive, proper definition).

==Chess-related historic and regional games==

Some of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess. The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.
