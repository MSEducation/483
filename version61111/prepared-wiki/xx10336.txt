Roberto Clemente Walker (August 18, 1934 – December 31, 1972) was a Puerto Rican professional baseball player. He was a Major League Baseball right fielder who played 18 seasons for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 through 1972. He was a National League, Most Valuable Player once, All-Star twelve times (15 games),Sportsdata. Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game. "There were two games a year from 1959 to 1962" ... "all players who were named to the AL or NL roster were credited with one appearance per season."

In 1972, Clemente got his 3,000th major league hit.
Clemente was involved in charity work in Puerto Rico and Latin American countries during the off seasons, often delivering baseball equipment and food to those in need. He died in an aviation accident on December 31, 1972, while in route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua.
Clemente was inducted posthumously to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973, becoming the first Latin American to be enshrined. His death established the precedent that as an alternate to the five year retirement period, a player must be deceased at least 6 months to be eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame.
Clemente is the first Latino player to win a World Series as a starter (1960), to receive a National League MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971).

==Early life==

Roberto Clemente was born in Barrio , San Antón,Not to be confused with the better known barrio San Antón in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Carolina,Baseball Hall of Famers: Roberto Clemente. Robert Kingsbury.

Clemente showed interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. He attended Vizcarondo High School in Carolina. During his first year in high school, he was recruited by Roberto Marin to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after Marin saw Clemente playing baseball in barrio San Antón of his hometown Carolina.[tpl]cite book|quote=For the next two years, Clemente played for the Sello Rojo softball team.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|page=20|chapter=Where Are You Going, Momen?[/tpl] He was with the team two years as shortstop.

==Baseball career==

===Puerto Rican Baseball (1952–1954)===

Clemente's professional career began when Pedrín Zorilla offered Clemente, 18, a contract which he signed on October 9, 1952, with the Cangrejeros de Santurce, a winter league team and franchise of the LBBPR.[tpl]cite book|quote="Well, Marin", said señor Zorilla, "we can give him $400 bonus and maybe $ 40.00 a week until he learns to wear a uniform."|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn= 0-15-307557-0|page=25|chapter=Tell the Man I Will Sign[/tpl] He was a bench player during his first campaign but was promoted to the Santurce Cangrejeros ("Crabbers") starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the Crabbers leadoff hitter. While Clemente was playing in the LBBPR, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with the team's Triple-A subsidiary.[tpl]cite book|quote="Roberto", said Pedrin Zorilla, "I have spoken with Mr. Campanis. The Dodgers would like to sign you to a contract with their Triple-A team in Montreal. They will pay you a signing bonus of $10,000 and a salary of $5,000 for the year"|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|page=33|chapter=Wearing the Uniform[/tpl]

===Minor League Baseball (1954)===

Clemente moved to Montreal to play with the Montreal Royals after signing with the Dodgers on February 19, 1954. The climate and language differences affected him early on, but he received the assistance of his teammate Joe Black, who was able to speak Spanish. Clyde Sukeforth, a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates, noticed that Clemente was being used as a bench player for the Royals and discussed the possibility of drafting Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates with the team's manager, Max Macon.[tpl]cite book|quote="I noticed you haven't been playing Clemente much." Sukeforth smiled across the dinner table at Max Macon. The two men had known each other for years. There was no sense in trying to fool each other. "Well, I don’t care if you never play him" continued the Pittsburgh scout. "We're going to finish last, and we're going to draft him number one."|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn= 0-15-307557-0|page=41|chapter=It's For Your Own Good[/tpl] Clemente hit .257 in 87 games that summer. The Pirates selected Clemente as the first selection of the rookie draft that took place on November 22, 1954.

====The 1950s====

Clemente debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 17, 1955, in the first game of a double header against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[tpl]cite book|quote=It was Sunday, April 17, 1955, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were playing the first game of a double-header against the Brooklyn Dodgers....

He noted that, during his upbringing, he was taught to never discriminate against someone based on ethnicity.[tpl]cite book|quote="I don’t believe in color," Roberto said. "I believe in people. I always respect everyone and thanks to God my mother and my father taught me never to hate, never to dislike someone based of their color.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente[/tpl]
Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latino who knew very little English, and of mixed-African descent. The year before, the Pirates had become the fifth team in the National League and ninth in the majors to break the baseball color line when they hired Curt Roberts who debuted with the team. This was seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line with the Dodgers.SportsCentury: Roberto Clemente Upon arriving in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended Clemente and helped him adjust to life in the majors, as well as to get used to life in Pittsburgh.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tMtRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6m0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4054,5029992&dq=curt+roberts&hl=en|title=Roberts Bucs' forgotten pioneer|last=Bouchette|first=Ed|date=May 15, 1987|work=Pittsburgh Post–Gazette|pages=19, 22|accessdate=March 10, 2012[/tpl]
During the middle of the season, Clemente was involved in a car accident due to a drunk driver; this caused him to miss several games with an injury in his lower back.[tpl]cite book|quote=To make matters worse, Roberto had to sit out many games because of pain in his lower back.

=====Marine Corps Reserve=====

During the off season, Clemente played with the Santurce Crabbers in the Puerto Rican baseball winter league, where he was already considered a star.[tpl]cite book|quote=Once again he was playing for the Santurce Crabbers. In the winter league he was an established star.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente[/tpl] He was traded to the Criollos de Caguas team (Caribbean baseball) and played for them during the 1957–1958 season. The Pirates experienced several difficult seasons through the 1950s, although they did manage a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948.
During the winter season of 1958–59, Clemente didn't play winter baseball on the Caguas team; instead, he joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He spent his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received his basic training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion."Clemente, The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero"; By: David Maraniss; p. 88; Simon & Schuster; ISBN 978-0-7432-1781-1 The rigorous training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles had disappeared.

His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defense during the course of the season earned him his first selection to National League All-Star roster (reserve player). He participated in both of the two All-Star games that were played that season.Sportsdata: Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game, 1959–1962, "all players who were named to the AL or NL roster were credited with one appearance per season."

During 1961 spring training, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler,[tpl]cite book|quote=Now, in the spring of 1961, he made another improvement.

During the 1961 season, Clemente was selected as the National League starting right fielder in the All-Star game. He hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run. With the American League ahead 4–3 in the tenth inning, Clemente hit a double to give the National League a decisive 5–4 win.[tpl]cite book|quote=Then he brought his bat around and smashed a line drive to right field.

During the course of the winter league, Clemente was injured and only participated as a pinch hitter in the league's All-Star game.

This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted an average of .257.

In 1967, he registered a career high .357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs.

====The 1970s====

The 1970 season was the last one that the Pittsburgh Pirates played in Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente noted that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, "I spent half my life there."[tpl]cite book|quote=On June 28, 1970, the Pittsburgh Pirates played their last game at Forbes Field.

A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request.[tpl]cite book|quote=A young Puerto Rican businessman named Juan Jiménez presented Roberto with a scroll containing 300,000 signatures from the people of Puerto Rico.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|page=107|chapter=I Don't Have The Words[/tpl][tpl]cite book|quote=At Roberto's request, thousands of dollars were donated to help the crippled children at Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|page=108|chapter=I Don't Have The Words[/tpl]
During the 1970 campaign, Clemente compiled an average of .352; the Pirates won the National League East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. In the offseason, Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and was subjected to a surgery.[tpl]cite book|quote=That winter, Roberto had other concerns as well. Don Melchor fell seriously ll and had to have surgery.|author=Paul Rober Walker|title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente|year=1988|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|isbn=0-15-307557-0|pages=111–112|chapter=I Don't Have The Words[/tpl]
In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the National League pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore had won 100 games and swept the American League Championship Series, both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente had won a World Series with the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente batted a .414 average (12 hits in 29 at-bats), performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2–1 seventh game victory. Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player award.
=====3,000th hit===== 
Frustrated and struggling with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games in 1972 and hit .312 in his final season. On September 30, he hit a double off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th hit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/community/clemente.jsp|title=Roberto Clemente Award|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2007-12-09[/tpl] It was the last at-bat of his career during a regular season, though he did play in the 1972 NLCS playoffs against the Cincinnati Reds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Clemente_Roberto.html|title=Clemente quietly grew in stature|author=Larry Schwartz|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2007-12-09[/tpl] In the playoffs, he batted .235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game ever was at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in the fifth game of the playoff series. He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series champions.
=====Anglicization of Name===== 
During much of his career, Clemente was often called by the Anglicized name of "Bob Clemente" by the media and in baseball merchandise such as baseball cards, even though he clearly preferred being called by his given first name of Roberto. According to contemporary accounts, "Roberto" was too exotic of a name at the time. Although Clemente was largely called Roberto by the late 1960s, he was called Bob as late as 1972, when he collected his 3,000th hit and Pirates announcer Bob Prince referred to him as "Bobby" while calling the game for KDKA.

Indeed, while being asked by a reporter about when he would get his 3,000th career hit in July 1971, Clemente's response was "Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfuckArQ_dQ|title=Roberto Clemente Prophecy|publisher=YouTube|date=1973-11-08|accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] Clemente's older step brother, Luis, died on December 31, 1954 and his step sister a few years later.
At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including most triples in a game (three) and hits in two consecutive games (ten).[tpl]cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/pit/history/single_game_records.jsp|title=Pirates Single Game Records|publisher=Pittsburgh Pirates|accessdate=2008-01-09[/tpl] Clemente also tied the record for most Gold Glove Awards won among outfielders with twelve, which he shares with Willie Mays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_ggnl.shtml|title=Gold Glove National League Outfielders|work=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2008-01-09[/tpl] He also is the only player to have hit a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://leftfield.homestead.com/roberto_clemente.html|title=Roberto Clemente Presente!|publisher=leftfield.com|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] He accomplished this historic baseball-event on July 25, 1956 in a 9–8 Pittsburgh win against the Chicago Cubs, at Forbes Field. In addition, he was one of four players to have ten or more Gold Gloves and a lifetime batting average of .317.

==Hall of Fame==

On March 30, (1973), the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 of the 420 available votes, or 92% of the vote. Clemente's Hall of Fame plaque had originally read "Roberto Walker Clemente". In 2000, the plaque was recast to express his name in the proper Hispanic format, "Roberto Clemente Walker".[tpl]cite web|title=Roberto Clemente Plaque is Recast to Correct Cultural Inaccuracy; New One Travels to Puerto Rico (November 2000)|url=http://209.23.71.87/whats_new/press_releases/2000/pr2000_09_19.htm| publisher=National Hall of Fame and Museum|date=2000-09-18|accessdate=2008-02-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030428013259/http://209.23.71.87/whats_new/press_releases/2000/pr2000_09_19.htm|archivedate=April 28, 2003[/tpl]
