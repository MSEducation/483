==Early life==

Born in Leongatha in southern Gippsland, Roughead played for the Gippsland Power. After the under 18's season finished Roughead helped his local team, Leongatha win the WGLFL premiership.

==AFL career==

Drafted by Hawthorn with 2nd overall pick in the 2004 AFL Draft, Roughead and Lance Franklin were keys to Hawthorn rebuilding under new coach Alastair Clarkson.
He received an AFL Rising Star nomination in round 19, 2005.
In 2007, Roughead showed his true skills after scoring 40 goals in 22 games. Although kicking 36 points resulted in an accuracy of just 52.6 percent that year, Roughhead showed he could hold down a key forward position.
So far in his career Roughead has shown he has tremendous athletic capapbility with a huge leap and clean marking hands. In season 2008, Roughead fell under the radar of teams with all the focus on Lance Franklin. Roughead kicked 75 goals from 25 matches. Despite having the ability to go into defence, Roughead has become a regular Centre Half Forward for Hawthorn. In the 2008 Grand final Roughead struggled to get the ball at times but finished with a respectable 2 goals. Jarryd Roughead is well known for his consistent assists to other forwards and his endurance.
Roughead kicked a career high 8 goals against Carlton on the MCG during the 2009 season.
In 2011, Roughead played in the ruck and forward due to Hawthorn's injuries. In Round 12, against Geelong, Jarryd Roughead ruptured his achilles during the final quarter. Roughead was stretched off the ground and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2011 AFL season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/jarryd-roughead-suffers-season-ending-achilles-injury/story-e6frf9jf-1226073650605 |title=Jarryd Roughead suffers season-ending achilles injury |first=Glenn |last=McFarlane |work=Sunday Herald Sun |date=12 June 2011[/tpl] He had kicked 16 goals for the season.
Roughead spent the majority of the 2012 season sharing the ruck duties with David Hale. When not in the ruck he was positioned in the forward line, but also assisted in defence as the need arose.  His ability to return from an achilles injury and play in the ruck whilst still kicking 41 goals silenced many doubters.
His basketball background has seen him develop very clever use of the 'tap' over his career.  This is used in general play to the benefit of team mates in his vicinity as well as to his own advantage around goals.
In 2013 he was awarded the Coleman Medal for being the leading goalkicker with 68 goals after the home and away season.  He managed to achieve this whilst spending considerable time in the ruck as well as in the midfield alongside his rucking partners, where his considerable size caused trouble for the opposition and his quick handpassing resulted in many clearances. Roughead kicked 2 goals in the Qualifying Final against Sydney, and another 2 goals in the Grand Final against Fremantle, which resulted in his second premiership medal in Hawthorn's win.  He finished the season with 72 goals in what has been widely regarded as his best season to date.
