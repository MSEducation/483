CATEGORIES: Ophioglossaceae

Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 25-30 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae, of the order Ophioglossales.  The name Ophioglossum comes from the Greek, and means "snake-tongue". eFloras: Ophioglossum . accessed 2.14.2014.
Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats. 

==Description==

Adders-tongues are so-called because the spore-bearing stalk  is thought to resemble a snake's tongue. Each plant typically sends up a small, undivided leaf blade with netted venation, and the spore stalk forks from the leaf stalk, terminating in sporangia which are partially concealed within a structure with slitted sides. 
When the leaf blade is present, there is not always a spore stalk present, and the plants do not always send up a leaf, sometimes going for a year to a period of years living only under the soil, nourished by association with soil fungi.
The plant grows from a central, budding, fleshy structure with fleshy, radiating roots. 

==Taxonomy==

Ophioglossum has the highest chromosome count of any known living organism, with 1,260 chromosomes.[tpl]cite book|author=Gerardus J. H.

In comparison, most species have far fewer chromosomes (e.g. humans have 46). Biomysteries Blog: "Largest Chromosome number of Ophioglossum"
