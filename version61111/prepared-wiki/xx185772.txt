[[MCFD2]]

Multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MCFD2 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zhang B, Cunningham MA, Nichols WC, Bernat JA, Seligsohn U, Pipe SW, McVey JH, Schulte-Overberg U, de Bosch NB, Ruiz-Saez A, White GC, Tuddenham EG, Kaufman RJ, Ginsburg D | title = Bleeding due to disruption of a cargo-specific ER-to-Golgi transport complex | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 220–5 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12717434 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ng1153 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Deka N, Wong E, Matera AG, Kraft R, Leinwand LA, Schmid CW | title = Repetitive nucleotide sequence insertions into a novel calmodulin-related gene and its processed pseudogene | journal = Gene | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–34 |date=Mar 1989 | pmid = 2463956 | pmc =  | doi =10.1016/0378-1119(88)90084-4  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: MCFD2 multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=90411| accessdate = [/tpl] Mutations in MCFD2 cause the combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII (F5F8D), a recessive bleeding disorder. MCFD2 and ERGIC-53 (or LMAN1) form a protein complex and serve as a cargo receptor to transport FV and FVIII from the ER to the Golgi body. Mutations in LMAN1 gene (encoding ERGIC-53 or LMAN1) also cause F5F8D.
