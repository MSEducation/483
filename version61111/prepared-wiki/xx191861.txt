Phineas Banning High School is located in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and is a part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

==History==

Banning High School was renamed in honor of General Phineas Banning when a newer facility at Avalon and Pacific Coast Highway was opened in 1926. The 'old' red brick building was a landmark in the Wilmington town for many years. The ivy covered brick building suffered damage in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and was torn down in 1973.
For three years, classes were held in bungalows while the new building was being constructed. In fall 1975, the new building was opened on the grounds with a Lakme Avenue address. Along with the new building, a new gym and swimming pool were added to the campusâ€”the home of the Banning Pilots.
After several years of repeated failure to improve its unsatisfactory performance, Banning High School entered LAUSD's Public School Choice process in 2012,http://publicschoolchoice.lausd.net/psc-40-high-schools which allowed teacher teams to develop reform plans. As a result, the Banning High School campus is slated to be divided between two school, Banning High School (since state law prevents failing schools from changing their names), and the Banning Academies of Creative and Innovative Sciences (BACIS),http://www.bhsacademy.org a teacher-designed school with a design based on current educational research. BACIS will open as a Small Learning Community in Fall 2013. It will become a separate school on the shared campus in Fall 2014.
