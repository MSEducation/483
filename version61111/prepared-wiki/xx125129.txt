Webb City High School, or WCHS, is a public high school in the Webb City R-7 located in Webb City, Missouri USA.

==Location and campus==

The school's campus, located at 621 North Madison, Webb City, Missouri is currently housed in a one-story structure originally built in 1968.  It was expanded in 1971, 1975, 1983, 1987, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2004, and 2009.  The most recent addition added a new library to the high school and the old library was torn down to make more space and new classrooms. A skylight was put in along with older classrooms having doors added.  Adjacent to the main building are several annex structures including a football stadium, tennis courts, a soccer field and an indoor swimming pool.

==Controversy==

WCHS was the center of a gay rights controversy when Brad Mathewson, a recent transfer student, was suspended from school for wearing gay pride shirts on two separate occasions in November 2004.[ref]
