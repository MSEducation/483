The Toy Town Museum is located on the Fisher-Price campus in East Aurora, New York.  It was conceived by a group of local citizens in East Aurora and Western New York to help celebrate the toy making heritage in the area.  There have been over 100 toy companies throughout Western New York over the past 100 years[tpl]cite web | url = http://toytownusa.com/about | title = About Toy Town Museum | accessdate = 2008-04-30 [/tpl] and the museum's exhibitions attempt to educate and entertain visitors.
