MyNotex is a free software dedicated to notetaking. It offers several features for redaction, classification and search according to certain criteria. Its interface resembles a text editor and has several panes that give an overview of how content is organized.

==How it works==

The basic unit of content is a note, and has several characteristics: title, date, keywords (tags), attachments (compressed in a ZIP archive) and text that can be formatted and encrypted.
Notes are grouped in subjects. A side pane lets you select a subject to view all notes that are part of it, sorted by date or title. Once displayed, a note can be directly edited.
Finally, a bottom pane can be used to search notes by subjects, title, content, attachment names, date or keywords.

==Features==

MyNotex offers various text formatting options (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, color, highlighting, font size and name, paragraph alignment and indentation), image insertion, three title levels as well as automatic recognition of lists (ordered or not) and links (to local files, web addresses, e-mails or another note). Several keyboard shortcuts are set to assist in writing and formatting (like insertion of the current date and time in a new line or restoration of default font).
Content can be written directly in the software or imported from various sources:
In any case, the text of a note can be encrypted with AES.
As for exportation, it supports HTML and MyNotex' native format. Also, a note can be copied as LaTeX or opened with OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice or the default web browser, which allows among others to print content. Finally, it's possible to send the text of a note by email.
Various organizing features allow to move a note from one subject to another, add comments to each subject, remove content, etc. In addition to search facilities and interface browsing via panes, it's possible to access notes through bookmarks.

==Synchronization==

Two files of MyNotex can be kept synchronized. Thus, changes made to one file will result in changes to the other during the process of synchronization. All types of changes are tracked (new, changed and deleted subjects, notes and attachments).
Files can therefore be modified offline and then be updated via a local network or the Internet (for instance through a cloud service).
MyNotex can be set to perform automatic synchronization when a file is opened or closed.

==Technical design==

MyNotex is written in Object Pascal and is developed using Lazarus. It runs on GNU/LinuxDeveloped using Lazarus, it could theoretically be compiled for Windows and Mac OS too. and is compiled for GNOME.
MyNotex stores notes in a SQLite database, but attachments (any type of file format) are compressed and saved in a folder in the same location as the database.
