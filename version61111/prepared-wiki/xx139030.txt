Kysnesstranda is a village in western Jondal municipality, Norway.
From 1837 Kysnesstranda was administratively a part of Strandebarm municipality, whose territory was located on both sides of the Hardangerfjord. In 1826 the district west of the fjord was separated from Strandebarm to create the new municipality Jondal; however, the village Kysnesstranda and the surrounding district remained a part of Strandebarm despite its location in Jondal.
On 1 January 1964, when Strandebarm municipality was to be incorporated into its neighbor Kvam, Kysnesstranda was moved to Jondal. Kysnesstranda had 100 inhabitants at the time.
