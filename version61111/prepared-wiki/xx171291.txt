==History==

The original call letters were WRKE when the station signed on in April 1957. In 1959, the call sign became WHYE ('Y' Radio) with a very slick top-40 presentation. To get attention, the first day of programming featured the song "The Old Mummer's Strut", by The Nu Tornadoes, played continuously. The success was immediate. However, WHYE was hampered by its daytime-only license against WROV-AM's 24-hour broadcast day, and by July 1964 had flipped to country. They saw success again for a year or so until WSLS changed to full-time country music programming. In 1966, WHYE became WPXI, again a Top-40 format slickly presented, And again, hampered by being daytime only. WPXI sputtered to an end in 1968. The next format and call letters were R&B and WTOY.
On July 1, 1991, now owned by Perception Media, 910 became the first contemporary Christian radio station in the valley.  Now known as "3WR - Family Radio".  During this time, the station hosted a widely popular Christian Rock show called "Lightswitch."  Originally, the show ran on Saturday nights, but switched to late Friday nights. In 1994, with the arrival of competing FM contemporary Christian formats (Spirit FM/PAR), 3WR switched to a Southern Gospel format.  This format proved successful for a number of years.  By 2008, 3WR had become increasingly talk oriented which lead to the News/Talk format change the following year.

==Format flip==

As of April 1, 2009, WWWR dropped its Southern Gospel format for News/Talk as "FOX Radio 910".  The current format features popular syndicated talk show hosts Laura Ingraham, Dr. Laura, Dan Patrick, Dennis Miller and hourly reports from FOX News.
