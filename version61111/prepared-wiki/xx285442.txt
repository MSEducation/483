==History==

===Formation and The Space Between EP (2011–2012)===

Intervals was formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2011, as a creative outlet for guitarist Aaron Marshall. He recorded and programmed all the parts for The Space Between himself in his home studio; it was mixed and mastered by Adam "Nolly" Getgood of Periphery and released independently, on December 20th 2011. As well as this, Aaron made an attempt to form a full band (including a vocalist), with the intention of turning Intervals into a touring act; the band however did not find a suitable vocalist and so decided to remain as an instrumental band for the foreseeable future.

===In Time EP (2012–2013)===

Fall 2012 saw the release of their 2nd EP In Time on October 30, 2012. The EP featured guest solos from Olly Steele (Monuments) and David Maxim Micic (Destiny Potato). This EP received a 4.0/Excellent rating via Sputnik Music and stated that the band were "a very talented instrumental progressive metal band."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/52919/Intervals-In-Time/ |title=Intervals - In Time |publisher=SputnikMusic.com |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] The band released a music video for "Epiphany" on April 25, 2013 via Guitar World promotion and YouTube.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/exclusive-intervals-premiere-epiphany-music-video |title=Exclusive: Intervals Premiere "Epiphany" Music Video |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] Following the success of In Time, the band gained endorsement deals from Ernie Ball Music Man, Pearl Drums, Meinl Cymbals, Toontrack, Hufschmid Guitar Picks, InTune Guitar Picks, and Gruv Gear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/guest-list-intervals-guitarist-aaron-marshall-picks-his-five-favorite-pieces-gear |title=Guest List: Intervals Guitarist Aaron Marshall Picks His Five Favorite Pieces of Gear |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] Aaron Marshall also released playthroughs and lessons for certain songs from the EP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/intervals-aaron-marshall-mata-hari-intro-riff-lesson |title=Intervals: Aaron Marshall "Mata Hari" Intro Riff Lesson |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/exclusive-play-through-video-intervals-alchemy |title=Exclusive Play-Through Video: Intervals — "Alchemy" |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl]

The band released Semesky's vocal debut in the form of new single ‘Ephemeral’ via RevolverMag.com, as well as revealing that the new album would be titled A Voice Within.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/?p=56184 |title=Exclusive: Intervals Premiere New Song, "Ephemeral" |publisher=RevolverMag.com |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl] Due to the need for Semesky to focus entirely on his vocal performance live, the band hired Henry Selva (formerly of The Human Abstract) as live bassist for their upcoming tours. Semesky provided comments on the announcement: [tpl]quote|text="I'm extremely happy to announce that I am the singer of Intervals. I joined the band on bass in early 2013, but after writing and experimenting with vocals over demos of the band's new material, the four of us knew that that was the direction we were meant to go. I feel so blessed to be a part of such a talented group of musicians and I'm extremely proud of the album we all worked so hard on. We can't wait for you all to hear it!"[/tpl]
