Venusaur, known in Japan as [tpl]nihongo|Fushigibana|フシギバナ|[/tpl], is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Venusaur first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise.

==Concept and characteristics==

Venusaur was one of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Originally called "Fushigibana" in Japanese, which is a combination of the word for mystery (fushigi) and the word for flower (hana). Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html |archivedate=2008-09-13[/tpl] As a result it was renamed Venusaur, which IGN wrote is a combination of "venus" from the plant venus flytrap and "saur" from dinosaur.Pokemon Blue Guide & Walkthrough - Game Boy - IGN
Venusaur, known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer.Pokédex: It is able to convert sunlight into energy. As a result, it is more powerful in the summertime.
