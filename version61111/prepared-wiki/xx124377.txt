==Plot==

Anzu Mochizuki is an average high school student. On the day of her 17th birthday, her mother tells her that she is the successor of the family's title as thiefs and that she is the next Thief Apricot. She'll have to combine her two lives and she'll meet some boys that will make her think which of the two sides of her life she should choose...

==Gameplay==

Kaitou Apricot's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a "decision point" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two or three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. Sometimes the player will have to play some minigames to continue with the story.
The main mechanic of the game is based around the theft of apricots and indeed all forms of soft fruit.
