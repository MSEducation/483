It was originally a "coon song", with African-American caricatures on the sheet music and "coon" references in the lyrics. The music also features similar rhythms to the short piano piece "Le Petit NÃ¨gre" by Claude Debussy from 1909.

In Charles Ives's composition Central Park in the Dark, "In the Good Old Summer Time," it is quoted frequently.
