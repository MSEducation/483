Live at the Forum is a two-part limited edition of Killing Joke's performance at London's Forum venue, recorded on 3 and 4 October 2008 and released mid-October 2008.
The opening night's set, documented on the Part 1 release, was primarily dedicated to the band's first two albums, 1980's Killing Joke (1980) and 1981's What's THIS For...!. The second night's set, included on the Part 2 release, focused on 1994's Pandemonium and singles from the 1979â€“1985 era.
For this tour, Killing Joke reformed their original line-up for the first time since 1982: singer Jaz Coleman, guitarist Kevin "Geordie" Walker, bassist Martin "Youth" Glover (who had not played in the band since the recording sessions for 2003's self-titled album), and drummer Paul Ferguson (who had last played on 1986's Brighter Than a Thousand Suns).
Each release comprises three compact discs, two of which contain the live recordings, with the third one featuring exclusive photos from the gig. Both parts are limited to pressings of 1,500 copies, and are only available at concertlive.co.uk.
Both parts were reissued in February 2009, now called The Gathering 2008. The two parts can be ordered individually or as a single limited edition box set http://www.plastichead.com/catalogue.asp?ex=fitem&verb=F&target=EWO039BOX.
