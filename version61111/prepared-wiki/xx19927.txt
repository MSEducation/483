[[Multivariate random variable]]

CATEGORIES: Probability theory, Multivariate statistics, Algebra of random variables

In mathematics, probability, and statistics, a multivariate random variable or random vector is a list of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value.  The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because there may be correlations among them — often they represent different properties of an individual statistical unit (e.g. a particular person, event, etc.).  Normally each element of a random vector is a real number.
Random vectors are often used as the underlying implementation of various types of aggregate random variables, e.g. a random matrix, random tree, random sequence, random process, etc.

==Operations on random vectors==

Random vectors can be subjected to the same kinds of algebraic operations as can non-random vectors: addition, subtraction, multiplication by a scalar, and the taking of inner products.

==Expected value, covariance, and cross-covariance==

===Expectation of a quadratic form===

One can take the expectation of a quadratic form in the random vector X as follows:Kendrick, David, Stochastic Control for Economic Models, McGraw-Hill, 1981.[tpl]rp|p.170-171[/tpl]
where C is the covariance matrix of X and tr refers to the trace of a matrix — that is, to the sum of the elements on its main diagonal (from upper left to lower right).  Since the quadratic form is a scalar, so is its expectation.
Hence
which leaves us to show that 
This is true based on the fact that one can cyclically permute matrices when taking a trace without changing the end result (e.g.: trace(AB) = trace(BA)).
We see that 
And since 
is a fixed number, then 
trivially. Using the permutation we get: 
and by plugging this into the original formula we get:

===Expectation of the product of two different quadratic forms===

One can take the expectation of the product of two different quadratic forms in a zero-mean Gaussian random vector X as follows:[tpl]rp|pp. 162-176[/tpl]
where again C is the covariance matrix of X. Again, since both quadratic forms are scalars and hence their product is a scalar, the expectation of their product is also a scalar.

==Applications==

===Portfolio theory===

In portfolio theory in finance, an objective often is to choose a portfolio of risky assets such that the distribution of the random portfolio return has desirable properties. For example, one might want to choose the portfolio return having the lowest variance for a given expected value.  Here the random vector is the vector r of random returns on the individual assets, and the portfolio return p (a random scalar) is the inner product of the vector of random returns with a vector w of portfolio weights — the fractions of the portfolio placed in the respective assets. Since p = wTr, the expected value of the portfolio return is wTE(r) and the variance of the portfolio return can be shown to be wTCw, where C is the covariance matrix of r.

===Regression theory===

In linear regression theory, we have data on n observations on a dependent variable y and n observations on each of k independent variables xj. The observations on the dependent variable are stacked into a column vector y; the observations on each independent variable are also stacked into column vectors, and these latter column vectors are combined into a matrix X of observations on the independent variables.  Then the following regression equation is postulated as a description of the process that generated the data:
