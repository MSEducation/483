Lindsay Kemp (born Cheshire, England, 3 May 1938) is a British dancer, actor, teacher, mime artist and choreographer.
Kemp's father, a seaman, was lost at sea in 1940. According to Kemp, he danced from early childhood: "I'd dance on the kitchen table to entertain the neighbours. I mean, it was a novelty in South Shields to see a little boy in full make-up dancing on pointe. Finally it got a bit too much for my mother, and she decided to send me to boarding school at the age of eight, hoping that it would knock some sense into me."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2002/jan/30/artsfeatures|title=Lindsay Kemp talks to Rupert Smith about his outrageous career|last=Smith|first=Rupert|date=2002-01-30|work=The Guardian|quote='I first danced Salome in school, naked but for some toilet paper' ... influenced David Bowie, and thus influenced every pop musician with the possible exception of ... respect for this 63-year-old dancer-mime-actor-choreographer-director has reached critical mass|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]
Kemp's mother moved away from South Shields, and Kemp attended Bearwood College, near Wokingham, a school for the sons of merchant seaman. He and his mother later moved to Bradford, Yorkshire where Kemp attended Bradford Art College before studying dance with Hilde Holger and mime with Marcel Marceau.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] He played the Player Queen in the BBC's Shakespeare Quatercentenary production of Hamlet filmed at Elsinore castle in 1963, and starring Christopher Plummer.
