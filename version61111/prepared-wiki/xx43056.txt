==History==

===Early history===

Pacifica was founded in 1946 by pacifists E. John Lewis and Lewis Hill. During World War II, Hill, as well as Lewis, filed for conscientious objector status. After the war, Lewis, Hill and a small group of former conscientious objectors created the Pacifica Foundation.  KPFA in Berkeley commenced broadcast activities in 1949.

===Internal conflict, 1990s–2002===

For most of its history, Pacifica gave each of its stations independent control of programming.  Then, during the 1990s, a major controversy arose over rumors that the Pacifica National Board and national staff were attempting to centralize control of content, in order to increase audience.  The rumors also included accusations that the board proposed changing the network's funding model away from reliance on listener donations and toward corporate foundation funding.  There were also accusations that the Board was considering selling both KPFA and WBAI in New York City, which operate on commercial-band FM frequencies (94.1 and 99.5, respectively) worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
This led to years of conflict, including court cases, public demonstrations, firings and strikes of station staff, whose common plight inspired creation of Radio4all.net to preserve what they saw as the original spirit of Pacifica.  Many listeners to the individual stations—especially KPFA and WBAI—objected to what they saw as an attempt to tone down the overtly left-leaning political content on Pacifica stations. The controversy included highly publicized disputes between listener organizations and Mary Frances Berry, a former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who chaired the corporation's board at the time.
The board eventually was embroiled in counter lawsuits by board members and listener-sponsors, and after global settlement of the lawsuits in November 2001, an interim board was formed to craft new bylaws, which it did in two tumultuous years of national debates among thousands of listener-sponsors and activists, finally giving listener-sponsors the right and responsibility to elect new Local Station Boards at each of the five Pacifica stations. These local boards in turn elect the national board of directors. Aside from some minor changes, the same 2003 bylaws remain in effect today.

===Recent history, 2000s===

Pacifica National News director Dan Coughlin was voted Interim Executive Director of the network in 2002 (the "Interim" was later dropped).  But the years of internal legal battles and financial mismanagement had taken a toll.  In 2005, Coughlin resigned, the network was still largely disorganized, and Pacifica reverted to operating with an interim executive director for most of the year.
In January 2006, Pacifica hired Greg Guma as the next executive director of the Pacifica Foundation. By the end of the year, it had fully recovered its financial health and had launched two new national programs: Informativo Pacifica, a daily Spanish Language newscast, and From the Vault, a weekly program drawn from Pacifica's extensive audio archives. Pacifica also produced Informed Dissent, a ten-week series for the 2006 mid-term elections that drew from talent across the network.
Guma left his post in September 2007.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The National Board unanimously chose former KPFA general manager Nicole Sawaya as the next executive director.  Sawaya was among the staff members fired by the national board in 1999 amidst Pacifica's internal crisis.  Sawaya began her tenure as executive director in mid-November 2007, but abruptly changed her mind two weeks later. Pacifica historian Matthew Lasar said she "found the level of internecine dysfunction at Pacifica overwhelming, and fled her job." The Pacifica National Board spent the next several months negotiating with her, and Sawaya resumed her job on March 5, 2008. She resigned effective September 30,[tpl]cite web |url=http://currentpublicmedia.blogspot.com/2008/09/sawaya-leaves-pacifica-publishes.html |title=Sawaya leaves Pacifica, publishes regretful critique |publisher=American University School of Communication |date=September 25, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101126222606/http://currentpublicmedia.blogspot.com/2008/09/sawaya-leaves-pacifica-publishes.html |archivedate=2010-11-26 |accessdate=2012-02-22[/tpl] citing "dysfunctional" governance and "shoddy and opaque" business practices that had plunged the organization into a financial crisis.
Sawaya's departure was followed by major staff layoffs. In 2009 Pacifica Board chair Grace Aaron became interim executive director, former board member LaVarn Williams replaced Lonnie Hicks as chief financial officer, and the national office took control of WBAI in New York. Aaron appointed Williams acting GM of WBAI in May, and Hicks filed a lawsuit against the foundation alleging that he was dismissed because he is African American and a whistleblower.

==Programs==

A show which has for years been considered the flagship of Pacifica Radio's national programming is Democracy Now!, an independent talk show that covers democracy, human rights and justice issues, and questions the motives of U.S. foreign and domestic policy.  Hosted by Amy Goodman and Juan González, this program is a compilation of news, interviews, and documentaries.  Democracy Now! is heard and seen on more than 700 radio and TV stations across the U.S. including public-access television stations and satellite television channels Free Speech TV and Link TV.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] WDEV, based in Waterbury, Vermont, is the only commercial radio station in the U.S. that carries the program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wdevradio.com/index-progs.asp |title=Program Schedule |publisher=WDEV Radio Vermont |accessdate=2012-02-22[/tpl] -- even though it is also heard in north-central Vermont by Pacifica affiliate WGDR in Plainfield and its sister station, WGDH in Hardwick. [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wgdr.org/ai1ec_event/democracy-now-2/?instance_id=230222 |title=Democracy Now! |publisher=Wgdr.org |accessdate=2013-07-30[/tpl]
In 2002, as Pacifica implemented its new listener-sponsor-accountability structure and as Pacifica and Democracy Now! settled outstanding disputes from previous years, Democracy Now! spun off with substantial funding from Pacifica to become an independent production.
The Pacifica network, in addition to extensive community-based productions at its various stations around the United States, also featured a daily newscast Free Speech Radio News for over a decade. FSRN was a radio program founded by Pacifica Reporters Against Censorship, a group of mostly Pacifica Network News reporters who went on strike against the Pacifica board policies of the late 1990s. FSRN was primarily funded by Pacifica, and includes headlines and news features produced by reporters based around the U.S. and in scores of countries around the world.  In September, 2013, the board of directors of FSRN issued a lay-off notice to all staff, and confirmed that their last broadcast would take place on Sept 27th, 2013. The board cited financial difficulties as the reason for the decision.[tpl]cite web|title=Free Speech Radio|url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Our-last-newscast-is-September-27--2013.html?soid=1102100306353&aid=WSa2AdUYdMo|publisher=Myemail.constantcontact.com|accessdate=24 September 2013[/tpl] 
In 2006, Pacifica added two new national programs: From the Vault from the Pacifica Radio Archives, a weekly program that thematically repackages archival material, making it relevant to contemporary listeners; and Informativo Pacifica, based at KPFK in Los Angeles, a daily Spanish-language newscast that includes reporters from the U.S. and many Latin American countries.
Local Pacifica stations also produce many programs that are available to network stations and affiliates. These include: Sprouts, a weekly showcase of producers and stations around the network, often in documentary format; Explorations in Science with Dr. Michio Kaku, a weekly radio program on science, politics, and the environment; Dennis Bernstein's Flashpoints a daily drive-time public affairs program; and many other regular programs.
Pacifica also produces a wide variety of special broadcasts, including live coverage of major U.S. Congressional hearings, national mobilizations against war, and other important events, such as the United States Social Forum. Special programs also include news documentaries, holidays and commemorations, and archival audio from the Pacifica Radio Archives.

==Financial problems at WBAI==

On August 9, 2013, Pacifica interim executive director Summer Reese announced that due to financial problems, Pacifica-owned radio stattion WBAI-FM in New York was laying off about two-thirds of its staff, effective August 12, 2013. The entire news department was reportedly included in the layoff.Ben Sisario, "WBAI-FM Lays Off Most of Staff," Aug. 11, 2013, The New York Times, at http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/media/wbai-fm-lays-off-most-of-staff.html.
