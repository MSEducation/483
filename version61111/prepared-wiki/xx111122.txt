Charles Henry Niehaus (January 24, 1855 – June 19, 1935), was an American sculptor.

==Education==

Niehaus was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to German parents.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&dq=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&f=false | title=Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788-1912, Volume 2 | publisher=The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company | year=1912 | accessdate=2013-05-20 | author=Clark, S. J. | pages=19[/tpl] He began working as a marble and wood carver, and then gained entrance to the McMicken School of Design in Cincinnati. He studied at the Royal Academy in Munich, Germany (1877–81). The effect of the German study was that he retained much of the Neo-Classical flavor in his art while most other sculptors of his generation were drawn towards Beaux-Arts realism.

==Career==

He returned to America in 1881. By virtue of being a native Ohioan, he was commissioned to sculpt two statues of the recently assassinated President Garfield; one for Cincinnati (Garfield's home city), and the other, in another pose, for the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. He moved to Rome, Italy, where he worked on the commissions, and made a study of ancient sculpture. He modeled three major male nudes during his years in Rome, including The Scraper (1883) and Caestus (1883-85). He returned to New York City in 1885, and opened a studio.1911 Encyclopedia Britanica.
In 1887, he created a statue of Ohioan William Allen, also for Statuary Hall.  In later years, he was to place statues of Oliver P. Morton of Indiana (1900), John J. Ingalls of Kansas (1905), Zachariah Chandler of Michigan (1913), George W. Glick of Kansas (1914), Ephraim McDowell of Kentucky (1929), and Henry Clay of Kentucky (1929) in the collection.
Monuments by Niehaus can be found in many American cities.  Several of the works authored by him are equestrian statues. As was the case with other sculptors of his day he also fashioned a fair amount of architectural sculpture.
In 1900 Niehaus married noted horticulturalist Regina Armstrong and moved to New Rochelle, New York, where they lived until his death in 1935.Regina Armstrong (NY Times & Standard Star articles provided)

==Selected works==

===United States Capitol===

Niehaus had eight statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., a record for a sculptor. However, in 2003, Kansas replaced his George W. Glick statue with one of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and in 2011, Michigan replaced his Zachariah Chandler statue with one of Gerald R. Ford. His remaining six statues are still more than any other sculptor has in the Hall.National Statuary Hall Collection from Architect of the Capitol.
There are also two busts by Niehaus in other collections:
