===Episode 1===

Colonel Gadaffi gave the IRA enough weapons to turn a militia into an army. Exposure's first film examines his support for the Republican terrorists and investigates the continuing danger of his legacy.
In this episode ITV mistakenly presented footage taken from the game ArmA 2 as footage of a 1988 IRA attack. The broadcaster apologised, blaming human error.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15082177 | work=BBC News | title=ITV documentary in IRA computer game blunder | date=27 September 2011[/tpl] A spokesperson for ITV commented on the error and said:
 "The events featured in Exposure: Gaddafi and the IRA were genuine but it would appear that during the editing process the correct clip of the 1988 incident was not selected and other footage was mistakenly included in the film by producers. This was an unfortunate case of human error for which we apologise."[tpl]cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5844214/idiot-documentarians-reveal-secret-ira-terrorism-footage-its-a-video-game-from-2009|title=Idiot Documentarians Reveal "Secret IRA Terrorism Footage".
