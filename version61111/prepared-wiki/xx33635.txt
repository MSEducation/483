MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) is an initiative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to put all of the educational materials from its undergraduate- and graduate-level courses online, partly free and openly available to anyone, anywhere. MIT OpenCourseWare is a large-scale, web-based publication of MIT course materials. The project was announced in October 2002 and uses Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license. The program was originally funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and MIT.  Currently, MIT OpenCourseWare is supported by MIT, corporate underwriting, major gifts, and donations from site visitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/donate/why-donate/ |title=Free Online Course Materials | Why Donate? | MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl] The initiative has inspired more than 250 other institutions to make their course materials available as open educational resources through the OpenCourseWare Consortium.[tpl]Cite news| last = Attwood| first = Rebecca| title = Get it out in the open| work = Times Higher Education| location = London| accessdate = 2010-12-18| date = 2009-09-24| url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=408300[/tpl]
As of October 2012, over 2180 courses were available online. While a few of these were limited to chronological reading lists and discussion topics, a majority provided homework problems and exams (often with solutions) and lecture notes. Some courses also included interactive web demonstrations in Java, complete textbooks written by MIT professors, and streaming video lectures.
As of October 2012, 60 courses included complete video lectures. The videos are available in streaming mode, but may also be downloaded for viewing offline.  All video and audio files are also available from iTunes U and the Internet Archive.

===History===

The concept of MIT OpenCourseWare grew out of the MIT Council on Education Technology, which was charged by MIT provost Robert Brown in 1999 with determining how MIT should position itself in the distance learning/e-learning environment.  MIT OpenCourseWare was then initiated to provide a new model for the dissemination of knowledge and collaboration among scholars around the world, and contributes to the “shared intellectual commons” in academia, which fosters collaboration across MIT and among other scholars. The project was spearheaded by professors Dick K.P Yue,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/vfrl/www/people/yue.html |title=Dick K.P. Yue |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl]   Shigeru Miyagawa,  Hal Abelson and other MIT Faculty.
The main challenge in implementing the OCW initiative had not been faculty resistance, but rather, the logistical challenges presented by determining ownership and obtaining publication permission for the massive amount of intellectual property items that are embedded in the course materials of MIT's faculty, in addition to the time and technical effort required to  convert the educational materials to an online format. Copyright in MIT OpenCourseWare material remains with MIT, members of its faculty, or its students.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
In September 2002, the MIT OpenCourseWare proof-of-concept pilot site opened to the public, offering 32 courses. In September 2003, MIT OpenCourseWare published its 500th course, including some courses with complete streaming video lectures. By September 2004, 900 MIT courses were available online. The response from MIT faculty and students has been very positive and MIT OpenCourseWare is seen as being consistent with MIT's mission (to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century) and is true to MIT's values of excellence, innovation, and leadership.
In 2005, MIT OpenCourseWare and other leading open educational resources projects formed the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which seeks to extend the reach and impact of open course materials, foster new open course materials and develop sustainable models for open course material publication.
In 2007, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced a site called Highlights for High School that indexes resources on the OCW applicable to advances high school study in biology, chemistry, calculus and physics in an effort to support US STEM education at the secondary school level.
In 2011, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced the first of fifteen OCW Scholar courses, which are designed specifically for the needs of independent learners.  While still publications of course materials like the rest of the site content, these courses are more in-depth and the materials are presented in logical sequences that facilitate self-study.  No interaction with other students is supported by the OCW site, but study groups on collaborating project OpenStudy are available for some OCW Scholar courses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ocw-scholar/ |title=OCW Scholar courses |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl]

===Technology===

MIT OCW was originally served by a custom content management system based on Microsoft's Microsoft Content Management Server, which was replaced in mid-2010 with a Plone-based content management system. The publishing process is described by MIT as a "large-scale digital publishing infrastructure consists of planning tools, a content management system (CMS), and the MIT OpenCourseWare content distribution infrastructure".[tpl]cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/help/faq4/index.htm |title=Free Online Course Materials | FAQ: Technology | MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl]
Video content for the courses were originally primarily in RealMedia format.  In 2008, OCW transitioned to using YouTube as the primary digital video streaming platform for the site, embedding YouTube video back into the OCW site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/MIT |title=MIT |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl] OCW video and audio files are also provided in full for offline downloads on iTunesU and the Internet Archive.  In 2011, OCW introduced an iPhone App called LectureHall in partnership with Irynsoft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/about/media-coverage/press-releases/iphone-lecturehall |title=Free Online Course Materials | MIT OpenCourseWare Announces iPhone App for Video Lectures | MIT OpenCourseWare |publisher=Ocw.mit.edu |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl]

===Funding===

The annual cost of running MIT OCW is about $3.5 million. "MIT's goal for the next decade is to increase our reach ten-fold" and to secure funding for this.
