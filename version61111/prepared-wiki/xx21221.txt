This extended hiatus was originally because of a new baby in the Chapman family. In September 2011, Matt Chapman created a Twitter account[tpl]Cite web| title=Matt Chapman's Twitter account | url=http://twitter.com/#!/ronginald[/tpl] in which he stated that he was now working as a writer and director for the Nickelodeon program Yo Gabba Gabba. Chapman also announced that Homestar Runner would eventually be updated, but "sporadically and without warning". Since then, Matt has moved on to work as a writer/director on other programs, such as Gravity Falls and The Aquabats! Super Show!.
On Feb. 27, 2012, Matt Chapman posted a screenshot of part of the script for sbemail 206 on his Twitter, with the message "Someday, when you least expect it..."[tpl]cite web | title=Someday, when you least expect it... |url= https://twitter.com/#!/ronginald/status/174295231376785409/photo/1 |publisher=twitter.com |accessdate=14 March 2012[/tpl] However, he did not give any further details of if or when the website would resume updates.
At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Strong Bad and Homestar appeared (unanimated) to introduce a panel regarding the history of W00tstock. The humorous skit began with, "Hello, my name is Strong Bad, and I'm from 2002. Ask your parents." referencing the characters' absence in recent years.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0m-k6qZMx8
On April 1, 2014 the Homestarrunner.com homepage featured the first new cartoon since the 2010 hiatus.

===Music===

The Homestar Runner site frequently features songs and videos within their animated shorts or as stand-alone entities, which serve as parodies of hair metal, death metal, college rock and hip hop. These are primarily sung and performed either by the characters or by fictitious rock bands with names such as “Limozeen”, “Peacey P”, “sloshy”, "Brainkrieg", "Tenerence Love", and “Taranchula”. Real-life musicians They Might be Giants have also appeared occasionally, performing with a Homestar puppet or allowing the characters to perform a video to their song Experimental Film.
The site-generated music has enjoyed surprising popularity, such that commercial CDs are now sold and two songs, "Trogdor" by the character Strong Bad and "Because, It's Midnite" by Limozeen, have been included in the successful Guitar Hero II and Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s video games, respectively. Their inclusion in the games is reportedly because Harmonix founder Alex Rigopulos is a professed fan of Homestar Runner.[tpl]Cite web| title=Georgia Tech - 26 April 2007 | url=http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Georgia_Tech_-_26_Apr_2007 | work=Homestar Runner Wiki | date=26 April 2007 | accessdate=16 July 2009[/tpl]
The first music included in the site's content was humorously absurd hip hop created by the character Coach Z, who often makes references to hip hop and rap music in conversation. Another character, Strong Bad, sings short intros in weekly cartoons in which he checks his email and provides humorous responses and commentary. In an email titled “dragon”, he draws a bizarre one-armed dragon called “TROGDOR, THE BURNiNATOR,” and performs his theme song. By far, Trogdor became the site’s most popular joke, yielding merchandise such as T-shirts, CDs, messenger bags, etc. all featuring the title character. Trogdor's theme song was included as a bonus track in Guitar Hero II.http://news.softpedia.com/news/Guitar-Hero-2-Track-List-Xbox-360-and-PS2-47443.shtml
In 2002, a faux hair metal band, Limozeen, was first introduced as a parody in the style of 1980s metal bands like Skid Row, White Lion and Poison; their songs include "Because, It's Midnite", "Nite Mamas", "Feed the Childrens" and "Brain Sister". Limozeen (actually the Atlanta indie band Y-O-U along with Matt Chapman on vocals) performed a live show in Atlanta, Georgia on March 17, 2008.[tpl]Cite web| author=Chapman, Matt |coauthors=Chapman, Mike| year=2008| title= Limozeen Live! | format=SWF | work=homestarrunner.com | url= http://www.homestarrunner.com/limolive.html [/tpl] They performed live again on November 8, 2008, opening for indie pop band Of Montreal.[tpl]Cite web| author=Chapman, Matt |coauthors=Chapman, Mike| year=2008| title= Zeenin' into Larger Venues! | format=SWF | work=homestarrunner.com | url= http://www.homestarrunner.com/limolive_om.html [/tpl] A few years later, the death metal parody Taranchula was created. Billed as Scandinavian, their songs, done in the style of Sepultura, include "Decoupage", "Trudgemank", and "Moving Very Slowly". The creators later introduced a noise pop band called “sloshy” (always spelled in lower case and rotated 180 degrees as "ʎɥsoןs"), which featured songs in the musical vein of Pavement such as "We Don't Really Even Care About You", "OK Fine", and "Unripe”, as well as a cover of Limozeen's "Because, It's Midnite". Recently, the site has also touched on rap music via the character Peacey P, a rapper who mainly appears as a guest star on various albums, even his own. His singing style resembles that of Snoop Dogg. Another new addition to the site's musical roster is the self-absorbed R&B artist Tenerence Love. Taranchula was later revisited and released a song called "Trudgemank" featuring Peacey P, à la "the early '90s".

==Characters==

==Cartoons==

Homestar Runner features several "sub-cartoons" and spin-offs. Some of these cartoons take place outside the normal Homestar Runner universe, and the main characters of the normal cartoons do not necessarily appear in them. When they do, it is often not in the same way they appear in the main Homestar Runner world — most of the main characters also have alter-egos that appear occasionally.

===Old-Timey (1936)===

These cartoons take place in an old-time setting, with most of the Homestar Runner characters having counterparts in the Old-Timey cartoons. These cartoons are in black and white with a film grain effect added and scratchy audio quality. They parody the distinctive style of animated cartoons during the 1920s and 1930s (à la Steamboat Willie), and can be seen as perhaps deliberately unfunny, to make a slanted joke about such old-style cartoons. The versions of the characters are, for the most part, similar to their standard counterparts. The names are mostly slightly changed (for instance, Strong Bad becomes Sir Strong Bad and Homestar Runner becomes The Homestar Runner) but some are completely different; for example, Pom Pom's equivalent is called Fat Dudley and Strong Sad's equivalent is called Sickly Sam.

===Powered By The Cheat===

"Powered by The Cheat", sometimes called Powered by Teh Cheat, are cartoons created by the character The Cheat, hence the name. They feature main characters, but have an amateurish style of animation, nonsensical plots and bad voice acting, with the voices provided by Mike Chapman. They parody poorly made Internet cartoons.

===20X6===

Another series of cartoons, Stinkoman 20X6 (abbreviated to 20X6; pronounced "Twenty Exty-Six"), originated from a response to an email asking Strong Bad what he would look like if he were in an anime. The main character, Stinkoman, is an anime version of Strong Bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. He is always looking for a fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a "challenge" ("Are you asking for a challenge?"). The characters in 20X6 cartoons each have a counterpart in the Homestar Runner universe, and their features are a parody of anime and Japanese video game stereotypes. The game of the same name was heavily based on the Mega Man series, particularly the first 6 entries.  Stinkoman's name comes from a conversation Homestar Runner and Strong Bad had while marooned on a desert island. Strong Bad created Stinkoman by applying several anime stereotypes (head shaped like a little bean, big shiny eyes, shiny body, mouth that is tiny when closed and huge when opened, blue hair, and robot boots) to his own appearance.

===Cheat Commandos===

The Cheat Commandos is a parody of G.I. Joe that created a cast of characters that are the same species as The Cheat. Each character is based on a G.I. Joe character. For example, the character Crackotage is based on Roadblock, but with a voice more like Scatman Crothers while Reinforcements' generic name and appearance is reminiscent of common grunt soldiers. The enemy of the Commandos is Blue Laser, a direct parody of Cobra, who have their equivalent of Cobra Commander, known as Blue Laser Commander. The cartoon is constantly advertising its products in the cartoons by such methods as referring to the areas they are in as "playsets", a convoy truck as an "action figure storage vehicle", and by ending each cartoon with the phrase (sung in a patriotic way), "Buy all our playsets and toys!" Other cartoons feature the character of Crack Stuntman, the fictional voice artist for the Cheat Commandos character Gunhaver.

===Strong Bad Email===

Strong Bad Emails (also known as "sbemails") have traditionally been among the most popular features on Homestar Runner. When it started in August 2001, the emails were initially brief, but grew to establish numerous spinoffs and inside jokes on the site. The format, though, has remained essentially unchanged since its inception (with the exception of updated computers): Strong Bad receives an email from a fan or viewer, and starts typing his response. Strong Bad generally mocks the sender, criticizing names, hometowns, spelling and grammar. Most of the time a cut-away sequence is used that gets away from typing the e-mail. Once the events of the email finish unfolding, Strong Bad wraps up the email, and then "The Paper", the "New Paper", the "Envelope Paper", or the "Compé-per" comes down/up with a link to email Strong Bad. Often, hidden animations (Easter Eggs) are displayed when the user clicks on a word or picture either during the email or after it has concluded.  Depending on the browser, it may be possible to hold the TAB key or the CTRL key along with the TAB key to highlight any clickable hidden feature in the animation.[tpl]Cite web| author=Chapman, Matt |coauthors=Chapman, Mike| year=2003| title=Strong Bad Email 79 "the process" | format=SWF | work=homestarrunner.com | url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail79.html | accessdate=2006-12-19[/tpl] When Strong Bad uses a laptop computer (emails 119-201), clicking on the screen at any time creates a little ripple, as if you are really tapping the screen.[tpl]Cite web| author=Chapman, Matt |coauthors=Chapman, Mike| title=Strong Bad Email 119 | format=SWF | work=homestarrunner.com | url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail119.html | accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl] As of October 6, 2009, there are 211 sbemails (including the 6 bonus episodes found on the sbemail DVDs exclusively distributed by Microcinema DVD). Many Homestar Runner objects, such as Trogdor, Homsar, Senor Cardgage, Teen Girl Squad, and 20X6, originated from sbemails.

===Teen Girl Squad===

Teen Girl Squad is a crudely drawn comic strip narrated by Strong Bad, using a falsetto  voice. It began after Strong Bad received an email asking him to make a comic strip of a girl and her friends.[tpl]Cite web| author=| year=2002| title=Strong Bad Email 53 | work=homestarrunner.com | url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail53.html|accessdate=2006-12-19[/tpl] The comic features four archetypal teenage girls, with heavy parody evident in the characters' nondescript names: "Cheerleader", "So and So", "What's Her Face" and "The Ugly One". The comic strip is about their lives (and frequently violent, but funny, deaths devised by Strong Bad). The comic seems to be a commentary on teen culture in the United States. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Holiday Specials===

Several episodes have been dedicated to special days of the year. For example, when the site was active, every Halloween, a cartoon was released featuring all the characters in costumes celebrating some traditional aspect of Halloween (such as ghost stories, trick-or-treating or pumpkin carving). The characters' costumes are often famously esoteric, full of obscure pop culture references or characters from movies and television shows made in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s; for example: Flavor Flav, Angus Young, Jambi the Genie, Gizmo, Prince, and Sam Kinison. April Fools' Day features various gags, such as turning the site into a "PAY PLUS!" offer site or flipping it upside down. The characters also celebrate an annual holiday called "Decemberween", a parody of Christmas that features gift-giving, carol-singing and decorated trees. The fact that it takes place on December 25, the same day as Christmas, has been presented as just a coincidence, and it has been stated that Decemberween traditionally takes place "55 days after Halloween".
Other holidays celebrated include New Year's Day, "The Big Game" (around the time of the Super Bowl), St. Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, "Senorial Day" (a combination of a lesser character named Senor Cardgage and Memorial Day), Flag Day, Independence Day (also known as "Happy Fireworks" by Homestar), Labor Day (occasionally referred to as "Labor Dabor"), Thanksgiving and, most recently, Easter.

===Marzipan's Answering Machine===

Marzipan's Answering Machine has limited animation and consists of a series of phone messages left on Marzipan's answering machine. These cartoons often include attempts by Strong Bad to prank call Marzipan or run some sort of scam. Homestar Runner leaves frequent messages, as does Coach Z, who was revealed to have a crush on Marzipan through a drunk dial in episode "5.0" of this feature. Also, Strong Sad is shown to have called many times, appearing to be friends with Marzipan. In addition, less frequently featured characters appear, such as Crack Stuntman, Stinkoman and Vector Strong Bad.

===Puppet Stuff===

Homestar Runner.com also features a segment in which the regular cartoons are replaced by puppets that may do skits that can vary from performing in music videos with They Might Be Giants, holiday videos, or Homestar, Marshie (the mascot for Fluffy Puff Mashmallows) and Strong Bad interacting with a little girl. Other videos include "Biz Cas Fri", which displays Strong Bad interacting with Homestar in his office cubicle.

==Video games==

===Web games===

Homestar Runner offers a variety of online games that feature one or more of their characters. The first games were simple in nature and are now found under Super Old Games-n-Such. Among them are the "Homestar Talker",[tpl]Cite web| author=| title=Homestar Talker | work=homestarrunner.com| url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/talky2.html | accessdate=2006-05-28[/tpl] a Soundboard starring Homestar, and "Astro-Lite 2600",[tpl]Cite web| author=| title=Astro-Lite 2600 | work=homestarrunner.com| url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/litebrite.html | accessdate=2008-04-30[/tpl] a game similar to Lite-Brite. More recent games have been released as products of "Videlectrix", a side project of the brothers. These games are far more complex, spoofing many popular 1980s videogames. "Where's an Egg?" is a good example of their parody games.Videlectrix releases another game parody: Where's an Egg? - Joystiq It is a web-based Flash game that is portrayed as a real, but extremely obscure game with all captions in broken Russian and clunky graphics reminiscent of the early days of computer gaming.Where's An Egg?, a review at the Flak Magazine The game takes place "in Soviet Russia" — a reference to the "Russian reversal" stock comedy framework originated by Yakov Smirnoff and made an Internet cliché on message boards such as those of FARK.com — and includes references to Lenin's Tomb, Sputnik, and Siberia. You play as an unnamed detective in search of an egg. Videlectrix claimed on its homepage that it purchased the game overseas "some years ago".  However, no one at the company could figure out how the game worked until they found a page from the original instruction booklet (in Russian, along with strained translations into English from the seller) for sale on an online auction site.A mock auction bid for the missing page #13 from the "instruktor book for very very foreign videomachine game 'WHERE AT DID YOU THE EGG PUT?!"
"Peasant's Quest", arguably the site's most famous game, is an adventure game featuring Rather Dashing, a young peasant in short pants. After he comes home from a vacation he finds his cottage burned to the ground. He vows to kill the destroyer of his cottage: Trogdor the Burninator, a dragon with one strong-looking human arm, created as a result of a Strong Bad email. The game uses a system that is a near-replica of Sierra Entertainment's Adventure Game Interpreter, used in King's Quest, Space Quest and several other early Sierra titles.
"Thy Dungeonman" is a parody of text adventure games. A running gag in the game is that "you cannot get ye flask" (one of the first items mentioned in the first game), as mentioned in the SBemail "video games". At the end of the third game, you manage to actually get Ye Flask. Though the game purports to be set in the medieval era, the text is actually rendered in mock Early Modern English, the language of William Shakespeare's plays and of the King James Bible. "Thy Dungeonman" has two sequels: "Thy Dungeonman II" and "Thy Dungeonman III", the latter of which is on the Homestar Runner website, the former on the Videlectrix site. "Thy Dungeonman III" has graphics, though the SBemail "video games" states that such games had no graphics ("Graphics schmaphics"). "Ye Flask" and "Ye can't get ye flask" have become catch-phrases in the Homestar Runner universe, eventually spawning a T-shirt in the Homestar Runner store.
Strong Bad Zone is a parody of vector graphics games such as Battlezone. The idea of the game is to not only block the items that are fired at you, but deflect them toward Strong Bad's floating head, of which they break off a piece upon contact. Should the player be struck by a projectile, vector Strong Bad will say "Your head a splode", a phrase jokingly described in the corresponding SBemail as a "bad translation".  In the website's version of the game, if a player succeeds in breaking all the pieces of the floating head, a new head appears and the game continues without interruption. In the Wii version, once Strong Bad is destroyed, the screen will become covered with lipstick kisses and vector Strong Bad will say "Back Off Baby," a reference to the SBemail "video games". The Wii version also adds music.
Other games include Stinkoman 20X6, an unfinished platform game based almost entirely on the Mega Man series; 50k Racewalker, a game based on track and field video games, apparently involving race walking (although the character moves significantly slower); Hallrunner, a vector game where various encounters must either be "spoken to, jumped over, or fought" before the object is known, while avoiding obstacles; and Pigs on Head, a Game & Watch based game.
In 2007, the website produced Wii versions of some of the games on the site, for the Wii browser. When played on the computer, these use the mouse only.[tpl]Cite web| author=| title=Viidelectrix | format= | work=videlectrix.com| url=http://www.videlectrix.com/vii | accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl]
