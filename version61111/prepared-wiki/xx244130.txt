CATEGORIES: Circuses

Great British Circus Ltd was a company that specialized in circus entertainment.  Unusually for a UK-based circus company it included wild animals such as tigers, camels and lions in its acts. Martin Lacey, was the company's owner and Circus Director,  and in 2012, at the age of 70, announced he would Retire, and the Great British Circus would not return for a 2013 Season.

==Use of wild animals==

Martin Lacey defends the company's approach as follows:  "The Circus takes veterinary advice from world-respected experts, not from campaign groups who too often seek to excite public sympathy in their quest for donations and support.".[tpl]cite web|author=Circus, DVDs, Great British, Animal Circus, Bertram Mills, Billy Smart |url=http://www.greatbritishcircus.co.uk/ |title=Shop4Circus |publisher=Greatbritishcircus.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl]  Martin Lacey has bred tigers for many years and provided most of the tigers used in the Esso oil television advertisements up until the 1970s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newshound.org.uk/April%202006.htm |title=April 2006 |publisher=Newshound.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Martin Wainwright |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/feb/07/martinwainwright |title='Nip' from tiger puts trainer in hospital | UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date=2001-02-07 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |location=London[/tpl]

===Early Day Motions===

On 3 March 2009 an Early Day Motion was tabled by John Austin, referring to the introduction of elephants into the circus as follows:  
 That this House shares the RSPCA's deep concern at the recent introduction of elephants into a circus in Nottinghamshire; hopes that the public will boycott the circus in protest; believes that the Government should intervene in this case and state categorically that it opposes the use of wild species in circuses; and urges the Government to bring forward proposals to ban the use of wild animals in circuses without further delay.This motion was signed by 110 MPs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=38030&SESSION=899 |title=Early day motion 948 - ANIMAL WELFARE IN CIRCUSES - UK Parliament |publisher=Edmi.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl]  
On the following day, another EDM was tabled, by Mark Pritchard, specifically naming the Great British Circus, as follows:  That this House notes with concern the continuing use of non-domesticated animals in circuses and more recently the re-introduction of elephants by the Great British Circus; is increasingly concerned by the delay of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in reporting on increasing amounts of evidence surrounding poor animal welfare standards in circuses; believes that the report of the Chair of the Circus Working Group fails to provide reliable information on this subject; supports the work of the Captive Animals Protection Society and others in achieving an end to animal use in circuses; and urges the Government to maintain its commitment to ban the use of non-domesticated animals in travelling circuses and to limit the use of domesticated species under a strict, accountable and open licensing system. This motion was signed by 78 MPs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=38060&SESSION=899 |title=Early day motion 976 - ANIMAL WELFARE IN CIRCUSES (No. 2) - UK Parliament |publisher=Edmi.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl]
