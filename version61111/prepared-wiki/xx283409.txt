==Critical reception==

Writing for FEARnet, Scott Weinberg praised the acting of the three leads but criticized the film's "paper-thin premise" and script for being derivative (pointing out Mallhi's previous work on 2011's The Roommate), and said "Even putting aside the casual plagiarism in Mallhi's screenplays, there's nothing here in the way of character, suspense, intensity, or surprises. It's just someone telling the same old story with slightly different character."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-crush|title=FEARnet Movie Review: 'Crush'|work=FEARnet|publisher=Horror Entertainment, LLC|date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] Ian Sedensky of Culture Crypt gave the film a score of 45/100 and judged: "The young cast is attractive, the production is well put together, and the twist, however absurd, might be genuinely shocking and entertaining to some. But this is a movie about a crush. And buying into the thin motivations behind this obsession requires a level of crazy reserved exclusively for the characters in this movie."[tpl]cite web|url=http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/crush-2013|title=CRUSH (2013) â€” CULTURE CRYPT|publisher=Culture Crypt LLC and Ian Sedensky|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] John Strand of Best-Horror-Movies awarded the film 2.5/5 "Freakheads" (the site's rating system), and concluded the film is "A neat little thriller that will appeal to teens and young adults who are not interested in scares and gore, but like a fairly executed, albeit predictable, storyline."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.best-horror-movies.com/review?name=crush-2013-review|title='Crush' (2013) Review|publisher=Best-Horror-Movies.com|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]
