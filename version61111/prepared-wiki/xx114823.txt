[[Eupoa]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Eupoa is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Originally known only from one species from Vietnam, several other species have been described since 1997, all from China.
Spiders of this genus have unusual pedipalps, and do probably not belong to the Salticoida, the main clade of jumping spiders. It is basal, but placement is not yet clear. Possibly Eupoa has branched from other basal groups like Lyssomaninae or Spartaeinae a long time ago.Maddison et al. 2007:21
Specimens of E. prima were collected from leaf litter.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 292

==Description==

Eupoa are small salticids, with E. prima only reaching about 2Â mm in both sexes. Although not closely related, it looks a bit like Neon, another litter dwelling species.
The abdomen is dark with light elongate transversal patches.
