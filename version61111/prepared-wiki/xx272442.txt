[[Oven bag]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking utensils

An oven bag is a plastic bag used for the roasting of meat or other food in an oven. An oven bag helps to keep the food being cooked moist by trapping the moisture in the bag and preventing it from escaping into the oven; as such, it serves a similar purpose to basting. The plastic used for manufacture of the oven bag must be chosen so that it will not melt at the temperature during cooking and thus spoil the food. To this end, many oven bags are formed from a special heat resistant nylon.
Oven bags should be carefully placed so that the bag does not come in contact with any hot surfaces in the oven, such as heating elements or oven racks. These may cause the bag to melt, smoke, or catch fire.

==Use in suicide==

There are cases of oven bags being used to commit suicide. When used for this purpose, the bag is referred to as a Suicide Bag.
