Founder member Bryan, who is lead singer, is originally from Newton Aycliffe in North East England.
The Hotel FM story began in,2005 when the Romanian composer Gabriel Băruţa recruited a few very talented musicians from his hometown Oradea to create a new sound, a modern pop-rock feel based on melody and innovation, specific to the songs he wrote.
Throughout the years, Hotel FM attracted exquisite young musicians like Nicolae Vedinaş (vocals, flute), Berek Szilard (vocals), Marius Pop (guitar), Vlady Săteanu (bass), Gabi Drăgan (drums) and Sanyi Zakar (guitar), united by the same vision and passion for music.
The band has played many concerts in cities of Romania and Germany and released a promotional CD in the spring of 2006.
The members of Hotel FM have always balanced the band’s activity with exciting side-projects: David is recording Shakespeare’s Sonnets on the music of Florian Chelu Madeva (Rock Filarmonica Oradea) and plays with the only Pink Floyd tribute band in Romania, “Speak Floyd”; Gabriel writes song for talented children and has won many national and international songwriting competitions. As a producer, he has worked with artists from many different genres, from rock to pop, hip-hop and even house. He has recently opened a brand new studio in Bucharest.
