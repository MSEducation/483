He writes, "Neither Qaradawi's popularity nor his rhetoric should distract from the fact that Egyptian revolution's grievances were based on a desire for political liberty and economic opportunity. That said, Islam remains an important framework for public debate and a reservoir of political symbolism."[tpl]cite news|last=Rock|first=Aaron|title=Qaradawi's Return And Islamic Leadership in Egypt|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/qaradawis-return-and-islamic-leadership-in-egypt-analysis-20032011/|accessdate=20 March 2011|newspaper=Eurasia Review|date=20 March 2011[/tpl]

==Views and statements==

===Religious and sectarian views===

====Muslims sects====

Al-Qaradawi has written on the danger of extremist groups of Islam, in his dissertation on the subject Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism. In it he warns of the dangers of blind obedience, bigotry and intolerance; rigidity—which deprives people of clarity of vision and the opportunity for dialogue with others; commitment to excessiveness, including the excessive application of minor or controversial Islamic issues to people in non-Muslim countries or to people who have only recently converted to Islam; harshness in the treatment of people, roughness in the manner of approach, and crudeness in calling people to Islam, all which are contrary to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah.[tpl]cite book|last=al-Qaradawi|first=Yusuf|title=Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism|year=1987|publisher=International Institute of Islamic Thought|page=10|url=http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/d/iare_e.pdf[/tpl]

====Non-Muslims====

Al-Qaradawi has called for dialogue with Non-Muslims. He also puts emphasis on conversations with the West, including Jews, Christians, and secularists. He writes that this effort should differentiate itself from a debate, for the latter does not often result in mutual cooperation. Regarding the rights and citizenship of non-Muslim minorities, Qaradawi has said, "those people who live under the protection of an Islamic government enjoy special privileges. They are referred to as 'the Protected People' (dhimmi) ... In modern terminology, dhimmies are 'citizens' of the Islamic state. From the earliest period of Islam to the present day, Muslims are in unanimous agreement that they enjoy the same rights and carry the same responsibilities as Muslims themselves, while being free to practice their own faiths."
In his book titled The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam, al-Qaradawi wrote, "Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur'an never addresses them without saying, 'O People of the Book' or 'O You who have been given the Book', indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion."

=====Jews=====

In May 2008, al-Qaradawi told visiting Rabbis from the Haredi, Anti-Zionist Neturei Karta sect, "there is no enmity between Muslims and Jews.... Jews who believe in the authentic Torah are very close to Muslims." He has also expressed his belief that relations between Muslims and Jews became strained with the emergence of Zionism and the establishment of Israel. "Muslims are against the expansionist, oppressive Zionist movement, not the Jews." He also said that Muslims and Jews were subjected to the same persecution following the fall of Islamic rule in Andalusia, now Spain.
However, al-Qaradawi has also made statements that some critics charge are anti-Semitic.
In a 9 January 2009, sermon during the Gaza War, shown on Al-Jazeera, Qaradawi prayed (as translated by MEMRI):[tpl]cquote|O Allah, take your enemies, the enemies of Islam. O Allah, take the Jews, the treacherous aggressors. O Allah, take this profligate, cunning, arrogant band of people. O Allah, they have spread much tyranny and corruption in the land. Pour Your wrath upon them, O our God. Lie in wait for them. O Allah, You annihilated the people of Thamoud (Sodom) at the hand of a tyrant, and You annihilated the people of 'Aad with a fierce, icy gale, and You destroyed the Pharaoh and his soldiers – O Allah, take this oppressive, tyrannical band of people. O Allah, take this oppressive, Jewish Zionist band of people. O Allah, do not spare a single one of them. O Allah, count their numbers, and kill them, down to the very last one.Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi On Al-Jazeera Incites Against Jews, Arab Regimes, and the U.S.; Calls on Muslims to Boycott Starbucks and Others; Says 'O Allah, Take This Oppressive, Jewish, Zionist Band of People ...

In August 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradhawi is president, had used the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations.Islamic Justice Finds a Foothold In Heart of Europe The Wall Street Journal, 4 August 2005, Vol nr. 24 Al-Qaradawi's remarks were sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Theologian of Terror, Anti-Defamation League, 4 August 2009.Muslim Brotherhood Ideologue Incites Violence Against Jews and Israel, Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 2 February 2009.Multiculturalists diminish 'rough beast' ravaging Islam by Rory Leishman, IFPress.com, 31 October 2009.The bond between Nazis and Islam by Paul Berman, The Australian, 13 July 2010.
In a sermon broadcast on Qatar TV on 26 April 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in an inter-faith dialogue if Jews were present, stating, "If you invite the Jews, I will not participate. I will participate in a Muslim-Christian meeting, but with the Jews there should be no debate." Qaradawi stated that there can be "no debate whatsoever with those who have committed injustice" and "Those Jews have committed clear injustice against us. They have shed our blood, killed our children, displaced our people, seized our lands, and usurped our rights." Later in his sermon, Qaradawi restated: "I cannot be a part of a conference in which wrongdoing Jews participate. They have committed great injustice, and I cannot possibly shake hands with them. Their hands are soiled with blood. They have murderous, violent, and oppressive hands. I cannot soil my hands by shaking theirs."Leading Sunni Scholar Yousuf Al-Qaradawi Refuses to Participate in Interfaith Dialogue with Jews, MEMRITV, Clip No. 3825 (transcript), 26 April 2013.

In a statement that aired on Al-Jazeera TV on 28 January 2009 during the Gaza war, al-Qaradawi said the following regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust (as translated by MEMRI):– Sheik Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi: Allah Imposed Hitler upon the Jews to Punish Them – "Allah Willing, the Next Time Will Be at the Hand of the Believers", MEMRITV, Clip no. 2005, Al-Jazeera TV (Qatar) – 28–30 January 2009.[tpl]cite news|title=Analysis: Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a 'man for all seasons'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=208978&R=R|work=The Jerusalem Post[/tpl]Qaradawi's Extremism Laid Bare, Investigative Project on Terrorism, IPT News, 6 February 2009.Intellectual Double Standards on Islamists by Steve Emerson, Jewish World Review, 6 May 2010/22 Iyar 5770.Islamist movements casts shadow over Egypt by Robert Wistrich, Washington Jewish Week, 18 January 2012.Militant Islamism, Islamism, Islam by Clifford D.

====Apostasy====

Al-Qaradawi says that apostasy – Muslims leaving Islam – is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that it is the duty of all Muslims "is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world".[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110805064833/http://www.islamonline.net/i3/ContentServer?pagename=IslamOnline/i3Layout&c=OldArticle&cid=1178724001992|title=Source of the Punishment for Apostasy|publisher=Islam online|accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
With regards to the punishment of apostasy, al-Qaradawi supports the classical Islamic tradition on some points but differs on others. He considers execution as a penalty in principle, but the only apostates that are to be executed are those that combine other crimes with apostasy (e.g., "inciting a war against Islam"). He also advocates that the apostates to be executed should be given a chance to repent. Finally, he believes that "hidden apostasy" (where the apostate does not "proclaim" his conversion) may be left to the judgement of God in the Hereafter.[tpl]cite news|title=Apostasy and its Classification in Yusuf Al-Qardawi's View|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/fatwa/apostasy-and-its-classification-yusuf-al-qardawis-view|publisher=Islamopedia[/tpl]
While al-Qaradawi believes that the Muslim community is not allowed to punish "intellectual apostasy", where the apostates do not "swagger" about their conversion, he still strongly condemns it. He says "These people are not noticed when they invade or begin to disseminate their falsehood, but they are mostly felt when they affect the minds. They do not use guns in their attacks, however, their attacks are fierce and cunning." Nevertheless, he concedes, "Erudite scholars and well versed jurists ... can not take an action in face of such professional criminals who have firmly established themselves and have not left a chance for law to be enforced on them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/crimes-and-penalties/apostasy/175287.html|title=Fatwa on Intellectual Apostasy|publisher=OnIslam|accessdate=1 March 2011[/tpl]
In February 2013, on an episode of Shariah and Life show, which broadcast on Al-Jazeera, Qaradawi stated since the 15th century, the application of the death penalty for those who leave Islam is a necessity, stating, "If they had gotten rid of the apostasy punishment Islam wouldn't exist today." Qaradwai also cited several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers, such as Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:33, which Qaradawi quoted as "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle is that they should be murdered or crucified." Qaradawi further explained, "... many hadiths, not only one or two, but many, narrated by a number of Muhammad's companions state that any apostate should be killed. Ibn 'Abbas's hadith: 'Kill whomever changes his faith Islam.'"Gore, Current silent as cleric affirms death penalty for leaving Islam on Al-Jazeera by Nicole Lafond, Daily Caller, 12 February 2013.

===Political views===

====Freedom and democracy====

Al-Qaradawi has spoken in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically.Reform according to Islam[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]. Al Jazeera EnglishMuslim world needs democracy, says Qaradawi – The Muslim News – 8 July 2006 On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: "On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. We are not a state for mullahs."Govt pressure bans Qaradawi, 22 February 2011

====Terrorism====

After the September 11 attacks, al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2001-09/13/article25.shtml |title=Qaradawi Condemns Attacks Against Civilians: Forbidden in Islam |publisher=Islam-online.net |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
He denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, "when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians," but qualifies that with "I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories."
Al-Qaradawi has suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) suicide bombings against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants has no other means of self-defense. The Oxford-based Malaysian Islamic Scholar, Dr. Afifi al-Akiti, rules that there is no Islamic legal for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat.

Western governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier wrote to al-Qaradawi: "With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Politics/Welcome.html|title=Qaradawi Is Welcome Peter Roberts Labour Left Briefing, December 2004|publisher=What next journal|accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]

====Israeli-Palestinian conflict====

Al-Qaradawi condones Palestinian attacks on Israelis. A resolution issued by The Islamic Fiqh Council affiliated to the Muslim World League in its 14th session, held in Doha (Qatar) on 11–16 January 2003 has upheld his views on the matter. Defending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told BBC Newsnight in 2005 that:

At the press conference held by the organizations sponsoring his visit to London, al-Qaradawi reiterated his view that suicide attacks are a justified form of resistance to Israeli occupation of the rightfully Palestinian Territories. He has also justified his views by stating that all Israeli civilians are potential soldiers, since Israel is a "militarized society". Because of these views, al-Qaradawi has been accused by Western countries and Israel of supporting terrorism.
Al-Qaradawi is opposed to attacks outside of the Palestinian Territories and Israel, and against non-Israeli targets. For example, on 20 March 2005, he condemned a car bombing that had occurred in Doha, Qatar the previous day. One Briton, Jon Adams was killed. Al-Qaradawi issued a statement that said[tpl]bquote|Such crimes are committed by insane persons who have no religious affiliation and play well into the hands of the enemies ... I urge all Qataris to stand united in facing such an epidemic and uproot it to nip the infection in the bud, otherwise it will spread like wildfire. I, in the name of all scholars in Qatar, denounce such a horrendous crime and pray that it would be the last and implore God to protect this secure country.[/tpl]
According to IslamOnline, Qaradawi released a fatwa on 14 April 2004 stating boycott of American and Israeli products was an obligation for all who are able. The fatwa reads in part :
On 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited Gaza and gave a speech in support of Hamas. He asked all of the Palestinian people to work with other Arab people and Muslims around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as "Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death" and "We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch."[tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/08/uk-palestinians-gaza-cleric-idUKBRE94714K20130508 |title=Influential Muslim cleric visits Hamas-ruled Gaza |author=Nidal al-Mughrabi |date=8 May 2013[/tpl]

====Iraq war====

In an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of Saddam Hussein under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people "after liberating Iraq from American colonialism". He also suggested that the trial was "an act of vengeance by the Americans" for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=iraq&ID=SP142707 |title=Middle East Media Research Institute |publisher=MEMRI |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cquote|A human soul must be respected.

Anybody whose last words are 'There is no God but Allah' goes to Paradise. The thing that improves record of Saddam Hussein is that in his final years – as the brothers in Iraq tell us – he was a changed man. He began to strictly observe the prayers, to read the Quran, and to do charitable work. He would hasten to do anything that may help people. He would help build mosques, and would say that if anybody wants to build a mosque, the government should pay half the cost of the building materials. When they entered his secret hideout and caught him, they found a prayer carpet and an open Quran.[/tpl]

====Hizb Allah (Party of God)====

In 2006, in response to Muslim scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen's fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for Hezbollah because they are Shia, al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added "Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches" and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of Iraq to end the civil war.Qaradawi urges Muslims to support Hezbollah. Gulf Times
Seven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to wage jihad against Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran: "The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis.... Now we know what the Iranians want.... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis."Syria conflict: Cleric Qaradawi urges Sunnis to join rebels BBC News, 1 June 2013 Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah.

====Arab Spring====

Qaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the National Transitional Council in the 2011 Libyan civil war, urging Arab nations to recognize them and "to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli". He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist the, and said "Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi."[tpl]cite news|title=Recognise Libyan rebels: Qaradawi|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=421411&version=1&template_id=36&parent_id=16|newspaper=Gulf Times|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=20 March 2011[/tpl]
In response to the 2011 Bahrain protests, Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: "The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis." He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: "I want them to be real citizens of their country."[tpl]cite news|title=Bharaini Sunnis, Shias should talk to resolve issues: Qaradawi|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/146271-bharaini-sunnis-shias-should-talk-to-resolve-issues-qaradawi.html|accessdate=30 March 2011|newspaper=The Peninsula|date=20 March 2011[/tpl]
Qaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the 2011 Syrian uprising, saying "Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station," and "It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community."[tpl]cite news|title=Protests in Syria's Daraa city, journalists banned|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1628710.php/Protests-in-Syria-s-Daraa-city-journalists-banned|newspaper=Deutsche Presse-Agentur|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria's "oppressive regime", claiming "atrocities" were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba'ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian regime,someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya, saying "The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny" and slamming Arab League leader Amr Moussa for criticism of it.[tpl]cite news|title=Qaradawi condemns 'atrocities' against protesters in Syria|author=Nour Abuzant|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=424384&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56|newspaper=Gulf Times|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl]

===Women and gender issues===

Commenting on the role women played in social active issues:  Although over sixty years have passed since the Movement emerged into existence, no women leaders have appeared that can confront secular and Marxist trends single-handedly and efficiently. This has come about as a result of men's unrelenting attempts to control women's movement, as men have never allowed women a real chance to express themselves and show special leadership talents and abilities that demonstrate their capability of taking command of their work without men's dominance.
 I believe that women's Islamic work will succeed and prove itself in the arena of the Islamic Movement only when it gives birth to female Islamic leaders in the fields of Call, thought, science, literature and education.
Accordingly, women as well as men can dedicate themselves to Allah, and play a role in jihad.Advisory opinion of the scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi on women's participation in martyrdom operations
I do not think that this is impossible or even difficult. There are genius women just as there are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al­ Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.

====Rape====

In 2004 The Daily Telegraph reported that IslamOnline was asked the following question "Are raped women punished in Islam?", and a panel headed by Qaradawi replied: "To be absolved from guilt, the raped woman must have shown some sort of good conduct.... Islam addresses women to maintain their modesty, as not to open the door for evil.... The Koran calls upon Muslim women in general to preserve their dignity and modesty, just to save themselves from any harassment.... So for a rape victim to be absolved from guilt, she must not be the one that opens ... her dignity for deflowering"[tpl]cite news|last=Syal|first=Rajeev |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1466715/For-her-to-be-absolved-from-guilt-a-raped-woman-must-have-shown-good-conduct.html|title=For her to be absolved from guilt, a raped woman must have shown good conduct|work=The Telegraph|date=11 July 2004|accessdate=11 April 2010|location=London[/tpl]
Officials from IslamOnline.net, however, denied that al-Qaradawi wrote the answer and reported that the article by the Sunday Telegraph was challenged by the Muslim Association of Britain, who also believed the article falsely attributed the comments to al-Qaradawi and was part of a "right-wing media" attempt to "stoke up the flames of hate" against al-Qaradawi. They demanded that The Telegraph issue a full apology as well as the resignation of the two writers of the article.UK Group To Sue Telegraph Over "False" Qaradawi Story by Mustafa Abdel-Halim, IOL Correspondent, 14 July 2004

In an interview with Der Spiegel, Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, "One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn't me who came up with this mindset.

==Reception in the Muslim world==

In 2004, 2,500 Muslim academics from 23 countries condemned Qaradawi, and accused him of giving "Islam a bad name and fostering hatred among civilizations" and "providing a religious cover for terrorism".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&section=0&article=53683&d=30&m=10&y=2004|title=Stop Terror Sheikhs, Muslim Academics Demand|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=15874|title=Be merciful to Qaradawi|publisher=Ikhwanweb|accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl] In 2012, Qardawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qardawi during the Arab Spring,Khalid al-Saif, "This is what Ibn Aqil said about Qardawi!" 6 October 2012. a charge he denied.
Pakistani scholar, Muhammad Taqi Usmani stated, "There is no doubt that I—as the lowest student of Islamic Fiqh—with my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-Qaradāwī to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of works, have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results the he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtilāf) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtihādī) are natural, and cannot be the sole basis for judging author so long as the people of knowledge do not deem bearers of such opinions to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and any case the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da'wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree."
In addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, "What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman" but exempts Qardawi by saying, "As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. this I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dā'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist."[tpl]cite web|last=Uthmani|first=Muhammad Taqi|title=Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, as I Have Known Him|url=http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/yusuf-al-qaradawi-as-i-have-known-him-by-mufti-taqi-uthmani-h/|publisher=SuhaibWebb|accessdate=28 June 2011[/tpl]

Qaradawi called Russia an "enemy of Islam" due to the country's friendly relations with Syria and its government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/europe/459988-qaradawi-russia-censure-wins-chechen-ire.html |title=Qaradawi Russia Censure Wins Chechen Ire - Europe - News |publisher=OnIslam.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl]
His remarks drew strong criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to Chechen President Razman Kadyrov, "Qaradawi's statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia." Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi's statements are mainly "directed against the Muslims of Russia, who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=10080 |title=Interfax-Religion |publisher=Interfax-Religion |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl]

===Fatwa controversy with MEMRI===

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) (citing Asharq Al-Awsat), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the Iraqi insurgency, saying,
 
 All of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and killing of Americans in Iraq is a religious obligation so as to cause them to leave Iraq immediately. The mutilation of corpses however is forbidden in Islam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=subjects&Area=jihad&ID=SP79404#_edn1|title=Memri| accessdate=18 June 2007[/tpl]
Al-Qaradawi, however, denies this allegation:
 I have not published a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists' Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question – are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word "killing" but rather I say "struggle", which is a more comprehensive word than the word "killing" and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the taking of hostages on a number of occasions in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.MEMRI as above, citing Al Hayat

Al -Qaradawi has authored more than 80 books and his academic style and objective thought are considered to be some of the main characteristics of his works. His most famous work is The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam. Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was "the duty of every Muslim family". His book Fiqh al-Zakat is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of zakat. Abul Ala Maududi commented on it as "the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)"
The prominent Deobandi Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani, said this about the work:Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, as I Have Known Him
 The first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh and its jurisprudential theory.
