On June 22, 1990 Robert and Lynda Douglas, of Springfield, Ohio were suspected of committing a grocery store robbery in Maquoketa, Iowa.  The pair left Maquoketa with Stammeyer pursuing them.  The chase, which reached speeds of 90 MPH took the suspects and the following officers through Jackson and Dubuque counties.  During the course of the pursuit Stammeyer was shot in the throat and shoulders, but continued to follow until the suspect's vehicle spun out near Key West, Iowa.  Robert Douglas killed his wife before officers shot and arrested him.  Douglas was later convicted of murder.
On July 1 Stammeyer retired from the patrol.  The next year he was honored with the Commissioner's Certificate of Valor for his actions during the pursuit and standoff.  Stammeyer was later featured on the Top Cop television show.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=202353 |title= Officer hurt in 1990 shootout dies: Stammeyer received certificate of valor for his actions |accessdate= 2008-05-21 |last= Carton |first= Rebbecca |work= Dubuque Telegraph Herald |publisher= Woodward Communications, Inc.
