[[1965 English cricket season]]

CATEGORIES: English cricket seasons from 1946 to 1968, 1965 in English cricket, 1965 in English sport

The 1965 English cricket season was the first season since the 1912 Triangular Tournament in which England played Test series against two touring sides. In the first half of a damp summer, New Zealand were the tourists, and England won all three matches. The South African side that toured in the second half of the season proved much tougher opposition, and won the three-match Test series one-nil, with two matches drawn. This was the last tour of England by a South African side before the ending of sporting links because of apartheid. 
The season also marked the end of Fred Trueman's international career, although he did not retire from first-class cricket until the end of the 1968 season.

==Test series==

For the first time since the 1912 Triangular Tournament, England hosted two series in one season.  The visitors were New Zealand and South Africa, who played three Tests each against England.  This was to be the last South African tour for over 25 years.  Opposition to the country's apartheid policy was increasing.
England were far too strong for New Zealand, winning all three matches, John Edrich scoring 310* in the final match at Headingley. He put on 369 with Ken Barrington for the second wicket. This was the culmination of a remarkable run of form for Edrich. In nine successive innings (the first eight being for Surrey) he scored 139, 121*, 205*, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310*.
South Africa, a young and improving side, were a far tougher proposition. Their players included Graeme Pollock and his brother Peter, Colin Bland and Eddie Barlow. South Africa won the series 1-0, with two matches drawn, thanks to the Pollock brothers, who were mainly responsible for their win by 94 runs in the Second Test at Trent Bridge. In overcast conditions, ideal for Tom Cartwright in particular, Graeme scored 125 out of 160 in 140 minutes, the last 91 coming in 70 minutes. He had come in at 16-2, and the score had declined to 80-5, before his partnerships with the captain, Peter van der Merwe, and Richard Dumbrill enabled the score to reach 269. He made another 59 in the second innings. His brother contributed bowling figures of 5-53 and 5-34.
