[[Randonneurs USA]]

CATEGORIES: Cycling organizations in the United States

Randonneurs USA or RUSA is the Audax Club Parisien-approved brevet coordinating organization for the United States.  U.S. Cyclists riding in the Paris–Brest–Paris qualify for the event through RUSA. RUSA also promotes randonneuring within the U.S..
Randonneuring is a style of bicycle riding that requires covering long-distances within a generously allotted time period of almost continuous riding.  As randonneurs, riders do not compete against their fellow cyclists, but only against their own personal best, the weather and the mind's desire for sleep.  Skills in self-sufficiency, bicycle mechanics, night-riding and endurance are all valued over ability to cycle at racing speeds or with racing strategies.

==RUSA Specific Events==

In addition to the support for ACP events, RUSA offers several other events including RUSA-ONLY brevets.  A very popular RUSA only event is the Permanent.  
The Permanent is a members-only event where a member can contact a Permanent Owner to sign up to do the Permanent and then eventually ride the Permanent. The Permanent can be used to help complete other RUSA ONLY awards such as the R-12 or RUSA Distance Awards.
