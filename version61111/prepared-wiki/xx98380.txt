The Republic of Ingushetia ([tpl]lang-ru|Респу́блика Ингуше́тия[/tpl], Respublika Ingushetiya; [tpl]lang-inh|ГӀалгӀай Мохк[/tpl] [tpl]transl|inh|Ğalğaj Moxk[/tpl]), commonly referred to as Ingushetia, is a federal subject of Russia (a republic), located in the North Caucasus region with its capital at Magas. In terms of area, the republic is the smallest of Russia's federal subjects except for the two federal cities, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. It was established on June 4, 1992 after the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was split in two. The republic is home to the indigenous Ingush, a people of Vainakh ancestry. Population: 412,529 (2010 Census).[tpl]ru-pop-ref|2010Census[/tpl]
The name "Ingushetia" is derived from an ancient village of Ongusht (renamed in 1859 to Tarskaya and in 1944 transferred to North Ossetia) and the Georgian ending -eti, all together meaning "(land) where the Ingush live".
Ingushetia is one of Russia's poorest and most restive regions. The ongoing military conflict in neighboring Chechnya has occasionally spilled into Ingushetia, and the republic has been destabilized by corruption, a number of high-profile crimes (including kidnapping and murder of civilians by government security forces[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8287143.stm |title=Ingushetia's cycle of violence |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2011-01-07[/tpl]), anti-government protests, attacks on soldiers and officers, Russian military excesses and a deteriorating human rights situation.Urgent Need for Vigorous Monitoring in the North Caucasus.

==Geography==

Ingushetia is situated on the northern slopes of the Caucasus. Its area is reported by various sources as either [tpl]convert|2000|km2|sp=us[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_03.htm|title=Территория, число районов, населённых пунктов и сельских администраций по субъектам Российской Федерации (Territory, Number of Districts, Inhabited Localities, and Rural Administration by Federal Subjects of the Russian Federation)|accessdate=2011-11-01|author=Федеральная служба государственной статистики (Federal State Statistics Service)|date=2004-05-21|work=Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года (All-Russia Population Census of 2002)|publisher=Federal State Statistics Service|language=Russian[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|3600|km2|sp=us[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|url=http://ingushetia.ru/about/index.shtml|publisher=Official website of Ingushetia|accessdate=2013-04-19|title=Социально-экономические характеристики|language=Russian[/tpl] the difference in reporting is mainly due to the inclusion or exclusion of parts of Sunzhensky Districts.

Major rivers include:

===Natural resources===

Ingushetia is rich in marble, timber, dolomite, plaster, limestone, gravel, granite, clay, thermal medical water, rare metals, mineral water, oil (over 60 billion tons), and natural gas reserves.

===Climate===

Ingushetia's climate is mostly continental.

==Etymology==

The Ingush, a nationality group indigenous to the Caucasus, mostly inhabit Ingushetia. They refer to themselves as Ghalghai (from Ingush: Ghala ("fortress" or "town") and  ghai ("inhabitants" or "citizens"). The Ingush speak the Ingush language, which has a very high degree of mutual intelligibility with neighboring Chechen.

==Origin of Ingushetia's population==

According to Leonti Mroveli, the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the Vainakh ancestor Kavkas.The work of Leonti Mroveli: "The history of the Georgian Kings"dealing with the history of Georgia and the Caucasus since ancient times to the 5th century AD, is included in medieval code of Georgian annals "Kartlis Tskhovreba".
According to Professor George Anchabadze of Ilia State University "The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the Caucasus. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was "Kavkas", hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most "Caucasian" people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus – Kavkas – Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/1887/ |title=Caucasian Knot | An Essay On the History of the Vainakh People.

The Soviet-Russian anthropologists and scientists N.Ya. Marr, V.V. Bounak, R.M. Munchaev, I.M Dyakonov, E.I. Krupnov and G.A. Melikashvilli wrote: "Among Ingush the Caucasian type is preserved better than among any other North Caucasian nation",
Professor of anthropology V.V.Bounak "Groznenski Rabochi" 5, VII, 1935. Professor G.F.Debets recognized that Ingush Caucasian anthropologic type is the most Caucasian among Caucasians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ingush.ru/his7.asp|title=G.F.Debets[/tpl] In an article in Science Magazine Bernice Wuethrich states that American linguist Dr. Johanna Nichols " has used language to connect modern people of the Caucasus region to the ancient farmers of the Fertile Crescent"  and that her research suggests that "farmers of the region were proto-Nakh-Daghestanians. Nichols is quoted as stating: "The Nakh–Dagestanian languages are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to Western civilization" Dr. Henry Harpending, University of Utah supports her claims in the article.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158.full?sid=b73d602d-8965-4c4a-90ba-26a04c20dab7|title=Peering Into the Past, With Words[/tpl];Bernice Wuethrich, "Science" 2000: Vol. 288 no. 5469 p. 1158

==Genetics of Ingushetia's population==

The Ingush have 89% of J2 Y-DNA which is the highest known frequency in the world and J2 is closely associated with the Fertile Crescent.Oleg Balanovsky, Khadizhat Dibirova, Anna Dybo, Oleg Mudrak, Svetlana Frolova, Elvira Pocheshkhova, Marc Haber, Daniel Platt, Theodore Schurr, Wolfgang Haak, Marina Kuznetsova, Magomed Radzhabov, Olga Balaganskaya, Alexey Romanov, Tatiana Zakharova, David F.

Spencer Wells, Chris Tyler-Smith, Elena Balanovska, and The Genographic Consortium Parallel Evolution of Genes and Languages in the Caucasus Region Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011 : msr126v1-msr126
The mitochondrial DNA of the Ingush differs from other Caucasian populations and the rest of the world due to the Hardy–Weinberg principle. "The Caucasus populations exhibit, on average, less variability than other World populations for the eight Alu insertion poly-morphisms analysed here. The average heterozygosity is less than that for any other region of the world, with the exception of Sahul. Within the Caucasus, Ingushians have much lower levels of variability than any of the other populations. The Ingushians also showed unusual patterns of mtDNA variation when compared with other Caucasus populations (Nasidze and Stoneking, submitted), which indicates that some feature of the Ingushian population history, or of this particular sample of Ingushians, must be responsible for their different patterns of genetic variation at both mtDNA and the Alu insertion loci."[tpl]cite journal |author=Ivane Nasidze et al. |year=2001 |title=Alu insertion polymorphisms and the genetic structure of human populations from the Caucasus |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=9 |pages=267–272 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200615 |pmid=11313770 |issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v9/n4/pdf/5200615a.pdf|title=Alu insertion polymorphisms and the genetic structure of human populations from the Caucasus|format=PDF[/tpl]

==History==

===Modern Ingush history===

Ingush were/are traditionally a classless society based on a clan system and unwritten law (approximately 350 clans live in Ingushetia today). Every member within a clan and clans themselves are viewed as equal. Unlike the neighboring nations in the Caucasus (including Chechens), Ingush never had social superiors of inferiors.
The Ingush/Ingushetia were also known by the following names: Gelia (American cartographer J. H. Coltonhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Colton%2C_G.W._Turkey_In_Asia_And_The_Caucasian_Provinces_Of_Russia._1856_%28A%29.jpg), Tschetschna (German geographers Joseph Grassl and Joseph Meyerhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Karte_des_Kaukasischen_Isthmus_-_Entworfen_und_gezeichnet_von_J-Grassl_-_1856.jpg), Ghalghai/Gelgai (Self), Nakh (self, meaning "people"), Vainakh (self, meaning "our people"), Kist (Georgian), Gergar (Self), Dzurdzuk (Georgian), Ghlighvi (Georgian), Angushtini (Russian), Mack-aloni (Ossetian), Orstkhoi (self), Nart-Orstkhoi (self), Galash (self), Tsori (self), Dzheirakhoi (self), Khamhoi (self), Metshal (self), Fyappi (self), and Nyasareth (self). The self namings represent different Vainakh tribes which make up Ingush population today[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ingushetia.org/article/95.html |title=The Land of Towers |author=Khasan Sampiev[/tpl]  The history of the Ingush is closely related to Chechens. Roman, Georgian, and later Russian missionaries Christianised the Ingush. The remains of several churches, notably the Tkhabya-Yerd and the Albe-Yerd can be found in Ingushetia. Ingush peacefully converted to Islam at the end of the 19th century which is almost three centuries after the beginning of Islamization in Chechnya and Dagestan.
Russian historians claim that the Ingush volunteered to become a part of Russia. This conclusion is based mostly on the document signed on 13 June 1810 by General-Major Delpotso and representatives of 2 Ingush clans. Other clans resisted the Russian conquest. On June 29, 1832 Russian barron Rozen reported in letter No.42 to count Chernishev that "on the 23rd of this month I exterminated eight Ghalghai (Ingush) villages. On the 24th I exterminated nine more villages near Targim." By November 12, 1836 (letter no.560, he was claiming that highlanders of Dzheirkah, Kist, and Ghalghai had been temporarily conquered.[tpl]cite web|author=Албогачиева М. |url=http://www.groznycity.ru/museum/history/albogachieva/document4261_5.shtml |title=Многоликая Ингушетия |publisher=Groznycity.ru |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] The Russian conquest was extremely difficult and the Russian forces began to rely on the method of colonization: extermination of local population and populating area with Cossack and Ossetian loyalists.
Colonization of Ingush land by Russians and Ossetians started in the middle of the 19th century. Russian General Evdokimov and Ossetian colonel Kundukhov in 'Opis no. 436' "gladly reported" that "the result of colonization of Ingush land was successful":
After the losses the remaining Ingush clans resorted mostly to underground resistance. The Russians built the fortress Vladikavkaz ("ruler of the Caucasus") on the place of Ingush village of Zaur.[tpl]cite book |author= P.G.Butkov |title= Materials of the new history of the Caucasus years 1722–1803 St. Petersburg 1869 (page 165) [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author= E.Bronevski |title= New geographical and historical perspectives of the Caucasus.

He suggested the separation of the Ingush and Chechens in order for Russia to win the war in the Caucasus. In another letter from General Ermolov to Lanski (dated 12 January 1827) on the impossibility of forceful Christianization of the Ingush, Yermolov wrote: "This nation, the most courageous and militaristic among all the highlanders, cannot be allowed to be alienated..."  The last organized rebellion (the so-called "Nazran insurrection") in Ingushetia occurred in 1858 when 5,000 Ingush started a fight but lost to superior Russian forces. The rebellion signalled the end of the First Russo-Caucasian War. In the same year, the Russian Tsar offered help in the deportation of Ingush and Chechens to Turkey and the Middle East by claiming that "Muslims need to live under Muslim rulers". It seems that he wanted to liberate the land for Ossetians and Cossaks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |title=The Ingush (with notes on the Chechen): Background information |accessdate=2007-02-10 |author=Johanna Nichols |date=February 1997 |work=University of California, Berkeley[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Some Ingush willingly went into exile to deserted territory in the Middle East where many of them died.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Soviets promised the Ingush that the villages and towns annexed during the colonization would be returned to the Ingush. Ingushetia becomes a major battleground between the old archenemies: general Denikin and Ingush resistance fighters. In his memoirs general Denikin writes: "Ingush people are the least numerous, most welded, and strongly martial organization. They were, in essence, the supreme arbiter of the North Caucasus. The moral of the appearance was defined long ago in Russian text-books of geography, "the chief occupation – animal husbandry and robbery ..." The last one of the two reached special art in the society. Political aspirations came from the same trend. The Ingush are mercenaries of the Soviet regime, they support it but don’t let the spread of it in their province. At the same time they tried to strike up relations with Turkey and sought the assistance from the Turks from Elisavetpol, and Germany – from Tiflis. In August, when the Cossacks and Ossetians captured Vladikavkaz, the Ingush intervened and saved the Soviet Board of Commissioners of Terek, but cruelly plundered the city and captured the state bank and mint. They robbed all the neighbors: the Cossacks and Ossetians in the name of "correcting historical errors".[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DzO9H7wAFeAC&dq=bibliogroup%3A%22Ocherki+russko%C4%AD+smuty%22&q=%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8| title=Ocherki Russkoi Smuti[/tpl] 21 December 1917 Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Dagestan declared independence from Russia and formed a single state "United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus" (also known as Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus) which was recognized by major world powers.

After 13 years of exile Ingush were allowed to return to Checheno-Ingushetia (but not to Ordzhonikidze or the Prigorodny District). Most of Ingushetia's territory had been settled by Ossetians and part of the region had been transferred to North Ossetia. The returning Ingush faced considerable animosity from the Ossetians. The Ingush were forced to buy their homes back from the Ossetians and Russians. These hardships and injustices led to a peaceful Ingush protest in Grozny in 16 January 1973, which was crushed by the Soviet troops[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/news/12884.html |title=35 years later.

In 1991, when the Chechens declared independence from the Soviet Union to form the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the Ingush chose to secede from the Chechen-Ingush Republic. Thus, in 1992 the Ingush joined the newly created Russian Federation to try to resolve the conflict with Ossetia peacefully, also in the hope that the Russians would return their land as a token of their loyalty. However, ethnic tensions in North Ossetia which were orchestrated by Ossetian ultra nationalists (per Helsinki human Right watch), led to the outbreak of the Ossetian–Ingush conflict in late October, when another ethnic cleansing of the Ingush population started. Thousands of Ingush civilians were taken hostage by combined Russian and Ossetian forces. Including over 500 Ingush hostages held in Beslan high-school. According to media reports, the Beslan high school gymnasium was one of several buildings in which the Ossetian militants had held hundreds of Ingush hostages, many of them women and children. The hostages were all kept in the same gymnasium, and deprived of food and water; at least one newborn, and several dozen male hostages were executed.[tpl]Wayback |date=20051215183917 |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/news/6214.html |title=Bashir Izmailov Witness Testimony [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://old.ingushetiyaru.org/news/6227.html |title=Ruslan Belkharoyev Witness Testimony |publisher=Old.ingushetiyaru.org |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl]Terror lingers in Russia's Caucasus region, Chicago Tribune, 12 October 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://old.ingushetiyaru.org/news/6214.html |title=ИНГУШЕТИЯ.РУ  Новости |publisher=Old.ingushetiyaru.org |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] Over 60,000 Ingush civilians being forced from their homes in the Prigorodny District of North Ossetia.

In 1994, when the first Russo-Chechen war started, the number of refugees in Ingushetia from both conflicts doubled. According to the UN, for every citizen of Ingushetia, one refugee arrived from Ossetia or Chechnya. This influx was very problematic for the economy, which collapsed after Aushev's success. The second Russo-Chechen war which started in 1999 brought more refugees (at some point there was one refugee for every Ingush citizen: 240,000 from Chechnya plus 60,000 from North Ossetia at the peak in 2000) and misery to Ingushetia. In 2001, Aushev was forced to leave his presidency and was succeeded by Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general. The situation worsened under his rule.

For example, according to a Russian news agency a murder of an ethnic-Russian school teacher in Ingushetia was committed by two ethnic-Russian and ethnic-Ossetian soldiers; Issa Merzhoev the Ingush Police detective who solved the crime was shot at and killed by "unknown" assailants shortly after he had identified the murderer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2007/08/29/2103857.shtml|title=The Murderers are not Insurgents |accessdate=2007-09-29 |author=B.Polonkoev |date=August 2007 |work=www.gazeta.ru[/tpl]
At least four people were injured when a vehicle exploded on 24 March 2008. An upsurge in violence in these months targeted local police officers and security forces.

On October 18, 2008, a Russian military convoy came under grenade attack and machine gun fire near Nazran.

On October 30, 2008 Zyazikov was dismissed from his office (he himself claimed he resigned voluntarily). On the next day, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov was nominated by Dmitry Medvedev and approved as President by the People's Assembly of Ingushetia (later the title President was rennamed to Head).

===Military history===

According to professor Johanna Nichols, in all the recorded history and reconstructable prehistory the Ingush people have never undertaken battle except in defense. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC Pharnavaz, his son Saurmag the Iberian kings, and the relatives of Ingush people per Leonti Mroveli, received military assistance from Ingush people in defence of Iberia against the Kartli occupation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080217060433/http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html|archivedate=2008-02-17|title=The Land of Towers |author=Khasan Sampiev[/tpl]
During World War I, 500 cavalrymen from an Ingush regiment of the Wild Division boldly attacked the German Iron Division.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The Russian Emperor Nicholas II, assessing the performance of the Ingush and Chechen regiments during the Brusilov breakthrough on the Russian-German front in 1915 wrote in his telegram to the Governor-General of the Tersky region Fleisher:
[tpl]bquote|The Ingush regiment pounced upon the German "Iron Division" like an avalanche. It was immediately supported by the Chechen regiment. The Russian history, including the history of our Preobrazhensky regiment, does not know a single instance of a horse cavalry attacking an enemy force armed with heavy artillery: 4.5 thousand killed, 3.5 thousand taken prisoner, 2.5 thousand wounded. Less than in an hour and a half the "Iron Division" ceased to exist, the division that had aroused fear in the best armies of our allies. On behalf of me, the royal court and the whole of the Russian army send our best regards to fathers, mothers, sisters, wives and brides of those brave sons of the Caucasus whose heroism paved the way for the destruction of German hordes. Russia bows low to the heroes and will never forget them. I extend my fraternal greetings, Nicholas II, August 25, 1915.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=eng&section=historyeng&row=11 |title=Chechen History[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1941, when Germans attacked the USSR, the whole Russian front was retreating 40 km a day. Out of 6,500 defenders of Brest Fortress 6,000 Soviet troops capitulated. 500 troops were fresh conscripts of Ingush and Chechen origin. Defenders held the fortress for over a month against the Germans and even managed to stage several attacks from the Fortress. The last defender's name has been unknown for a long time; his documents identified him as a man called Barkhanoyev. Decades later, official records revealed it was Umatgirei Barkhanoyev from the Ingush village of Yandare. Recently, the memoirs of Stankus Antanas, a Lithuanian national and former Waffen SS officer, were published in Ingushetia. He recalls that in July 1941, his regiment was ordered to "finish off" the remaining Soviet soldiers in the fortress. When the Nazis decided that no defenders had been left alive, an SS general lined up his soldiers on the parade ground to award them with decorations for capturing the fortress. Then, a Red Army officer came out from the fortress's underground bunker:
[tpl]bquote|He was blind because of his wounds and walked with his left arm extended forward. His right hand rested on a gun holster. He walked along the parade grounds wearing a ragged uniform, but his head was held high. The entire division was shocked at the sight. Approaching a shell-hole, he turned his face toward the west. The German general suddenly saluted this last defender of the Brest Fortress, and the rest of the officers followed suit. The Red Army officer drew a handgun and shot himself in the head. He fell on the ground facing Germany. A deep-drawn sigh aired over the parade grounds. We all stood 'frozen' in awe of this brave man.[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20050505/39887224.html |author= Russian News and Information Agency RIA Novosti |title= Russian News and Information Agency RIA Novosti: DEFENSE OF THE MOTHERLAND IS EVERY MUSLIM'S DUTY [/tpl][/tpl]
In 1994–1996 Ingush volunteers fought alongside Chechens in the Russian-Chechen war. Besides few[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] incidents (including the killings of Ingush civilians by the Russian soldiers), Ingushetia was largely kept out of the war by determined policy of non-violence pursued by President Ruslan Aushev.
This changed after the beginning of the Second Chechen War, and especially since Murat Zyazikov became the second Russian appointed president of Ingushetia in 2002. The first major rebel attack of the conflict, in which a military convoy was destroyed occurred in May 2000 and caused the deaths of 19 soldiers. In the June 2004 Nazran raid, Chechen and Ingush rebels attacked government buildings and military bases across Ingushetia, resulting in the deaths of at least 90 Ingush people and unknown number of Russian troops. Among them the Republic's acting interior minister Abukar Kostoyev, his deputy Zyaudin Kotiyev. In response to a sharp escalation in attacks by insurgents since the summer of 2007,TIMELINE OF VIOLENCE IN INGUSHETIA: SUMMER-FALL 2007[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] Moscow sent in an additional 25,000 MVD and FSB troops, tripling the number of special forces in Ingushetia.

==Economy==

There are some natural resources in Ingushetia: mineral water in Achaluki, oil and natural gas in Malgobek, forests in Dzheirakh, metals in Galashki. The local government is considering the development of tourism however this is problematic due to the uneasy situation in the republic itself and the proximity of some conflict zones. However, Ingushetia continues to remain as one of Russia's poorest republics, largely due to the ongoing conflict, corruption and civil disorders. Unemployment is estimated to be around 53%, and growing poverty is a major issue.
