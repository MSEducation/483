Drought  is an extended period when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply whether surface or underground water.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.It's a scorcher - and Ireland is officially 'in drought' Irish Independent, 2013-07-18. Generally, this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region. Although droughts can persist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant damageLiving With Drought and harm to the local economy.Australian Drought and Climate Change, retrieved on June 7th 2007.  Prolonged drought has caused cause mass migrations and humanitarian crises.
Many plant species, such as cacti, have adaptations such as reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands.Keddy, P.A. 2007. Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p.  Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity.

==Consequences==

Periods of droughts can have significant environmental, agricultural, health, economic and social consequences. The effect varies according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources. Areas with populations that depend on  as a major food source are more vulnerable to famine.
Drought can also reduce water quality, because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources. Common consequences of drought include:

==Globally==

Drought is a normal, recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world. It is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the Epic of Gilgamesh and tied to the biblical story of Joseph's arrival in and the later Exodus from Ancient Egypt.BBC - Weather Centre - Features - History and Religion - Weather in the Bible - Drought and Famine Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon,Ancient Chile Migration Mystery Tied to Drought as has the exodus of early humans out of Africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago.Drought pushed ancient African immigration 
Modern people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities.

Well-known historical droughts include:
The Darfur conflict in Sudan, also affecting Chad, was fueled by decades of drought; combination of drought, desertification and overpopulation are among the causes of the Darfur conflict, because the Arab Baggara nomads searching for water have to take their livestock further south, to land mainly occupied by non-Arab farming people.Looking to water to find peace in Darfur

Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a "tipping point" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate. According to the WWF, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.Climate change a threat to Amazon rainforest, warns WWF, World Wide Fund for Nature, March 9, 2996.

By far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.Sensitivity of the Australian Monsoon to insolation and vegetation: Implications for human impact on continental moisture balance, Geological Society of America In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008.Australian rivers 'face disaster', BBC News Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008.Australia faces worse, more frequent droughts: study, Reuters Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world’s first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population.Metropolis strives to meet its thirst, BBC News  The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010.

In 2012, a severe drought struck the western Sahel. The Methodist Relief & Development Fund (MRDF) reported that more than 10 million people in the region were at risk of famine due to a month long heat wave that was hovering over Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. A fund of about £20,000 was distributed to the drought-hit countries.http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/12566

==Causes==

Generally, rainfall is related to the amount and dew point (determined by air temperature) of water vapour carried by regional atmosphere, combined with the upward forcing of the air mass containing that water vapour. If these combined factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface, the result is a drought. This can be triggered by high level of reflected sunlight, (high albedo), and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses (i.e. reduced water content), and ridges of high pressure areas from behaviors which prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Oceanic and atmospheric weather cycles such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) make drought a regular recurring feature of the Americas along the Midwest and Australia. Guns, Germs, and Steel author Jared Diamond sees the stark impact of the multi-year ENSO cycles on Australian weather patterns as a key reason that Australian aborigines remained a hunter-gatherer society rather than adopting agriculture.Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond 1997, pgs 308-309  Another climate oscillation known as the North Atlantic Oscillation has been tied to droughts in northeast Spain.[tpl]cite journal|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon/ChristopherMonckton08-d/Vicente-SerranoCuadrat07-NAOonNESpainDroughts.pdf|title=North Atlantic oscillation control of droughts in north-east Spain: evaluation since 1600 A.D.|author=Sergio M.

==Types==

As a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases. People tend to define droughts in three main ways:NOAA factsheet, retrieved April 10, 2007
