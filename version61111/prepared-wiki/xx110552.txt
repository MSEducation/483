[[Boeing Phantom Works]]

CATEGORIES: Boeing

The Phantom Works division is the advanced prototyping arm of the Defense and Security side of The Boeing Company. Its primary focus is developing advanced military products and technologies, many of them highly classified.
Founded by McDonnell Douglas, the research and development group continued after Boeing acquired the company.  Its logo was derived from the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom combat jet.

==Scope and responsibility==

Phantom Works' organization mirrors that of Boeing's Defense business units, with 'Advanced' versions of each unit (e.g. Advanced Boeing Military Aircraft). The underlying technology is provided by the Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) organization, who develop new technologies (i.e. Technology Readiness Level 1-4) for use by Boeing's Commercial and Defense units.  Phantom Works responsibility is to grow those technologies into prototype (i.e. Technology Readiness Level 4-6) to then transition those prototypes to the business units to turn into products (i.e. Technology Readiness Level 7-9).

==Locations==

Headquartered in St Louis, Phantom Works has projects throughout the majority of Boeing locations in the United States.
