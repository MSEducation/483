OpenBroadcaster is an open source system to run Community Radio and TV broadcast transmitters with a simple web interface.

==History==

The initial concept was to develop a web based radio system to run emergency messages and public service announcements for export to Africa as part of a Yukon College innovation project originating from Tagish Yukon Territory Canada by  using a windup radio designed by Trevor Baylis. 
On Labour Day weekend, 1997 CFET-FM 106.7FM was launched, for the benefit of communities in Tagish, Johnson's Crossing and Marsh Lake, YT. It was a one-man operation, but local volunteers could record material for sending to the station via the internet for broadcast. The same system could be used for the community's local emergency population warning   for instantaneous relay of Yukon Forestry Service alerts for Wildfire situations.   2004 CFET-FM Radio  began using OpenBroadcaster for User Generated Radio. CJUC Whitehorse Yukon  was put into production at radio station .
