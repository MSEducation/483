[[Queen's Dock, Port of Liverpool]]

CATEGORIES: Liverpool docks

Queen's Dock is a dock on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to King's Dock to the north, Coburg Dock to the south. 
The dock was designed by Henry Berry and opened in 1785. It was later expanded by John Foster, Sr.. At its largest, the dock consisted of a main basin and two branch docks, which were separated by a graving dock. Branch Dock Number 2 (to the north) has since been filled in and is used as a car park. The graving dock is now straddled by an HM Revenue and Customs building.
This and the other docks in the southern system are owned by British Waterways.
