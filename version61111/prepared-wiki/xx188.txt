The Ministry remitted the case to the DCSD. In doing so the Ministry indicated that it regarded the DCSD's previous findings of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid.[ref]

</ref> The Ministry also instructed the DCSD to decide whether to reinvestigate.
On 12 March 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.

====Response of the scientific community====

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a petition"Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed". Retrieved 26 February 2006. among Danish academics. 308 scientists, many of them from the social sciences, criticised the DCSD's methods in the case and called for the DCSD to be disbanded.[ref]
</ref> The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency to
form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2002 Annual Report. Retrieved 13 February 2008. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures (primarily from the medical and natural sciences community) to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the Danish Research Agency.

===The top 50 sustainability books===

The alumni network of the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL) voted The Skeptical Environmentalist among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.[tpl]Cite book|last1= Visser |first1= Wayne |title=The Top 50 Sustainability Books |year= 2009 |publisher= Greenleaf Publishing |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-1-906093-32-7|pages=256 [/tpl]

==Continued debate and criticism==

The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003-2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.
The Lomborg Deception, a book by Howard Friel, claims to offer a "careful analysis" of the ways in which Lomborg has "selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence".[ref]
Philip Kitcher. The Climate Change Debates Science, Vol. 328, 4 June 2010, p. 1232.[/ref] Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument rebuttal. Friel has written a reply to this rebuttal, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg´s arguments. An attempt to analyse the controversy argument-by-argument is presented on the web site Lomborg-errors.
A Dutch think tank, HAN, Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, published a report in which they claimed 25 out of 27 accusations against Lomborg to be unsubstantiated or not to the point.Rörsch, Arthur, et al. "A Critical Consideration of the Verdict of the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty on the Book by Bjorn Lomborg 'The Skeptical Environmentalist'". Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, 4-April-2003. Retrieved 26 February 2006.
A group of scientists with relation to this think tank also published an article in 2005 in the Journal of Information Ethics,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Rörsch, A. et al. |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |date=Spring 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16[/tpl] in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

===Kåre Fog===

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of Journal of Information Ethics[tpl]Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |date=Fall 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66[/tpl] by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called "the Galileo hypothesis", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.
Kåre Fog has established a catalogue of criticisms against Lomborg on the Lomborg Errors website, established in 2004. Fog maintains the catalogue, which includes a section for each page in each chapter in The Skeptical Environmentalist and also deals with Lomborg´s other books and film. In each section, Fog lists and details what he believes to be flaws and errors in Lomborg's work. Fog explicitly indicates if there are any details which he believes support the interpretation that the particular error may have been made deliberately by Lomborg, in order to mislead. Although Lomborg previously has defended himself against the critique raised by a group of opponents in 1999 and 2002, especially in the web-book "Godhedens Pris",[tpl]cite web|url=http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/102-file/Reply_to_Skeptical_Questions.pdf|title=Short reply to Skeptical Questions, Sustainable Answers|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2002-06-27|work=lomborg.com[/tpl][ref]
</ref> he has never defended himself against the extensive critique raised against him by Kåre Fog after the complaint case and after the establishment of the Lomborg Errors web site in 2004.<ref>

==Further career==

===Government work===

In March 2002, the newly elected center-right prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.
In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government, and co-sponsored by The Economist. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, Global Crises, Global Solutions, edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by Cambridge University Press.

===Further books===

Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems, published in 2007, offers an "... overview of twenty-three of the world's biggest problems relating to the environment, governance, economics, and health and population. Leading economists provide a short survey of the state-of-the-art analysis and sketch out some policy solutions for which they provide cost-benefit ratios."[tpl]citation|title=Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems: costs and benefits|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-71597-3|oclc=165408072[/tpl]
Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming, also published in 2007, argues against taking immediate and "drastic" action to curb greenhouse gases while simultaneously stating that "Global warming is happening. It's a serious and important problem ...". He argues that "... the cost and benefits of the proposed measures against global warming. ... is the worst way to spend our money. Climate change is a 100-year problem — we should not try to fix it in 10 years."[tpl]citation|title=Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming|publisher=Cyan and Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=978-0-462-09912-5|oclc=271251227[/tpl]
Howard Friel wrote a book entitled The Lomborg Deception, which criticizes Lomborg, claiming that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public rebuttal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf?PHPSESSID=472777bb754a1c0c02d803620257a62a|title=A Response by Bjorn Lomborg to Howard Friel’s ‘The Lomborg Deception’|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|work=lomborg.com[/tpl]

==Personal life==

==Discussions in the media==

After the release of The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the media, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international mass media. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and print media around the world.
