Zemun (Serbian Cyrillic: Земун, [tpl]IPA-sh|zɛ̂,mun|pron[/tpl]) is a historical town and one of the 17 municipalities which constitute the City of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Before 1934, it was a town separate from Belgrade. The development of New Belgrade in the late 20th century joined them together in a continuous urban area.

==Name==

In  ancient times, the Celtic  and Roman  settlement was known as Taurunum.  The Frankish  chroniclers of the Crusades  mentioned it as Mallevila, a toponym from the 9th century.  This was also a period when a Slavic  name Zemln was recorded for the first time.  Believed to be derived from the word zemlja,  meaning earth, it was a basis for all other future  names of the city: modern Serbian Земун  (Cyrillic) or Zemun (Latin), Hungarian  Zimony and German  Semlin.

==History==

The area  of Zemun has been inhabited ever since the Neolithic period. Baden culture  graves and ceramics like bowls and anthropomorphic urns were found in the  town.http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/srejovic/dsrejovic-eneolit.html  Bosut culture  graves were found in nearby Asfaltna Baza.http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/balcanica/balcanica%2035/01%20Tasic.pdf  The first Celtic settlements in Taurunum area originate from the 3rd  century BC when the Scordisci occupied several Thracian and Dacian areas  of the Danube. The Romans came in the 1st century BC, Taurunum became  part of the Roman province of Pannonia around 15 AD. It had a fortressA manual of  ancient and modern history ...

After the Great Migrations the area  was under the authority of various peoples and states, including the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids and the Bulgarian Empire. The town was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary in the 12th century and in the 15th  century it was given as a personal possession to the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. After the  nearby Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1459, Zemun became an important military outpost. In 1521, the forces of Kingdom of Hungary, 500 šajkaši crew (led by Croat Marko Skoblić) consisted of Croats[tpl]cite book | title = Povijest Hrvatske I.

Zemun and the  southeastern Syrmia were conquered by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1717, after the Ottoman  defeat at the Battle of Peterwardein (5 August 1716) and through the Treaty of Požarevac (German: Passarowitz) became a property of the Schönborn family. In 1736, Zemun was the site of a peasant revolt. Its strategic  location near the confluence of the Sava and the Danube placed it in  the center of the continued border wars between the Habsburg and the  Ottoman empires. The Treaty of Belgrade of 1739 finally fixed the border, the Military Frontier was organized in the region in  1746, and the town of Zemun was granted the rights of a military commune  in 1749. In 1754, the population of Zemun included 1,900 Orthodox Christians, 600 Catholics, 76 Jews, and about 100 Romani. In 1777, the population of Zemun  numbered 1,130 houses with 6,800 residents, half of which were ethnic Serbs, while another half of population  was composed of Catholics, Jews, Armenians and Muslims. Among Catholic population, the largest ethnic group were Germans. From this period originates the increased settlement of Germans and Hungarians in the Zemun.
Zemun  prospered as an important road intersection and a border city. In 1816  it was greatly expanded by mass resettlement of Germans  and Serbs  in the new town suburbs of Franzenstal and Gornja Varoš, respectively.  In the 19th century, Zemun reached 7,089 residents and 1,310 houses.  Zemun also became important in Serbian history as the refuge for Karađorđe in 1813 as well as many other people from the nearby Belgrade and the rest of Karađorđe's Serbia which fell to the Ottoman rule.
During the Revolution of 1848-1849, Zemun was one of the de facto capitals of Serbian Vojvodina, a Serbian autonomous region  within Habsburg Empire,  but in 1849, it was returned under the administration of the Military  Frontier. With the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1882, Zemun  and the rest of Srem was included into Syrmia County of Croatia-Slavonia, which was an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. The first railway line that connected it to the  west was built in 1883, and the first railway bridge over the Sava followed shortly thereafter in 1884.
During the World War I in 1914, Zemun changed hands between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, finally ending up in Serbia on  November 5, 1918. The town became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The inter-war period was  marked by political struggle between the city gentry (organized into the Radical Party, Democratic Party and the Croatian Peasant Party) and the more socialist parties supported by the ethnic Germans.
In 1934 two intra-city bus lines were introduced connecting Zemun with the parts of Belgrade, and  the general shift of attention towards this issue was supported by the  growing Serbian  population of Zemun. The Zemun airbases originally built in 1927 were  an important geostrategic objective in the Axis invasion of April 1941. Following the surrender of Yugoslavia that same month, Zemun, along with the rest of Syrmia, was given to the Independent State of Croatia. The city was taken from Axis control in 1944, and since then, it is part of Serbian region known as Central Serbia.

==Geography==

Zemun originally developed on three hills, Gardoš,  Ćukovac  and Kalvarija, on the right bank of the Danube, where the widening of the  Danube begins and the Great War Island is formed at the mouth of the Sava river. The core of the city are  the neighborhoods of Donji Grad, Gardoš, Ćukovac and Gornji Grad. To the  south, Zemun continues into Novi Beograd with which it makes one  continuous urban area (neighborhood of Tošin Bunar). In the west it extends into the neighborhoods of Altina and Plavi Horizonti and to the north-west into Galenika, Zemun Polje and further into Batajnica.
The municipality is located in the eastern Syrmia region, in the central-western section of the Belgrade City area. The urban section of Zemun is the both most northern and western section of the urban Belgrade. Zemun borders the province of Vojvodina to the west (municipality of Stara Pazova), and municipalities of Surčin to the south, Novi Beograd to the south-east and Palilula and Stari Grad across the Danube.
The Danube bank in the north is mostly marshy, so the settlements are built further from the river (Batajnica) separated from it by hillocks (up to 114 m). The city of Zemun itself was built right on the bank, 100 meters above sea level. These are points of the Zemun loess plateau, an extension of the Syrmia loess plateau, which continues into the crescent-shaped Bežanijska Kosa loess hill on the south-east. The yellow loess is thick up to 40 meters and very fertile, with rich, grass-improved, humus chernozem. The uninhabited river islands of Great War Island and Little War Island on the Danube, also belong to the municipality Zemun, too. Municipality has an area of [tpl]convert|153|km²|0|abbr=off[/tpl].

==Neighbourhoods and suburbs==

The municipality has only two official settlements: (City of) Zemun, which is part of the urban Belgrade city proper (uža teritorija grada; statistically it is classified as Belgrade-part) and the village of Ugrinovci (with two hamlets  of Grmovac and Busije). Many of the neighbourhoods developed in the last few decades (Altina, Plavi Horizonti, Kamendin, Grmovac, Busije, etc.).

==Administration==

The municipality of Zemun became part of the Belgrade City Area (Teritorija grada Beograda) with the division of Yugoslavia into banovinas by king Alexander I on October 3, 1929. On April 1, 1934, municipality itself was absorbed into the municipality of Belgrade, so the post of the president of the municipality of Zemun was abolished and "Zemun section administrator" was appointed to the Belgrade's city government. 

In 1941-44 it was occupied by the German army as the Okupationsgebiet Ostsyrmien. Germany technically recognised  Zemun and surroundings as part of the Independent State of Croatia puppet regime but Zemun remained under direct German rule. 

After 1945 Zemun was administratively divided into the City of Zemun and Zemun district (srez), unlike rest of Belgrade which was divided into raions. In 1955 both City of Zemun and most of the Zemun district were incorporated into Belgrade again. In 1950s and 1960s, municipalities of Boljevci and Dobanovci were annexed to the municipality of Surčin while Batajnica was annexed to Zemun itself. In 1965 Surčin was annexed to the municipality of Zemun which marked the largest territorial expansion of Zemun (438 km²). However, on November 24, 2003 Belgrade City assembly voted to re-create the municipality of Surčin, but it remained under the administration of Zemun until November 3, 2004, when separate municipal government was established after the local elections. A motion for Batajnica to split from Zemun too was active for a while in early 2000s (see List of former and proposed municipalities of Belgrade).

==Economy and transportation==

Zemun is one of the most developed municipalities of Belgrade, with developed industries in almost every branch. Zemun has two large and still growing industrial zones, one located along the highway and the other one along the road to Batajnica and further to Novi Sad (Galenika, Goveđi Brod, etc.). Industries include: heavy agricultural machines and appliances (Zmaj), precise and optical instruments and automatized appliances (Teleoptik), clocks (INSA), busses and other heavy vehicles (Ikarbus), pharmaceuticals (Galenika), plastics (Grmeč), shoes (Obuća Beograd), textile (TIZ, Zekstra), food, candies and chocolate (Soko Štark), metals (IMPA, Intersilver), wood and furniture (Gaj, Reprek), recycling (INOS metali and INOS papir), beverages (Coca Cola, Navip), chemicals (Roma), building materials (DIA, Anicom), electronics, leather, etc. In addition to this dozens of halls, and warehouses are built throughout both industrial zones.
Several important roads of Serbia run through the municipality. The Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the old (Batajnički drum) and new (highway) road Belgrade-Novi Sad, the still in construction starting point (Batajnica-Dobanovci) of the future Belgrade beltway (Batajnica-Bubanj Potok), Belgrade-Novi Sad railway, etc. Zemun has no bridges, apart from the seasonal pontoon bridge which connects the mainland with the Great War Island during summer. First bridge over the Danube, Galenika-Borča bridge is still in project.
Batajnica Airbase with a limited civil traffic is also located in the municipality, near the Batajnica settlement.

==Architecture, culture and education==

The faculty of agriculture of the Belgrade University is located in Zemun, as well as many other important higher schools (Internal affairs, Economics, Technics and machines, Medicine, Zemun gymnasium) and institutes (Institute for agriculture and forestry, Institute for mining, world famous Institute for corn in Zemun Polje, Institute for livestock, Institute for the implementation of the nuclear energy in agriculture, Institute for physics). Zemun has a Homeland museum and Madlenianum Opera and Theatre.
Two of Belgrade's major hospitals-clinical centers are located in Zemun: "KBC Zemun" and "KBC Bežanijska Kosa", so as the retirement home "Bežanijska Kosa", the largest one in Belgrade. Churches include the Gardoš cemetery church and the Hariš chapel, Saint Nicholas, Saint Archangel Gabriel and two Roman Catholic churches.
Zemun is known for many squares, though almost all of them are small in size: Magistratski, Senjski, Veliki, Branka Radičevića, Karađorđev, Masarikov, etc. On one of them, the Zemun open green market is located. The bank of the Danube is turned into Zemunski Kej, a kilometers long promenade, with various entertainment facilities along it, including barges-cafés, amusement park and especially formerly largest hotel in Belgrade, Hotel Jugoslavija.
The remnants of the old town which existed during battles between Kingdom of Hungary and Byzantine Empire in 12th century are known as Zemunski Grad (Zemun Town).[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Today visible ruins however are of the medieval fortress (angular towers and parts of the defending wall) of the 1521 Ottoman siege. The Kula Sibinjanin Janka (The tower of Janos Hunyadi) or the Millennium tower was built and officially  opened  on August 20, 1896 to celebrate a thousand years of Hungarian settlement in the Pannonian plain.   The tower was built as a combination of various styles, mostly influenced by the Roman elements. Being a natural lookout, it was used by Zemun's firemen for decades. Today, the tower is better known after the Janos Hunyadi, who actually died in the old fortress four and a half centuries before the tower was built. In general, Gardoš is today the most recognizable symbol of Zemun. For the most part, the neighborhood preserved its old looks, with narrow, still mostly cobblestoned streets unsuitable for modern vehicles, and individual residential houses.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Zemun is not rich in parks. The largest one is the City park (Gradski park, built in 1880, scheduled for reconstruction in 2008 Politika daily, November 6, 2007, p.24) and another one is Jelovac in Kalvarija. A small park on the quay was renovated in November 2007.Beoinfo
