Molybdenum is a Group 6 chemical element with the symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin Molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|Μόλυβδος[/tpl] [tpl]lang|grc-Latn|molybdos[/tpl], meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.[tpl]Cite book|contribution = Molybdenum|year = 1994|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|volume = 4|page = 18|publisher = Chemical Rubber Publishing Company|isbn=0-8493-0474-1|editor=Lide, David R.[/tpl] Molybdenum minerals have been known into prehistory, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.
Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth, but rather in various oxidation states in minerals.
The free element, which is a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is in making many types of steel alloys, including high strength alloys and superalloys.
Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion [tpl]chem|MoO|4|2-[/tpl] is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water. Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production of the element) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications, as pigments, and as catalysts.
Molybdenum-containing enzymes are by far the most common catalysts used by some bacteria to break the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen, allowing biological nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation, and these nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a different form from the rest. Owing to the diverse functions of the various other types of molybdenum enzymes, molybdenum is a required element for life in all higher organisms (eukaryotes), though not in all bacteria.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5.5. It has a melting point of [tpl]convert|2623|°C|°F[/tpl]; of the naturally occurring elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points. Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at [tpl]convert|300|°C|°F[/tpl]. It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals.[tpl]cite book|last = Emsley|first = John|title = Nature's Building Blocks|url=http://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&pg=PA265|publisher = Oxford University Press|year= 2001|location = Oxford|pages = 262–266|isbn =0-19-850341-5[/tpl] The tensile strength of molybdenum wires increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30 GPa, when their diameter decreases from ~50–100 nm to 10 nm.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/10/4/045004|title=Inherent tensile strength of molybdenum nanocrystals|year=2009|last1=Shpak|first1=Anatoly P.|first2=Sergiy O.|first3=Tatjana I|first4=Igor M|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=10|page=045004|last2=Kotrechko|last3=Mazilova|last4=Mikhailovskij|bibcode=2009STAdM..10d5004S|issue=4[/tpl]

===Isotopes===

There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, ranging in atomic mass from 83 to 117, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.[tpl]cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128|publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O.|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J.|last4 = Wapstra|first4 = A. H.[/tpl]
Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019 y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150 ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.[tpl]cite book|year = 2006|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|editor= Lide, David R.|volume = 11|pages = 87–88|publisher = CRC|isbn=0-8493-0487-3[/tpl]
As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.[tpl]cite web|author=Armstrong, John T.|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/technetium.html|title=Technetium|publisher=Chemical & Engineering News|year=2003|accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl]
In 2008, the Delft University of Technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum-98-based production of molybdenum-99.Wolterbeek, Hubert Theodoor; Bode, Peter "A process for the production of no-carrier added 99Mo". European Patent EP2301041 (A1) ― 2011-03-30. Retrieved on 2012-06-27.

===Compounds and chemistry===

Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95.95 g/mol.[tpl]cite journal |author=M. E. Wieser, M. Berglund |year=2009 |title=Atomic weights of the elements 2007 (IUPAC Technical Report) |url=http://www.ciaaw.org/pubs/TSAW2007.pdf |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=11 |pages=2131–2156 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-09-08-03 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.ciaaw.org/atomic_weights3.htm | title =Current  Table of Standard Atomic Weights in Alphabetical Order: Standard Atomic weights of the elements | year= 2013 | author=  Meija, J. et al,[/tpl] It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature, and the bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600 °C, resulting in molybdenum trioxide:
The trioxide is volatile and sublimates at high temperatures. This prevents formation of a continuous protective oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal.[tpl]cite book|last = Davis|first = Joseph R.|title = Heat-resistant materials|work = Molybdenum|publisher = ASM International|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=GEHA8_bix0oC&pg=PA365|page=365|year=1997|isbn=0-87170-596-6[/tpl] Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to those of tungsten than that of chromium. An example is the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds as compared with the stability of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is common in the molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), whereas the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.
Molybdenum(VI) oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water, forming molybdates (MoO42−). Molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates, but they show a similar tendency to form complex oxyanions by condensation at lower pH values, such as Mo7O246− and Mo8O264−. Polymolybdates can incorporate other ions into their structure, forming polyoxometalates.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 30|page=34|year = 1997|title = Polyoxometalate Chemistry: An Old Field with New Dimensions in Several Disciplines|first1 = Michael T.|last1 = Pope|last2= Müller |first2 = Achim|doi = 10.1002/anie.199100341[/tpl] The dark-blue phosphorus-containing heteropolymolybdate PMo12O403− is used for the spectroscopic detection of phosphorus.[tpl]cite book|isbn = 978-0-8247-8433-1|pages = 280–288|author = ed. by Nollet, Leo M. L.|year = 2000|publisher = Marcel Dekker|location = New York, NY|title = Handbook of water analysis|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YZpW4Y4Q_PIC&pg=PA280[/tpl] The broad range of oxidation states of molybdenum is reflected in various molybdenum chlorides:
The structure of the MoCl2 is composed of Mo6Cl84+ clusters with four chloride ions to compensate the charge.
Like chromium and some other transition metals, molybdenum is able to form quadruple bonds, such as in Mo2(CH3COO)4. This compound can be transformed into Mo2Cl84−, which also has a quadruple bond.
The oxidation state 0 is possible with carbon monoxide as ligand, such as in molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.

==History==

Molybdenite—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were graphite. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Lansdown | first1 = A. R. | title = Molybdenum disulphide lubrication | volume = 35 | work = Tribology and Interface Engineering | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-444-50032-8[/tpl] Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite, it was still confused with the common lead ore PbS (now called galena); the name comes from Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|Μόλυβδος[/tpl] [tpl]lang|grc-Latn|molybdos[/tpl], meaning lead. (The Greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages).[tpl]cite web|author=Melchert, Craig | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/melchert/webpage/molybdos.pdf| title=Greek mólybdos as a Loanword from Lydian | publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill | accessdate=2011-04-23[/tpl]
Although apparent deliberate alloying of molybdenum with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330) has been reported, that art was never employed widely and was later lost.International Molybdenum Association, "Molybdenum History"[tpl]cite book | title = Accidental use of molybdenum in old sword led to new alloy | url = http://books.google.com/?id=yUpYAAAAMAAJ&q=Japanese+sword+molybdenum&dq=Japanese+sword+molybdenum | author1 = Institute | first1 = American Iron and Steel | year = 1948 [/tpl] In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead, and thus was not the same as galena.[tpl]cite web|last = Van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Molybdenum|work = Elementymology & Elements Multidict|date= 2006-01-10|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Mo|accessdate = 2007-05-20[/tpl]
By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) not galena nor graphite.[tpl]cite web|last = Gagnon|first = Steve|title = Molybdenum|publisher = Jefferson Science Associates, LLC|url = http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele042.html|accessdate = 2007-05-06[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author = Scheele, C.

Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum by using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.[tpl]cite journal|author = Hjelm, P. J.|title = Versuche mit Molybdäna, und Reduction der selben Erde|journal = Svenska vetensk. Academ.

For about a century after its isolation, molybdenum had no industrial use, owing to its relative scarcity, difficulty extracting the pure metal, and the immaturity of appropriate metallurgical techniques.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Hoyt | first1 = Samuel Leslie | title = Metallography, Volume 2 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1921 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last1 = Krupp | first1 = Alfred | last2 = Wildberger | first2 = Andreas | title = The metallic alloys: A practical guide for the manufacture of all kinds of alloys, amalgams, and solders, used by metal-workers ... with an appendix on the coloring of alloys | publisher = H.C.

In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to its use as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZVkZNyVI4toC&pg=PA117| page = 117 | title = The Making of American Industrial Research: Science and Business at Ge and Bell, 1876–1926 | isbn = 9780521522373 | author1 = Reich | first1 = Leonard S | date = 2002-08-22[/tpl] In 1913, Frank E.

During the first World War, demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high speed steels. Some British tanks were protected by 75 mm (3 in) manganese steel plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with 25 mm (1 in) molybdenum steel plating allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection. The Germans also used molybdenum-doped steel for heavy artillery. This was because traditional steel melted at the heat produced by enough gunpowder to launch a one ton shell.Sam Kean. The Disappearing Spoon. Page 88–89 After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.[tpl]cite journal| first = Ray | last = Millholland | title = Battle of the Billions: American industry mobilizes machines, materials, and men for a job as big as digging 40 Panama Canals in one year | date = August 1941 | work = Popular Science | page = 61 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=xScDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56[/tpl]

==Occurrence and production==

Molybdenum is the 54th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the 25th most abundant element in its oceans, with an average of 10 parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe.[tpl]cite book|contribution = Molybdenum|year = 2005|title = Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry|pages = 1038–1040|place= New York|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-61525-5|editor= Considine, Glenn D.[/tpl] The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6 µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Abstracts/2002_Abstracts/Jan02_Abstracts/Jambor_p181_02.pdf|title=New mineral names|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=87|page=181|year=2002|author=Jambor, J.L. et al.[/tpl]
The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur, in the same way as copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source of molybdenum is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore, and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.
Historically, the Knaben mine in southern Norway, opened in 1885, was the first dedicated molybdenum mine. It closed from 1973–2007, but is now reopened.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0375-6742(96)00069-6|title = Dispersion of tailings in the Knabena—Kvina drainage basin, Norway, 1: Evaluation of overbank sediments as sampling medium for regional geochemical mapping|year = 1997|last1 = Langedal|first1 = M|journal = Journal of Geochemical Exploration|volume = 58|page= 157|issue = 2–3[/tpl]
Large mines in Colorado (such as the Henderson mine and the Climax mine)[tpl]cite journal|first=Paul B.|last = Coffman|title = The Rise of a New Metal: The Growth and Success of the Climax Molybdenum Company|journal = The Journal of Business of the University of Chicago|page= 30|year = 1937|volume = 10|doi = 10.1086/232443[/tpl] and in British Columbia yield molybdenite as their primary product, while many porphyry copper deposits such as the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah and the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile produce molybdenum as a byproduct of copper mining.
The world's production of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000 t), United States (64,000 t), Chile (38,000 t), Peru (18,000 t) and Mexico (12,000 t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3 mt), US (2.7 mt) and Chile (1.2 mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly split between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe and the rest of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.
In molybdenite processing, the molybdenite is first heated to a temperature of [tpl]convert|700|°C|°F[/tpl] and the sulfide is oxidized into molybdenum(VI) oxide by air:
The oxidized ore is then either heated to [tpl]convert|1100|°C|°F[/tpl] to sublimate the oxide, or leached with ammonia, which reacts with the molybdenum(VI) oxide to form water-soluble molybdates:
Copper, an impurity in molybdenite, is less soluble in ammonia. To completely remove it from the solution, it is precipitated with hydrogen sulfide.
Pure molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen, while the molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the aluminothermic reaction with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum. A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum.[tpl]cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1096–1104|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|author=Holleman, Arnold F.; Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Gupta|first = C.

Molybdenum has a value of approximately $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009. It maintained a price at or near $10,000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003, and reached, due to increased demand, a peak of $103,000 per tonne in June 2005.[tpl]cite web|title = Dynamic Prices and Charts for Molybdenum|publisher = InfoMine Inc.|year=2007|url = http://www.infomine.com/investment/charts.aspx?c=molybdenum&u=mt&submit1=Display+Chart&x=usd&r=15y#chart|accessdate = 2007-05-07[/tpl] In 2008 the London Metal Exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity on the exchange.[tpl]cite web |title=LME to launch minor metals contracts in H2 2009 |url=http://lme.com/6241.asp |date = 2008-09-04 |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=28 July 2009[/tpl]

==Applications==

===Alloys===

About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgical applications such as alloys, with the rest of molybdenum used as compounds in chemical applications. Estimated fractional global industrial use of molybdenum is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys, 5%.Pie chart of world Mo uses. London Metal Exchange.
The ability of molybdenum to withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening makes it useful in applications that involve intense heat, including the manufacture of armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors and filaments.
Most high-strength steel alloys (example 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Despite such small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used as an alloying agent each year in stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons and high-temperature superalloys.
Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability.[tpl]cite web|title = Molybdenum Statistics and Information|publisher = U.S. Geological Survey|date= 2007-05-10|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/molybdenum/|accessdate = 2007-05-10[/tpl] Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to "chrome-moly" type-300 stainless steels (high-chromium steels that are corrosion-resistant already due to their chromium content, but in reality "chrome-moly" is not a type-300 stainless, but instead a 41xx series that is not stainless) and especially so in the so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN). Molybdenum acts by increasing lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve out iron atoms from the surface.
Because of its lower density and more stable price, molybdenum is sometimes used instead of tungsten. An example is the 'M' series of high-speed steels such as M2, M4 and M42 as substitution for the 'T' steel series, which contain tungsten. Molybdenum can be implemented both as an alloying agent and as a flame-resistant coating for other metals. Although its melting point is [tpl]convert|2623|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl], molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above [tpl]convert|760|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] making it better-suited for use in vacuum environments.[tpl]cite web|title=Molybdenum|publisher=AZoM.com Pty.

TZM (Mo (~99%), Ti (~0.5%), Zr (~0.08%) and some C) is a corrosion-resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above 1300C. It has about twice the strength of pure Mo, and is more ductile and more weldable, yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt (FLiBe) and salt vapors used in molten salt reactors for 1100 hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure.[tpl]cite book|last=Smallwood|first=Robert E.|title=ASTM special technical publication 849: Refractory metals and their industrial applications: a symposium|url=http://books.google.com/?id=agaacIr25KcC&pg=PA9|year=1984|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=9780803102033|page=9|chapter=TZM Moly Alloy[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.energyfromthorium.com/forum/download/file.php?id=805|title = Compatibility of Molybdenum-Base Alloy TZM, with LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4|publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory Report|accessdate = 2010-09-02|date = December 1969[/tpl]
Other molybdenum-based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications. For example, because of the corrosion resistance against molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and the molybdenum/tungsten alloy (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers which come into contact with molten zinc.[tpl]cite book|title =Tool and manufacturing engineers handbook|first = W.

The most important role of the molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes.[ref]

[/ref] In nitrogen fixation in certain bacteria, the nitrogenase enzyme, which is involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen, usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of Mo with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme is similar to that in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.[tpl]cite journal|title = A newly discovered role for iron-sulfur clusters|first1 = Patricia C.| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0805713105| journal=PNAS| year=2008|volume=105|pages=11589–11590 |pmid = 18697949| last1 = Dos Santos|last2 = Dean|first2 = Dennis R.|issue = 33|pmc = 2575256|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10511589D [/tpl]
In 2008, evidence was reported that a scarcity of molybdenum in the Earth's early oceans was a limiting factor for nearly two billion years in the further evolution of eukaryotic life (which includes all plants and animals) as eukaryotes cannot fix nitrogen, and must therefore acquire most of their oxidized nitrogen suitable for making organic nitrogen compounds, or the organics themselves (like proteins) from prokaryotic bacteria.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=C.|first2=T.

Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water. Once oxygen made by early life appeared in seawater, it helped dissolve molybdenum into soluble molybdate from minerals on the sea bottom, making it available for the first time to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and allowing them to provide more fixed usable nitrogen compounds for higher forms of life. In 2013, Steven Benner suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24120-primordial-broth-of-life-was-a-dry-martian-cupasoup.html?cmpid=RSS%7CNSNS%7C2012-GLOBAL%7Clife#.Uh98K5BwaUk|title=Primordial broth of life was a dry Martian cup-a-soup|work=New Scientist|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013[/tpl]
Although oxygen once promoted nitrogen fixation via making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived in large quantities in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions were required to isolate and protect their nitrogen-fixing enzymes in heterocysts, or similar structures protecting them from too much oxygen. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions from oxygen in aerobic organisms continues to the present.
Though molybdenum forms compounds with various organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout the human body as MoO42−.[tpl]cite web|last = Mitchell|first = Phillip C.

In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentrations also affect protein synthesis, metabolism and growth.
In animals and plants a tricyclic compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate to form a complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor.

Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, in much the same way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However, presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this mechanism is seen primarily in adults, the neurological consequences have not been as marked as for the congenital cofactor deficiency.[tpl]cite journal|pmc=1911702|pmid=6426561|year=1984|last1=Abumrad|first1=NN|title=Molybdenum—is it an essential trace metal?|volume=60|issue=2|pages=163–71|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine[/tpl]

===Copper-molybdenum antagonism===

High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high amounts of molybdenum develop symptoms including diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia and achromotrichia (loss of hair pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by the administration of more copper into the system, both in dietary form and by injection.[tpl]cite journal|last = Suttle|first = N. F.|title = Recent studies of the copper-molybdenum antagonism|journal = Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 299–305|publisher = CABI Publishing|year= 1974|doi = 10.1079/PNS19740053|pmid = 4617883[/tpl] The condition, as an effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.Hauer, Gerald Copper deficiency in cattle.

Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically in the treatment of copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially via the inhibition of copper ion dependent membrane translocation process involving a non-classical secretion pathway.[tpl]cite journal|author = Nickel, W|title = The Mystery of nonclassical protein secretion, a current view on cargo proteins and potential export routes|journal = Eur.
