Mister Ed is an American television situation comedy produced by FilmwaysThe New York Times Encyclopedia of Television by Les Brown (Times Books, a division of Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company, Inc., 1977), ISBN 0-8129-0721-3, p. 277 that first aired in syndication from January 5 to July 2, 1961, and then on CBS from October 1, 1961, to February 6, 1966.[tpl]cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |coauthors=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Random House LLC|year=2009|edition=9|pages=905|isbn=0-307-48320-7[/tpl] The show's title character is a fictional talking horse, originally appearing in short stories by Walter R. Brooks.
Mister Ed is one of the few series to debut in syndication and be picked up by a major network for prime time.

==Beginnings==

The show was derived from a series of short stories by Walter R. Brooks, which began with The Talking Horse in the September 18, 1937, issue of Liberty.[ref]PARTNERS SLATE TV COMEDY SERIES: Lubin, Hamilton Pian 'Ed and Wilbur Pope' Films' --'Playhouse 90' Cast
By OSCAR GODBOUT Special to The New York Times.. New York Times (1923-Current file) York, N.Y Oct 16, 1957: 70.[/ref] Brooks is otherwise known for the Freddy the Pig series of children's novels, which likewise feature talking animals who interact with humans. Director Arthur Lubin's secretary, Sonia Chernus, is credited as having developed the format for television, by having introduced the Brooks stories to Lubin himself.
The concept of the show is similar to Francis the Talking Mule, with the equine normally talking only to one person (Wilbur), and thus both helping and frustrating its owner. The Francis movies were directed by Lubin, who performed the same duty on Mister Ed.

==Synopsis==

The stars of the show are Mister Ed, a palomino who can talk, played by gelding Bamboo Harvester and voiced by former Western star Allan Lane and his owner, a friendly, but somewhat klutzy architect named Wilbur Post (Alan Young). Much of the program's humor stems from the fact Mister Ed will speak only to Wilbur, as well as Ed's notoriety as a troublemaker. Other running jokes center on Wilbur being accident prone and inadvertently causing harm to himself and others. According to the show's producer, Arthur Lubin, Young was chosen as the lead character because he "just seemed like the sort of guy a horse would talk to".
The other main character throughout the series is Wilbur's generally tolerant young wife, Carol (Connie Hines). The Posts also have two sets of neighbors, to whom Ed delights in making Wilbur appear as eccentric as possible.  They included the Addisons, Roger (Larry Keating) and his wife Kay (Edna Skinner), who both appeared from the pilot episode until Keating's death in 1963; thereafter, Skinner continued appearing as Kay alone, without mention of Roger's absence, until the neighbors were recast. During this period, Kay's brother Paul Fenton (Jack Albertson), who had made occasional appearances before, appears. Following the Addisons, the Posts' new neighbors were Col. Gordon Kirkwood, USAF (Ret.), portrayed by Leon Ames, Wilbur's former commanding officer, and his wife Winnie (Florence MacMichael).  They appeared on the series from 1963 to 1965. In the final season, the Kirkwoods were phased out, while Carol's grumpy and uptight father, Mr. Higgins (Barry Kelley), who appeared occasionally throughout the entire series, apparently moved in with Wilbur and Carol during the final episodes.  Mr. Higgins loathes Wilbur since Wilbur's quirky eccentricity always clashes with his own emotionless and uptight personality. Carol's father never stops trying to persuade her to divorce Wilbur, who he often refers to as a "kook" because of Wilbur's clumsiness. Alan Young performed double-duty during the final season of the series, also directing nearly all episodes.
Ed's ability to talk is never explained or, indeed, even much contemplated on the show. In the first episode, when Wilbur expresses an inability to understand the situation, Ed offers the show's only remark on the subject: "Don't try. It's bigger than both of us!"
The Posts resided at 17230 Valley Spring in the San Fernando Valley.Ed, the Jumper @ ~2:25 http://www.hulu.com/watch/197686

==Episodes==

==Production notes==

The first horse that played Mister Ed for the first, unaired pilot episode was a chestnut gelding. The horse proved to be unruly and difficult to work with and was replaced with the horse named Bamboo Harvester (1949–70), a crossbred gelding of American Saddlebred, Arabian and grade ancestry. A second pilot episode was filmed and Bamboo Harvester remained with the series until its cancellation.

===Making Ed "talk"===

Mister Ed was voiced by ex-B-movie cowboy star Allan "Rocky" Lane (speaking) and Sheldon Allman (singing, except his line in the theme song, which was sung by its composer, Jay Livingston).
Ed was voice-trained for the show by Les Hilton. Lane remained anonymous as the voice of Mister Ed, and the show's producers referred to him only as "an actor who prefers to remain nameless," though once the show became a hit, Lane campaigned the producers for credit, which he never received. The credits listed Mister Ed as playing "himself"; however, his family tree name was Bamboo Harvester. Ed's stablemate, a quarterhorse named Pumpkin, who was later to appear in the television series Green Acres, was also Ed's stunt double in the show.
During and after the run of the series, there were reports that crew members made Mister Ed's mouth move to appear as if he were talking by applying peanut butter to his gums in order for him to try to remove it by moving his lips. However, Alan Young said in 2004 that this was untrue, and that he had started this story himself.[tpl]cite web|author=John Clark |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/04/PKG0D3QHMK1.DTL |title=Interview with Alan Young |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=January 4, 2004 |accessdate=2009-11-25[/tpl] In another interview, Young said, "Al Simon and Arthur Lubin, the producers, suggested we keep the method making the horse appear to talk a secret because they thought kids would be disappointed if they found out the technical details of how it was done, so I made up the peanut butter story, and everyone bought it. It was initially done by putting a piece of nylon thread in his mouth. But Ed actually learned to move his lips on cue when the trainer touched his hoof. In fact, he soon learned to do it when I stopped talking during a scene! Ed was very smart."[tpl]cite web|author=December 1, 2009 |url=http://www.mydailyfind.com/features/mister-eds-alan-young-talks-about-the-talking-horse-and-hollywood-lore.html |title=Alan Young talks about Mister Ed and Hollywood lore |publisher=My Daily Find |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl]
Young added that Bamboo Harvester (Mister Ed) saw the trainer as the disciplinarian, or father figure, and when scolded for missing a cue, would go to Young for comfort, like a mother figure, which Les Hilton said was a good thing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22archive+of+american+television+interview+with+alan+young%22&num=10&so=2&start=0 |title=Archive of American Television Interview with Alan Young – Google Videos |publisher=Video.google.com |accessdate=2009-11-25[/tpl]

===Theme song===

The theme song, titled "Mister Ed", was written by the songwriting team of Jay Livingston and Ray Evans and sung by Livingston. However, they took a theme of the German Romantic era composer Emile Waldteufel as the basis of their song. After using only the music to open the first seven episodes, a decision was made to replace the instrumental-only version with one containing the lyrics. Livingston agreed to sing it himself, at least until a professional singer could be found; however, the producers liked the songwriter's vocals and kept them on the broadcast.
In May 1986, Jim Brown, a preacher from South Point, Ohio, claimed that the Mister Ed theme song contains "satanic messages" if played in reverse. Brown and his colleague Greg Hudson held religious seminars covering a variety of religious topics but also focused on messages that they claimed exist in secular music. At one such seminar held for teenagers in Ironton, Ohio, Brown and Hudson said that after listening to "Mister Ed" on the album Television's Greatest Hits in reverse, the phrases "Someone sung this song for Satan" and "the source is Satan" were audible. After the seminar, the teenagers who attended burned over 300 records and cassettes with offending lyrics and alleged satanic messages. While the teens did not burn a copy of Television's Greatest Hits, Brown stated that, "Satan can be an influence whether they "Mister Ed" songwriters know it or not. We don't think they did it on purpose and we're not getting down on Mr. Ed."[tpl]cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Justin|title=Satan Taking Mr. Ed Along For The Ride?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-05-08/features/8602020267_1_satan-backward-message|publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=May 8, 1986[/tpl]

===Sponsorship===

The series was sponsored from 1961-63 by Studebaker-Packard Corporation and Studebaker Corporation.[tpl]cite book|last=Foster|first=Patrick|title=Studebaker: The Complete History|year=2008|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=1-616-73018-8|page=158[/tpl]  Studebakers were featured prominently in the show during this period. The Posts are shown owning a 1962 Lark convertible, and the company used publicity shots featuring the Posts and Mister Ed with their product (various cast members also appeared in "integrated commercials" for Lark at the end of the program).  When another Lark convertible served as the official pace car at the 1962 Indianapolis 500, Connie Hines attended the race as part of the promotion.
The Ford Motor Company provided the vehicles starting at the beginning of 1965.
