==History==

Celebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products. 

===United States===

Joan Crawford was married to PepsiCo president Alfred Steele from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973.
During the 1960s, Joanie Sommers sang two popular commercial songs ("It's Pepsi, for those who think young" and "Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as "The Pepsi Girl".
During 1984, Michael Jackson signed a large contract with Pepsi that has since produced many commercials and world tours through 1993.
During the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer Chayanne was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish language to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles.
In the early 1990s, Ray Charles was the star of a Diet Pepsi campaign called "You Got the Right One, Baby," which was also known as "Uh-huh."  
In 2001, Britney Spears became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, Beyoncé Knowles, and Enrique Iglasias. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song "We Will Rock You" by Queen set in a Roman gladiator arena.
In 2005, Christina Aguilera was signed to promote the popular drink (she was previously promoting Coca-Cola in 2000).  The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States.  Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. Aretha Franklin was also a spokesperson in 1998. And also in 1999 Janet Jackson signed on to the original "Ask For More" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson. 
In 2008, PepsiCo launched the "Cool Tones" campaign. It involved Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All American Rejects writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. Carey also recorded a commercial for the campaign in which she performs one of her original ringtones.
In 2012, Beyoncé was signed to promote Pepsi once again. This campaign will be her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 — and her face will be on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign is estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyoncé’s fee and what Pepsi calls a creative content development fund. 
Nicki Minaj released a Pepsi commercial including her hit single, Moment 4 Life, on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm.
NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a spokesperson for Pepsi, and was sponsored by the company starting in 1997 as an associate sponsor, and sponsored Gordon in the Busch Series for two seasons. Since 2001, Pepsi has served as sponsor for Gordon in at least two races per season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/sponsors.html|title=Jeff Gordon's Sponsors|work=Gordonline.com|accessdate=2013-05-23[/tpl]
In 2013, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and musical group One Direction co-starred in a Pepsi commercial.

===Europe and the United Kingdom===

For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, Pepsi was the title sponsor of Suzuki's effort in motorcycle road racing's premier class, Grand Prix 500cc. The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors. 
During 1988-9, Suzuki also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
In 1998, the group Spice Girls have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song "Move Over (Generation Next)".
