Lake Sakakawea is a reservoir in the Missouri River basin in central North Dakota. Named for the Shoshone-Hidatsa woman Sakakawea, it is the largest man-made lake in North Dakota and the third largest in the United States, after Lake Mead and Lake Powell. The lake lies in parts of six counties in western North Dakota: Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail, and Williams. A map centered around the Van Hook Arm [tpl]coord|47|53|00|N|102|21|14|W|scale:1000000[/tpl] of the lake perhaps better shows its westward extent from its origin at the Garrison Dam.
It is located about [tpl]convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Bismarck, North Dakota; the distance by the river is about [tpl]convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The lake averages between [tpl]convert|2|and|3|mi|km[/tpl] in width and is [tpl]convert|14|mi|km[/tpl] wide at its widest point (Van Hook Arm). Lake Sakakawea marks the maximum southwest extent of glaciation during the ice age.
The reservoir was created with the completion of Garrison Dam in 1956, the second (and largest) of six main-stem dams on the Missouri River built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation and irrigation.
The creation of the lake displaced members of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation from the villages of Van Hook and (Old) Sanish, forcing the creation of New Town and Mandaree. Incidentally, one name that had been proposed for New Town was Vanish (a portmanteau of the two previous towns' names). A third reservation town, Elbowoods (Arikara: hiswíkat hiswíkAt), where the agency headquarters, boarding school, hospital and jail were located, was also lost to the lake. These three towns are commemorated in the names of the three campground sections at Lake Sakakawea State Park, a state park located adjacent to Garrison Dam.
Lake Sakakawea is also home to many summer camps, including Triangle Y Camp and Camp of the Cross.
