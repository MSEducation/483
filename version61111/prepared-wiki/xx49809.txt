==Powers and position==

Since the abolition of the post Chairman of the Communist Party of China in 12th Central Committee in 1982, the General Secretary is the highest-ranking official of the party and heads the Central Secretariat, Political bureau and its Standing Committee.
Since its founding, the most important position in the PRC has been that of the General Secretary (or Chairman from 1922 to 1925 and 1943 to 1982). As a single party state, the Communist party leader holds ultimate power and authority over state and government. 
Since the Party National Security Commission and Leading Group for Deepening Reforms established, the power of General Secretary has become more important.
