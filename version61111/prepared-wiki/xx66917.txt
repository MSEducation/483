==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is a matter of exclusion, as there is no specific test for the condition. To exclude sarcoidosis in a case presenting with pulmonary symptoms might involve chest X-ray, CT scan of chest, PET scan, CT-guided biopsy, mediastinoscopy, open lung biopsy, bronchoscopy with biopsy, endobronchial ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound with FNA of mediastinal lymph nodes (EBUS FNA). Tissue from biopsy of lymph nodes is subjected to both flow cytometry to rule out cancer and special stains (acid fast bacilli stain and Gömöri methenamine silver stain) to rule out microorganisms and fungi.[tpl]cite journal|last=Parrish|first=S|coauthors=Turner, JF|title=Diagnosis of sarcoidosis.|journal=Disease-a-month|date=November 2009|volume=55|issue=11|pages=693–703|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2009.06.001|pmid=19857643[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Hawtin|first=KE|coauthors=Roddie, ME; Mauri, FA; Copley, SJ|title=Pulmonary sarcoidosis: the 'Great Pretender'.|journal=Clinical Radiology|date=August 2010|volume=65|issue=8|pages=642–50|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2010.03.004|pmid=20599067[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Culver, DA; Judson, MA|title=A concise review of pulmonary sarcoidosis.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=1 March 2011|volume=183|issue=5|pages=573–81|doi=10.1164/rccm.201006-0865CI|pmid=21037016|pmc=3081278[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Miliauskas|first=S|coauthors=Zemaitis, M; Sakalauskas, R|title=Sarcoidosis—moving to the new standard of diagnosis?|journal=Medicina|year=2010|volume=46|issue=7|pages=443–6|pmid=20966615|url=http://medicina.kmu.lt/1007/1007-01e.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]
Serum markers of sarcoidosis, include: serum amyloid A, soluble interleukin 2 receptor, lysozyme, angiotensin converting enzyme and the glycoprotein KL-6. Angiotensin-converting enzyme blood levels are used in the monitoring of sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis Workup|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=6 February 2014|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301914-workup#showall|author=Kamangar, N; Rohani, P; Shorr, AF|editor=Peters, SP; Talavera, F; Rice, TD; Mosenifar, Z[/tpl] A bronchoalveolar lavage can show an elevated (of at least 3.5) CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, which is indicative (but not proof) of pulmonary sarcoidosis. In at least one study the induced sputum ratio of CD4/CD8 and level of TNF was correlated to those in the lavage fluid.
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, lymphoma, septic emboli, rheumatoid nodules, Wegener's granulomatosis, varicella infection, tuberculosis and atypical infections, such as Mycobacterium avium complex, cytomegalovirus and cryptococcus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Allmendinger A, Perone R |title=Case of the Month |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=10 |year=2009|url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1451377[/tpl] Sarcoidosis is confused most commonly with neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma, or with disorders characterized also by a mononuclear cell granulomatous inflammatory process, such as the mycobacterial and fungal disorders.
Chest X-ray changes are divided into four stages:[tpl]cite journal |author=Joanne Mambretti |year=2004 |title=Chest X-ray Stages of Sarcoidosis |journal=Journal of Insurance Medicine |pages=91–92 |url=http://www.aaimedicine.org/journal-of-insurance-medicine/jim/2004/036-01-0091.pdf |accessdate=June 3, 2012[/tpl]
Although people with stage 1 X-rays tend to have the acute or subacute, reversible form of the disease, those with stages 2 and 3 often have the chronic, progressive disease; these patterns do not represent consecutive "stages" of sarcoidosis.  Thus, except for epidemiologic purposes, this X-ray categorization is mostly of historic interest.
In sarcoidosis presenting in the Caucasian population, hilar adenopathy and erythema nodosum are the most common initial symptoms. In this population, a biopsy of the gastrocnemius muscle is a useful tool in correctly diagnosing the person. The presence of a noncaseating epithelioid granuloma in a gastrocnemius specimen is definitive evidence of sarcoidosis, as other tuberculoid and fungal diseases extremely rarely present histologically in this muscle.[tpl]cite journal |author=Andonopoulos AP, Papadimitriou C, Melachrinou M, et al. |title=Asymptomatic gastrocnemius muscle biopsy: an extremely sensitive and specific test in the pathologic confirmation of sarcoidosis presenting with hilar adenopathy |journal=Clin.

===Classification===

Sarcoidosis may be divided into the following types:

==Treatment==

Most persons (>75%) only require symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin. For persons presenting with lung symptoms, unless the respiratory impairment is devastating, active pulmonary sarcoidosis is observed usually without therapy for two to three months; if the inflammation does not subside spontaneously, therapy is instituted. Corticosteroids, most commonly prednisone or prednisolone, have been the standard treatment for many years. In some people, this treatment can slow or reverse the course of the disease, but other people do not respond to steroid therapy. The use of corticosteroids in mild disease is controversial because in many cases the disease remits spontaneously.[tpl]cite journal | last=White | first=ES |date=June 2007 | title=Current and emerging strategies for the management of sarcoidosis |journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume= 8 | issue=9 | pages=1293–1311 |doi=10.1517/14656566.8.9.1293 | pmid=17563264 |last2=Lynch Jp | first2=3rd [/tpl] Despite their widespread use, the evidence supporting corticosteroid use is weak at best.[tpl]cite journal|last=Paramothayan|first=NS|coauthors=Lasserson, TJ; Jones, PW|title=Corticosteroids for pulmonary sarcoidosis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2005|issue=2|pages=CD001114|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001114.pub2|pmid=15846612|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001114.pub2/pdf[/tpl]
Severe symptoms are generally treated with corticosteroids although steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolic acid and leflunomide[tpl]cite journal|last=Sahoo|first=DH|coauthors=Bandyopadhyay, D; Xu, M; Pearson, K; Parambil, JG; Lazar, CA; Chapman, JT; Culver, DA|title=Effectiveness and safety of leflunomide for pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.|journal=The European Respiratory Journal|date=November 2011|volume=38|issue=5|pages=1145–50|doi=10.1183/09031936.00195010|pmid=21565914|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/38/5/1145.full.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Panselinas|first=E|coauthors=Judson, MA|title=Acute pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis.|journal=Chest|date=October 2012|volume=142|issue=4|pages=827–36|doi=10.1378/chest.12-1060|pmid=23032450|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/25163/chest_142_4_827.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] are often used as alternatives.[tpl]cite journal|last=King|first=CS|coauthors=Kelly, W|title=Treatment of sarcoidosis.|journal=Disease-a-month|date=November 2009|volume=55|issue=11|pages=704–18|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2009.06.002|pmid=19857644[/tpl] Of these methotrexate is most widely used and studied.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Nunes, H; Sweiss, NJ; Lower, EE|title=Established and experimental medical therapy of pulmonary sarcoidosis.|journal=The European Respiratory Journal|date=June 2013|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1424–38|doi=10.1183/09031936.00060612|pmid=23397302[/tpl] Methotrexate is considered a first-line treatment in neurosarcoidosis, often in conjunction with corticosteroids. Long-term treatment with methotrexate is associated with liver damage in about 10% of people and hence may be a significant concern in people with liver involvement and requires regular liver function test monitoring. Methotrexate can also lead to pulmonary toxicity (lung damage), although this is fairly uncommon and more commonly it can confound the leukopenia caused by sarcoidosis. Due to these safety concerns it is often recommended that methotrexate is combined with folic acid in order to prevent toxicity. Azathioprine treatment can also lead to liver damage. Leflunomide is being used as a replacement for methotrexate, possibly due to its purportedly lower rate of pulmonary toxicity. Mycophenolic acid has been used successfully in uveal sarcoidosis,[tpl]cite journal|last=Bhat|first=P|coauthors=Cervantes-Castañeda, RA; Doctor, PP; Anzaar, F; Foster, CS|title=Mycophenolate mofetil therapy for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis.|journal=Ocular Immunology and Inflammation|date=May–June 2009|volume=17|issue=3|pages=185–90|doi=10.1080/09273940902862992|pmid=19585361[/tpl] neurosarcoidosis (especially CNS sarcoidosis; minimally effective in sarcoidosis myopathy)[tpl]cite journal|last=Androdias|first=G|coauthors=Maillet, D; Marignier, R; Pinède, L; Confavreux, C; Broussolle, C; Vukusic, S; Sève, P|title=Mycophenolate mofetil may be effective in CNS sarcoidosis but not in sarcoid myopathy.|journal=Neurology|date=29 May 2011|volume=76|issue=13|pages=1168–72|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318212aafb|pmid=21444902[/tpl] and pulmonary sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Judson|first=MA|title=The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis|journal=Respiratory Medicine|date=October 2012|volume=106|issue=10|pages=1351–1361|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2012.01.013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Brill|first=AK|coauthors=Ott, SR; Geiser, T|title=Effect and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis: a retrospective study.|journal=Respiration|year=2013|volume=86|issue=5|pages=376–83|doi=10.1159/000345596|pmid=23295253[/tpl]

In a clinical trial cyclosporine added to prednisone treatment failed to demonstrate any significant benefit over prednisone alone in people with pulmonary sarcoidosis, although there was evidence of increased toxicity from the addition of cyclosporine to the steroid treatment including: infections, malignancies (cancers), hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Likewise chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide are seldom used in the treatment of sarcoidosis due to their high degree of toxicity, especially their potential for causing malignancies.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dastoori|first=M|coauthors=Fedele, S; Leao, JC; Porter, SR|title=Sarcoidosis — a clinically orientated review|journal=Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine|date=April 2013|volume=42|issue=4|pages=281–9|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01198.x|pmid=22845844[/tpl] Infliximab has been used successfully to treat pulmonary sarcoidosis in clinical trials in a number of persons. Etanercept, on the other hand, has failed to demonstrate any significant efficacy in people with uveal sarcoidosis in a couple of clinical trials. Likewise golimumab has failed to show any benefit in persons with pulmonary sarcoidosis. One clinical trial of adalimumab found treatment response in about half of subjects, which is similar to that seen with infliximab, but as adalimumab has better tolerability profile it may be preferred over infliximab.
Ursodeoxycholic acid has been used successfully as a treatment for cases with liver involvement.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bakker|first=GJ|coauthors=Haan, YC; Maillette de Buy Wenniger, LJ; Beuers, U|title=Sarcoidosis of the liver: to treat or not to treat?|journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine|date=October 2012|volume=70|issue=8|pages=349–56|pmid=23065982|url=http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000876|format=PDF[/tpl] Thalidomide has also been tried successfully as a treatment for treatment-resistant lupus pernio in a clinical trial, which may stem from its anti-TNF activity, although it failed to exhibit any efficacy in a pulmonary sarcoidosis clinical trial. Cutaneous disease may be successfully managed with antimalarials (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and the tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline. Antimalarials have also demonstrated efficacy in treating sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia and neurosarcoidosis. Long-term use of antimalarials is limited, however, by their potential to cause irreversible blindness and hence the need for regular ophthalmologic screening. This toxicity is usually less of a problem with hydroxychloroquine than with chloroquine, although hydroxychloroquine can disturb the glucose homeostasis.
Recently selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors like apremilast (a thalidomide derivative) and roflumilast and the less subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitor, pentoxifylline, have been tried as a treatment for sarcoidosis, with successful results being obtained with apremilast in cutaneous sarcoidosis in a small open-label study.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Judson, MA; Ingledue, R; Craft, NL; Lower, EE|title=Efficacy and safety of apremilast in chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis.|journal=Archives of Dermatology|date=February 2012|volume=148|issue=2|pages=262–4|doi=10.1001/archdermatol.2011.301|pmid=22004880|url=http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/DERM/22504/dlt110003_262a_264.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01830959|Use of Roflumilast to Prevent Exacerbations in Fibrotic Sarcoidosis Patients (REFS)[/tpl] Pentoxifylline has been used successfully to treat acute disease although its use is greatly limited by its gastrointestinal toxicity (mostly nausea, vomiting and diarrhea).

Because of its uncommon nature, the treatment of male reproductive tract sarcoidosis is controversial. Since the differential diagnosis includes testicular cancer, some recommend orchiectomy, even if evidence of sarcoidosis in other organs is present. In the newer approach, testicular, epididymal biopsy and resection of the largest lesion has been proposed.

==Prognosis==

The disease can remit spontaneously or become chronic, with exacerbations and remissions. In some persons, it can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and death. About half of cases resolve without treatment or can be cured within 12–36 months, and most within five years. Some cases, however, may persist several decades. Two-thirds of people with the condition achieve a remission within 10 years of the diagnosis.[tpl]cite web|title=What Is Sarcoidosis?|work=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute|publisher=National Institutes of Health|date=14 June 2013|accessdate=21 February 2014|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sarc/[/tpl] When the heart is involved, the prognosis is generally less favourable, although, corticosteroids appear effective in improving AV conduction.[tpl]cite journal|author=Syed J, Myers R|title=Sarcoid heart disease |journal=Can J Cardiol |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |date=January 2004|pmid=14968147 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sadek|first=MM|coauthors=Yung, D; Birnie, DH; Beanlands, RS; Nery, PB|title=Corticosteroid therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: a systematic review.|journal=Can J Cardiol|date=September 2013|volume=29|issue=9|pages=1034–41|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2013.02.004|pmid=23623644[/tpl] The prognosis tends to be less favourable in African Americans, compared to white Americans.

==Epidemiology==

Sarcoidosis most commonly affects young adults of both sexes, although studies have reported more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nunes H, Bouvry D, Soler P, Valeyre D |title=Sarcoidosis |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2|pages=46|year=2007 |pmid=18021432 |pmc=2169207 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-46 |url=[/tpl]
Sarcoidosis occurs throughout the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5 per 100,000 in men and 19 per 100,000 in women. The disease is most common in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60 per 100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland.

There also has been a seasonal clustering observed in sarcoidosis-affected individuals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Lower, EE; du Bois, RM|title=Sarcoidosis.|journal=Lancet|date=29 March 2003|volume=361|issue=9363|pages=1111–8|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12888-7|pmid=12672326[/tpl] See in Greece about 70% of diagnoses occur between March and May every year, in Spain about 50% of diagnoses occur between April and June and in Japan it is mostly diagnosed during June and July.
The differing incidence across the world may be at least partially attributable to the lack of screening programs in certain regions of the world, and the overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, that may interfere with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis where they are prevalent. There may also be differences in the severity of the disease between people of different ethnicities. Several studies suggest the presentation in people of African origin may be more severe and disseminated than for Caucasians, who are more likely to have asymptomatic disease. Manifestation appears to be slightly different according to race and sex. Erythema nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese persons, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.
It is more common in certain occupations, namely firefighters, educators, military personnel, persons who work in industries where pesticides are used, law enforcement and healthcare personnel.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=A|title=Sarcoidosis: epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and genetics.|journal=Disease-a-month|date=November 2009|volume=55|issue=11|pages=649–60|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2009.04.008|pmid=19857640[/tpl] In the year after the September 11 attacks, the rate of sarcoidosis incidence went up four-fold (to 86 cases per 100,000).

==History==

It was first described in 1877 by Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson, a dermatologist as a condition causing red, raised rashes on the face, arms and hands. In 1888 the term Lupus pernio was coined by Dr. Ernest Besnier, another dermatologist.[tpl]cite book|last=Sharma|first=OP|title=Sarcoidosis.|year=2005|publisher=European Respiratory Society Journals|location=Sheffield|isbn=9781904097884|chapter=Chapter 1: Deﬁnition and history of sarcoidosis[/tpl] Later in 1892 lupus pernio's histology was defined. In 1902 bone involvement was first described by a group of three doctors. Between 1909 and 1910 uveitis in sarcoidosis was first described, and later in 1915 it was emphasised, by Dr. Schaumann, that it was a systemic condition. This same year lung involvement was also described. In 1937 uveoparotid fever was first described and likewise in 1941 Löfgren syndrome was first described. In 1958 the first international conference on sarcoidosis was called in London, likewise the first USA sarcoidosis conference occurred in Washington, DC in the year 1961. It has also been called Besnier-Boeck disease or Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Babalian|first=L|title=Disease of Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 January 1939|volume=220|issue=4|pages=143–145|doi=10.1056/NEJM193901262200404[/tpl]

==Society and culture==

There exists a society on sarcoidosis and related conditions called, the World Association of Sarcoidosis and other Granulomatous disease (WASOG), whose purpose is to organise meetings for physicians involved in sarcoidosis and related conditions and to inform interested individuals.[tpl]cite web|title=Join WASOG|work=World Association of Sarcoidosis and other Granulomatous Disease|accessdate=21 February 2014|url=http://www.wasog.org/join.htm[/tpl] WASOG has its own journal too, Sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and diffuse lung diseases. There is also an organisation called the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research (FSR), devoted to supporting research into sarcoidosis and its possible treatments.[tpl]cite web|title=Mission & Goals|work=Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research|accessdate=21 February 2014|url=http://www.stopsarcoidosis.org/about-us/mission_goals/[/tpl] There has also been some concerns that rescue workers for the World Trade Center are at a heightened risk for sarcoidosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Izbicki|first=G|coauthors=Chavko, R; Banauch, GI; Weiden, MD; Berger, KI; Aldrich, TK; Hall, C; Kelly, KJ; Prezant, DJ|title=World Trade Center "sarcoid-like" granulomatous pulmonary disease in New York City Fire Department rescue workers.|journal=Chest|date=May 2007|volume=131|issue=5|pages=1414–23|doi=10.1378/chest.06-2114|pmid=17400664|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/22056/1414.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=9/11 Health - What We Know About the Health Effects of 9/11|work=NYC|publisher=US Government|accessdate=22 February 2014|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/html/know/physical.shtml[/tpl]
In 2014, in a letter to the British medical journal The Lancet, it was suggested that the French Revolution leader Maximilien Robespierre suffered from sarcoidosis, and suggested that the condition caused him a notable impairment during his time as the head of the Reign of Terror.[tpl]cite journal|last=Charlier|first=Philippe|coauthors=Philippe Froesch|title=Robespierre: the oldest case of sarcoidosis?|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2013|volume=382|issue=9910|page=2068|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62694-X/fulltext#|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62694-x[/tpl]

==Pregnancy==

Sarcoidosis generally does not prevent successful pregnancy and delivery; the increase in estrogen levels during pregnancy may even have a slightly beneficial immunomodulatory effect. In most cases, the course of the disease is unaffected by pregnancy, with improvement in a few cases and worsening of symptoms in very few cases, although it is worth noting that a number of the immunosuppressants (such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) used in corticosteroid-refractory sarcoidosis are known teratogens.[tpl]cite journal |author=Subramanian P, Chinthalapalli H, Krishnan M|title=Pregnancy and sarcoidosis: an insight into the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria |journal=Chest |volume=126|issue=3|pages=995–8|date=September 2004|pmid=15364785|doi=10.1378/chest.126.3.995 [/tpl]
