Lactose in food (such as dairy products) is broken down by the enzyme lactase into glucose & galactose. In individuals with galactosemia, the enzymes needed for further metabolism of galactose are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose 1-phosphate in various tissues as in the case of classic galactosemia, resulting in hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, brain damage, & ovarian failure. Without treatment, mortality in infants with galactosemia is about 75%.
Galactosemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a child must inherit one defective gene from each parent to show the disease. Heterozygotes are carriers, because they inherit one normal gene & one defective gene.Galactosemia The University of Utah, Genetics Science Learning Center. 2008. Carriers show no symptoms of galactosemia.

==Types==

Galactose is converted into glucose by the action of three enzymes, known as the Leloir pathway. There are diseases associated with deficiencies of each of these three enzymes:

==Accumulation of galactose==

===Reduction to galactitol===

In galactosemic patients, the accumulation of galactose becomes the substrate for enzymes that catalyze the polyol pathway of carbohydrate metabolism. The first reaction of this pathway is the reduction of aldoses, types of sugars including galactose, to sugar alcohols.Kolatkar, Nikheel Dr. "Aldose Rudctase Inhibitors." Your Total Health. http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/aldose-reductase-inhibitors.html Recent data suggests that aldose reductase is the enzyme responsible for the primary stage of this pathway. Therefore aldose reductase reduces galactose to its sugar alcohol form, galactitol. Galactitol, however, is not a suitable substrate for the next enzyme in the polyol pathway, polyol dehydrogenase. Thus, galactitol accumulates in body tissues and is excreted in the urine of galactosemic patients. Accumulation of galactitol has been attributed to many of the negative effects of galactosemia, and high concentrations of galactitol have been found in people with classic galactosemia (GALT deficiency), galactokinase deficiency, and epimerase deficiency.

===Oxidation to galactonate===

Accumulated galactose can also undergo an alternative reaction: oxidation to galactonate. The mechanism of galactonate formation is still unclear. However, recent studies suggest that galactose dehydrogenase is responsible for converting galactose to galactonolactone, which then spontaneously or enzymatically converts to galactonate. Once formed, galactonate may enter the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, oxidation to galactonate serves as an alternate form of metabolizing galactose. This oxidative pathway renders accumulated galactonate less harmful than accumulated galactitol.

==Diagnosis==

Infants are routinely screened for galactosemia in the United States, and the diagnosis is made while the person is still an infant. Infants affected by galactosemia typically present with symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and jaundice. None of these symptoms are specific to galactosemia, often leading to diagnostic delays. Luckily, most infants are diagnosed on newborn screening. If the family of the baby has a history of galactosemia, doctors can test prior to birth by taking a sample of fluid from around the fetus (amniocentesis) or from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling or CVS).[tpl]cite journal |author=Fensom AH, Benson PF, Blunt S |title=Prenatal diagnosis of galactosaemia |journal=Br Med J |volume=4 |issue=5941 |pages=386–7 |date=November 1974 |pmid=4154122 |pmc=1612460 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.4.5941.386|url=[/tpl]
A galactosemia test is a blood test (from the heel of the infant) or urine test that checks for three enzymes that are needed to change galactose sugar that is found in milk and milk products-into glucose, a sugar that your body uses for energy. A person with galactosemia doesn't have one of these enzymes. This causes high levels of galactose in the blood or urine.
Galactosemia is normally first detected through newborn screening, or NBS.  Affected children can have serious, irreversible effects or even die within days from birth.  It is important that newborns be screened for metabolic disorders without delay.  Galactosemia can even be detected through NBS before any ingestion of galactose-containing formula or breast milk.
Detection of the disorder through newborn screening (NBS) does not depend on protein or lactose ingestion, and, therefore, it should be identified on the first specimen unless the infant has been transfused.    A specimen should be taken prior to transfusion.  The enzyme is prone to damage if analysis of the sample is delayed or exposed to high temperatures.  The routine NBS is accurate for detection of galactosemia.  Two screening tests are used to screen infants affected with galactosemia  — the Beutler's test and the Hill test.[tpl]cite journal |author=Parris CR|title=An Overview of Expanded Newborn Screening for Inborn Errors of Metabolism |journal=Nutrition issues in Gastroenterology|date=August 2006|url=http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/medicine/divisions/digestive-health/nutrition-support-team/nutrition-articles/Aug2006.pdf[/tpl] The Beutler's test screens for galactosemia by detecting the level of enzyme of the infant.   Therefore,  the ingestion of formula or breast milk does not affect the outcome of this part of the NBS, and the NBS is accurate for detecting galactosemia prior to any ingestion of galactose.

==Treatment==

The only treatment for classic galactosemia is eliminating lactose and galactose from the diet. Even with an early diagnosis and a restricted diet, however, some individuals with galactosemia experience long-term complications such as speech difficulties, learning disabilities, neurological impairment (e.g. tremors, etc.), and ovarian failure in females. Symptoms have not been associated with Duarte galactosemia, and many individuals with Duarte galactosemia do not need to restrict their diet at all. However, recent research (26) corroborates a previously overlooked theory that Duarte galactosemia may lead to language developmental issues in children with no clinical symptoms. Infants with classic galactosemia cannot be breast-fed due to lactose in human breast milk and are usually fed a soy-based formula.Breastfeeding: Diseases and Conditions: Contraindicators | DNPA
Galactosemia is sometimes confused with lactose intolerance, but galactosemia is a more serious condition.  Lactose intolerant individuals have an acquired or inherited shortage of the enzyme lactase, and experience abdominal pains after ingesting dairy products, but no long-term effects. In contrast, a galactosemic individual who consumes galactose can cause permanent damage to their bodies.
Long term complication of galactosemia includes:
