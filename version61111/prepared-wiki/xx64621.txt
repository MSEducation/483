Julie Myerson (born Julie Susan Pike, 2 June 1960) is an English author and critic.

She has also appeared regularly as a panellist on the arts programme Newsnight Review.

She has written a column for The Independent about her domestic trials including her partner, the screenwriter and director Jonathan Myerson, and their children Jacob (known as Jake), Chloe and Raphael. More recently she has written a column for the Financial Times about homes and houses. Myerson was a regular reviewer on the UK arts programme, Newsnight Review, on BBC Two.

==Fiction==

Myerson's novels are usually quite dark in mood tending towards the supernatural.
Her first novel was Sleepwalking (1994), and it was to some degree autobiographical. It deals in part with the suicide of an uncaring and abusive father (Myerson's own father committed suicide). The main character Susan is heavily pregnant and begins an affair. She also feels she is haunted by her father's mother, reliving the neglect that made him abusive.
In The Touch (1996) a group of young people try to help a tramp who preaches fundamentalist Christianity, and who turns violently against them.
In Me and the Fat Man (1999) a waitress takes to earning extra money giving oral sex in a park, though not out of necessity; she gets involved with two other men, friends who have an awkward relationship and a secret between them that turns out to be related to her own birth.
Laura Blundy (2001) is set in the Victorian period, and Julie Myerson tries to bring out the freshness and modernity of the period as it would have appeared at the time.
Something Might Happen (2003) is about a murder in a Suffolk seaside town.

==Family controversies==

Julie Myerson was the anonymous author of 'Living with Teenagers',[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/10/family-julie-myerson |title= Becky Gardiner: 'Living with the Myersons'|work=The Guardian |location=UK ||date= 10 March 2009  | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]  a Guardian column and later book[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/mar/22/society |title= Kate Figes: 'Chill-out zone'|work=The Guardian |location=UK ||date= 22 March 2008  | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article3313443.ece |title= : 'The hell of living with teenagers'|work=The Times|date= 6 March 2008 | location=London[/tpl] that detailed the lives of a family with three teenage children. The column was stopped after one of the children was identified and was ridiculed at school, although Myerson had previously denied being the author three times to her own children, only coming clean when it became so obvious there was no other option.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/4962988/Julie-Myerson-and-the-extraordinary-case-of-the-copycat-column.html |title= Tim Walker: 'Julie Myerson and the extraordinary case of the copycat column'|publisher=The Telegraph|date= 9 March 2009 | location=London | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]  After the Guardian confirmed the author of the series it removed the articles from its website to 'protect their privacy'.
She was at the centre of a media controversy in March 2009 when details of her book 'The Lost Child: a True Story' emerged; commentators criticised Myerson for what Minette Marrin in The Sunday Times, called her "betrayal not just of love and intimacy, but also of motherhood itself".[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin/article5864699.ece?openComment=true|title= Her son was betrayed because she’s a writer first, mother second|work=The Sunday Times|date= 8 March 2009 | location=London | first=Minette | last=Marrin | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] Tim Lott called the book a "moral failure", adding "Julie has betrayed Jake for her own ambition".[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/tim-lott-julie-has-betrayed-jake-for-her-own-ambition-1639668.html|title= Tim Lott: 'Julie has betrayed Jake for her own ambition'|work=The Independent |location=UK ||date= 8 March 2009  | accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] However, some critics took a diametrically opposing view. The Guardian's Mark Lawson, a friend of Julie Myerson, called the book noble, saying that "The elegance and thoughtfulness of this book – and its warning of a fate that may overtake many parents – should not be lost in the extra-literary frenzy.",[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/mar/14/julie-myerson-lost-child-review|title= Mother courage|work=The Guardian |location=UK ||date= 14 March 2009|accessdate=19 April 2009  | first=Mark | last=Lawson[/tpl] while The Observer's Kate Kellaway called the book rash but courageous, writing that Myerson had tried to "write honestly about a nightmarish situation and a subject that never seems to get the attention it deserves."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/mar/15/lost-child-julie-myerson|title= A potent dose of mother courage|work=The Guardian |location=UK ||date= 15 March 2009|accessdate=19 April 2009  | first=Kate | last=Kellaway[/tpl] The book was published in the U.S. in August 2009.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/books/31myerson.html?scp=1&sq=&st=nyt|title= A Mother's Memoir, a Son's Anguish|work=The New York Times|date= 30 August 2009|accessdate=31 August 2009 | first=Patricia | last=Cohen[/tpl]
Myerson stated she may also sell the film rights at some point in the future, "maybe in 20 years."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/matthew-bell-the-ios-diary-1662812.html|title= Matthew Bell: The IoS Diary|publisher=The Independent on Sunday|date= 5 April 2009|accessdate=5 April 2009 | location=London[/tpl]
Her son described her as "slightly insane" and the publication as "obscene", and declared his intention to change his name to "Jake Karna".[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1163721/My-names-Jake-Karna--Myerson--drug-novel-son-changes-disown-writer-mother.html|title= My name's Jake Karna ...not Myerson – drug novel son changes name to disown writer mother|work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date= 22 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009  | first=Helen | last=Dowd[/tpl] The last name refers to Karna, a Hindu warrior who, in the Mahabharata, is rejected by his mother.
