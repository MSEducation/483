Saint Acacius was a 4th-century priest who lived in  Sebaste, Armenia, during Diocletian's persecution. He was arrested and executed under the governor Maximus with seven women and one Hirenarchus, who was so impressed with the devotion to their faith he became a Christian and suffered the same fate.
