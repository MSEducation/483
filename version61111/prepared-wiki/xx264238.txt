[[Tessera (Venusian geography)]]

CATEGORIES: Surface features of Venus

Tessera is a "complex ridged" surface feature seen on Venusian plateau highlands (and maybe on Neptune's moon Triton). Tessera is thought to be caused by crustal folding, buckling, and breaking. The presence of tessera on Venus suggests that the Venusian surface may be subject to piecewise lateral motions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Basilevsky|first=A.|coauthors=J.
