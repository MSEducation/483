It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has dictated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity.[tpl]cite book |last=McGowen |first=Afaf Sabeh |editor-last=Collelo |editor-first=Thomas |title=Lebanon: A Country Study |chapter=Historical Setting |series=Area Handbook Series |edition=3rd |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Division |publication-date=1989 |oclc=18907889 |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/cntrystd.lb |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl]

In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of Christianity. In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, a religious divide that would last for centuries. During the Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the  Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.
The region eventually came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, a political empire that which came to power from 1299-1923. Following the collapse of the Empire after World War I, the five provinces that constitute modern Lebanon were mandated to France. The French expanded the borders of Mount Lebanon, which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to include more Muslims. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, establishing a unique political system[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]"confessionalism"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]that is a power-sharing mechanism based on religious communities. Bechara El Khoury (independent Lebanon's first president), Riad El-Solh (Lebanon's first prime minister) and Emir Majid Arslan (Lebanon's first minister of defence) are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are national heroes for having led the country's independence.

==Etymology==

The name Lebanon originates from the Semitic root LBN ([tpl]lang|sem|لبن[/tpl]), meaning "white", likely a reference to the snow-capped Mount Lebanon.[tpl]Cite book|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,621 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites |last1=Room |first1=Adrian |edition=2nd |year=2005|publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |pages=214–216|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA214[/tpl]

==History==

===Ancient Lebanon===

Evidence of an early settlement in Lebanon was found in Byblos, which is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,. The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars left by the Neolithic and Chalcolithic fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |title=Archaeological Virtual Tours: Byblos |publisher=Destinationlebanon.gov.lb |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080223164318/http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |archivedate = 23 February 2008[/tpl]
Lebanon was a part of northern Canaan, and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants – the Phoenicians, a seafaring people that spread across the Mediterranean before the rise of Cyrus the Great.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_lebanonphoenicians.htm |title=Lebanon in Ancient Times |publisher=About.com |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] Their most famous colonies were Carthage in today’s Tunisia and Cádiz in today’s Spain. The Phoenicians are best known as the inventors of the alphabet, among many other things. After two centuries of Persian rule, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great attacked and burned Tyre, the most prominent Phoenician city. Throughout the subsequent centuries leading up to recent times, the country became part of numerous succeeding empires, among them Egyptian Empire, Persian, Assyrian, Hellenistic, Roman, Armenian, Eastern Roman, Arab (Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid), Seljuk, Mamluk, the Crusader's state of County of Tripoli founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse that encompassed most of present day Lebanon, and the Ottoman Empire.

===Maronites, Druze, and the Crusades===

The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of Anatolia, became a major center of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the early spread of the religion. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named Maron established a monastic tradition, focused on the importance of monotheism and asceticism, near the Syrian mountain range known as Mount Lebanon. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among the Syrians in the region. These Christians came to be known as Maronites and moved into mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.[tpl]cite book | title=From the Holy Mountain: A Journey Among the Christians of the Middle East | author=Dalrymple, William | year=1997 | publisher=Vintage Books (Random House) | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC |page=305 | isbn=9780307948922[/tpl]
During the 7th century the Muslim Arabs conquered Syria establishing a new regime to replace the Byzantines Though Islam and the Arabic language were officially dominant under this new regime, the general populace still took time to convert from Christianity and the Syriac language. The Maronite community in particular clung stubbornly to its faith and managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Syria.
During the 11th century the Druze faith emerged from a branch of Shia Islam. The new faith gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The Northern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families to the early 14th century which was then brought to an end by the Mamluk invasion. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. The South of current Lebanon (Jabal Amel), Baalbek and The Beqaa Valley was ruled by The Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. The major cities on the coast, Acre, Beirut, and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by Arab culture.
Following the fall of Roman/Christian Anatolia to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the Crusades launched by the Franks in Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially Syria and Palestine (the Levant). The First Crusade succeeded in temporarily establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.[tpl]cite book | author=Hillenbrand, Carole | publisher=Psychology Press | year=2000 | title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives | isbn=978-1-57958-354-5 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC |pages=20–21[/tpl] These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.
One of the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e. the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the eastern Mediterranean, who swore allegiance to Constantinople or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

===Ottoman Lebanon and French Mandate===

During this period current Lebanon was divided into several provinces. The Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel.  
In the Southern Mount Lebanon in 1590, Fakhr-al-Din II became successor to Korkmaz. He soon established his authority as paramount prince of the Druze in the Shouf area of Mount Lebanon. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed Sanjakbey (Governor) of several Ottoman sub-provinces, with responsibility for tax-gathering.  He extended his control over a substantial part of Mount Lebanon and its coastal area, even building a fort as far inland as Palmyra.[tpl]cite book |author=T.J. Gorton |title=Renaissance Emir |publisher=Quartet Books |date=25 April 2013 |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=160–161[/tpl] This over-reaching eventually became too much for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, who sent a punitive expedition to capture him in 1633.  He was taken to Istanbul, kept in prison for two years and then executed along with one of his sons in April 1635.[tpl]cite book |author=T.J. Gorton |title=Renaissance Emir |publisher=Quartet Books |date=25 April 2013 |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=195–210[/tpl] Surviving members of Fakhr al-Din's family ruled a reduced area under closer Ottoman control until the end of the seventeenth century.
On the death of the last Maan emir, various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830.  Approximately 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druzes during inter-communal violence in 1860.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0026) |title=Lebanon |work=Library of Congress Country Studies |date=December 1987[/tpl] Shortly afterwards, the Emirate of Mount Lebanon that lasted about 400 years was replaced by the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the Règlement Organique.
The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the Al Ali Alsagheer in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region.
In 1920, following WWI, the area of the Mutasarrifate, plus some surrounding areas which were predominantly Shia and Sunni, became a part of the state of Greater Lebanon under the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. In the first half of 1920, Lebanese territory was claimed as part of the Arab Kingdom of Syria, but shortly the Franco-Syrian War resulted in Arab defeat and capitulation of the Hashemites. By the end of the war, famine had killed an estimated 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, about 30% of the total population.[tpl]cite web |author=Abdul-Ilah Saadi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/arabunity/2008/02/2008525183842614205.html |title=Dreaming of Greater Syria |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]

A constitution was adopted on 25 May 1926 establishing a democratic republic with a parliamentary system of government.

===Independence===

Lebanon gained independence in 1943, while France was occupied by Germany.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.pbs.org/behindcloseddoors/glossary.html| title = Glossary: Cross-Channel invasion| accessdate =17 October 2009| publisher=Public Broadcasting Service[/tpl]
General Henri Dentz, the Vichy High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.Needed.
After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General Charles de Gaulle visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941 General Georges Catroux announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the Free French government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by throwing the new government into prison. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943 and recognized the independence of Lebanon.
The allies kept the region under control until the end of World War II. The last French troops withdrew in 1946. Lebanon's unwritten National Pact of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its speaker of the parliament to be a Shiite Muslim, its prime minister be Sunni Muslim, and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be Greek Orthodox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/publications/lebanons-confessionalism-problems-and-prospects|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709034419/http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2006/0330_lebanon_confessionalism.html|archivedate=9 July 2008|title=Lebanon's Confessionalism: Problems and Prospects|last=Harb|first=Imad|date=March 2006|work=USIPeace Briefing|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=20 January 2009[/tpl]

In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighbouring Arab countries in a war against Israel. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.[tpl]sfn|Morris|2008|p=524[/tpl] Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.[tpl]sfn|Morris|2008|p=259[/tpl] On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then Minister of National Defence, Emir Majid Arslan – captured Al-Malkiyya.

In 1958, during the last months of President Camille Chamoun's term, an insurrection broke out, instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the United Arab Republic. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 United States Marines were briefly dispatched to Beirut on July 15. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general Fuad Chehab.
With the defeat of the PLO in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.

===Civil war and occupation===

In 1975, following increasing sectarian tensions, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The Lebanese Civil War pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In June 1976 Syria sent in its own troops, ostensibly to restore peace. In October 1976 the Arab League agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian Arab Deterrent Force, which was charged with restoring calm.[tpl]cite web|title=Country Profile: Lebanon|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon/?profile=all|publisher=British Foreign & Commonwealth Office[/tpl]
In 1982, the PLO presence in Lebanon led to an Israeli invasion. A multinational force of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after the Israeli siege of the city, to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. It returned in September 1982 after the assassination of Bashir Gemayel and subsequent fighting, during which a number of massacres were committed, such as in Damour,Noam Chomsky, Edward W.

According to a videotape released by Osama Bin Laden in 2004, images of the bombing of Lebanon were what made him conceive the attack on the United States on the 11th of September 2001, in order to deter further attacks resulting in the deaths of women and children.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3966817.stm
In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi-Moroccan-Algerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.
In the same month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the Taif Agreement, which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the de-confessionalisation of the Lebanese political system. The war ended at the end of 1990 after sixteen years, resulting in massive loss of human life and property, while devastating the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded.[tpl]cite news|title=After 2 Decades, Scars of Lebanon's Civil War Block Path to Dialogue|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/middleeast/after-2-decades-scars-of-lebanons-civil-war-block-path-to-dialogue.html|publisher=New York Times[/tpl]  Some 900,000 people, representing one-fifth of the pre-war population, were displaced from their homes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72218 |title=Lebanon: Haven for foreign militants |publisher=UN IRIN news |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins.[tpl]cite web|last=Salem |first=Paul |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20061101faessay85602/paul-salem/the-future-of-lebanon.html |title=The Future of Lebanon |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] The Taif Agreement has still not been implemented in full and Lebanon's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines.

==Geography==

Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes 33° and 35° N and longitudes 35° and 37° E.
The country's surface area is [tpl]convert|10452|sqkm[/tpl] of which [tpl]convert|10230|sqkm[/tpl] is land. Lebanon has a coastline and border of [tpl]convert|225|km[/tpl] on the Mediterranean sea to the west, a [tpl]convert|375|km[/tpl] border shared with Syria to the north and east and a [tpl]convert|79|km[/tpl] long border with Israel to the south.[tpl]cite book | title=Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan – Middle East: region in transition | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Etheredge, Laura S; Britannica Educational Publishing | year=2011| pages=85–159| isbn=978-1-61530-414-1[/tpl] The border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms.[tpl]cite web|last=Philps |first=Alan |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1343868/Israel%27s-withdrawal-from-Lebanon-given-UN%27s-endorsement.html |title=Israel's Withdrawal from Lebanon Given UN's Endorsement |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2000-06-19 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]
Lebanon is divided into four distinct physiographic regions: the coastal plain, the Lebanon mountain range, the Beqaa valley and the Anti-Lebanon mountains.
The narrow and discontinuous coastal plain stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the Akkar plain to Ras al-Naqoura at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited alluvium alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches.
The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of limestone and sandstone that runs for most of the country's length. The mountain range varies in width between [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|56|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at [tpl]convert|3088|m[/tpl] above sea level in Qurnat as Sawda' in North Lebanon and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of [tpl]convert|2695|m[/tpl] in Mount Sannine.
The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it's a part of the Great Rift Valley system. The valley is [tpl]convert|180|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|10|to|26|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits.
The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in Mount Hermon at [tpl]convert|2814|m[/tpl].
The mountains of Lebanon are drained by seasonal torrents and rivers foremost of which is the [tpl]convert|145|km[/tpl] long Leontes that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of Baalbek and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre. This is a list of all waterways named as rivers in Lebanon. Lebanon has 16 rivers all of which are non navigable; 13 rivers originate on the western face of the Lebanon range and run through the steep gorges and into the Mediterranean Sea, the other three arise in the Beqaa Valley.[tpl]cite web|last=ECODIT|title=National action plan for the reduction of pollution into the mediterranean sea from land based sources|url=http://smap.ew.eea.europa.eu/media_server/files/C/f/NAP_Med.pdf|publisher=Lebanese ministry of the environment|accessdate=31 January 2012|format=pdf|date=October 2005[/tpl] Check the List of rivers of Lebanon.

===Climate===

Lebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.(Bonechi et al.) (2004) Golden Book Lebanon, p. 3, Florence, Italy: Casa Editrice Bonechi. ISBN 88-476-1489-9 Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall, when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings, certain areas in north-eastern Lebanon receive little because of rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/31.htm |title=Lebanon – Climate |publisher=Country Studies US |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]

As a result of longstanding exploitation, few old Cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon, but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for germination and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars, including the Shouf Biosphere Reserve, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the Tannourine Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.Talhouk, S.

In 2010, the Environment Ministry set a 10-year plan to increase the national forest coverage by 20% that is equivalent to the planting of two million new trees each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Article.aspx?id=155258 |title=Lebanon begins landmark reforestation campaign |publisher=The Daily Star |date=2011-11-26 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] The plan, which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and implemented by the United States Forest Service (USFS), through the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI), was inaugurated in 2011 by planting cedar, pine, wild almond, juniper, fir and oak and other seedlings in ten regions around Lebanon.

==Government and politics==

Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy, which implements a special system known as confessionalism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18281.htm |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2002: Lebanon |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |date=2003-03-31 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and attempts to fairly represent the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government.[tpl]cite journal|author=Lijphart, Arend|title=Consociational Democracy|journal=World Politics|volume=21|issue= 2|year=1969|doi=10.2307/2009820|pages=207–225[/tpl]Lijphart, Arend.

Lebanon was rated as "Partly Free" in 2013.
Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they do not have Lebanese citizenship, but this was later reduced to around 20 as of 2007 after liberalization laws.

===Law===

There are 17 official religions in Lebanon, each with its own family law and religious courts. Law of 16 July 1962 concurring in the project of organization of the Sharia, with Sunni and Ja'afari Shii jurisdictions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SHS/pdf/Women_in_Personal_Status_Laws.pdf |title=Women In Personal Status Laws |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]
The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system, and is a civil law country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (heritage, marriage, divorce, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law. For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims. personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf |title=The Lebanese Legal System |author=Chibli Mallat |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]

The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.[tpl]Cite journal | publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | last = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | title = Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms – Lebanon | accessdate =4 July 2009 | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc[/tpl]

===Foreign relations===

Lebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002. It is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the World Trade Organization.
Lebanon enjoys good relations with virtually all of the other Arab countries (despite historic tensions with Libya, the Palestinians, Syria and Iraq), and hosted an Arab League Summit in March 2002 for the first time in more than 35 years. Lebanon is a member of the Francophone countries and hosted the Francophone Summit in October 2002 as well as the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009.

==Economy==

Lebanon’s economy follows a laissez-faire model. Most of the economy is dollarized, and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders. The Lebanese government’s intervention in foreign trade is minimal.

Lebanon has a very high level of public debt and large external financing needs. The 2010 public debt exceeded 150.7% of GDP, ranking fourth highest in the world as a percentage of GDP, though down from 154.8% in 2009.

===History===

The 1975–1990 civil war heavily damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a West Asian entrepôt and banking hub. The subsequent period of relative peace enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange.[tpl]cite web|url=http://teacherlink.ed.usu.edu/tlresources/reference/2001WorldFactbook/LEBANON.PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604195718/http://teacherlink.ed.usu.edu/tlresources/reference/2001WorldFactbook/LEBANON.PDF |archivedate=2007-06-04 |title=CIA World Factbook 2001 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]

==Demographics==

The population of Lebanon was estimated to be 4,125,247 in July 2010, however no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups.[tpl]cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,LBN,4562d8cf2,4954ce52c,0.html |title=Lebanon : Overview Minority Rights Group International |publisher=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically Arab is a widely employed example of panethnicity since in reality, the Lebanese “are descended from many different peoples who have occupied, invaded, or settled this corner of the world,” making Lebanon, “a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures”.[tpl]cite book|author=Jamie Stokes|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East: L to Z|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&pg=PA406|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=June 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7158-6|page=406[/tpl] While at first glance, this ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity might seem to cause civil and political unrest, “for much of Lebanon’s history this multitudinous diversity of religious communities has coexisted with little conflict”.

It is believed that there has been a decline in the ratio of Christians to Muslims over the past 60 years, due to higher emigration rates of Christians, and a higher birth rate in the Muslim population. When the last census was held in 1932, Christians made up 53% of Lebanon's population.[tpl]cite web|title=The Lebanese Demographic Reality|url=http://www.lstatic.org/PDF/demographenglish.pdf|publisher=Lebanese Information Center Lebanon|date=2013-01-14[/tpl] In 1956 it was estimated that the population was 54% Christian and 44% Muslim.
A demographic study conducted by the research firm Statistics Lebanon found that approximately 27% of the population was Sunni, 27% Shi'a, 21% Maronite, 8% Greek Orthodox, 5% Druze, and 5% Greek Catholic, with the remaining 7% mostly belonging to smaller Christian denominations.[tpl]cite web |title=Lebanon |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2010 |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148830.htm[/tpl]

Because the relative size of confessional groups remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932. There are 18 state-recognized religious sects – 4 Muslim, 12 Christian, 1 Druze, and 1 Jewish.

==Culture==

The culture of Lebanon is the cross culture of various civilizations over thousands of years. Originally home to the Phoenicians, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Fatimids, the Crusaders, the Ottoman Turks and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups. Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine.
Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”.Stokes, Jamie. Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Facts On File, 2009, p. 406 ISBN 0816071586 Lebanese Arabic is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted “in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms”.

===Holidays and festivals===

Lebanon celebrates national and both Christian and Muslim holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar. Greek Orthodox (with the exception of Easter), Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God,the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning).
