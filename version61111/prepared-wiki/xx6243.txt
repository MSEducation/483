Helene Bertha Amalie "Leni" Riefenstahl ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈʁiːfənʃtaːl|lang[/tpl]; 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a German film director, photographer, actress and dancer widely known for directing the Nazi Party propaganda film Triumph of the Will. Riefenstahl’s prominence in the Third Reich, along with her personal association with Adolf Hitler, destroyed her film career following Germany's defeat in World War II, after which she was arrested but released without any charges.
Triumph of the Will gave Riefenstahl instant and lasting international fame, as well as infamy. She directed eight films, two of which received significant coverage outside Germany. The propaganda value of her films made during the 1930s repels most modern commentators, but many film histories cite the aesthetics as outstanding.Koster, Ron, Leni Riefenstahl’s Film Début, 2004, retrieved 6 January 2008New York Times, Janet Maslin, Just What Did Leni Riefenstahl’s Lens See?, 13 March 1994, retrieved 6 January 2008Psymon, Leni Gallery, retrieved 6 January 2008[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/leni-riefenstahl-on-trial/49944/ | title=Leni Riefenstahl on Trial | author=Carl Rollyson | publisher=The New York Sun | date=7 March 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl] The Economist wrote that Triumph of the Will "sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century".[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl: Hand-held history |date=September 2003 |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2051630[/tpl]
In the 1970s, Riefenstahl published her still photography of the Nuba tribes in Sudan in several books such as The Last of the Nuba. Active until her death at age 101, she published marine life stills and released the marine-based film Impressionen unter Wasser in 2002.

==Early life==

Christened Helene Bertha Amalie, she was born into a prosperous German Protestant family on 22 August 1902."Leni Riefenstahl" by Leni Riefenstahl; pages: 11, 104 Her father owned a successful heating and ventilation company and he wanted her to follow him into the world of business.http://courses.washington.edu/ger371/riefenstahl/biography.html However, her mother believed that Leni’s future was in show business. In 1918, when she was 16, she started dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Riefenstahl gained a reputation on Berlin's dance circuit and she quickly moved into films. She made a series of films for Arnold Fanck, and one of them, The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), co-directed by G. W. Pabst, saw her fame spread to countries outside of Germany. Riefenstahl produced and directed her own work called Das Blaue Licht (1932), co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival. In the film, Riefenstahl played a peasant girl who protected a glowing mountain grotto. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female.

==Career==

===Dancer and actress===

Riefenstahl took dancing lessons and attended dance academies from an early age and began her career as a self-styled and well-known interpretive dancer, traveling around Europe and working with director Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal.[tpl]cite news |first= Richard|last= Falcon|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=9 September 2003 |publisher=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/09/world.news1 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= Judith|last= Thurman|pages=XX |title=Where There's a Will |date=17 March 2007 |publisher=New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/03/19/070319crbo_books_thurman?currentPage=3[/tpl] After injuring her knee while performing in Prague, she saw a film about mountains, entitled Mountain of Destiny (der Berg des Schicksals, 1924), and became fascinated with the possibilities of this sort of film.[tpl]cite news |first= Val|last= Williams|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=10 September 2003 |publisher=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leni-riefenstahl-548728.html |location=London[/tpl] She went to the Alps to meet the film's director, Arnold Fanck, hoping to secure the lead in his next project. Instead, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker who had starred in Fanck's films, who wrote to the director about her.
Riefenstahl went on to star in many of Fanck’s mountain films as an athletic and adventurous young woman with a suggestive appeal; she became an accomplished mountaineer during the winters of filming on mountains and learned filmmaking techniques. Riefenstahl went on to have a prolific career as an actress in silent films. She was popular with the German public and highly regarded by directors. In 1930, she lost the lead role in the Josef von Sternberg-directed The Blue Angel to her neighbour, Marlene Dietrich.[tpl]cite news |first= Charles|last= Moore|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=10 September 2003 |publisher=Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/2003/09/24/tehAdb1001.xml | location=London[/tpl] Her last acting role before becoming a director was the 1933 U.S.-German co-productions of the Arnold Fanck-directed, German-language SOS Eisberg and the Tay Garnett-directed, English-language SOS Iceberg. The movies were filmed simultaneously and produced and distributed by Universal Studios. SOS Iceberg was Riefenstahl’s only English-language film role as an actress. One of her fans at this time was Adolf Hitler. Riefenstahl accompanied Fanck to the 1928 Olympic Games in St. Moritz, where she became interested in athletic photography and filming.
When presented with the opportunity to direct Das Blaue Licht (The Blue Light) (1932), she took it. Breaking from Fanck's style of setting realistic stories in fairytale mountain settings, Riefenstahl—working with leftist screen writers Béla Balázs and Carl Mayer—filmed Das Blaue Licht as a romantic, wholly mystical tale which she thought of as more fitting to the terrain. She co-wrote, directed and starred in the film and produced it under the banner of her own company, Leni Riefenstahl Productions. Das Blaue Licht won the Silver Medal at the Venice Biennale and played to full audiences all over Europe. However, it was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, many of them Jewish.[tpl]cite news |first= Clive|last= James|pages=XX |title=Reich Star |date=25 March 2007 |publisher=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/books/review/James.t.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1[/tpl] Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of co-writer Béla Balázs and producer Harry Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl’s behest. The director later turned over the name of her Jewish co-screenwriter to Nazi Propagandist Julius Streicher.[tpl]cite news |first= Alan|last= Riding|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl, Film Innovator Tied to Hitler, Dies at 101 |date=10 September 2003 |publisher=The New York Times |url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/riefenstahl-obit.html[/tpl] Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused the offers in order to stay in Germany with a boyfriend.
