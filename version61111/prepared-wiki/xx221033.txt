Renivaldo Pereira de Jesus (born 19 February 1974 in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia), aka Pena, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Serrano Sport Club as a striker.

==Football career==

After playing in modest clubs in his country, Pena had his first taste of European football in 1998, but only lasted a few months with Grasshopper Club Zürich, moving then to Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras.
In 2000 he signed with F.C. Porto, where he was the top goalscorer in the league in his first season with 22 goals, while also adding the cup. After falling out with club coach Octávio Machado, Pena was loaned to RC Strasbourg in France, where he failed to settle; two other loans ensued, and the player experienced some success at both Sporting Clube de Braga and Club Sport Marítimo.
Released by Porto in June 2005, Pena returned to Brazil. After a spell with Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, he saw out his career with modest sides.
