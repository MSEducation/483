==History==

In October of 1799, Russian General Alexander Suvorov made a strategic retreat from the French Revolutionary forces in Italy over the Panix pass, elevation [tpl]convert|2407|m|ft|0[/tpl], which connects the town of Glarus, at [tpl]convert|472|m|ft|0[/tpl], and the hamlet of Panix, at [tpl]convert|1300|m|ft|0[/tpl]. Panix is located on the east side of the mountain along the Schmue stream. The event is frequently mentioned in British mountain guides from the nineteenth century, adding interest to the mountain, and still attracts tourists to the area.[ref]
