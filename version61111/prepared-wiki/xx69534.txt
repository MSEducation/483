CATEGORIES: 12th-century books, Medieval literature

The Ludus de Antichristo is a liturgical drama from the 12th century whose original author is unknown.  Its origins are almost certainly from southern Germany.  The manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery in Tegernsee, Bavaria.  Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa I and his troubles with Pope Alexander III.https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/30891/Thomas_Kyle.pdf?sequence=1  The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the Antichrist, a prophesied figure of evil whose coming (according to the Old and New Testaments) was an indication that the end of the world, or apocalypse, was near.
