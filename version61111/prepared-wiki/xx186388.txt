==Function==

Galactosyltransferase I is one of seven β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) enyzmes. These enzymes are type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a β-1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: β4GalT1 and β4GalT2, β4GalT3 and β4GalT4, β4GalT5 and β4GalT6, and β4GalT7. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the common carbohydrate-protein (GlcA-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser) linkage found in proteoglycans. Manganese is required as a cofactor. This enzyme differs from the other six beta4GalTs because it lacks the conserved β4GalT1-β4GalT6 Cys residues and it is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi.

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in the B4GALT7 gene that result in a defective galactosyltransferase I enzyme with reduced or absent activity are associated with progeroid type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Quentin E, Gladen A, Rodén L, Kresse H. | title = A genetic defect in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate proteoglycan: galactosyltransferase I deficiency in fibroblasts from a patient with a progeroid syndrome. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 1342–6 |date=Aug 1990 | pmid = 2106134 | pmc=53471[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Furukawa K, Okajima T | title = Galactosyltransferase I is a gene responsible for progeroid variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: molecular cloning and identification of mutations | journal = Biochim.
