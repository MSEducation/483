Malcolm in the Middle is an American television sitcom created by Linwood Boomer for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series was first broadcast on January 9, 2000 and ended its six-year run on May 14, 2006, after seven seasons and 151 episodes. The series received critical acclaim, and won a Peabody Award, seven Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, and seven Golden Globe nominations.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/awards |title = Awards list |accessdate =April 24, 2006 |publisher=Internet Movie Database[/tpl]
The series follows a family of six (later seven), and stars Frankie Muniz in the lead role of Malcolm, a more-or-less normal boy who tests at genius level. He enjoys being smart, but he despises having to take classes for gifted children, who are mocked by the other students who call them "Krelboynes", a reference to the nerdy Seymour Krelboyne from The Little Shop of Horrors. Jane Kaczmarek is Malcolm's overbearing, authoritarian mother, Lois, and Bryan Cranston plays his disengaged but loving father, Hal. Christopher Masterson plays eldest brother Francis, a former rebel who, in earlier episodes, was in military school, but eventually marries and settles into a steady job. Justin Berfield is Malcolm's dimwitted older brother Reese, a schoolyard bully who tortures Malcolm at home even while he defends him at school. Younger brother Dewey, a genius musician, is portrayed by Erik Per Sullivan. For the first several seasons, the show's focus was on Malcolm. As the series progressed, however, it began to explore all six members of the family equally. A fifth son—Jamie—was introduced as a baby towards the middle of the series.
Malcolm in the Middle was produced by Satin City and Regency Television in association with Fox Television Studios (syndicated by Fox corporate sibling 20th Television). The show has proven popular worldwide and has been syndicated in 57 countries. In the United States, it had been syndicated during the day on FX and at night on Nickelodeon's sister channel TeenNick, as well as local stations. In the United Kingdom, it originally aired on Sky1 then eventually began on BBC Two, its HD counterpart and Sky2, however after Sky stopped airing repeats of the show, the rights were bought by Channel 5 and are now shown on 5*. In Ireland it aired on TV3's sister channel 3e. It was also syndicated on Network Ten in Australia (originally airing on the Nine Network) and on Comedy Central in India. In Canada, episodes were shown on the Global Television Network.
The show placed No. 88 on Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'s[/tpl] "New TV Classics" list,[tpl]cite web|title=The New Classics: TV|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 5, 2012|date=June 18, 2007[/tpl] and was named by Alan Sepinwall of HitFix as one of the 10 best shows in Fox network history.[tpl]cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=The 10 best shows in FOX network history|url=http://www.hitfix.com/galleries/the-10-best-shows-in-fox-network-history#3|work=HitFix|publisher=HitFix, Inc.|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=April 18, 2012[/tpl]

==Premise==

Set in a suburban neighborhood in the fictional Tri-County Area, Malcolm in the Middle is about a boy named Malcolm and his dysfunctional family.[tpl]cite book|last=Roman|first=James W.|title=From Daytime to Primetime: The History of American Television Programs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h8AqrjoCueUC&pg=PA119|accessdate=February 3, 2014|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31972-3|page=119[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Abbott|first=Jon|title=Irwin Allen Television Productions, 1964–1970: A Critical History of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, The Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gq-uf3wB-TcC&pg=PA139|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=October 3, 2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8662-5|page=139[/tpl] The show stars Frankie Muniz as Malcolm, the third of four (later five) boys, his brothers, and their parents, Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) and Hal (Bryan Cranston). The oldest, Francis (Christopher Masterson), was sent away to military school, leaving at home his three younger brothers, Reese (Justin Berfield), Malcolm, and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), Malcolm being the middle child still at home. In season four, the character Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez) was added to the show as the fifth son. The show's early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an adolescent and enduring the eccentricities of his life. Later seasons gradually explored the other members of the family and their friends in more depth, including others such as Craig Feldspar, Stevie Kenarban, and Stevie's dad Abe.
The series was different from many others in that Malcolm broke the fourth wall by talking directly to the viewer,[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Tom|title=Breaking the Fourth Wall: Direct Address in the Cinema|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HeLhLCfwCbUC&pg=PA74|accessdate=February 3, 2014|year=2012|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-4425-4|page=74[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=Barbara|title=Prime-time Television: A Concise History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XELSaXYkpMwC&pg=PA47|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=January 1, 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98142-6|page=47[/tpl] all scenes were shot using a single camera,[tpl]cite book|last=Berman|first=Garry|title=Best of the Britcoms: From Fawlty Towers to The Office|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V-SLkIap93wC&pg=PR18|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=January 2011|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=978-1-58979-566-2|page=18[/tpl] and the show employed neither a laugh track nor a live studio audience.[tpl]cite news|last=Duffy|first=Mike|title='Malcolm in the Middle' rides to the rescue of the TV sitcom|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=20000426&id=rVMjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RDUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3217,5213050|accessdate=February 4, 2014|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=April 26, 2000[/tpl] Emulating the style of hour-long dramas, this half-hour show was shot on film instead of video. Another distinctive aspect of the show is that the cold open of every episode is unrelated to the main story. Exceptions were episodes which were the conclusions of "two-parters"; each part two episode opened with a recap of its part one episode.

A privately owned home, located at 12334 Cantura Street in Studio City, was rented for upwards of $3,000 a day to film as Malcolm's house.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=Tricia|title=As seen on TV!|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,165987,00.html|accessdate=February 4, 2014|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 5, 2001|quote=They pay about $3,000 to $4,000 a day.[/tpl] School scenes were filmed at Walter Reed Middle School,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvmaps.co.uk/school-where-malcolm-middle-was-filmed |title=The school where Malcolm in the Middle was filmed |accessdate=March 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Filming locations for Malcolm in the Middle |publisher=IMDB |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/locations[/tpl] also in Studio City, and the Lucky Aide was represented by a Drug Emporium at 6020 Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood. In "Stock Car Races," when Hal and the boys are entering a race track, the billboard behind the entrance displays the place as Irwindale Speedway, a real race track in Southern California. The last episode in the first season ("Waterpark") was filmed at a water park called Wild Rivers located in Irvine, California.
Studio filming for Malcolm in the Middle took place at the Radford Avenue CBS Studio Center in Studio City.[tpl]cite book|last=Alleman|first=Richard|title=Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie L.A.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OPRKEpwjfLQC&pg=PA426|accessdate=February 4, 2014|date=March 6, 2013|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8041-3777-5|pages=424–426[/tpl]
Chris Masterson would take a diminished role starting with Season 6 of the show in favor of getting behind the camera, directing and writing some episodes in Seasons 6 and 7.

===Music===

The show's theme song, "Boss of Me", was written and recorded by the alternative rock group They Might Be Giants.[tpl]cite book|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LyoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=November 2002|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|page=63|id=[tpl]ISSN|10746978[/tpl][/tpl] The song won the "Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media" award at the 2002 Grammy Awards.[tpl]cite news|title=They Might Be Giants Tell Kids 'No!'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75673/they-might-be-giants-tell-kids-no|accessdate=February 4, 2014|newspaper=Billboard (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Billboard|date=May 25, 2002[/tpl] The band also performed nearly all of the incidental music for the show in its first two seasons.[tpl]cite news|last=Kelly|first=John|title=Middle Tones|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-01-23/lifestyle/0101220333_1_john-flansburgh-theme-song-particle-man|accessdate=February 4, 2014|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|date=January 23, 2001[/tpl]
Mood setting music is sprinkled throughout the series, in lieu of audience laughter, in a way that resembles feature film more than other TV sitcoms. Some examples of this highly varied music include ABBA, Basement Jaxx, Sum 41, Kenny Rogers, Lords of Acid, The Getaway People, En Vogue, Electric Light Orchestra, Phil Collins, Quiet Riot, Queen, Titán, and Citizen King whose song "Better Days" is played at the end of both the pilot episode and the series finale. The Southern California pop-punk band Lit have many of their songs featured in several episodes. Lit songs that were never released as singles were also used.
A soundtrack, Music from Malcolm in the Middle, was released on November 21, 2000.[tpl]cite web| title =Malcolm in the Middle SoundTrack| publisher=SoundTrackNet| year = 2001| url = http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=2648[/tpl]

Only the first season of Malcolm in the Middle has been released on DVD in the U.S. Season 2 was set to be released in the fall of 2003, but was cancelled due to high costs of music clearances.[tpl]cite news|last=Lambert|first=David|title=Malcolm in the Middle – Season 2 (plus Other Shows) Hamstrung by Music Clearances|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Malcolm-Middle/870|accessdate=February 4, 2014|newspaper=TVShowsOnDVD.com|date=November 30, 2003[/tpl]

All the UK DVD releases are intact as originally aired with no cuts, with the original music, with the exception of one Season 3 episode "Company Picnic" which was originally aired as a one-hour special, before being re-edited and split into two parts for syndication. The DVD presents the syndicated version.
All seven seasons as well as the complete series set were released in Australia in September 2013. The complete series set altered the separate seven season sets to fit into four volumes.
All episodes are in NTSC format, despite several sets being listed as PAL. They are also in 16:9 widescreen format and lack optional subtitles, although they are mistakenly labeled as including them (with the exception of the first season, which is ported from the U.S. release and includes subtitles). The subtitles being labeled as included was fixed in the complete boxset. The opening theme of Season 1, the extended pilot and all extras are in 4:3. In season 2 and 7 opening theme is not 4:3 but has an extended picture effect instead of the black bars. In seasons 3 to 6 the opening theme is in 16:9. Some episodes, due to the only widescreen source having them, includes the TV PG and fox widescreen logos on them but no TV logo.
The show is rated  PG  for Parental Guidance in Australia and  PG  in New Zealand for violence, coarse language and sexual references.

==Syndication==

The show entered barter syndication one month before the sixth season premiered on Fox and was later aired on FX in the fall of 2007 until the fall of 2010. When the show entered syndication all of the TV-14 episodes had to be changed to TV-PG since they did not meet the syndication standards for a TV-14 rating. However Netflix categorizes the show under TV-14 (despite the only episode to use that rating is "Poker #2"). The show was launched on Nick at Nite on July 5, 2009 at 8:00 pm with an all night marathon. However, Nick at Nite aired the show with a PG rating and the episodes were either banned or heavily edited due to content that was too strong for the PG rating.
