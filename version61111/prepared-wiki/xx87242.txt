CATEGORIES: Nanoscale Science Research Centers

The Molecular Foundry is a nanoscience User Facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, and is one of five Nanoscale Science Research Centers sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. The Molecular Foundry provides users from around the world with access to cutting-edge nanoscience expertise and instrumentation in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment. 
Users of the Molecular Foundry are provided with free access to instruments, techniques and collaborators for nanoscience research that is in the public domain and intended for open publication. Proposals for user projects are solicited to promote interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists studying nanoscale phenomena in materials science, physics, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, biology and chemistry in six interdependent facilities:

==Imaging and Manipulation of Nanostructures==

Led by Facility Director Jim Schuck and was founded by Miquel Salmeron

==Nanofabrication==

The nanofabrication facility is led by Facility Director Stefano Cabrini and was founded by Jeff Bokor

==Theory of Nanostructured Materials==

Led by Facility Director David Prendergast and was founded by  Steven Louie

==Inorganic Nanostructures==

Led by Facility Director Jeff Urban and was founded by A. Paul Alivisatos

==Biological Nanostructures==

Led by Facility Director Ron Zuckermann and was founded by Carolyn R. Bertozzi

==Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis==

Led by Facility Director Frantisek Svec and was founded by Jean Fr√©chet
The Molecular Foundry was founded in 2003.  The building was completed on March 24, 2006 and received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold recognition from the US Green Building Council in 2007 for its optimization of energy usage. Jeff Neaton was appointed director of the Molecular Foundry in 2013.
