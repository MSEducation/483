The Heinkel He 49 was a German single-bay single-seat biplane of mixed construction armed with two machine guns. Four designs were made, the He 49a, He 49b, He 49c, and the He 51 which went on to become a Luftwaffe fighter.

==Production history==

The first prototype, the He 49a, was flown in November 1932, and the second prototype, the He 49b, followed in February 1933, with a modified fuselage to make it 40 cm (16 in) longer. This was later turned into a floatplane, the He 49bW, and the third prototype, the He 49c, had a different engine. The He 49d went on to become the He 51, a  fighter used during the Spanish Civil War which continued in service as an advanced trainer and ground-attack aircraft into the early years of World War II.

==Operational history==

All variants - apart from the He 51 - were just prototypes, and were never deployed.
