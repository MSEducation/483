He earned All-American honors at Penn State and in 1997 he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was a first round draft choice of the Green Bay Packers and became an integral member of Vince Lombardi's teams that captured the 1965 NFL championship and Super Bowls I and II.

==Professional career==

Robinson was drafted by the Packers in the first round of the 1963 NFL Draft and by the San Diego Chargers in the third round of the AFL Draft of the same year.  He was also drafted by the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL.  Originally, he did not think he would end up playing in Green Bay. The Chargers had a financial package of $38,000 for Robinson but ran out of money and were going to trade his AFL rights to the Buffalo Bills. Robinson's fiancé (and future wife) Elaine had been to Buffalo and knew how cold it was there, but had never been to Green Bay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/64174112.html|title= An Unsung Hero|publisher=JSOnline.com - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl] Robinson would later recall that she didn't join him there until his second year in the NFL.
The Packers decided to move Robinson from defensive end to linebacker. After backing up incumbent Dan Currie during his rookie season,  Robinson became the starting left side linebacker for the Packers and remained in that role with the team through 1972.  Alongside the immortal MLB Ray Nitschke and Pro Bowler Lee Roy Caffey, the three formed one of the best starting units of linebackers in NFL history. Robinson was not only adept at defending the run but also against the pass. He intercepted 21 passes as a Packer, including five in 1966, which tied cornerback Bob Jeter for the team lead. Robinson played on two Super Bowl Championship teams, and won a total of three NFL Titles with the Packers (1965, 1966, 1967).  During that time, he developed a reputation as a big-game player.Riddell Presents: The Gridiron's Greatest Linebackers  Perhaps the most notable example came in the 1966 NFL Championship game against the Dallas Cowboys. On a fourth down play from the Packers' two-yard-line, Robinson pressured Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith into a desperation pass that was intercepted by safety Tom Brown in the end zone, preserving a 34-27 victory by the Packers.  Despite this, Vince Lombardi, the future Hall of Fame head coach of the Packers, was not pleased that Robinson had freelanced on the play and gave him the coach's lowest grade possible, a minus two. However, Lombardi would later privately praise Robinson for making the game-winning play.
After Lombardi's retirement as Packers' head coach following Super Bowl II, the aging team went into a period of decline under new coach (and former defensive coordinator) Phil Bengtson. Individually, Robinson continued to shine. He was named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI in 1968. In 1969, he was again named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI and was also chosen for the 1st Team's of the New York Daily News, PFW and The Sporting News. Robinson suffered a setback during the 1970 season when he tore his Achilles tendon, but was ready for the start of the 1971 season. By then, Bengtson had been replaced as Packers' head coach by Dan Devine. Robbinson did not get along with Devine and would later state that, while he felt that Vince Lombardi was the best coach he ever played for, Devine was his worst coach at any level: high school, college, or pros. Although the team rebounded from a 4-8-2 record in Devine's first season to finish 10-4 and win the NFC Central Divisional title, the 1972 season would be Robinson's last in a Packers uniform.
Robinson then finished his career with the Washington Redskins from 1973–1974, playing under another future Hall of Fame head coach in George Allen. He later stated that he was fine with the trade to the Redskins because there was no way that he would play for Devine anymore.  Robinson continued his high level of play in D.C., intercepting four passes during his first season with the Redskins. On October 14, 1973, Robinson returned one of those four interceptions 28 yards for the only touchdown of his career during a 21-3 Redskins win over the New York Giants. Robinson retired from the NFL in August 1975 after a career of twelve professional seasons.[tpl]cite web|title=Hall of Famers|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=315[/tpl]  He finished his career with 27 interceptions for return yardage totaling 449 and the one aforementioned touchdown. He also recovered 12 fumbles.  Robinson was named to three Pro Bowls in 1966, 1967, and 1969 and was selected for one of the linebacker spots on the NFL's all-decade team for the 1960s.

==Post NFL Activities==

Robinson has pursued many different endeavors since retiring as an NFL player.
