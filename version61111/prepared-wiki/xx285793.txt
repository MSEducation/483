==History==

Cavendish Farms was established in 1980 when J.D. Irving Ltd. purchased C.M. MacLean Ltd., a company that was operating a small frozen vegetable and french fry processing plant in New Annan, Prince Edward Island.  Plant #1 underwent multiple expansions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s; Cavendish Farms also focused exclusively on french fry processing.
In 1996 a state of the art Plant #2 was commissioned on the opposite side of the highway from Plant #1 in New Annan.  In 2001 the company purchased a french fry processing plant in Jamestown, North Dakota.  In 2009 the company purchased the appetizer division of Omstead Foods in Wheatley, Ontario.  In 2012 the company purchased a potato processing plant in Lethbridge, Alberta.
In 2009 the company commissioned a biogas facility at its two french fry processing facilities in New Annan.  The largest of its kind in North America, Cavendish Farms is the first potato processing company to use solid waste material to produce energy.[tpl]cite web|title=Cavendish Farms - Our History|url=http://www.cavendishfarms.com/grocery-ca-about-us-history.aspx|publisher=Cavendish Farms Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
In 2012 the company converted its two french fry processing facilities in New Annan from burning #6 fuel oil (Bunker C) to use compressed natural gas.  This eliminates the consumption of [tpl]convert|22000000|l|gal|abbr=on[/tpl] of heavy fuel oil annually.[tpl]cite web|title=Cavendish Farms - Our History|url=http://www.cavendishfarms.com/grocery-ca-about-us-history.aspx|publisher=Cavendish Farms Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
