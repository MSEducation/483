[[Chinese numerals]]

CATEGORIES: Numerals, Chinese language, Chinese mathematics

Chinese numerals are words and characters used to denote numbers in Chinese.
Today speakers of Chinese use three written numeral systems: the system of Arabic numerals used world-wide, and two indigenous systems. The more familiar indigenous system is based on Chinese characters that correspond to numerals in the spoken language. These are shared with other languages of the Chinese cultural sphere such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China primarily use the Arabic system for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.
The other indigenous system is the Suzhou numerals, or huama, a positional system, the only surviving form of the rod numerals. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in Hong Kong before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also Roman) numerals.

==Written numbers==

The Chinese character numeral system consists of the Chinese characters used by the Chinese written language to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., "one thousand nine hundred forty-five"), it is not an independent system per se. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in Arabic numerals, in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.

===Characters used to represent numbers===

====Standard numbers====

There are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing and one for use in commercial or financial contexts known as dàxiě ([tpl]zh|t=大寫|s=大写|l=big writing[/tpl]). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would.大寫數字『 A forger could easily change the everyday characters 三十 (30) to 五千 (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters 參拾 (30) and 伍仟 (5000). They are also referred to as "banker's numerals", "anti-fraud numerals", or "banker's anti-fraud numerals". For the same reason, rod numerals were never used in commercial records.
T denotes Traditional Chinese characters, S denotes Simplified Chinese characters.

====Characters with regional usage====

====Characters with military usage====

In the PLA, some numbers will have altered names when used for clearer radio communications. They are:

====Large numbers====

For numbers larger than 10,000, similarly to the long and short scales in the West, there have been four systems in ancient and modern usage. The original one, with unique names for all powers of ten up to the 14th, is ascribed to the Yellow Emperor in the 6th century book by Zhen Luan,  Wujing suanshu (Arithmetic in Five Classics). In modern Chinese only the second system is used, in which the same ancient names are used, but each represents a number 10,000 (myriad, 萬 wàn) times the previous:
In practice, this situation does not lead to ambiguity, with the exception of 兆 (zhào), which means 1012 according to the system in common usage throughout the Chinese communities as well as in Japan and Korea, but has also been used for 106 in recent years (especially in mainland China for megabyte). To avoid problems arising from the ambiguity, the PRC government never uses this character in official documents, but uses 万亿 (wànyì) instead. The ROC government in Taiwan uses 兆 (zhào) to mean 1012 in official documents.

====Numbers from Buddhism====

Numerals beyond 載 zài come from Buddhist texts in Sanskrit, but are mostly found in ancient texts.

====Small numbers====

The following are characters used to denote small order of magnitude in Chinese historically. With the introduction of SI units, some of them have been incorporated as SI prefixes, while the rest have fallen into disuse.

====SI prefixes====

In the People's Republic of China, the translations for the SI prefixes in 1981 were different from those used today. The larger (兆, 京, 垓, 秭, 穰) and smaller Chinese numerals (微, 纖, 沙, 塵, 渺) were defined as translations for the SI prefixes as mega, giga, tera, peta, exa', micro, nano,  pico,  femto,  atto, resulting in the creation of more values for each numeral.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] 1981 Gazette of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, No. 365, page 575, Table 7: SI prefixes
Republic of China (Taiwan) defined 百萬 as the translation for mega. This translation is widely used in official documents, academic communities, informational industries, etc. However, the civil broadcasting industries sometimes use 兆赫 to represent "megahertz".
Today, both the governments of the People's Republic of China (Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau) and Republic of China (Taiwan) use phonetic transliterations for the SI prefixes. However, the governments have each chosen different Chinese characters for certain prefixes. The following table lists the two different standards together with the early translation.

===Reading and transcribing numbers===

====Whole numbers====

Multiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.
In Mandarin, the multiplier 兩 (liǎng) is often used rather than 二 (èr) for all numbers greater than 200 with the "2" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both 兩 (liǎng) or 二 (èr) are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, 二 (yi6) is used to represent the "2" numeral for all numbers.  In the southern Min dialect of Chaozhou (Teochew), 兩 (no6) is used to represent the "2" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.  Thus:
For the numbers 11 through 19, the leading "one" (一) is usually omitted.  In some dialects, like Shanghainese, when there are only two significant digits in the number, the leading "one" and the trailing zeroes are omitted.  Sometimes, the one before "ten" in the middle of a number, such as 213, is omitted.  Thus:
Notes:
In certain older texts like the Protestant Bible or in poetic usage, numbers such as 114 may be written as 100 10 4 (百十四).
For numbers larger than a myriad, the same grouping system used in English applies, except in groups of four places (myriads) rather than in groups of three (thousands).  Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.  Larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 × wàn (萬) = yì (億). If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading "one" is omitted as per the above point.  Hence (numbers in parentheses indicate that the number has been written as one number rather than expanded):
Interior zeroes before the unit position (as in 1002) must be spelt explicitly.  The reason for this is that trailing zeroes (as in 1200) are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs.  One zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.  Where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred.  Thus:

====Fractional values====

To construct a fraction, the denominator is written first, followed by 分之 ("parts of") and then the numerator. This is the opposite of how fractions are read in English, which is numerator first. Each half of the fraction is written the same as a whole number. Mixed numbers are written with the whole-number part first, followed by 又 ("and"), then the fractional part.
Percentages are constructed similarly, using 百 (100) as the denominator. The 一 (one) before 百 is omitted.
Decimal numbers are constructed by first writing the whole number part, then inserting a point ([tpl]zh|t=點 |s=点 |p=diǎn[/tpl]), and finally the decimal expression. The decimal expression is written using only the digits for 0 to 9, without multiplicative words.

====Ordinal numbers====

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding 第 dì ("sequence") before the number.

====Negative numbers====

Negative numbers are formed by adding ([tpl]zh|t=負 |s=负[/tpl], Pinyin: fù, Jyuping: fu6) before the number.

====Usage====

Chinese grammar requires the use of classifiers (measure words) when a numeral is used together with a noun to express a quantity. For example, "three people" is expressed as 三个人 sān ge rén, "three GE person", where 个 ge is a classifier. There exist many different classifiers, for use with different sets of nouns, although 个 is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers. For details see the article Chinese classifier.
Chinese uses cardinal numbers in certain situations in which English would use ordinals. For example, 三楼 sān lóu (literally "three story") means "third floor" ("second floor" in British numbering). Likewise, 二十一世纪 èrshí yī shìjì (literally "twenty-one century") is used for "21st century".Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar, Routledge, 2004, p. 12.
Numbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in 二零零一 èr líng líng yī ("two zero zero one") for the year 2001.Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar, Routledge, 2004, p. 13. Names of months and days (in the Western system) are also expressed using numbers: 一月 yīyuè ("one month") for January, etc.; and 星期一 xīngqīyī ("week one") for Monday, etc. (although Sunday is 星期日 xīngqīrì, or informally 星期天 xīngqītiān, "week day"). Full dates are usually written in the format 2001年1月20日 for January 20, 2001 (using 年 nián "year", 月 yuè "month", and 日 rì "day") – all the numbers are read as cardinals, not ordinals, and the year is read as a sequence of digits as just mentioned. (See also Chinese calendar.)

==Counting rod and Suzhou numerals==

In the same way that Roman numerals were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the rod numerals, which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals ([tpl]zh|t=蘇州花碼 |s=苏州花码 |p=Sūzhōu huāmǎ[/tpl]) system is a variation of the Southern Song rod numerals. Nowadays, the huāmǎ system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

==Hand gestures==

There is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.

==Historical use of numerals in China==

Most Chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the Shang dynasty oracle numerals of the 14th century BC. The oracle bone script numerals were found on tortoise shell and animal bones. In early civilizations, the Shang were able to express any numbers, however large, with only nine symbols and a counting board.The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, p5,Cambridge University Press  ISBN 0-521-23582-0
Some of the bronze script numerals such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 became part of the system of rod numerals.
In this system, horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  Sun Tzu wrote that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal".Chinese Wikisource 孫子算經: 先識其位，一從十橫，百立千僵，千十相望，萬百相當。
The counting rod numerals system has place value and decimal numerals for computation, and was used widely by Chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the Han dynasty to the 16th century.
Alexander Wylie, Christian missionary to China, in 1853 already refuted the notion that "the Chinese numbers were written in words at length", and stated that in ancient China, calculation was carried out by means of counting rods, and "the written character is evidently a rude presentation of these". After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said "Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value place-value, several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs."Alexander Wylie, Jottings on the Sciences of the Chinese, North Chinese Herald, 1853, Shanghai
During the Ming and Qing dynasties (when Arabic numerals were first introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.

==Cultural influences==

Traditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in Japan and Korea and were used in Vietnam before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.
