==Biography==

Kevin Warwick was born in 1954 in Coventry in the United Kingdom. He attended Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby, Warwickshire. He left school in 1970 to join British Telecom, at the age of 16. In 1976 he took his first degree at Aston University, followed by a Ph.D and a research post at Imperial College London.
He subsequently held positions at Oxford, Newcastle and Warwick universities before being offered the Chair in Cybernetics at the University of Reading in 1987.
Warwick is a Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology and a Fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute. He is Visiting Professor at the Czech Technical University in Prague and the University of Strathclyde and in 2004 was Senior Beckman Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. He is also Director of the University of Reading Knowledge Transfer Partnerships Centre, which links the University with Companies and is on the Advisory Boards of the Instinctive Computing Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/vis/ |title=Ambient Intelligence Lab (AIL) – Ambient Intelligence |publisher=Cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26[/tpl] and the Centre for Intermedia, University of Exeter.Advisory Board – English – University of Exeter. Humanities.exeter.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.
By the age of 40 he had been awarded higher doctorates (D.Sc.) by both Imperial College and by the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague for his research output in completely separate areas. He was presented with the 'Future of Health Technology Award' in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was made an Honorary Member of the Academy of Sciences, St.Petersburg. He has received the IET Achievement Medal, the IET Mountbatten Medal and in 2011 the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://conferences.theiet.org/pinkerton/speaker/index.cfm|title=The Pinkerton Lecture 2012|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|accessdate=2012-10-24[/tpl]
Warwick is currently Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Research at Coventry University.

==Work==

Warwick carries out research in artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, control systems and robotics. Much of Warwick's early research was in the area of discrete time adaptive control. He introduced the first state space based self-tuning controller[tpl]cite journal |last=Kevin |first=Warwick |title=Self-tuning regulators: A state-space approach |year=1981 |journal=International Journal of Control |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=839–858 |doi=10.1080/00207178108922958[/tpl] and unified discrete time state space representations of ARMA models.Warwick, K: "Relationship between Åström control and the Kalman linear regulator – Caines revisited", Journal of Optimal Control:Applications and Methods, 11(3), pp.223–232, 1990
However he has also contributed in mathematics,Warwick,K:"Using the Cayley–Hamilton theorem with N partitioned matrices",IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, AC.28(12),pp.1127–1128, 1983 power engineering[ref]Warwick, K, Ekwue, A and Aggarwal, R (eds).

===Artificial intelligence===

Warwick presently heads an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council supported research project which investigates the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in order to suitably stimulate and translate patterns of electrical activity from living cultured neural networks in order to utilise the networks for the control of mobile robots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://technology.newscientist.com/channel/tech/mg19926696.100-rise-of-the-ratbrained-robots.html |title=Rise of the rat-brained robots – tech – 13 August 2008 – New Scientist |publisher=Technology.newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26[/tpl] Hence a biological brain actually provides the behaviour process for each robot. It is expected that the method will be extended to the control of a robot head.
Previously Warwick was behind a genetic algorithm called Gershwyn, which was able to exhibit creativity in producing pop songs, learning what makes a hit record by listening to examples of previous hit songs.BBC News|Entertainment|To the beat of the byte, 1 July 1998 Gershwyn appeared on BBC's Tomorrow's World having been successfully used to mix music for Manus, a group consisting of the four younger brothers of Elvis Costello.
Another Warwick project involving artificial intelligence is the robot head, Morgui. The head contains 5 senses (vision, sound, infrared, ultrasound and radar) and is being used to investigate sensor data fusion. The head was X-rated by the University of Reading Research and Ethics Committee due to its image storage capabilities – anyone under the age of 18 who wishes to interact with the robot must apriori obtain parental approval.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/jul/17/highereducation.science |title=University robot ruled too scary |last=Radford |first=Tim |date=13 July 2003 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London[/tpl]
Warwick has very outspoken views on the future, particularly with respect to artificial intelligence and its impact on the human species, and argues that we will need to use technology to enhance ourselves in order to avoid being overtaken.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/12/99/back_to_the_future/kevin_warwick.stm | work=BBC News[/tpl] He also points out that there are many limits, such as our sensorimotor abilities, that we can overcome with machines, and is on record as saying that he wants to gain these abilities: "There is no way I want to stay a mere human."Kevin Warwick, FAQ, http://www.kevinwarwick.com/faq.htm (last question)

===Bioethics===

Warwick heads the University of Reading team in a number of European Community projects such as FIDIS looking at issues concerned with the future of identity, ETHICBOTS and RoboLaw which consider the ethical aspects of robots and cyborgs.Warwick, K: "Implications and Consequences of Robots with Biological Brains", Ethics and Information Technology, 12, pp. 223–234, 2010
Warwick is also working with Daniela Cerqui, a social and cultural anthropologist from the University of Lausanne, to address the main social, ethical, philosophical and anthropological issues related to his research.http://www.kevinwarwick.com
Warwick’s areas of interest have many ethical implications, some due to his Human enhancement experiments. The ethical dilemmas in his research are highlighted as a case study for schoolchildren and science teachers by the Institute of PhysicsPEEP Physics Ethics Education Project: People as a part of their formal Advanced level and GCSE studies. His work has also been directly discussed by The President's Council on Bioethics and the President’s Panel on Forward Engagements.Introduction He is presently a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on Novel Neurotechnologies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/neurotechnology/neurotechnology-about-working-party |title=Neurotechnology - About the Working Party | Nuffield Council on Bioethics |publisher=Nuffieldbioethics.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26[/tpl]
His paper entitled Future issues with Robots and Cyborgs is ranked as the top paper, in terms of downloads per day, in the journal Studies in Ethics, Law and Technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bepress.com/selt/topdownloads.html |title=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |publisher=Bepress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26[/tpl]

===Deep brain stimulation===

Along with Tipu Aziz and his team at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and John Stein of the University of Oxford, Warwick is helping to design the next generation of Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article2079637.ece|work=The Times|location=London|title=The blade runner generation|first=Charlotte|last=HuntGrubbe|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=2010-05-07[/tpl] Instead of stimulating the brain all the time, the aim is for the device to predict when stimulation is needed and to apply the signals prior to any tremors occurring to stop them before they even start.Wu, D., Warwick, K., Ma, Z., Burgess, J., Pan, S. and Aziz, T: “Prediction of Parkinson’s disease tremor onset using radial basis function neural networks”, Expert Systems with Applications, Vol.37, Issue.4, pp. 2923–2928, 2010

===Public awareness===

Warwick has headed a number of projects aimed at exciting schoolchildren about the technology with which he is involved. In 2000 he received the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Millennium Award for his Schools Robot League. Meanwhile in 2007, 16 school teams were involved in designing a humanoid robot to dance and then complete an assault course—a final competition being held at the Science Museum (London). The project, entitled 'Androids Advance' was supported by EPSRC and was presented as an evening news item on Chinese television.英国类人机器人大赛 寓教于乐两相宜(机器人,教育,科技,发展,英国 ) – 新视界－全球资讯视频总汇
Warwick contributes significantly to the public understanding of science by giving regular public lectures, taking part in radio programmes and through popular writing. He has appeared in numerous television documentary programmes on artificial intelligence, robotics and the role of science fiction in science, such as How William Shatner Changed the World, Future Fantastic and Explorations.Kevin Warwick He also appeared in the Ray Kurzweil inspired film Transcendent Man along with Colin Powell, William Shatner and Stevie Wonder. He has also guested on a number of TV chat shows, including Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Først & sist, and Richard & Judy. Warwick has appeared on the cover of a number of magazines, for example the February 2000 edition of Wired.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/wired/coverbrowser/2000 | work=Wired | title=Cover Browser – Wired Magazine[/tpl]
In 2000 Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of the Robots. The lectures were well received by some and were even felt to be inspirational.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7927000/7927557.stm | work=BBC News | title=Today: Friday 6 March 2009 | date=6 March 2009[/tpl] Meanwhile in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is a danger to the public perception of science.Cyber don shrugs off attack on credibility In light of Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sgc/html_papers/colton_thes00.html |title=AISB - Cyborg Off His Christmas Tree by Simon Colton |publisher=Doc.ic.ac.uk |date=2001-12-22 |accessdate=2013-05-26[/tpl] Subsequent letters were generally positive, Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures.[tpl]cite web|author=12 January 2001 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=156487 |title=Letter: A Christmas cheer | General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2001-01-12 |accessdate=2013-05-26[/tpl]
In 2005 Warwick was congratulated for his work in attracting students to the field by Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom in an Early day motion for making the subject interesting and relevant so that more students will want to develop a career in science.Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Scheme And Wales.

===Robotics===

Warwick's claims that robots that can program themselves to avoid each other while operating in a group raise the issue of self-organisation, and as such might be the major impetus in following developments in this area. In particular, the works of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, once in the province of pure speculation now have become immediately relevant with respect to synthetic intelligence.
Cyborg-type systems not only are homeostatic (meaning that they are able to preserve stable internal conditions in various environments) but adaptive, if they are to survive. Testing the claims of Varela and Maturana via synthetic devices is the larger and more serious concern in the discussion about Warwick and those involved in similar research. "Pulling the plug" on independent devices cannot be as simple as it appears, for if the device displays sufficient intelligence and assumes a diagnostic and prognostic stature, we may ultimately one day be forced to decide between what it could be telling us as counterintuitive (but correct) and our impulse to disconnect because of our limited and "intuitive" perceptions.
Warwick's robots seemed to have exhibited behaviour not anticipated by the research, one such robot "committing suicide" because it could not cope with its environment.Warwick, K: “I, Cyborg”, University of Illinois Press, 2004, p 66 In a more complex setting, it may be asked whether a "natural selection" may be possible, neural networks being the major operative.
The 1999 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recorded that Warwick carried out the first robot learning experiment across the internet. One robot, with an Artificial Neural Network brain in Reading, UK, learnt how to move around. It then taught, via the internet, another robot in SUNY Buffalo New York State, USA, to behave in the same way. The robot in the USA was therefore not taught or programmed by a human, but rather by another robot based on what it itself had learnt.Warwick, K: “I, Cyborg”, University of Illinois Press, 2004
Hissing Sid was a robot cat which Warwick took on a British Council lecture tour of Russia, it being presented in lectures at such places as Moscow State University. Sid, which was put together as a student project, got its name from the noise made by the Pneumatic actuators used to drive its legs when walking. The robot also appeared on BBC TV's Blue Peter but became better known when it was refused a ticket by British Airways on the grounds that they did not allow animals in the cabin.[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_/ai_56752397|work=Airline Industry Information|title=-BA criticised over denying boarding to robotic cat|date=22 October 1999[/tpl]
Warwick was also responsible for a robotic "magic chair" (based on the SCARA-form UMI RTX[tpl]cite web|last=UMI|title=Inside the UMI RTX Robot Arm|url=http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/w/images/3/3c/RTX_Inside.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl]  arm) which Sir Jimmy Savile used on BBC TV's Jim'll Fix It. The chair provided Jim with tea and stored Jim'll Fix it badges for him to hand out to guests.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguide/tvradio/story/0,,2045929,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Now then, now then|first=Sam|last=Delaney|date=31 March 2007|accessdate=2010-05-07[/tpl] Warwick even appeared on the programme himself for a Fix it involving robots.

===Project Cyborg===

Probably the most famous piece of research undertaken by Warwick (and the origin of the nickname, "Captain Cyborg", given to him by The Register) is the set of experiments known as Project Cyborg, in which he had a chip implanted into his arm, with the aim of "becoming a cyborg".
The first stage of this research, which began on 24 May 1998, involved a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, and used to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity. The main purpose of this experiment was said to be to test the limits of what the body would accept, and how easy it would be to receive a meaningful signal from the chip.Wired Magazine 8.02 (February 2000), 'Cyborg 1.0: Interview with Kevin Warwick'. Retrieved 25-12-2006.
The second stage involved a more complex neural interface which was designed and built especially for the experiment by Dr. Mark Gasson and his team at the University of Reading. This device consisted of an internal electrode array, connected to an external "gauntlet" that housed supporting electronics. It was implanted on 14 March 2002, and interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The electrode array inserted contained 100 electrodes, of which 25 could be accessed at any one time, whereas the median nerve which it monitored carries many times that number of signals. The experiment proved successful, and the signal produced was detailed enough that a robot arm developed by Warwick's colleague, Dr Peter Kyberd, was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/60/10/1369.pdf|author=Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A|title=The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=60|issue=10|pages=1369–1373|year=2003|doi=10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|pmid=14568806[/tpl]
By means of the implant, Warwick's nervous system was connected onto the internet in Columbia University, New York. From there he was able to control the robot arm in the University of Reading and to obtain feedback from sensors in the finger tips. He also successfully connected ultrasonic sensors on a baseball cap and experienced a form of extra sensory input.Warwick, K, Hutt, B, Gasson, M and Goodhew, I:“An attempt to extend human sensory capabilities by means of implant technology”, Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Hawaii, pp.1663–1668, October 2005
A highly publicised extension to the experiment, in which a simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife—with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal from afar—was also successful in-so-far as it resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: “Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy”, IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185–189, 2004 Finally, the effect of the implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP).Kyberd, P, Murgia, A, Gasson, M, Tjerks, T, Metcalf, C, Chappell, P, Warwick, K, Lawson, S and Barnhill, T: "Case studies to demonstrate the range of applications of the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure", British Journal of Occupational Therapy, 72(5), pp.212–218, 2009 It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, nerve tissue was seen to grow around the electrode array, enclosing the sensorGasson, M.N., Hutt, B.D., Goodhew, I., Kyberd, P., and Warwick, K: "Invasive Neural Prosthesis for Neural Signal Detection and Nerve Stimulation", International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing, Vol.19:5, pp.365–75, 2005.
As well as the Project Cyborg work, Warwick has been involved in several of the major robotics developments within the Cybernetics Department at Reading. These include the "seven dwarves", a version of which was sold in kit form as "Cybot" on the cover of Real Robots magazine.

===Implications of Project Cyborg===

Warwick and his colleagues claim that the Project Cyborg research could lead to new medical tools for treating patients with damage to the nervous system, as well as opening the way for the more ambitious enhancements Warwick advocates. Some transhumanists even speculate that similar technologies could be used for technology-facilitated telepathy."[tpl]cite web|title=Evolving Towards Telepathy|date=26 April 2004|author=George Dvorsky|url=http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/267/Default.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706064752/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/267/Default.aspx|archivedate=6 July 2007|publisher=Betterhumans [/tpl] Warwick himself asserts that his controversial work is important because it directly tests the boundaries of what is known about the human ability to integrate with computerised systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
A controversy arose in August 2002, shortly after the Soham murders, when Warwick reportedly offered to implant a tracking device into an 11-year-old girl as an anti-abduction measure. The plan produced a mixed reaction, with support from many worried parents but ethical concerns from a number of children's societies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] As a result, the idea did not go ahead.

===Turing Interrogator===

Warwick has participated as a Turing Interrogator, on two occasions, judging machines in the 2001 and 2006 Loebner Prize competitions, platforms for an 'imitation game' as devised by Alan Turing. The 2001 Prize, held at the Science Museum in London, featured Turing's 'jury service' or one-to-one Turing tests and was won by A.L.I.C.E.The A. L. I. C. E.
