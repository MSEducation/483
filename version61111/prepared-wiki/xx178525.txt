The castle lying on raised bedrock was a well defended position for a fortification with thick and high walls, which was also surrounded by a moat that had only one access available through a drawbridge.
The historic site in 2013 was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the ongoing Syrian civil war. The Syrian government reported that there have been "illegal excavation acts in unexplored tombs in Palmyra". There are also pictures that appear to show government tanks using the Roman colonnaded road.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria's priceless heritage under attack|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21702546|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2013[/tpl]
