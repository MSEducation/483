U.S. Route 28 is a defunct designation (since the early 1950s) of an east–west highway between Florence, Oregon, and Ontario, Oregon.

==History==

In 1937, US 28 was truncated at Eugene, Oregon, which then became its western terminus. US 28 was replaced with U.S. Route 26 when U.S. 26 was extended from Wyoming to the Pacific Ocean in 1952.  The portion of US 28 from Ontario, OR, to Prineville, OR, became US 26.  US 26 then continued in a northwesterly direction to Portland and Astoria.  From Prineville to Eugene, US 28 became U.S. Route 126, now known as Oregon Route 126.

==Route description==

US 28 began at US 99 in Eugene before continuing to Sisters and Redmond, where the route met US 97. Continuing east, the highway ran concurrently with US 395 to Prineville.
At the junction with Route 126, the old designation of US 28 follows US 26 and picks up the Ochoco Highway No. 41, which also follows OR 126 west to US 97 in Redmond. The Ochoco Highway ends at OR 19 near Dayville, from which US 28 followed the John Day Highway No. 5 through John Day to US 20 in Vale. The remainder of US 28 in Oregon overlapped US 20 on the Central Oregon Highway No. 7 to the Idaho state line.
