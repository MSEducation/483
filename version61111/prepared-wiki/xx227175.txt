2 Days & 1 Night ([tpl]ko-hhrm|1박 2일[/tpl]; also known as 1 Night 2 Days; abbreviated as 1N2D) is a South Korean reality-variety show that airs on KBS2 beginning August 5, 2007. 1 Night 2 Days is one of the two segments (the other segment is Superman is Back) on Happy Sunday. The show's current cast members are Cha Tae-hyun, Kim Jong-min, Kim Joo-hyuk, Kim Jun-ho, Defconn, Jung Joon-young.
The show's motto is "Real wild road variety." Its main concept is to recommend various places of interest that viewers can visit in South Korea. Filming for every new trip is usually done 2 weeks prior to broadcast.

==Synopsis==

The cast members have made various trips throughout Korea, including many offshore islands.  The most notable trip to date was to the Liancourt Rocks, controversial due to the ownership claims on the island by both South Korea (which calls them Dokdo) and Japan (which calls them Takeshima). On their 17th trip to Wando County in South Jeolla, the cast was told to live and experience the wildlife having no access to their cellphones and having to build a tent on their own with the materials provided by the production crew. In June 2008, they travelled to Baekdu Mountain (Changbai Mountain), which is located on the border of North Korea and China. The trip took 4 nights and 5 days, rather than usual 1 night and 2 days. They took the scenic route to Baekdu Mountain by taking a boat to China then taking a bus to the actual mountain rather than by taking a direct flight in order to film the beautiful scenery along the way.  After climbing up the stairs leading up the mountain they reached Heaven Lake (천지, 天池), one of the highest crater lakes in the world.  At Heaven Lake they symbolically poured water from the Liancourts, the disputed easternmost island of Korea; Udo (우도), one of the southernmost islands of Korea; Gageodo, the westernmost island of Korea; and Baengnyeong Island, the northernmost island in the Yellow Sea. This was to symbolize their wish for Korea to once again become one united nation just as the waters became one at Heaven Lake. Near the end of 2009, it was rumored that a trip for Antarctica was being planned. The producer confirmed that they are trying to arrange a journey to the South Pole and on the 125th episode, Kang Ho-dong mentioned to Park Chan-ho that the trip will take place in March. However, the trip was canceled due to the 2010 Chile earthquake. There was also a viewers' special trip on February 2009, where the production team started gathering 6 teams for a trip with the cast. Thousands of applications were sent to the team and the final teams were chosen by the casts themselves. The episode became very popular and on December 2009, the production team announced that a second viewers' special is coming on February 2010 and mentioned that they received around 100,000 applications. In August 2011, they had a third viewer's special, which had 100 people attending from ages 1–100, adding another senior, who's age is 102.

==History==

Before 1 Night 2 Days was first aired, it was preceded by Are You Ready which featured most of the 1 Night 2 Days members — Kang Ho-dong, Lee Soo-geun, Kim Jong-min, and Eun Ji-won. Are You Ready was canceled due to low viewership ratings and was replaced by 1 Night 2 Days after 12 episodes.
Singer and actor Lee Ji-hoon was offered to join the cast of 1 Night 2 Days but rejected the role to take a role on MBC drama New Heart instead.[tpl]ko icon[/tpl] 이지훈, "내가 거절한 '1박 2일' 대박 배아파" My Daily. May 28, 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2009.
1 Night 2 Days premiered with cast members Kang Ho-dong, Lee Soo-geun, Kim Jong-min, Eun Ji-won, Noh Hong-chul, Ji Sang-ryul, and Sanggeun the dog mascot on August 5, 2007.
The show later experienced a number of cast member changes:
Season 1 broadcast its final episode on February 26, 2012.
Season 2 premiered on March 4, 2012 with returning members Lee Soo-geun, Kim Jong-min, and Uhm Tae-woong, who were joined by new members Kim Seung-woo, Cha Tae-hyun, Sung Si-kyung, and Joo Won. Kim Seung-woo left the show in March 2013 to re-focus on his acting career. He was replaced by fellow actor Yoo Hae-jin. 
On November 24, 2013 1 Night 2 Days Season 2 officially wrapped up season two with a final goodbye from the members. Similar to the show’s signature opening in which the members gather together to introduce the episode, it was fitting to see the members gather one last time to bid farewell to its audience. 
Season 3 of 1 Night 2 Days will consist of returning members Cha Tae-hyun and Kim Jong-min, as well as new members Kim Jun-ho, Kim Joo-hyuk, Jung Joon-young, and Defconn.

==Broadcast==

KBS Drama, KBS Joy has often aired re-runs of 1 Night 2 Days. U-KBS HERAT, a DMB, a digital radio transmission technology developed by South Korea, channel aired the show daily from Monday to Friday at 8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m. and recorded the show as one of the "fun to watch" re-runs. KBS World, the international broadcasting service provided by KBS, also started airing English-subtitled episodes (usually 2-4 weeks after the original broadcast) of the show starting from Episode 35 titled as 2 Days and 1 Night.
With 1 Night 2 Days being well received, KBS Joy launched a "female version" of 1 Night 2 Days called 다녀오겠습니다. The first season aired between January 12, 2009 and April 29, 2009. The first season's members were gagwoman Kim Sook, Kim E-Z (former member of Baby V.O.X.), Jeong Jung-ah, Bronwyn Mullen (Afrikaaner ethnicity and member on Global Talk Show), Polina Lipina (Polish ethnicity and member on Global Talk Show), and Kim Ji Hye (member of Korean girl group Cats).

===Bok-bul-bok Game===

"Bok Bul Bok Game" (복불복), which can be translated to "blessing-curse-blessing" or "luck or not", is the method used to determine which members will be sleeping outside as well as to decide which members will be getting food. The decision is based on the results of games such as "Kung Kung Ta" (쿵쿵따), a game where a person says a word that does not exist and the next person has to make a new word that doesn't exist with the ending letter or simple games like juggling soccer balls. The first three members who lose the game are given a punishment, such as drinking salt water or soy sauce or eating other strange foods. For example, "Kkanari Eakjeott" (까나리 액젓), "Myeolchi Eakjeott" (멸치 액젓), "Hwang-seo-geo-jeott" (황석어젓), "Buldak-sauce" (불닭 소스), "Wasabi" (고추냉이), "Vinegar" (식초), and more. If they can pass their punishment, they are able to escape sleeping outside or receive food and prizes automatically, however this rarely happens. Kim C and the rest of the cast once said, "The Bok Bul Bok system is completely unfair and crazy." ("복불복 시스템은 완전 공정하지 않으며 미친 것이다") Also, MC Mong once left a quote stating in their trip to Jeju do, "Bok Bul Bok Forever! As long as it's not me!" ("복불복이여 영원하라, 나만 아니면 돼!") Bok-bul-bok represents an important significance of the show.

====Bok-bul-bok marathon====

Every summer the show will conduct a Bok-bul-bok marathon. At certain points in the race, Bok-bul-bok games are placed where the runners chooses an item which can either benefit them or make them suffer. These could be fish sauce, hot or cold coffee, water, salt-water or other various items. Two of the members are omitted from the race and rides on a truck to be commentators. Their first marathon winner was Lee Seung-gi. Their second annual marathon winner was Kim C who ran the race in a full-length parka.

====Autumn reading competition====

Every autumn the show will conduct a reading competition. The cast will have an hour to study before the competition starts. Members who lost the competition was chosen to sleep outdoors.

====Challenging the production team====

On the episode aired May 31, 2009, the cast challenged the production team, where if the cast wins they get to have dinner and sleep inside while the production team will sleep outdoors. However, after playing three games of Bok-bul-bok, including a game of table tennis, badminton, and soccer, the cast lost and the production team got to eat their dinner. On the episode aired September 27, 2009, the production team were once challenged again by the crew. If the production team lost, all 80 staff members including the casts' managers and coordinators were to sleep outside. With some luck, the cast defeated the production team in winning two of the three Bok-bul-bok games. The games they played on their second challenge were a 3-point table tennis match, 3-point soccer game, and jump roping. As aired on the same episode, the production team and cast agreed to have their next challenge during their first snow.

====Indoor, outdoor and "out-outdoor" sleeping====

This concept first appeared on their trip to Andong, North Gyeongsang when the cast were split up into YB and OB teams to determine their sleeping locations through a game of Bok-bul-bok. The OB team had won the game through a relay of Jegichagi (제기차기), but the YB team had insisted the production team to give them another chance. The same game was played, but each member represented and played for themselves. With the YB team already sleeping outside, the members who took the challenge competed to sleep indoors. However if they lose the game, they were to sleep "out-outdoors" (sleeping in a sleeping bag without a tent). Lee Seung-gi, MC Mong and Kim Jong-min attempted the challenge but failed and were chosen to sleep "out-outdoors". Kang Ho-dong decided to challenge the game to save the YB team, but failed twice and was selected to sleep "out-outdoors" as well. Kim C decided to take the challenge, but also failed and was chosen to sleep "outdoors" (with a tent). Eun Ji-won and Lee Soo-geun did not attempt the challenge and slept "outdoors" and "indoors", respectively.

===Wake-up song===

A wake-up song is usually selected to be played in the morning to wake the members up and start their morning mission. The trot song, "Please Endure" or "Baemida" ("It's a Snake") which is sung by Kim Hye-yeon was 1 Night 2 Days first wake-up song. "Please Endure" is a song about snakes, which drew attention with its repetitive lyrics and melody. Later on, a remix version of the song was aired on February 10, 2008 as the wake-up song. On the February 24, 2008 episode, a song titled "Wake-Up" was used. Since March 23, 2008, the show's wake-up song is a combination of the members' songs mixing various voices into the melody. For example, MC Mong's hit single, "Circus", could be heard, or the classic favorite "Words I Couldn't Say" ("하지못한말") by Lee Seung-gi was mixed with Kang Ho-dong's "Seung-Gi yah" shout. Also, the voices of the cast and crew are included in all of the wake up song, but mostly Kang Ho-dong. Kim Hye-yeon made an appearance on the show on August 31, 2008 singing "Please Endure" live to wake the cast up, which surprised the cast.

====Wake-up mission====

A wake-up mission is usually conducted every morning of their trip to determine the three members who will get to eat breakfast. Members are usually woken up by the snake song, songs of the members, or remixes of songs with the members voices shouting their names. Their wake-up mission for the episode aired November 16, 2009 (the "3rd Severe Winter Camp Training" trip) was canceled due to a blizzard.

===Severe summer and winter camp training===

During each season, a "severe" summer and winter camp training trip is held where members had to endure critical conditions—such as building their own tents and making their own food (without utensils), driving in an open-top convertible in the winter or driving with all the windows rolled-up and no air conditioner in a van in the summer. The Severe Winter Camp Training has been held 3 times and the Severe Summer Camp Training has been held twice.

===Freestyle trips===

The show will have "freestyle" trips where a captain is selected to be in charge and decide on the location of the trip. The captain who is chosen for freestyle trips usually feels burdensome as it was their responsibility to make the trip fun and have enough filming footage. The first freestyle trip captain was Eun Ji-won. The trip was filmed after Lee Soo-geun's wedding. Eun Ji-won decided to have their at the Nanji Camping location, situated near the Han River in Seoul. Even though, the ride should have taken only 5 minutes to get there, it took them over an hour to reach the Nanji Camping Centre. The second freestyle trip was conducted by MC Mong, who later passed the responsibility to Lee Seung-gi because it was too burdensome. Lee Soo-geun was selected to be the captain for the third freestyle trip when their flights to Jeju do were canceled due to bad weather.

During the early days of 1 Night 2 Days, the show was heavily compared with  SBS's Good Sunday's Family Outing 2 and MBC's Infinite Challenge, particularly because Noh Hong-chul was part of both 1 Night 2 Days and Infinite Challenge (which aired on Sundays and Saturdays, respectively).[tpl]ko icon[/tpl] 뚜껑뉴스 예능, 모방과 트렌드 사이에서 Y-Star.
