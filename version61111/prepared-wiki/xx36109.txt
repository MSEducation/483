==Controversy==

Some sources of controversy stem from the notion of attempting to artificially beautify the natural form of the body, often leading to charges of disfigurement and mutilation. Extreme forms of body modification are frequently viewed as symptomatic of body dysmorphic disorder, other mental illnesses, or as an expression of unchecked vanity.Freak: Encyclopedia II - Freak - Made freaks Unlicensed surgery performed outside of a medical environment can often be life-threatening, and is illegal in most countries and states.
"Disfigurement" and "mutilation" (regardless of any appreciation this always applies objectively whenever a bodily function is gravely diminished or lost) are terms used by opponents of body modification to describe certain types of modifications, especially non-consensual ones. Those terms are used fairly uncontroversially to describe the victims of torture, who have endured damage to ears, eyes, feet, genitalia, hands, noses, teeth, and/or tongues, including amputation, burning, flagellation, piercing, skinning, and wheeling[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]. "Genital mutilation" is also used somewhat more controversially to describe certain kinds of socially proscribed modifications to the genitals, such as male circumcision, female circumcision, castration,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] and surgeries performed to conform the genitals of individuals with intersex conditions to those of typical males or females.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilchins|first=Riki|title=A Girl's Right to Choose: Intersex Children and Parents Challenge Narrow Standards of Gender|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/summer-2002/intersex.html|work=NOW Times|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=12 September 2012[/tpl]
