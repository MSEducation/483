==Taxonomy==

Leptospira, together with the genera Leptonema and Turneria, is a member of the family Leptospiraceae.  The genus Leptospira is divided into 20 species based on DNA hybridization studies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brenner DJ, Kaufmann AF, Sulzer KR, Steigerwalt AG, Rogers FC, Weyant RS |title=Further determination of DNA relatedness between serogroups and serovars in the family Leptospiraceae with a proposal for Leptospira alexanderi sp. nov. and four new Leptospira genomospecies |journal=Int.

'Pathogenic Leptospira''
'''
Intermediates or opportunistic ''Leptospira''
Non-pathogenic ''Leptospira''
Members of Leptospira are also grouped into serovars according to their antigenic relatedness.  There are currently over 200 recognized serovars.  A few serovars are found in more than one species of Leptospira.
At its 2002 meeting, the Committee on the Taxonomy of Leptospira of the International Union of Microbiological Societies approved the following nomenclature for serovars of Leptospira. Genus and species must of course be italicized, with the serovar name not italicized and with an upper case first letter.
For example:

==Phylogeny==

==Morphology==

Although over 200 serotypes of Leptospira have been described, all members of the genus have similar morphology.  Leptospira are spiral-shaped bacteria that are 6-20 μm long and 0.1 μm in diameter with a wavelength of about 0.5 μm.[tpl]cite journal |author=Levett PN |title=Leptospirosis |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=296–326 |year=2001 |pmid=11292640 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.2.296-326.2001 |pmc=88975[/tpl]  One or both ends of the spirochete are usually hooked.  Because they are so thin, live Leptospira are best observed by darkfield microscopy.
The bacteria have a number of degrees of freedom; when ready to proliferate via binary fission, the bacterium noticeably bends in the place of the future split.

==Cellular structure==

Leptospira have a Gram-negative-like cell envelope consisting of a cytoplasmic and outer membrane.  However, the peptidoglycan layer is associated with the cytoplasmic rather than the outer membrane, an arrangement that is unique to spirochetes.  The two flagella of Leptospira extend from the cytoplasmic membrane at the ends of the bacteria into the periplasmic space and are necessary for the motility of Leptospira.[tpl]cite journal |author=Picardeau M, Brenot A, Saint Girons I |title=First evidence for gene replacement in Leptospira spp. Inactivation of L. biflexa flaB results in non-motile mutants deficient in endoflagella |journal=Mol.

The outer membrane contains a variety of lipoproteins and transmembrane outer membrane proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cullen PA, Cordwell SJ, Bulach DM, Haake DA, Adler B |title=Global Analysis of Outer Membrane Proteins from Leptospira interrogans Serovar Lai |journal=Infect.

The outer membrane of Leptospira, like those of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  Differences in the highly immunogenic LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of Leptospira.  Consequently, immunity is serovar specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of Leptospira endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation.  Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity.  An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4.[tpl]cite journal |author=Werts C, Tapping RI, Mathison JC, Chuang TH, Kravchenko V, Saint Girons I, Haake DA, Godowski PJ, Hayashi F, Ozinsky A, Underhill DM, Kirschning CJ, Wagner H, Aderem A, Tobias PS, Ulevitch RJ |title=Leptospiral lipopolysaccharide activates cells through a TLR2-dependent mechanism |journal=Nat.

==Habitat==

Leptospira, both pathogenic and saprophytic, can occupy diverse environments, habitats and life cycles; these bacteria are found throughout the world, except in Antarctica.  High humidity and neutral (6.9-7.4) pH are essential for their survival in the environment, with stagnant water reservoirs - bogs, shallow lakes, ponds, puddles, etc. - being the natural habitat for the bacteria.

==Nutrition==

Leptospira are typically cultivated at 30 °C in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium, which can be supplemented with 0.21% rabbit serum to enhance growth of fastidious strains.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson RC, Harris VG |title=Differentiation of Pathogenic and Saprophytic Leptospires I. Growth at Low Temperatures |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=27–31 |year=1967 |pmid=6027998 |doi= |pmc=251866[/tpl]  Growth of pathogenic Leptospira in an artificial nutrient environment such as EMJH becomes noticeable in 4–7 days; growth of saprophytic strains occur within 2–3 days. The minimal growth temperature of pathogenic species is 13-15 °C.  Because the minimal growth temperature of the saprophytes is 5-10 °C, the ability of Leptospira to grow at 13 °C can be used to distinguish saprophytic from pathogenic Leptospira species.  The optimal pH for growth of Leptospira is 7.2-7.6.
Leptospira are aerobes whose major carbon and energy source during in vitro growth is long-chain fatty acids, which are metabolized by beta-oxidation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson RC, Gary ND |title=NUTRITION OF LEPTOSPIRA POMONA II. : Fatty Acid Requirements |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=85 |issue= 5|pages=976–82 |year=1963 |pmid=14044026 |doi= |pmc=278270[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Henneberry RC, Cox CD |title=Beta-oxidation of fatty acids by Leptospira |journal=Can. J. Microbiol. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |year=1970 |pmid=5415967 |doi=10.1139/m70-007[/tpl]  Fatty acids are provided in EMJH in the form of Tween.  Fatty acid molecules are bound by albumin in EMJH and are released slowly into the medium to prevent its toxic accumulation.
Like most bacteria, Leptospira require iron for growth.[tpl]cite journal |author=Faine S |title=Iron as a growth requirement for pathogenic Leptospira |journal=J. Gen. Microbiol. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=246–51 |year=1959 |pmid=13654718 |doi=[/tpl]  L. interrogans and L. biflexa have the ability to acquire iron in different forms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Louvel H, Bommezzadri S, Zidane N, Boursaux-Eude C, Creno S, Magnier A, Rouy Z, Médigue C, Saint Girons I, Bouchier C, Picardeau M |title=Comparative and Functional Genomic Analyses of Iron Transport and Regulation in Leptospira spp |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=188 |issue=22 |pages=7893–904 |year=2006 |pmid=16980464 |doi=10.1128/JB.00711-06 |pmc=1636298[/tpl]  A TonB-dependent receptor required for utilization of the ferrous form of the iron has been identified in L. biflexa, and an ortholog of the receptor is encoded in the genome of L. interrogans.  L. interrogans can also obtain iron from heme, which is bound to most of the iron in the human body.  The HbpA hemin-binding protein, which may be involved in the uptake of hemin, has been identified on the surface of L. interrogans[tpl]cite journal |author=Asuthkar S, Velineni S, Stadlmann J, Altmann F, Sritharan M |title=Expression and Characterization of an Iron-Regulated Hemin-Binding Protein, HbpA, from Leptospira interrogans Serovar Lai |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=75 |issue=9 |pages=4582–91 |year=2007 |pmid=17576761 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00324-07 |pmc=1951163[/tpl]  Although other pathogenic species of Leptospira and L. biflexa lack HbpA, yet another hemin-binding protein, LipL41, may account for their ability to use hemin as a source of iron.  Although they do not secrete siderophores, L. biflexa and L. interrogans may be capable of obtaining iron from siderophores secreted by other microorganisms.

==Genome==

The genome of pathogenic Leptospira consists of two chromosomes.  The size of the genomes of L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Lai is approximately 4.6 Mb.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ren SX, Fu G, Jiang XG, Zeng R, Miao YG, Xu H, Zhang YX, Xiong H, Lu G, Lu LF, Jiang HQ, Jia J, Tu YF, Jiang JX, Gu WY, Zhang YQ, Cai Z, Sheng HH, Yin HF, Zhang Y, Zhu GF, Wan M, Huang HL, Qian Z, Wang SY, Ma W, Yao ZJ, Shen Y, Qiang BQ, Xia QC, Guo XK, Danchin A, Saint Girons I, Somerville RL, Wen YM, Shi MH, Chen Z, Xu JG, Zhao GP |title=Unique physiological and pathogenic features of Leptospira interrogans revealed by whole-genome sequencing |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6934 |pages=888–93 |year=2003 |pmid=12712204 |doi=10.1038/nature01597[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Nascimento AL, Ko AI, Martins EA, Monteiro-Vitorello CB, Ho PL, Haake DA, Verjovski-Almeida S, Hartskeerl RA, Marques MV, Oliveira MC, Menck CF, Leite LC, Carrer H, Coutinho LL, Degrave WM, Dellagostin OA, El-Dorry H, Ferro ES, Ferro MI, Furlan LR, Gamberini M, Giglioti EA, Góes-Neto A, Goldman GH, Goldman MH, Harakava R, Jerônimo SM, Junqueira-de-Azevedo IL, Kimura ET, Kuramae EE, Lemos EG, Lemos MV, Marino CL, Nunes LR, de Oliveira RC, Pereira GG, Reis MS, Schriefer A, Siqueira WJ, Sommer P, Tsai SM, Simpson AJ, Ferro JA, Camargo LE, Kitajima JP, Setubal JC, Van Sluys MA |title=Comparative Genomics of Two Leptospira interrogans Serovars Reveals Novel Insights into Physiology and Pathogenesis |journal=J.

The guanine plus cytosine (GC) content is between 35% and 41%.Albert I Ko,  Cyrille Goarant,  Mathieu Picardeau. (2009, October) Leptospira: the dawn of the molecular genetics era for an emerging zoonotic pathogen.  Nature Reviews. Microbiology.  Vol. 7,  Iss. 10,  p. 736-47 (12 pp.) L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo is usually transmitted by direct exposure to infected tissues, whereas L. interrogans is often acquired from water or soil contaminated by the urine of carrier animals harboring Leptospira in their kidneys.  The high number of defective genes and insertion sequences in L. borgpetersenii Hardjo together with the poor survival outside of the host and difference in transmission patterns compared to L. interrogans suggest that L. borgpetersenii is undergoing insertion-sequence mediated genomic decay, with ongoing loss of genes necessary for survival outside of the host animal.

==Genotyping==

Genome sequence determination several strains of Leptospira lead to the development of multilocus VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for species level identification of pathogenic Leptospira species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cerqueira GM, Picardeau M |title=A century of Leptospira strain typing |journal=Infect. Genet. Evol. |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=760–8 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19540362 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2009.06.009 |url=[/tpl] Both methods hold the potential to replace the highly ambiguous serotyping method currently in vogue for leptospiral strain identification.
