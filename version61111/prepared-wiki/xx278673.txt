The Norvall Hunter Farm is a historic farmstead on the edge of the village of Mechanicsburg, Ohio, United States.  Established in the middle of the nineteenth century, the farm was once home to one of the village's first professionals, and it has been named a historic site because of its distinctive architecture.

==Buildings==

The Hunter Farm comprises eleven historic buildings, centered around the high-style farmhouse.  Built in 1850, the farmhouse is a two-story structure built of brick; architectural elements such as its pilasters and recessed entryway are constructed with evidence of influence from both the Greek Revival and Italianate styles.  Three barns, three sheds, two other farm-related buildings, an additional storage building, and a garage form the rest of the farm complex; these ten outbuildings and a privy are placed in two clusters.

==Preservation==

In 1985, the Norvall Hunter Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its distinctive historic architecture and because of its place as the home of a leading local citizen.  It is one of twenty Mechanicsburg locations on the Register; all were listed at the same time as part of a multiple property submission because the village's high propertion of non-historic buildings frustrated locals' initial hopes of designating a larger historic district.Recchie, Nancy.
