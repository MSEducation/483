The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty. It is located in the center of Beijing, China, and now houses the Palace Museum. For almost 500 years, it served as the home of emperors and their households, as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government.
Built in 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers [tpl]convert|72|ha|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|title=故宫到底有多少间房 (How many rooms in the Forbidden City)|url=http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html|publisher=Singtao Net|date=2006-09-27|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese[/tpl]  The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture,[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04[/tpl] and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.
Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Part of the museum's former collection is now located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Both museums descend from the same institution, but were split after the Chinese Civil War.

==Name==

The common English name, "the Forbidden City", is a translation of the Chinese name Zijin Cheng ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|紫|禁|城[/tpl]|p=Zǐjinchéng|l=Purple Forbidden City[/tpl]). Another English name of similar origin is "Forbidden Palace".See, e.g., [tpl]cite journal|title=Perspective of urban land use in Beijing|journal=GeoJournal|date=April 1990|first=Guo-hui|last=Gan|volume=20|issue=4|pages=359–364|doi=10.1007/bf00174975[/tpl]
The name "Zijin Cheng" is a name with significance on many levels. Zi, or "Purple", refers to the North Star, which in ancient China was called the Ziwei Star, and in traditional Chinese astrology was the heavenly abode of the Celestial Emperor. The surrounding celestial region, the Ziwei Enclosure ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|紫|微|垣[/tpl]|p=Zǐwēiyuán[/tpl]), was the realm of the Celestial Emperor and his family. The Forbidden City, as the residence of the terrestrial emperor, was its earthly counterpart. Jin, or "Forbidden", referred to the fact that no one could enter or leave the palace without the emperor's permission. Cheng means a city.
Today, the site is most commonly known in Chinese as Gùgōng ([tpl]linktext|故|宫[/tpl]), which means the "Former Palace"."Gùgōng" in a generic sense also refers to all former palaces, another prominent example being the former Imperial Palaces (Mukden Palace) in Shenyang; see Gugong (disambiguation). The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the "Palace Museum" ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|故|宫|博|物|院[/tpl]|p=Gùgōng Bówùyùan[/tpl]).

==History==

The site of the Forbidden City was situated in the Imperial City during the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Upon the establishment of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor moved the capital from Beijing in the north to Nanjing in the south, and ordered that the Yuan palaces be burnt down. When his son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital back to Beijing, and construction began in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City.p. 18, [tpl]cite book|last=Yu|first=Zhuoyun|title=Palaces of the Forbidden City|year=1984|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0-670-53721-7[/tpl]
