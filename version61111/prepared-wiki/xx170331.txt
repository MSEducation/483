Yolngu Boy is an Australian film which was released in 2001.
The film is about three Aboriginal Australians, Botj (Sean Mununggurr), Lorrpu (John Sebastian) and Milika (Nathan Daniels), that trek through Australia's Top End after Botj, recently released from prison, commits arson and vandalism while high from sniffing petrol. The three flee from the police who threaten to send Botj back to jail, and head to Darwin by coast. However, soon after their arrival, they are discovered by the police, sleeping in a hotel room. Botj leaves before the other two wake, and has been breathing petrol fumes for their hallucinogenic effects, which leads him to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. His body is discovered by Lorrpu and Milika later that day.  Lorrpu and Milika return to their original home and their old lives. For Lorrpu, the journey has been a rite of passage, and his aboriginal tribe, the Yolngu have accepted him. The film has many social issues like the problems of youth sniffing petrol.
