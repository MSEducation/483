[[Geography of India]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of India

The geography of India describes the geographic features of India, a country in South Asia. India lies largely on the Indian Plate, the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, whose continental crust forms the Indian subcontinent. The country is situated north of the equator between 8°4' and 37°6' north latitude and 68°7' and 97°25' east longitude.[tpl]cite book |title=India Yearbook 2007 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Govt.

On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean – in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the southwest, the Laccadive Sea to the south, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate India from Sri Lanka to its immediate southeast, and the Maldives are some [tpl]convert|400|km[/tpl] to the southwest. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some [tpl]convert|1200|km[/tpl] southeast of the mainland, share maritime borders with Burma, Thailand and Indonesia.  Kanyakumari at 8°4′41″N and 77°32′28″E is the southernmost tip of the Indian mainland, while the southernmost point in India is Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island.  India's territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of [tpl]convert|12|nmi|mi km|1|lk=in[/tpl] from the coast baseline.[tpl]cite web| title = Territorial extent of India's waters | publisher = The International Law of the Sea and Indian Maritime Legislation |date=30 April 2005| url=http://www.irfc-nausena.nic.in/irfc/ezine/Trans2Trimph/chapters/27_law%20of%20the%20sea1.htm | accessdate = 16 May 2006[/tpl]
The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the Himalayan mountain range, where the country borders China, Bhutan, and Nepal. Its western border with Pakistan lies in the Punjab Plain and the Thar Desert. In the far northeast, the Chin Hills and Kachin Hills, deeply forested mountainous regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, its border with Bangladesh is largely defined by the Khasi Hills and Mizo Hills, and the watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[tpl]clarify|date=May 2011|reason=not clear how the "watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain" defines the India-Bangladesh border; most rivers of the region flow right across the border, no?[/tpl]
The Ganges is the longest river originating in India. The Ganges–Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Kangchenjunga, on the border between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in India at [tpl]convert|8598|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the world's 3rd highest peak. Climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine in the upper reaches of the Himalayas.

==Geological development==

India is entirely contained on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formed when it split off from the ancient continent Gondwanaland (ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent of Pangea). The Indo-Australian is subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates. About 90 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period, the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15 cm/year (6 in/yr).[tpl]cite book|title=Age of Initiation of the India-Asia Collision in the East-Central Himalaya|url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rowley/Rowley/Collision_Age_files/J%20Geol%202005%20Zhu.pdf|author=Bin Zhu et al.|publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University at Albany|pages=281|format=PDF|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] About 50 to 55 million years ago, in the Eocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era, the plate collided with Asia after covering a distance of [tpl]convert|2000|to|3000|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], having moved faster than any other known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Fastest Continent: India's truncated lithospheric roots|author=Dr. Rainer Kind|publisher=Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|date=September 2007[/tpl] The collision with the Eurasian Plate along the modern border between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas. [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5 cm/yr (2 in/yr), while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2 cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the "fastest continent". This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4 mm/yr (0.15 in/yr).

==Political geography==

India is divided into twenty eight states (further subdivided into districts) and seven union territories.
India's borders run a total length of [tpl]convert|15106.70|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh were delineated according to the Radcliffe Line, which was created in 1947 during Partition of India. Its western border with Pakistan extends up to [tpl]convert|3323|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], dividing the Punjab region and running along the boundaries of the Thar Desert and the Rann of Kutch. This border runs along the Indian states of Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Punjab.http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BM_MAN-IN-PAKS-060513.pdf Both nations delineated a Line of Control (LoC) to serve as the informal boundary between the Indian and Pakistan-administered areas of Kashmir. According to India's claim, it also shares a [tpl]convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] border with Afghanistan in northwestern Kashmir, which is under Pakistani control.
India's border with Bangladesh runs [tpl]convert|4096.70|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram are the States which share the border with Bangladesh.http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BM_MAN-IN-BANG-270813.pdf There are 92 enclaves of Bangladesh on Indian soil and 106 enclaves of India are on Bangladeshi soil.[tpl]cite journal| title = The Nowhere People|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1912/19120600.htm | journal = Frontline Magazine, The Hindu | author = Naunidhi Kaur | volume = 19 |issue=12 |date=June 2002 | accessdate = 19 November 2008[/tpl] The Teen Bigha Corridor is a strip of land formerly belonging to India on the West Bengal–Bangladesh border which has been leased indefinitely to Bangladesh so that it can access its Dehgram–Angalpota enclaves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Physiographic regions==

India can be divided into five physiographic regions. They are

===The Northern Mountains===

A great arc of mountains, consisting of the Himalayas, Hindu Kush, and Patkai ranges define the northern Indian subcontinent. These were formed by the ongoing tectonic collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The mountains in these ranges include some of the world's tallest mountains which act as a natural barrier to cold polar winds. They also facilitate the monsoon winds which in turn influence the climate in India. Rivers originating in these mountains, flow through the fertile Indo–Gangetic plains. These mountains are recognised by biogeographers as the boundary between two of the Earth's great ecozones: the temperate Palearctic that covers most of Eurasia and the tropical and subtropical Indomalaya ecozone which includes the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.
India has eight major mountain ranges having peaks of over [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft||abbr=on[/tpl]

===Indo-Gangetic plain===

The Indo-Gangetic plains, also known as the Great Plains are large alluvial plains dominated by three main rivers, the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra. They run parallel to the Himalayas, from Jammu and Kashmir in the west to Assam in the east, and drain most of northern and eastern India. The plains encompass an area of [tpl]convert|700000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The major rivers in this region are the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra along with their main tributaries–Yamuna, Chambal, Gomti, Ghaghara, Kosi, Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Chenab, and Tista—as well as the rivers of the Ganges Delta, such as the Meghna.
The great plains are sometimes classified into four divisions:
The Indo-Gangetic belt is the world's most extensive expanse of uninterrupted alluvium formed by the deposition of silt by the numerous rivers. The plains are flat making it conducive for irrigation through canals. The area is also rich in ground water sources.
The plains are one of the world's most intensely farmed areas. The main crops grown are rice and wheat, which are grown in rotation. Other important crops grown in the region include maize, sugarcane and cotton. The Indo-Gangetic plains rank among the world's most densely populated areas.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Thar Desert===

The Thar Desert (also known as the deserts) is the world's seventh largest desert,[tpl]WWF correction|name=Thar desert|id=im1304|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] by others the tenth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=The World's Largest Desert|publisher=geology.com|accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] It forms a significant portion of western India and covers an area of [tpl]convert|200000|to|238700|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590028/Thar-Desert|title=Thar Desert|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] The desert continues into Pakistan as the Cholistan Desert. Most of the Thar Desert is situated in Rajasthan, covering 61% of its geographic area.
About 10 percent of this region comprises sand dunes, and the remaining 90 percent consist of craggy rock forms, compacted salt-lake bottoms, and interdunal and fixed dune areas. Annual temperatures can range from [tpl]convert|0|C[/tpl] in the winter to over [tpl]convert|50|C[/tpl] during the summer. Most of the rainfall received in this region is associated with the short July–September southwest monsoon that brings [tpl]convert|100|to|500|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation. Water is scarce and occurs at great depths, ranging from [tpl]convert|30|to|120|m[/tpl] below the ground level.[tpl]cite book|title=Afforestation in Arid zones|author=Kaul, R.N.|publisher=N.V. Publishers, The Hague|year=1970[/tpl] Rainfall is precarious and erratic, ranging from below [tpl]convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in the extreme west to [tpl]convert|375|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] eastward.The only river in this region is Luni. The soils of the arid region are generally sandy to sandy-loam in texture. The consistency and depth vary as per the topographical features. The low-lying loams are heavier and may have a hard pan of clay, calcium carbonate or gypsum.

===Highlands===

The Central Highlands consists of three main plateaus — the Malwa Plateau in the west, the Deccan Plateau in the south (covering most of the Indian peninsula) and the Chota Nagpur Plateau in the east.
The Malwa Plateau is spread across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The average elevation of the Malwa plateau is 500 metres, and the landscape generally slopes towards the north. Most of the region is drained by the Chambal River and its tributaries; the western part is drained by the upper reaches of the Mahi River.
The Deccan Plateau is a large triangular plateau, bounded by the Vindhyas to the north and flanked by the Eastern and Western Ghats. The Deccan covers a total area of 1.9 million km² (735,000 mile²). It is mostly flat, with elevations ranging from [tpl]convert|300|to|600|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The average elevation of the plateau is [tpl]convert|2000|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. The surface slopes from [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m[/tpl] in the west to [tpl]convert|1500|ft|m[/tpl] in the east.[tpl]cite web|title=The Deccan Plateau|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/asia/the-deccan-plateau.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=14 November 2008[/tpl] It slopes gently from west to east and gives rise to several peninsular rivers such as the Godavari, the Krishna, the Kaveri and the Mahanadi which drain into the Bay of Bengal. This region is mostly semi-arid as it lies on the leeward side of both Ghats. Much of the Deccan is covered by thorn scrub forest scattered with small regions of deciduous broadleaf forest. Climate in the Deccan ranges from hot summers to mild winters.
The Chota Nagpur Plateau is situated in eastern India, covering much of Jharkhand and adjacent parts of Orissa, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Its total area is approximately [tpl]convert|65000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and is made up of three smaller plateaus — the Ranchi, Hazaribagh, and Kodarma plateaus. The Ranchi plateau is the largest, with an average elevation of [tpl]convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Much of the plateau is forested, covered by the Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests. Vast reserves of metal ores and coal have been found in the Chota Nagpur plateau. The Kathiawar peninsula in western Gujarat is bounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Gulf of Khambat. The natural vegetation in most of the peninsula is xeric scrub, part of the Northwestern thorn scrub forests ecoregion.
In western India, the Kutch region in Gujarat and Koyna in Maharashtra are classified as a Zone IV region (high risk) for earthquakes. The Kutch city of Bhuj was the epicentre of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which claimed the lives of more than 1,337 people and injured 166,836 while destroying or damaging near a million homes.[ref]
