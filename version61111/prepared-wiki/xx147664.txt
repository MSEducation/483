Jeff is currently Chair of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure Renewal & Public Works and represents the City on several other committees.
Before engaging in professional politics Browaty worked at the family owned and operated Dennis T. Browaty & Associates a commercial real estate appraisal and consulting company.  He had previously completed a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Manitoba's I.H. Asper School of Business. 
Browaty began his professional political career as a staffer to Manitoba PC Leader Stuart Murray and then to local Member of Parliament Joy Smith. On October 25, 2006, Jeff Browaty, defeated incumbent Mark Lubosch.  Browaty received 6,820 votes (52%) to Mark Lubosch's 4,563 (35%). Candidate James Viehweg placed third with 1,712 votes (13%). Public outcry over speedbumps and the McIvor street closure that limited access to Lagimodi√®re Boulevard as well as the sluggish progress towards the extension of the Chief Peguis Trail (to Lagimodiere Boulevard) were the issues that Browaty appeared to capitalize on. The race was interesting as none of the candidates were endorsed by political parties, unions, the Mayor or other interest groups and it was the only ward which featured a true battle amongst independents.
At 29, Browaty was youngest councillor elected in 2006. He has become known for using technology as a means of staying in touch with voters by, amongst other things, building one of the largest Facebook group of any politician in Manitoba.
