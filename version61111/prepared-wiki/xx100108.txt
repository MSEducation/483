==Geography==

Connected to the two principal centers (Madalena on the west coast and Lajes on the south coast) by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway, the parish is wedged between the parishes of São Caetano and Candelária. The pie-shaped parish extends from the southern coast to the interior, sloping from rugged cliffs to the mountainous summit of Ponta do Pico.  While farmlands and settlements occupy most of the areas along the roadways, the dense forest occupies the majority of its territory. 
In addition to the parish center of São Mateus (location of the primary school, commercial businesses and civil government), located near the São Caetano border, the coastal village of Arieiro in the southwest corner and the interior hamlet of Ginjeira, are the predominant rural agglomerations.
