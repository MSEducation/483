At times amulets were given the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs. Such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents.cf. Thomas Eric Peet, William Leonard Stevenson Loat, The Cemeteries of Abydos. Part 3. 1912-1913, Adamant Media Corporation, ISBN 1-4021-5715-0, p.23 Cartouches were formerly only worn by Pharaohs.

==Etymology==

The term cartouche was  first applied by soldiers who fancied that the symbol they saw so frequently repeated on the pharaonic ruins they encountered resembled a muzzle-loading firearm's paper powder cartridge ([tpl]lang|fr|cartouche[/tpl] in French).White, Jon Manchip, Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt, Courier Dover 2002, p.175
