Lisa Lyttelton, Dowager Viscountess Cobham (born about 1958 as Lisa Clayton) is the first British woman to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world.[tpl]cite news|title=British sailor Lisa Clayton|work=Star-News|date=1995-06-30|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5q4sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FBUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4204,5559161|accessdate=2010-05-17[/tpl]  She was educated in Birmingham at the Church of England School for Girls, Edgbaston, and the University of Birmingham.
On September 17, 1994, Clayton set out to attempt two world records, namely "Fastest Sail Around the World by a Woman, Single-Handed Without Assistance" and "First British Woman to Sail Single-Handed and Non-Stop Around the World." She returned on 29 June 1995, after 285 days at sea.
On her thirty-eight foot yacht, called Spirit of Birmingham, Clayton survived the [tpl]convert|31000|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] journey despite capsizing seven times. Her vessel was named after her home city and the university which contributed over Â£40,000 and expertise to make it possible for Clayton to realise her dream.
On 1 August 1997 she married the 11th Viscount Cobham, owner of Hagley Hall in Worcestershire. He died in 2006.
