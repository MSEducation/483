Bilson gave the sermon at the coronation on 25 July 1603 of James VI of Scotland as James I of England. While the wording conceded something to the divine right of kings, it also included a caveat about lawful resistance to a monarch. This theme was from Bilson's 1585 book, and already sounded somewhat obsolescent.Peter E. McCullough, Sermons at Court: Politics and Religion in Elizabethan and Jacobean Preaching (1998), pp. 104.
At the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, he and Richard Bancroft implored King James to change nothing in the Church of England.W. B. Patterson, King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (1997), p. 104. He had in fact advised James in 1603 not to hold the Conference, and to leave religious matters to the professionals.Alan Stewart, The Cradle King: A Life of James VI & I (2003), p. 191. The advice might have prevailed, had it not been for Patrick Galloway, Moderator of the Scottish Assembly.Collinson, p. 451. Later, in charge of the Authorized Version, he composed the front matter with Miles Smith, his share being the dedication.Alister McGrath, In The Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible (2001), p. 188, p. 210.
He bought the manor of West Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, in 1605.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41935|title=Parishes - Buriton | A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3 (pp. 85-93)|publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-04-12[/tpl] Later, in 1613, he acquired the site of Durford Abbey, Rogate, Sussex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41688|title=Rogate | A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4 (pp. 21-27)|publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-04-12[/tpl]
He was ex officio Visitor of St John's College, Oxford, and so was called to intervene when in 1611 the election as President of William Laud was disputed, with a background tension of Calvinist versus Arminian. The other candidate was John Rawlinson. Bilson, taken to be on the Calvinist side, found that the election of the high-church Laud had failed to follow the college statutes.Trevor-Roper, p. 43. He in the end ruled in favour of Laud, but only after some intrigue: Bilson had difficulty in having his jurisdiction recognised by the group of Laud's activists, led unscrupulously by William Juxon. Laud's party had complained, to the King, who eventually decided the matter himself, leaving the status quo, and instructed Bilson.Thomas A. Mason, Serving God and Mammon: William Juxon, 1582–1663, Bishop of London, Lord High Treasurer of England, and Archbishop of Canterbury (1985), p. 27.Kenneth Fincham, Early Stuart Polity p. 188 in The History of the University of Oxford (1984).

===Final years===

He was appointed a judge in the 1613 annulment case of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex and his wife Frances née Howard; with John Buckridge, bishop of Rochester, he was one of two extra judges added by the King to the original 10, who were deadlocked. This caused bitterness on the part of George Abbot, the archbishop of Canterbury, who was presiding over the nullity commission. Abbot felt that neither man was impartial, and that Bilson bore him an old grudge.Anne Somerset, Unnatural Murder: Poison at the Court of James I, pp. 159-160. Bilson played a key role in the outcome, turning away the Earl of Essex's appeal to appear a second time before the commission, and sending away Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton who was asking on behalf of Essex with a half-truth about the position (which was that the King had intervened against Essex).Somerset, p. 164. The outcome of the case was a divorce, and Bilson was then in favour with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, a favourite in the court who proceeded to marry Frances. Bilson's son, the lawyer Sir Thomas Bilson (1579–1630), was nicknamed "Sir Nullity Bilson", because his knighthood followed on the outcome of the Essex annulment case.http://www.the-miscellany.co.uk/jacobean/person?id=226Somerset, p. 168.
In August 1615 Bilson was made a member of the Privy Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/diary/1eng.html|title=1eng|publisher=philological.bham.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-04-12[/tpl] In fact, though this was the high point of Bilson's career as courtier, and secured by Somerset's influence, he had been led to expect more earlier that summer. Somerset had been importunate to the point of pushiness on behalf of Bilson, hoping to secure him a higher office, and had left Bilson in a false position and James very annoyed. This misjudgement was a major step in Somerset's replacement in favour by George Villiers, said to have happened in physical terms under Bilson's roof at Farnham Castle that same August.Alan Stewart, The Cradle King: A Life of James VI & I (2003), p. 271.Somerset, p. 286. Bilson died in 1616 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy==

It was said of him, that he "carried prelature in his very aspect." Anthony Wood proclaimed him so "complete in divinity, so well skilled in languages, so read in the Fathers and Schoolmen, so judicious is making use of his readings, that at length he was found to be no longer a soldier, but a commander in chief in the spiritual warfare, especially when he became a bishop!" Bilson is also remembered for being hawkish against recusant Roman Catholics.Michael C. Questier, Conversion, Politics and Religion in England, 1580–1625 (1996), note p. 189. Henry Parker drew on both Bilson and Richard Hooker in his pamphlet writing around the time of English Civil War.Michael Mendle, Henry Parker and the English Civil War: The Political Thought of the Public's 'Privado'  (2003), p. 63.
Bilson had argued for resistance to a Roman Catholic prince. A century later, Richard Baxter drew on Bilson in proposing and justifying the deposition of James II.William M. Lamont, Richard Baxter and the Millennium (1979), p. 29. What Bilson had envisaged in 1585 was a "wild" scenario or counterfactual, a Roman Catholic monarch of England: its relevance to practical politics came much later.William Lamont, Puritanism and Historical Controversy (1996), pp. 56-8.

===Writings===

His writings took a nuanced and middle way in ecclesiastical polity, and avoided Erastian views and divine right, while requiring passive obedience to authority depending on the context.Whitney Richard David Jones, The Tree of Commonwealth, 1450–1793 (2000), p. 99.Irving Ribner, The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare (2004), p. 307. His efforts to avoid condemning Huguenot and Dutch Protestant resisters have been described as "contortions".Lisa Ferraro Parmelee, Good Newes from Fraunce: French Anti-league Propaganda in Late Elizabethan England (1996), p. 112. His works included:
