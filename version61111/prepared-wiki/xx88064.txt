He slowed down after the deputy chief minister R. R. Patil reined in the encounter specialists.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Daya-Nayaks-worth-Rs-89-lakh-only/articleshow/15763466.cms | title = Daya Nayak's worth Rs 89 lakh only | date = 2007-12-04 | newspaper = Mumbai Mirror [/tpl]

==School in Yennehole==

Daya Nayak built a school in his native village Yennehole. The money for building the school was collected through donations from Bollywood personalties in name of the Radha Nayak Educational Trust (named after Nayak's mother). The school was inaugurated by Amitabh Bachchan in 2000 in presence of celebrities like M. F. Husain, Suniel Shetty and Aftab Shivdasani.[tpl]cite web | url = http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/06sld1.htm | title = The school that Daya Nayak built | accessdate = 2014-02-06 | publisher = rediff.com [/tpl] It was later handed over to the Government of Karnataka, and is now known as the Radha Nayak Government High School.

==Allegations of corruption and criminal links==

In 2003, Ketan Tirodkar, a small-time journalist with underworld links, accused Daya Nayak of having links with the Mumbai underworld, and of amassing wealth disproportionate to his income through illegal means. Tirodkar alleged that he had become friends with Nayak in 2002, and ran an extortion business with him.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main51.asp?filename=Ne031211Coverstory.asp | title = Dead Man Talking  | journal = Tehelka | volume = 8 | issue = 48 | date = 2011-12-03 | author = Rana Ayyub [/tpl]
Nayak was investigated by the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court for links with the underworld. He came out clean in investigations conducted by ACP Shankar Kamble in 2003 and by DCP K L Bishnoy in 2004. He was given clean chit after another inquiry by ACP Dilip Sawant in 2004. The same year, Tirodkar was taken into custody on the charge of having links with the Dubai-based don Chota Shakeel.[tpl]cite web | url = http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=234136 | title = Crime Branch gives clean chit to Daya Nayak | date = 2004-07-09 | publisher = Outlook [/tpl]
In 2006, Nayak was arrested during an investigation led by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) ACP Bhim Rao Ghadge. The ACB officials raided his house on 21 January 2006. He was suspended a day later.[tpl]cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-01-23/india/27825416_1_daya-nayak-mumbai-police-anti-corruption-bureau | title = Daya Nayak suspended by Mumbai Police | date = 2006-01-23 | newspaper = The Times of India [/tpl] The school built by him was also raided without the knowledge of approval of the Karnataka state government. On February 18, 2006, a sessions court issued a non-bailable warrant against him in the disproportionate assets case after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the sessions court, the Bombay High Court and after the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere in the case and directed him to surrender. Two days later, he surrendered as directed and was sent to judicial custody. Nayak spent 14 days in police custody and 45 days in judicial custody, and was released on bail after no chargesheet could be filed against him due to lack of evidence.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=585 | title = Daya Nayak Breaks his Silence... | author = Walter Nandalike | date = 2007-05-06 | publisher = Dajiworld [/tpl]
The 2003 complaint against him stated that he had amassed wealth worth crores of rupees. ACB found his assets to be worth much less - Rs. 89.17 lakh, but still filed a chargesheet against him, stating that these assets were disproportionate to Nayak's monthly salary of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 10,000 as a sub-inspector. Nayak was accused of floating bogus companies with help of his associate Rajendra Phadte, and getting his wife Komal to take property loans from these companies in order to launder his money. The ACB also stated that he had dealt properties in name of his brother-in-law P. Manivelan and Phadte.
The ACB summoned Manivelan 27 times, but could not find any evidence against him. ACB arrested him at the insistence of the IPS officer Pradnya Saravade, on the charge of laundering Daya Nayak's money. Manivelan was jailed for 62 days, during which both is parents died. He appealed to the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC). The Commission Chairman Justice Kshitij Vyas criticized the arrest and passed strictures against Pradnya Saravade for her high handedness. MSHRC imposed a fine of [tpl]INR|25000[/tpl] on the state government, asking it to be recovered from Saravade.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=50507 | date = 2008-09-01 | title = Mumbai: Human Rights Commission Slams Govt - Daya Nayak Smells Victory | publisher = Dajiworld [/tpl]
Nayak insisted that all his money was accounted for, and every transaction was made by cheque. He also pointed out that his assets had been shown as inflated. For example, his Tata Sumo was a government vehicle and the 2 lakh rupee expense reimbursed by the government for a post-encounter hospital stay had been counted as an asset. Ghadge claimed that Nayak had assets in Switzerland and owned hotels in Dubai. Nayak denied this, saying that he had never travelled outside India. The ACB alleged that Nayak had transferred [tpl]INR[/tpl] 100 crore to a foreign contact from a cyber cafe in Goa. It claimed that he was in Goa on 18 January 2006, but his duty records proved that he was at the Charkop Police station. ACB also brought up the point that a person called D Naik had traveled several times between Mumbai and Goa by air. It was later found out that the person was the Goa minister Damodar Naik.
According to Nayak's supporters, he was framed by some of his colleagues who had close ties with the underworld criminals, whom Nayak had fought with. Nayak himself termed Ghadge as the "most corrupt officer", and alleged that Ghadge had filed an FIR against him after he refused his demand for a bribe of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 1 crore.
In 2008, after the Soharbuddin Sheikh fake encounter case came to light, Tirodkar filed one more affidavit stating that Daya Nayak was involved in the death of Sadiq Jamal, another alleged fake encounter by the Gujarat Police. According to Tirodkar, the Gujarat police had asked Daya Nayak and him to supply "a Muslim boy with some criminal background" to the Gujarat Police, and in response, Nayak handed over Sadiq Jamal to them.
In 2010, the Court quashed all the MCOCA charges against him.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/encounter-specialist-daya-nayak-reinstated/article3537186.ece | title = â€˜Encounter specialist' Daya Nayak reinstated | date = 2012-06-16 | newspaper = The Hindu [/tpl]
