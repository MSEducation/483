==Influences==

Blood Brothers is Alexi Tan's first feature film, though Tan has referred to it as "a combination of all my collaborators' work" including costume designer Tim Yip, cinematographer Michel Taburiaux, and of course producer John Woo.Podvin, Thomas (August 2007). "Five Questions For Alexi Tan, director of John Woo-produced gangster drama Blood Brothers", that's Beijing, p. 54. 
Tan has stated that he draws upon his upbringing as an overseas Chinese, such that his vision of China and Chinese society will at once be Chinese and at the same time "different.". Tan notes that his film is an attempt to combine Eastern and Western influences, in that it is his attempt to transport the style of classic westerns, in particular those of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, into the setting of 1930s Shanghai.[tpl]cite web | title = The Birth of a Vision | publisher = Official site | url = http://www.bloodbrothersthemovie.com | date= | accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl]

==Production history==

The idea for Blood Brothers first began to gain traction when producers John Woo and Terence Chang watched Tan's Double Blade, a music video starring Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou, and contacted Tan expressing interest in producing a feature-length film with the young director.[tpl]cite web | title = Alexi Tan, Making the Cut | publisher = Theme Magazine | url = http://www.thememagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=131&Itemid=109| author=Maglioro, Joe |date= Spring 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl] Up to this point, Tan had worked primarily as a fashion photographer. 
Once Woo and Chang were on board, however, Tan was able to seriously develop his concept for the film. Given Tan's overseas upbringing and lack of Mandarin speaking and writing ability (he was born in Manila and studied in London), the screenplay was originally written in English. As such, Tan collaborated with native Chinese writer, Jiang Dan to translate his film into natural sounding Chinese.[tpl]cite web | title = Screenplay | publisher = Official site | url = http://www.bloodbrothersthemovie.com | date= | accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl] Despite Tan's initial concerns that Jiang Dan would not understand the Leone or Peckinpah influences, he later felt that her contributions to the story helped flesh out the film's romantic elements and in particular expanded upon the feminine perspectives of Shu Qi's and Lulu Li's characters.
Shooting of the film took place entirely within China: primarily in Shanghai, and the outlying town of Zhujiajiao. The main set of the "Paradise Club" (the titular club in the Chinese title), was built in the Shanghai Film and TV Studio under the direction of Production Designer Alfred Yau.[tpl]cite web | title = The Look of the Film: Design, Photography, and Lighting | publisher = Official site | url = http://www.bloodbrothersthemovie.com | date= | accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl] 
Fight choreography, in particular the film's many gun battles, was done by Hong Kong veteran action director Philip Kwok, who was also involved in the action choreography for John Woo's 1992 Hong Kong film Hard Boiled.
