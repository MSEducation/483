==Personal life==

Clayborn was born in St. Louis, Missouri.  At birth, he suffered from a condition known as Erb's Palsy, something that is caused during birth by an injury to the nerves surrounding a child's shoulder.  Because his head and neck were pulled to the side as his shoulders passed through the birth canal, he suffered nerve damage resulting in the loss of some movement and weakness in his right arm.[tpl]cite news |title=Late bloomer Clayborn becoming dominant leader |url=http://thegazette.com/2009/11/06/late-bloomer-clayton-becoming-dominant-leader/ |publisher=The Gazette|date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=10 October 2010[/tpl]  Clayborn underwent physical therapy throughout his young life and eventually overcame the limitations caused by the disorder.
When Adrian was 10, his older brother, Anthony, was shot and killed in northern St. Louis.[tpl]cite news |title=Spotlight on Adrian Clayborn: Close to it All |url=http://www.kcrg.com/sports/hawkeyes/Clayborn-Close-to-it-All-100147949.html |publisher=The Gazette|date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]
