==Volleyball characteristics==

Indoor volleyballs are designed for the indoor version of the sport, and beach volleyballs for the beach game.  
Indoor volleyballs may be solid white or a combination of two or three different easily distinguishable colors.  They are made in two versions: the youth version is slightly smaller and weighs much less than an adult volleyball and than the standard version to accommodate youth's use. 
Beach volleyballs are slightly larger than standard indoor balls, have a rougher external texture, and a lower internal pressure.  They can be brightly colored or solid white.
The very first volleyballs were made from leather paneling over a rubber carcass.
