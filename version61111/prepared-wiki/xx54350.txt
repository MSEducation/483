===Governors of Wisconsin Territory===

Wisconsin Territory was formed on July 3, 1836. During the time of its existence, the Wisconsin Territory had three territorial governors, one of whom served non-consecutive terms,[ref][tpl]cite book | title=Manual for the use of the assembly, of the state of Wisconsin, for the year 1853 | url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?id=WI.WIBlueBk1853 | accessdate=December 11, 2007 | publisher=Brown and Carpenter, Printers| location=Madison, Wisconsin | page=74 | year=1853[/tpl]

===Governors of the State of Wisconsin===

Wisconsin was admitted to the Union on May 29, 1848. Since then, it has had 45 governors, one of whom served non-consecutive terms.
Originally, governors of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 the state constitution was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/bb/05bb/695-743.pdf | chapter=Wisconsin Governors since 1848 | accessdate=October 5, 2007 |format=PDF |title=State of Wisconsin Blue Book 2005–2006 | page=724[/tpl] Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.
The state constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor; originally, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected on different tickets, and thus were not necessarily of the same party.  Since the 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted on, together.  Originally, if the office of the governor was vacant for any reason, "the powers and duties of the office . . . devolved upon the lieutenant governor."  In 1979, the constitution was amended to make this more specific: if the governor dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, but becomes acting governor if the governor is absent from the state, impeached, or unable to carry out of duties.Wisconsin Constitution article V, § 7  If any of these events occur while the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the secretary of state becomes either governor or acting governor.Wisconsin Constitution article V, § 8  Two Wisconsin governors have died while in office, one has died after being elected but before taking office, and four have resigned.
