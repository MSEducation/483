It is on the northern edge of central London, at the junction of Euston Road and York Way, in the London Borough of Camden on the boundary with the London Borough of Islington. It is one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/managed-stations/ |title=Commercial information |date=April 2014 |work=Our Stations |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page= |accessdate=12 April 2014 [/tpl]
King's Cross station is the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, one of Britain's major railway backbones providing high speed inter-city services to destinations in Yorkshire, the North East and northern and eastern Scotland. Its most important long-distance destinations are Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh. It also hosts commuter services to areas of North London and outer-suburban services to Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire including fast regional services to Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn.
Immediately to the west across Pancras Road is St Pancras International, the London terminus of the Midland Main Line, Eurostar and high-speed trains to Kent via High Speed 1, and a major interchange for Thameslink services between [tpl]stnlink|Bedford[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlink|Brighton[/tpl]. The two stations are operationally completely separate, but as they are adjacent, they are regarded as a single complex for interchange purposes. They share King's Cross St. Pancras tube station on the London Underground network, where six Underground lines meet. Taken together, the two main-line stations and the associated Underground station form one of Britain's biggest transport hubs. The station is also within walking distance of Euston, the southern terminus for the West Coast Main Line.

==History==

King's Cross was built in 1851–1852 as the London hub of the Great Northern Railway and terminus of the East Coast main line. It took its name from the King's Cross area of London, which was named after a monument to King George IV that was demolished in 1845.Highbury, Upper Holloway and King's Cross, Old and New London: Volume 2 (1878), pp. 273–279. Retrieved 15 May 2009. Construction was  on the site of a fever and smallpox hospital and it replaced a temporary terminus at Maiden Lane that had opened on 7 August 1850.[tpl]cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995|publisher=Patrick Stephens |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |id=R508 |page=134 |ref=harv [/tpl]
Plans for the station were first made in December 1848 under the direction of George Turnbull, resident engineer for construction of the first [tpl]convert|20|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] of the Great Northern Railway out of London.Diaries of George Turnbull (Chief Engineer, East Indian Railway Company) held at the Centre of South Asian Studies at Cambridge University, England.Page 87 of George Turnbull, C.E. 437-page memoirs published privately 1893, scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007. The detailed design was by Lewis Cubitt, the brother of both Thomas Cubitt (the architect of Bloomsbury, Belgravia and Osborne House), and of Sir William Cubitt (who was chief engineer of The Crystal Palace built in 1851, and consulting engineer to the Great Northern and South Eastern Railways). The design is magnificent in its simplicity, being based on two great arched train sheds, with a brick structure at the south end designed to reflect the main arches behind.  In size, it was inspired by the 180 metre long Moscow Riding Academy of 1825, which it handsomely exceeded at 246 metres.  At the time King's Cross station was the last word in functional modernity.  Lewis Cubitt was also responsible for the design of the Great Northern Hotel (see below), and the 1847 cast-iron railway bridge ovr the River Nene at Peterborough. 
The main part of the station, which today includes platforms 1 to 8, was opened on 14 October 1852. The platforms have been reconfigured several times. Originally there was only one arrival and one departure platform (today's platforms 1 and 8 respectively), with the space between used for carriage sidings. As suburban traffic grew additional platforms were added with considerably less grandeur. The suburban station building now containing platforms 9–11 is from that era.
A new platform, numbered 0, was opened in 2010. To the east of platform 1, it created capacity for Network Rail to achieve a phased refurbishment of platforms 1–8 that includes new lifts to a new footbridge between the platforms. By 2013 the entire station will have been restored and transformed.King's Cross Redevelopment, First Capital Connect. Retrieved 10 October 2010.
A number of famous trains have been associated with King's Cross, such as the Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh, and the Gresley A3 and later streamlined A4 Pacific steam locomotives, which handled express services from the 1930s until the early 1960s. The most famous of these was Mallard, which still holds the world speed record for steam locomotives (set in 1938).
In 1972, a single-storey extension designed in-house by British Rail was built on to the front of the station to contain the main passenger concourse and ticket office. Although intended to be temporary, it still stood 40 years later, obscuring the Grade I-listed façade of the original station. Before the extension was built, the façade was hidden behind a small terrace of shops. The extension was demolished in late 2012,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.rail.co/2012/11/12/kings-cross-temporary-extension-torn-down-after-40-years |title= King's Cross 'temporary' extension torn down after 40 years |work=Rail.co |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate= 30 December 2012 |author= Johnson, Marc[/tpl] revealing once again the Lewis Cubitt architecture. In its place, the 75,000 sq ft King's Cross Square was created, which was opened to the public on 26 September 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=King's Cross Square opens to the public|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24274049|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2013[/tpl]
On 10 September 1973, a Provisional IRA bomb exploded in the booking hall at 12.24, causing extensive damage and injuring six people, some seriously. The [tpl]convert|3|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] device was thrown without warning by a youth who escaped into the crowd and was not caught.
The King's Cross fire of 1987, in which 31 people died, was at King's Cross St Pancras Underground station.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/18/newsid_2519000/2519675.stm |title=King's Cross station fire 'kills 27' |work=On This Day: 18 November 1987 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl]
The station has changed ownership a number of times: firstly the Great Northern Railway (GNR) (1852–1923), then the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) (1923–1948), then following nationalisation British Railways (1948–1996), then upon privatisation Railtrack, then Network Rail.
When the railways were privatised in 1996, express services into the station were taken over by GNER. Though it successfully re-bid for the franchise in 2005, it was asked to surrender it in December 2006. National Express East Coast took over the franchise on 9 December 2007 after an interim period when GNER ran trains under a management contract. In July 2009, it was announced that National Express was no longer willing to finance the East Coast subsidiary and the franchise was taken back into public ownership, handing over to East Coast in November 2009.

===King's Cross York Road===

Between 1863 and 1976, part of King's Cross was an intermediate station. On the extreme east of the site was King's Cross York Road, with suburban trains from Finsbury Park calling here, then using the sharply curved, and sharply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, with platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) rising to the main-line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from August 1976.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/k/kings_cross_york_road/index.shtml |title=Disused Stations: Kings Cross York Road |accessdate=23 April 2010[/tpl]

===Restoration===

In 2005, a £500 million restoration plan was announced by Network Rail; it was approved by Camden London Borough Council on 9 November 2007. The plan includes a thorough restoration and reglazing of the arched roof of the original station and the removal of the cramped and congested 1972 extension, to be replaced by an open-air plaza, scheduled for completion in 2013.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/architecture/all-change-at-kings-cross-7565844.html |title= All change at King's Cross |work=London Evening Standard |author= Long, Kieran |date= 14 March 2012 |page=34[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Network Rail unveils look for King's Cross square |work=Rail |location =Peterborough |page=14 |date=10 August 2011[/tpl]
A new semi-circular departures concourse, opened to the public on 19 March 2012,[tpl]cite news |work=Rail Professional |title=New concourse set to open at King's Cross |author=Silvester, Katie |url= http://www.railpro.co.uk/news/?idArticles=1330 |date=14 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/New_Kings_Cross.aspx |publisher=Network Rail |year=2012 |title= What's changing at King's Cross?[/tpl] has been built in the space directly to the west of the station behind the Great Northern Hotel, some outbuildings of which have been demolished. Designed by John McAslan and built by Vinci,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-kings-cross-western-concourse-opens.html |title=London King's Cross western concourse opens |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London |date=19 March 2012[/tpl] it is intended to cater for much-increased passenger flows and provide greater integration between the intercity, suburban and underground sections of the station, facilitating interchange between King's Cross and St Pancras. Departing passengers use the new concourse; arriving passengers initially exited the station from the old concourse on Euston Road, but now go through the new public square. The architect claims that the roof is the longest single-span station structure in Europe. The semi-circular building has a radius of 54 metres and over 2000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass.
The land between and behind the two stations is being redeveloped with nearly 2,000 new homes, [tpl]convert|486280|m²|abbr=on|sigfig=4[/tpl] of offices and new roads as King's Cross Central.
As part of this restoration programme, refurbished offices have opened on the east side of the station to replace the ones lost on the west side, and a new platform 0 opened underneath them on 20 May 2010. To prevent exhaust fumes from entering the ventilation system, no diesel trains are permitted to use this platform. The platform occupies the space of a former taxi rank, and was originally to be known as platform Y, but was renamed to avoid the confusion of having both lettered and numbered platforms. When the refurbishment is complete, all the platforms will be renumbered, the new one becoming platform 1.[tpl]cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Phil |editor-last=Pigott |editor-first=Nick |editor-link=Nick Pigott |date=July 2010|title= King's Cross Platform Zero opens |journal=The Railway Magazine |volume=156 |issue=1311 |page=7 |location=London |issn=0033-8923 [/tpl] Although there have been plans for a new platform for some time to increase capacity, it was the need to minimise disruption during restoration when other platforms would be temporarily out of use that led to this being built.

==King's Cross St Pancras tube station==

King's Cross St Pancras tube station is served by more lines than any other station on the London Underground, and is one of the busiest. It is in Travelcard Zone 1.
Major work is ongoing to link the various entrances to two new ticket halls and reduce overcrowding. Overcrowding has led to the closure of the entry and exit to the main ticket hall from inside King's Cross during weekday morning peak hours. At these times access to the tube station is via the new entrances outside King's Cross. Staff are placed at these entrances throughout the morning peak to implement crowd control and narrow or close the entrances. None of the other entrances to the tube station can be closed, being either inside St Pancras or too close to Euston Road to allow room for large crowds to wait.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

==In culture==

===Boudica and King's Cross===

The area of King's Cross was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the River Fleet. The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge. The name "Battle Bridge" is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the British Iceni tribe led by Boudica, Britain's Warrior Queen. Boudica's legendary fame during the Victorian era, when Queen Victoria was portrayed as her 'namesake',[tpl]cite journal |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |volume=XLII |year=1854 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MFZIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA541&dq=victoria+boadicea+namesake |page=541 |title=The Queens Before the Conquest |accessdate=20 February 2013 [/tpl] restored a historical and cultural foundation to Britain. Boudica has since remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom. The absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that Britain's native cultural and historical knowledge of Boudica's rebellion, with anything else of pre-Roman occupation, is solely due to the deliberate erasure of indigenous culture with the subsequently revised public image transformed from the propaganda writings of Romans. With scarce historical evidence it is disputed by modern historians. However Lewis Spence's 1937 book "Boadicea – Warrior Queen of the Britons", went so far as to include a map showing the positions of the opposing armies.
According to folklore,Boudica and King's Cross Station, (Museum of London). Retrieved 5 July 2011. King's Cross is the site of Boudica's final battle and perhaps she is buried under one of the platforms. Platforms 8, 9 and 10 have been suggested as possible sites. There are also passages under the station that her ghost is reputed to haunt.

===In fiction===

====The Ladykillers====

The station, its surrounding streets and the railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station and Mrs Wilberforce, an elderly widow in a house overlooking the railway, unwittingly assists them in moving the proceeds through the station. Members of the gang fall out with each other and one by one they all fall or are dropped into passing goods wagons.

====Harry Potter====

|}
King's Cross features in the Harry Potter books, by J. K. Rowling, as the starting point of the Hogwarts Express to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The train uses a secret platform 9¾ accessed through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10.
Platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station, and they are separated by two intervening tracks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4504_King%27s%20Cross%20Station%20Map.pdf|title=King's Cross – Station Guide |publisher=Network Rail |accessdate=3 May 2009[/tpl] Rowling intended the location to be in the main part of the station, but she misremembered the platform numbering. During an interview in 2001, she indicated that she had confused King's Cross with Euston, but platforms 9 and 10 at Euston are also separated by two tracks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4500_Euston%20Station%20Map.pdf |title=Euston – Station Guide |publisher=Network Rail |accessdate=3 May 2009[/tpl]
When the films were made, the station scenes took place within the main station, with platforms 4 and 5 renumbered 9 and 10. In the film of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the exterior of St. Pancras was used since its Victorian Gothic façade was considered more impressive than the real King's Cross.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
When the first film was released, a large floor panel was placed on the ground outside platforms 9 and 10, indicating the Hogwarts Express. It was later removed. Within King's Cross, a cast-iron "Platform 9¾" sign was erected on the wall of the suburban station building containing the real platforms 9 and 10. Part of a luggage trolley was installed below the sign: the near end was visible, but the rest of the trolley has disappeared into the wall. It is common to see Harry Potter fans stop to photograph the trolley or try to push the trolley through the wall to the hidden platform.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Due to problems with crowd numbers and renovation work within the station, the half trolley was moved to an exterior wall on Euston Road and in 2012, to the western departures concourse.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
"King's Cross" is the title of Chapter 35 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which is set in a dream location resembling the station. The station also features in the epilogue of the book, making it the final setting of the Harry Potter series. The real station appears in the film adaptation of both scenes.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

 ''"And what have you gained?"

 ''"A starting-point for our investigation." He hailed a cab. "King's Cross Station," said he. 

''"We have a journey, then?"

"Yes; I think we must run down to Cambridge together. All the indications seem to me to point in that direction."
