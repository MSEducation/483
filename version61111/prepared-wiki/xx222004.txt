The song was later recorded by other artists,[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] although not with the success of the original.  The song also inspired the book Carolina Girls (ISBN 0-9712521-7-3) by Steven Brown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicksprings.com/carolinagirls.htm |title=Chick Springs Publishing |publisher=Chicksprings.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl]
In an interview with Blues Critic, Danny Woods of Chairman of the Board was asked if "Carolina girls really are the best" and explains:  "You know when I first came here (The Carolinas) there was no style. You know you had the New York girls, California girls and they all got the attention. Even songs about them. And that just made Carolina girls feel like nothing but there's quite a difference between Carolina girls now and then. Their self esteem just magnified after that song."[tpl]cite web|url=http://bluescritic.com/chairmenoftheboardinterview.htm |title=CD Store Page 1 |publisher=Bluescritic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl] 
Fellow Chairman Ken Knox followed up:
 Girls became prideful. High schools and colleges use that song. Marching bands play "Carolina Girls". It's on T-shirts and we're glad about that. It's the all time biggest Carolina beach song now.
