Tian Han ([tpl]zh|t=田漢|s=田汉|p=Tián Hàn|first=t[/tpl]; 12 March 1898 – 10 December 1968Rudolf G. Wagner. The Contemporary Chinese Historical Drama: Four Studies. University of California Press, 1990. p. 137. ISBN 9780520059542), born in Changsha, Hunan, was a Chinese drama activist, playwright, a leader of revolutionary music and films, as well as a translator and poet. Tian contributed a great deal to the development of Chinese modern drama as well as Chinese opera. His most famous legacy may be the lyrics he wrote for March of the Volunteers in 1934, the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

==Biography==

During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Tian became famous for the vigorous anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist activities in the circle of artists and intellectuals he gathered.
Returning from Japan in 1921, Tian established the Creative Society together with Guo Moruo. The Southern China Society, also headed by Tian, played a leading role in promoting dramatic performances in southern China. In 1927, Tian taught at the Department of Literature of Shanghai Art University. Later, he joined The League of Chinese Left-Wing Dramatists.
Tian used various aliases and pen names including Tián Shòuchāng (田壽昌), Bóhóng (伯鴻), Chén Yú (陳瑜), Shùrén (漱人), and Hànxiān (漢仙).
He was attacked in 1966 on the eve of the Cultural Revolution for his historical play Xie Yaohuan (1961), an attack on Chairman Mao's policies. Criticism of this play, along with two other historical plays (Hai Rui Dismissed from Office by Wu Han and Li Huiniang by Meng Chao), were the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution.Rudolf G. Wagner. The Contemporary Chinese Historical Drama: Four Studies. University of California Press, 1990. p. 80. ISBN 9780520059542  Tian was denounced in a 1 February 1966 People's Daily article entitled "Xie Yaohuan is a Poisonous Weed" (田汉的《谢瑶环》是一棵大毒草 Tián Hàn de Xiè Yáohuán Shì yī kē Dà Dúcǎo). The Jiefang Daily called Xie Yaohuan a "political manifesto".  Tian was imprisoned as a "conterrevolutionary" in a prison run personally by Kang Sheng and died there in 1968.  After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he and Xie Yaohuan were rehabilitated posthumously in 1979.

==Works==

Although a proponent of western style theater (話劇 huàjù) in China, Tian also produced a number of works with historical themes.Rudolf G. Wagner. The Contemporary Chinese Historical Drama: Four Studies. University of California Press, 1990. p. 82-83. ISBN 9780520059542
