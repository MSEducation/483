SingTel Optus Pty Limited is the second largest telecommunications company in Australia, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications ([tpl]asx|SGT[/tpl]).  The company primarily trades under the Optus brand, while maintaining several wholly owned subsidiary brands, such as Virgin Mobile Australia in the mobile telephony market, Uecomm in the network services market and Alphawest in the ICT services sector.
To provide services, Optus owns and operates its own network infrastructure, as well as using the services of other network service providers, most notably Telstra Wholesale.  It provides services both directly to end users and also acts as a wholesaler to other service providers. Through its OptusNet brand, it provides broadband, wireless and dial-up internet services.
The company was originally known as Aussat Pty Limited prior to privatisation, when it became Optus Communications Pty Limited.  It was later renamed to Cable & Wireless Optus Pty Limited before changing again to its present name.

==Overview==

Key Optus products and services include:
Retail services are sold to customers via phone, internet or through retail outlets, especially  franchise chains such as Optus World, Network Communications, Strathfield, Telechoice, and Allphones.

==History==

===AUSSAT and Deregulation===

Optus can trace its beginnings back to the formation of the Government-owned AUSSAT Pty Limited in 1981.  In 1982, Aussat selected the Hughes 376 for their initial satellites, with the first, AUSSAT A1, launched in August 1985.[tpl]cite web | title = Aussat A-Series | work = Australia's Satellites & Programs | publisher = Lowdown | url = http://www.lowdown.com.au/sat_assat.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070608034807/http://www.lowdown.com.au/sat_assat.html  |archivedate = 2007-06-08[/tpl]  AUSSAT satellites were used for both military and civilian satellite communications, and delivering television services to remote outback communities.
With Aussat operating at a loss and with moves to deregulate telecommunications in Australia, the government decided to sell Aussat, coupled with a telecommunications licence.  The licence was sold to Optus Communications — a consortium including:[tpl]cite book|title=Report 333 - The sale of Aussat|date=September 1994|publisher=The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia — Joint Committee of Public Accounts|isbn=0-644-35468-2|pages=12[/tpl]
The new telecommunications company was designed to provide competition to then government owned telecommunications company Telecom Australia, now known as Telstra.

===Early History===

After privatisation, AUSSAT became Optus and its first offering to the general public was to offer long distance calls at cheaper rates than that of its competitor Telstra. The long distance calling rates on offer were initially available by consumers dialing 1 before the area code and phone number.  Following this, a ballot process was conducted by then regulator AUSTEL, with customers choosing their default long distance carrier.[tpl]cite news | last = Zucker | first = Paul | title = Australia's Telecom apologizes for misleading ads | publisher = Newsbytes News Network | date = 1993-06-04 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1993_June_4/ai_14017101 | accessdate = 2007-06-05 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Customers who made no choice or refused to respond to the mailout campaign automatically remained as a Telstra long distance customer.  Customers who remained with Telstra could dial the override code of 1456 before the area code and phone number to manually select Optus as the carrier for that single call.  Since 1 July 1998, consumers have the choice of preselecting their preferred long distance carrier or dialling the override code before dialing a telephone number.
The group began by building an interstate fibre optic cable and a series of exchanges between Optus' interstate network and Telecom's local network. It also laid fibre optics into major office buildings and industrial areas, and focused on high bandwidth local, (interstate) long distance, and interstate calls for business. In its early years, Optus was only able to offer local and long distance calls to residential customers connected to Telstra's local phone network. Telstra would carry residential to residential calls to Optus' exchanges, and then the calls would be switched to Optus' long distance fibre optic network.
Optus was the man sponsor of the 1997 ARL season.

===The Hybrid Fibre-Coax Rollout===

These practices meant that Optus was (and still is) the single largest customer of their competitor, Telstra. To become competitive Optus would need to lay its own local phone network. To provide a killer application for this, the Australian Federal government sold subscription television licences.  Optus, as well as the Seven Network, businessman Kerry Stokes and American cable company Cablevision, formed the Optus Vision consortium. News Corporation and Telstra created the rival Foxtel consortium.
Telstra's local phone network did not have the capability to deliver Foxtel pay television to consumers in the early 1990s, so Telstra identified a need to create a broadband network to support this new product.
As Telstra and Optus could not agree on terms for a joint broadband cable roll out, they laid two competing cable networks, in addition to Telstra's existing copper network, at a combined cost estimated of over A$6bn.
Whilst Telstra focused on creating a broadband network specifically for broadcast, Optus designed their cable network to provide telephony services in addition to broadcast television.

===Takeovers===

Cable and Wireless with 24.5% stakeholder bought out Bell South's equal 24.5% shareholding in July 1997.[tpl]cite news|title = Bell South Agrees To Drop Stake In Australian Company|publisher = The New York Times|date = 1997-07-02|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E5DE1530F931A35754C0A961958260|accessdate = 2008-07-19[/tpl]  The company returned to profitability in 1998 and changed its name to Cable and Wireless Optus Pty Limited.[tpl]cite press release|title = Optus continues strong turnaround performance|publisher = Cable & Wireless Optus via Australian Securities Exchange|date = 1998-08-31|url = http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/showSignalgAnnouncement.do?issuerId=788&documentNumber=140432&documentDate=1998-08-31|accessdate = 2008-07-19[/tpl]  Government relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions paved the way for the company to be floated[tpl]cite news|title = Cable & Wireless looks to buy Bell South's Optus stake|publisher = Computer Business Review|date = 1997-07-01|url = http://www.cbronline.com/article_cg.asp?guid=A424DE21-CA27-40FE-8302-7D7B6FEF197D|accessdate = [/tpl] - with Cable and Wireless increasing its holding to 52.5%)[tpl]cite web|title = Cable & Wireless: "Optus"|publisher = Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (Communications Division)|date=August 1999|url = http://www.union-network.org/Unisite/In_Depth/Multinationals/Cable_Wireless/Cable_Wireless_optus.html|accessdate = 2008-07-19[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|title = Cable & Wireless Optus Prospectus|publisher = Cable & Wireless Optus via Australian Securities Exchange|date = 1998-09-30|url = http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/showSignalgAnnouncement.do?issuerId=788&documentNumber=141427&documentDate=1998-09-30|accessdate = 2008-07-19[/tpl] - and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 1998-11-17.[tpl]cite press release|title = Cable & Wireless Optus trades on ASX|publisher = Australian Securities Exchange|date = 1998-11-17|url = http://www.asx.com.au/about/shareholder/media_releases/MR171198_AS3.htm|accessdate = 2008-07-19[/tpl]

In the 2003 & 2004 Financial Year, Optus reported a profit of A$440 million.  This was an improvement of A$412 million from the previous year.  The company has remained profitable since then.
In August 2004 Optus completed a A$227 million takeover of UEComm Ltd.
In July 2005 Optus announced it would acquire Alphawest Ltd. for A$25.9 million. The buyout was completed in November 2005 and Alphawest is now an operating division of Optus Business.
On 12 January 2006 Optus acquired the remaining 74.15% of Virgin Mobile Australia for U$22.6 m, giving it 100% ownership

===OptusNet===

Optus Communications offered its first business-focused internet products in 1998 under the OptusNet product family, offering in-house developed dial-up and high-speed services. Optus purchased one of Australia's pioneer ISPs, Microplex, in 1998 to provide consumer dial-up internet services.[tpl]cite news | title = Optus Buys Microplex | publisher = Australian Cybermalls News | date = 1998-05-25 | url = http://ausmall.com.au/acnarch/acnews27.htm#980525 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Clarke | first = Roger | title = A Brief History of the Internet in Australia | date = 2001-05-05 | url = http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/OzIHist.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]  Separate to this, under the Optus Vision brand, a cable broadband arm began as a joint venture with U.S cable and content provider Excite@Home and was known as Optus@Home from its introduction in 1999 [tpl]cite press release | title = Optus @Home priced for unlimited access | publisher = Optus | date = 1999-12-16 | url = http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/aboutoptus/menuitem.813c6f701cee5a14f0419f108c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=26498336054f4010VgnVCM1000009fa87c0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=585cfaf924954010VgnVCM10000029a67c0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default | accessdate = 2007-01-01 [/tpl] until it was renamed in 2002.[tpl]cite news | last = Borgo | first = Matt | title = Optus@Home renames to OptusNet Cable | publisher = Whirlpool | date = 2002-03-25 | url = http://whirlpool.net.au/article.cfm/777 | accessdate= 2007-06-16 [/tpl]  ADSL services were offered from February 2004.[tpl]cite news | last = McNeill | first = Fiona | title = Telstra-Optus price war erupts | publisher = Whirlpool | date = 2004-02-16 | url = http://whirlpool.net.au/article.cfm/1235 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]  ADSL2+ services were provided from December 2005.[tpl]cite news | last = Corner | first = Stuart | title = Optus launches ADSL2+ services | publisher = iTWire | date = 2006-03-30 | url = http://www.itwire.com/content/view/3774/127/ | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]

===OPEL Networks===

In June 2007, joint venture subsidiary OPEL Networks was awarded government funding towards the cost of building a regional broadband network.  Optus was to be contracted to build the network on behalf of OPEL.[tpl]cite web | title = Broadband Access and Choice for rural and regional Australia | publisher = OPEL / Elders | date = 2007-06-18 | url = http://www.futuris.com.au/images/presentations/presentation_38.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-14 [/tpl]
In April 2008, after a change of the Federal Government from the Liberal Party of Australia coalition to the Australian Labor Party, the new government terminated the funding agreement and the project was halted, with its functions to be replaced by the National Broadband Network.

===Terria===

Optus is part of a consortium – now known as Terria – that in July 2006 announced their intention to make a combined bid to build the proposed National Broadband Network.

==Infrastructure==

Optus' fully owned network infrastructure consists of the following[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/wholesale/menuitem.58d2265ecf5c99a54f7416058c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=ea3058ebbebd1010VgnVCM100000c8a87c0aRCRD |title=Optus Network |accessdate=2007-06-04 |publisher=Optus[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/wholesale/menuitem.58d2265ecf5c99a54f7416058c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=8c6058ebbebd1010VgnVCM100000c8a87c0aRCRD |title=DSL Network and Coverage |accessdate=2007-06-04 |publisher=Optus[/tpl]

===Network Backbone===

===Customer access network===

OptusNet is one of only five ISPs in Australia to provide Cable internet (the other four are BigPond, Neighbourhood Cable, TransACT and e-wire). In August 2010, OptusNet released an upgrade of its HFC network to the DOCSIS 3.0 standard,Optus.com.au which enabled customers to access a maximum theoretical downstream bandwidth of 100 Megabits. OptusNet is also one of the few ISPs in Australia to currently provide ADSL2+ via its own DSLAMs, which it also resells to other ISPs.[tpl]cite web | title = Australia — Broadband — ADSL2+ Providers | publisher = BuddeComm | url = http://www.budde.com.au/Reports/Contents/Australia-Broadband-ADSL2-Providers-4159.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]
