[[Jollas]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Jollas is a genus of jumping spiders (Salticidae). Most species occur in Central to South America. J. lahorensis, however, is only found in Pakistan; this most likely results from a taxonomic mistake. The salticid genera Freya, Bellota and Zygoballus have very similar distribution artifacts.
