==Coaching career==

Knapp spent nine years in various positions with the San Francisco 49ers: offensive quality control from 1995 to 1997, quarterbacks coach from 1998 to 2000, and offensive coordinator from 2001 to 2003, featuring the West coast offense.
http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/KnapGr0.htm He was named offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons from 2004 to 2006, helping to form Michael Vick at quarterback as a potent two-way offensive threat. The 2004 Atlanta Falcons finished first in the NFC South with an 11-5 record. Knapp then went to the Oakland Raiders as offensive coordinator in 2007 and 2008, but these teams struggled on offense.  In 2009, he shifted to the Seattle Seahawks as offensive coordinator and then as quarterbacks coach of the Houston Texans from 2010 to 2011, helping mold Matt Schaub into a premier quarterback. The 2011 Texans finished the season 10-6 and first place in the AFC South.
Before the start of the 2012 NFL season, he was named by new head coach Dennis Allen, whom he met as a fellow coach in Atlanta, as offensive coordinator of the Raiders a second time around. To strengthen the offensive line, the Raiders' general manager, Reggie McKenzie, picked the Texans' right guard, Mike Brisiel, as a free agent.  After a season marked by a switch to a zone-blocking scheme at Knapp's urging, and the resulting ineffectiveness of the Raiders' key offensive threat, running back Darren McFadden, Knapp was relieved of his duties as the Raiders offensive coordinator on December 31st, 2012.
Knapp was hired as the quarterbacks coach for the Denver Broncos on January 18th, 2013.
