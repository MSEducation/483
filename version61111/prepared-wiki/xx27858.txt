CATEGORIES: Breakfasts, Meals

Breakfast is the first meal taken after rising from a night's sleep, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/breakfast |title=breakfast - definition of breakfast by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-28[/tpl] Among English speakers, "breakfast" can be used to refer to this meal or to refer to a meal composed of traditional breakfast foods (such as eggs, oatmeal and sausage) served at any time of day. The word literally refers to breaking the fasting period of the prior night.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=breakfast&searchmode=none | title=Breakfast | publisher=Etymonline.com | accessdate=February 2, 2013[/tpl]
Breakfast foods vary widely from place to place, but often include a carbohydrate such as grains or cereals, fruit and/or vegetables, a protein food such as eggs, meat or fish, and a beverage such as tea, coffee, milk or fruit juice. Coffee, milk, tea, juice, breakfast cereals, pancakes, sausages, French toast, bacon, sweet breads, fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, muffins, crumpets and toast with butter or margarine and/or jam or marmalade are common examples of breakfast foods, though a large range of preparations and ingredients are associated with breakfast globally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.breakfastpanel.org/history-of-breakfast/|title=History of breakfast|accessdate=21 April 2011[/tpl]

==Effect on health==

Some nutritional experts have long referred to breakfast as the most important meal of the day, citing studies that find that people who skip breakfast are disproportionately likely to have problems with concentration, metabolism, weight, and cardiac health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN01119|title=Why is breakfast the most important meal of the day?|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2824987.stm|title=Breakfast is 'most important meal'|date= 7 March 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23403744|title=Breakfast linked to 'healthy heart'|publisher=Circulation|website=BBC News|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2013[/tpl] The nutritionist Monica Reinagel has argued the metabolic benefits have been exaggerated, noting the improvement in cognition has been found among children, but is much less significant among adults. Reinagel also explains that the link between skipping breakfast and increased weight is likely behavioral—compensating with snacks and/or eating more later—and therefore not inevitable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/is-skipping-breakfast-bad-for-you.aspx|title=Is Skipping Breakfast Bad for You|accessdate=17 February 2010[/tpl] Some say that skipping breakfast may even lead to diabetes as well as coronary disease.http://voices.yahoo.com/going-bed-late-night-skipping-early-morning-12590418.html

===Nigeria===

Nigeria has over 250 different ethnic groups,[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html |title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov[/tpl] with a corresponding variety of cuisines. For the Hausa of northern Nigeria, a typical breakfast consists of kosai (cakes made from ground beans which are then fried) or funkaso (wheat flour soaked for a day then fried and served with sugar). Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as koko. For the south western Yoruba people (Ilé Yorùbá) one of the most common breakfasts is Ògì— a porridge made from corn, usually served with evaporated milk. Ògì is eaten with Acarajé (akara) or Moi moi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/food/fo-44786_1_nigerian-bean-cakes|title=Nigerian Bean Cakes Make a Hearty Breakfast|first=Rose|last=Dosti|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 February 1988|accessdate=15 January 2012[/tpl] Both are made from ground bean paste; akara is fried in oil, and moi moi is wrapped in leaves or foil and then steamed. Ògì can also be steamed in leaves to harden it and eaten with akara or moi moi for breakfast. English tea or [tpl]typo|malta[/tpl] is served as a breakfast drink. Another popular option in southwest Nigeria is Gari, which is eaten like a cereal. Gari, known in Brazil as farofa, is made from the root of cassava. For breakfast, it is soaked in water and sweetened with sugar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motherlandnigeria.com/food.html|title=Foods and Drinks|publisher=Motherland Nigeria|accessdate=15 January 2012[/tpl]

===Somalia===

Breakfast (quraac) is an important meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shaah). The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraq) or soup.Abdullahi, pp.111-114. Lahoh, is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p. 113.Little Business Women It is often eaten along with honey and ghee, and washed down with a cup of tea.

===Uganda===

In Uganda, most tribes have different cuisine but the most popular breakfast dishes are Porridge and Katogo.

==Asia==

===Burma===

In Burma, the traditional breakfast is htamin jaw, fried rice with boiled peas (pè byouk), and yei nway jan (green tea) especially among the poor.[tpl]cite book|last=Kong|first=Foong Ling|author2=Ming Tsai|author3=Chiong Liew|title=The Food of Asia|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2002|page=24|isbn=978-0-7946-0146-1[/tpl]
Glutinous rice or kao hnyin is steamed and wrapped in banana leaf often served with peas as kao hnyin baung with a sprinkle of crushed and salted toasted sesame.
 Equally popular is the purple variety of rice known as nga cheik which is cooked the same way and called nga cheik paung. Si damin is sticky rice cooked with turmeric and onions in peanut oil and served with crushed and salted toasted sesame and crisp fried onions. Assorted fritters such as baya jaw (urad dal)is often served as a compliment.
Nan bya or naan (Indian-style flatbreads) again with pè byouk or simply buttered, is served with Indian tea or coffee. It goes well with hseiksoup (mutton soup).
Fried chapati, blistered like nan bya but crispy, with pè byouk and crispy fried onions is a popular alternative.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.travelwireasia.com/5870/burmese-food/|title=A taste of Yangon: 6 must-try Burmese dishes|last=Lane|first=Jo|date=28 February 2012|work=Travel Wire Asia|publisher=Hybrid News Limited|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]

Eeja gway (Chinese-style fried breadsticks or youtiao) with Indian tea or coffee is another favourite.
Mohinga,[tpl]cite book|last=Köllner|first=Helmut|author2=Axel Bruns|title=Myanmar (Burma)|publisher=Hunter Publishing|year=1998|page=215[/tpl] perhaps the most popular of all, now available as an "all-day breakfast" in many towns and cities, is rice vermicelli in fish broth kept on the boil with chickpea flour and/or crushed toasted rice, lemon grass, sliced banana stem, onions, garlic, ginger, pepper and fish paste and served with crispy fried onions, crushed dried chilli, coriander, fish sauce and lime. Add fritters such as split chickpea (pè jan jaw), urad dal (baya jaw) or gourd (bu jaw), boiled egg and fried fish cake (nga hpè jaw).

===China===

As China is made up of many distinct provinces each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep fried bread sticks or doughnuts (youtiao), buns (mantou), porridge (congee), and fried or soup-based noodles.[tpl]cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soy bean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.

===Hong Kong===

Due to its near two centuries history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in Hong Kong, as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in Cha chaan teng. Cha Chaan Teng breakfasts often include Hong Kong style milk tea, pan fried egg, bread, Cantonese noodles and/or Hong Kong style macaroni in soup.[tpl]cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/eat/cha-chaan-teng-cheat-sheet-how-order-hong-kongs-temples-comfort-food-726567|title=Cha chaan teng cheat sheet: What to order at the most popular eateries in Hong Kong|work=travel.cnn.com|accessdate=December 30, 2013[/tpl]
Traditional Cantonese breakfast may include dim sum, which include a variety of different ingredients and are prepared in numerous different forms from delicately wrapped baby shrimp steamed dumplings to sweet water chestnut cake. Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. Iron Buddha tea is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as pu'er and oolong are also common.[tpl]cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular. In modern times, dim sum is commonly prepared and served in Yum Cha restaurants rather than home because of the skill and efforts involved in the preparation.

===Japan===

Breakfast in modern Japanese households comes in two major variations: Japanese-style and Western-style. Japanese-style breakfasts are eaten widely in Japan, but are often eaten only on weekends and non-working days. Younger Japanese couples may prefer Western-style breakfasts because they are generally less time-consuming to prepare.
The standard Japanese breakfast consists of steamed white rice, a bowl of miso soup, and Japanese styled pickles (like takuan or umeboshi). A raw egg and nori are often served; the raw egg is beaten in a small bowl and poured on the hot rice to make golden colored tamago kake gohan, whilst the nori (sheets of dried seaweed) is used to wrap rice. Grilled fish and Japanese green tea is often served as well.
Western-style breakfasts in Japanese households are similar to those in the United States. Japanese children often eat cornflakes and drink milk, hot chocolate or fruit juice. Japanese adults (especially younger ones) tend to have toast with butter or jam, eggs, and slices of vegetables. They often drink coffee or orange juice.
Traditional Japanese inns (like ryokan) serve complete traditional breakfast. Western-style hotels and restaurants in Japan generally offer a mix of the Western and Japanese-styles.

===Korea===

Traditionally, Korean breakfasts consist mainly of rice and soup dishes.  These can include small amounts of fish or beef, and some form of broth, stew or porridge.  Like all Korean meals, breakfast is usually served with banchan, or side dishes consisting of kimchi, steamed eggs and tofu.[tpl]cite web|title= About |url=http://koreanfood.about.com/od/koreanfoodbasics/ig/Korean-Breakfast/Korean-Brunch.htm|accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl]

===India===

There is no standard Indian breakfast menu as almost each state in India has different specialties.
However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into 2 types; North Indian and South Indian.
The eastern and western parts of India also have individual breakfast items unique to their culture or state.

===Philippines===

A traditional Filipino breakfast might include pandesal (small bread rolls), kesong puti (white cheese), champorado (chocolate rice porridge), sinangag (garlic fried rice), and meat—such as tapa, longganisa, tocino, karne norte (corned beef), or fish such as daing na bangus  (salted and dried milkfish)—or itlog na pula (salted duck eggs).  Coffee is also commonly served particularly kapeng barako, a variety of coffee produced in the mountains of Batangas noted for having a strong flavor.
Certain portmanteaus in Filipino have come into use to describe popular combinations of items in a Filipino breakfast.  An example of such a combination order is kankamtuy:  an order of kan'''in'' (rice), kamatis'' (tomatoes) and tuy'o (dried fish).  Another is tapsi: an order of tapa and sinangág.  Other examples include variations using a silog suffix, usually some kind of meat served with sinangág and itlog (egg).  The three most commonly seen silogs are tapsilog (having tapa as the meat portion), tocilog (having tocino as the meat portion), and longsilog (having longganisa as the meat portion). Other silogs include hotsilog (with a hot dog), bangsilog (with bangus (milkfish)), dangsilog (with danggit (rabbitfish)), spamsilog (with spam), adosilog (with adobo), chosilog (with chorizo), chiksilog (with chicken), cornsilog (with corned beef), and litsilog (with lechon/litson). Pankaplog is a slang term referring to a breakfast consisting of pandesal, kape (coffee), and itlog (egg).[tpl]cite web |url=http://pinoyslang.com/define/pakaplog |title=Pakaplog |publisher=Pinoy Slang |accessdate=2008-11-12[/tpl] An establishment that specializes in such meals is called a tapsihan'' or "tapsilugan".
