Outside the eurozone, a total of 23 countries and territories that do not belong to the EU have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including 14 countries in mainland Africa (CFA franc and Moroccan dirham), two African island countries (Comorian franc and Cape Verdean escudo), three French Pacific territories (CFP franc) and two Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark) and Macedonia (Macedonian denar).[tpl]cite web|last=Cardoso|first=Paulo|title=Interview – Governor of the National Bank of Macedonia – Dimitar Bogov|url=http://www.the-american-times.com/american-times-governor-national-bank-macedonia-dimitar-bogov/2013/10/05|work=The American Times United States Emerging Economies Report (USEER Report)|publisher=Hazlehurst Media SA|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl]  On 28 July 2009, São Tomé and Príncipe signed an agreement with Portugal which will eventually tie its currency to the euro.[tpl]Cite news|title= S.Tomé e Princípe ancora-se ao euro |url=http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/stome-e-principe-ancorase-ao-euro_1393438 |publisher=economia.publico.pt |date=27 July 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011[/tpl]
With the exception of Bosnia, Macedonia (which both pegged its currency against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo) all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.
Within the EU several currencies have a peg to the euro, in most instances as a precondition to joining the eurozone. The Bulgarian lev was formerly pegged to the Deutsche Mark; other EU member states have a direct peg due to ERM II: the Danish krone, and the Lithuanian litas.
In total, as of 2013, 182 million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro, 27 million people outside the eurozone in Europe, and another 545,000 people on Pacific islands.

==Economics==

===Optimal currency area===

In economics, an optimum currency area (or region) (OCA, or OCR) is a geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.A Plan for a European Currency, 1973 by Mundell However, even before the creation of the single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014341 |title=The Breakup of the Euro Area by Barry Eichengreen :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13839381 |title=Greek debt crisis: Straw says eurozone 'will collapse' |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for The New Yorker explains it thus:
 The guiding principle of the currency, which opened for business in 1999, were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country's annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G.D.P. It was a nice idea, but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone, Germany and France, had broken the rules for three years in a row.John Lanchester, "Euro Science," New Yorker, 10 October 2011.  

===Transaction costs and risks===

The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).
The absence of distinct currencies also removes exchange rate risks. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.
Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more liquid and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.Benchimol, J., 2014. Risk aversion in the Eurozone, Research in Economics, vol. 68, issue 1, pp. 39–56.

===Price parity===

Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of the law of one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w8402 |title=Market Integration and Convergence to the Law of One Price: Evidence from the European Car Market |publisher=Nber.org |accessdate=5 January 2009[/tpl]

===Macroeconomic stability===

Low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies. Because a high level of inflation acts as a tax (seigniorage) and theoretically discourages investment, it is generally viewed as undesirable. In spite of the downside, many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures. Some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the Bundesbank in Germany; as the European Central Bank is modelled on the Bundesbank,[tpl]Cite book|title=The History of the Bundesbank: Lessons for the European Central Bank |last=de Haan |first=Jakob |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-21723-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EaIV0OWlaokC |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl] it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low. Member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation. The ECB (unlike the Federal Reserve in the United States of America) does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment.
Many national and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.
Unfortunately, there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This is one of the main reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] This effect is strongest in European countries with a weak economy.
In general, those in Europe who own large amounts of euros, are served by high stability and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros, including those countries who need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly less strong euro leading to more export. Because with a lower euro, investors would see better chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there, would become less risky, and that would push interest rates for southern countries more in line with the European average.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The contradiction here is, that high macroeconomic stability in the form of ongoing historically low inflation, over time leads to economic problems, creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

====Trade====

A 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecb.de/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp594.pdf |title=The euro's trade effects |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] although one study suggested an increase of only 3%[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |title=The Euro Effect on Trade is not as Large as Commonly Thought|format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] while another estimated 9 to 14%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1079383 |title=SSRN-Estimating the Euro Effects on Trade with Propensity Score Matching by Pandej Chintrakarn |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/670658078011l5r1/ |title=Rose effect and the euro: is the magic gone? |work=Review of World Economics |accessdate=13 July 2010[/tpl]

====Investment====

Physical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |title=The Impact of the Euro on Investment: Sectoral Evidence|format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5njSL0hxe|archivedate=22 February 2010 |title=Does the single currency affect FDI?|publisher=AFSE.fr |format=PDF |accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl] Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.wu-wien.ac.at/rof/papers/pdf/Bris-Koskinen-Nilsson_Euro%20Effects.pdf |title=The Real Effects of the Euro: Evidence from Corporate Investments |format=PDF |accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl]

====Inflation====

The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Paolo Angelini | coauthors = Francesco Lippi | title = Did Prices Really Soar after the Euro Cash Changeover?

The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121658067/abstract |title=The Euro Changeover and Its Effects on Price Transparency and Inflation |publisher=InterScience.Wiley.com |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl] It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1162/qjec.121.3.1103 |title=Quarterly Journal of Economics – Abstract |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=1103 |publisher=MIT Press Journals |year=2006 |last1=Hobijn |first1=Bart |last2=Ravenna |first2=Federico |last3=Tambalotti |first3=Andrea [/tpl]

====Exchange rate risk====

One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates. It has been found that the introduction of the euro created "significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of Europe".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VFG-4KB14MN-1&_user=121712&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000009979&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=121712&md5=9da59b5525252985a70618a2dafbc141 |title=The impact of the introduction of the Euro on foreign exchange rate risk exposures |work=Journal of Empirical Finance |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] These reductions in market risk "were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-Euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe".

====Financial integration====

The introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European financial integration. According to a study on this question, it has "significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets ... However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp139.pdf |title=The Euro and Financial Integration|format=PDF |date=May 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMC-4TXF7WY-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2c6125b54140decec22b1a1afcb622e0 |title=The geography of asset trade and the euro: Insiders and outsiders |work=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] On a global level, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=925858 |title=SSRN-Global Bond Portfolios and EMU by Philip R. Lane |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl]

====Effect on interest rates====

The introduction of the euro has decreased the interest rates of most members countries, in particular those with a weak currency.  As a consequence the market value of firms from countries which previously had a weak currency has very significantly increased.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/hhn101 |title=The Euro and Corporate Valuations |publisher=Rfs.oxfordjournals.org |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] The countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the euro are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eabcn.org/research/documents/lane.pdf |title=The Real Effects of EMU |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl]
The effect of such low interest rates made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell and the countries themselves to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and increase their public deficit and levels of privately held consumer debt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/opinion/2076100/redwood-origins-euro-crisis |title=Redwood: The origins of the euro crisis |publisher=Investmentweek.co.uk |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] Following the late-2000s financial crisis, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ip-global.org/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |title=Farewell, Fair-Weather Euro | IP – Global-Edition |publisher=Ip-global.org |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Price convergence====

The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.ecb.eu/events/pdf/conferences/emu/sessionV_Angeloni_Paper.pdf |title=Price setting and inflation dynamics: did EMU matter |format=PDF |accessdate=13 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://opus.zbw-kiel.de/volltexte/2009/7575/pdf/200906dkp.pdf |title=Price convergence in the EMU? Evidence from micro data |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] Other studies have found evidence of price convergence,[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.london.edu/hrey/IMRRtele.pdf |title=One TV, One Price? |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/835/1/MPRA_paper_835.pdf |title=One Market, One Money, One Price? |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] in particular for cars.Gil-Pareja, Salvador, and Simón Sosvilla-Rivero, "Price Convergence in the European Car Market", FEDEA, November 2005. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/hepdoc/macppr_4_2009.pdf |first=Ulrich |last=Fritsche |first2=Sarah |last2=Lein |first3=Sebastian |last3=Weber |title=Do Prices in the EMU Converge (Non-linearly)? |publisher=University of Hamburg, Department Economics and Politics Discussion Papers, Macroeconomics and Finance Series |date=April 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl]

====Tourism====

A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU, with an increase of 6.5%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983231 |title=SSRN-The Effect of EMU on Tourism by Salvador Gil-Pareja, Rafael Llorca-Vivero, José Martínez-Serrano |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl]

==Exchange rates==

===Flexible exchange rates===

The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This is because of the implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low interest rates and restricting money supply, has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners.

===Against other major currencies===

The euro is one of the major reserve currencies together with the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Pound sterling and Swiss franc. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable.[tpl]cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110822-701343.html |title= Euro Stable Despite Debt Crisis Says Schaeuble |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= 22 August 2011 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index – measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners – was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/15/uk-markets-euro-mystery-idUKLNE7AE02520111115 |title= Puzzle over euro's 'mysterious' stability |work=Reuters |date= 15 November 2011[/tpl]

==Linguistic issues==

The formal titles of the currency are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor (one hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/conrep/cr200705en.pdf|title=European Central Bank, Covergence report May 2007|format=PDF|quote=The euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it. To make this singleness apparent, Community law requires a single spelling of the word euro in the nominative singular case in all Community and national legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets.|accessdate=29 December 2008[/tpl] This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages; e.g., those where there is no eu diphthong. Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; euro in the Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро (evro) and not eуро (euro) in all official documents.[tpl]cite web|author=Elena Koinova |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2007/10/19/656777_evro-dispute-over-portuguese-foreign-minister |title="Evro" Dispute Over – Portuguese Foreign Minister – Bulgaria |publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] In the Greek script the term ευρώ is used; the Greek "cent" coins are denominated in λεπτό/ά (lepto/a). Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural,European Commission. "Spelling of the words "euro" and "cent" in official community languages as used in community legislative acts" (PDF). Retrieved 12 January 2009. although the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation states that the plural forms euros and cents should be used in English.For example, see European Commission, Directorate General for Translation: English Style Guide section 20.9 "'The euro.' Like 'pound', 'dollar' or any other currency name in English, the word 'euro' is written in lower case with no initial capital and, where appropriate, takes the plural 's' (as does 'cent')."
