Intensive five-day revision courses are also available during normal school holidays at Christmas, Easter, winter mid-term break, in May and August. Study skills seminars available in September. From 2009, the Institute launched Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT) preparation courses.

==Self-financing==

The Institute is one of very few secondary schools in Ireland that is not funded at least in part by central government through the Department of Education. As a result, the school is not subject to inspections from the Department, is not obliged to follow a certain curriculum and may pay teachers as it wishes, rather than according to the public service wages paid to most teachers in the country. The school is owned by Ray Kearns and family.The key factors when repeating the Leaving By Chris Pillow and Gerard Kiely, Sunday Business Post, 22 August 2004.
