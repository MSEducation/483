King Swamp is the self-titled debut album of the British rock band King Swamp.  Originally released in May 1989, the album was well received by critics.  But, its failure to peak even in the top-150 on the Billboard 200 proved to be a bad omen.  When their second album failed to chart anywhere in the U.S. or the U.K., the band split up.  Despite the failure of the album to find a commercial audience, it did have the unique distinction of being featured on the 1980s TV show Miami Vice.  The track 'Year Zero' was used during the pre-credit car chase sequence of the two-hour finale episode titled 'Freefall' (first aired on May 21, 1989).
