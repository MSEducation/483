Outside the United States, Americanization or Americanisation is the influence the United States has on the culture of other countries, such as their popular culture, cuisine, technology, business practices, or political techniques. The term has been used since at least 1907.Samuel E. Moffett, The Americanization of Canada (1907) full text online; see also Ralph Willett, The Americanization of Germany, 1945-1949 (1989)  Within the United States, the term Americanization refers to the process of acculturation by immigrants or annexated populations (e.g. the Californios) to American customs and values.

==Media and popular culture==

Hollywood (the American film and television industry) dominates most of the world's media markets. It is the chief medium by which people across the globe see American fashions, customs, scenery and way of life.[tpl]cite book|author1=William Hoynes|author2=David Croteau|author3=Stefania Milan|title=Media/Society: Industries, Images, and Audiences|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R2jVgDIaV3QC&pg=PA333|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|page=333[/tpl]
U.S.-based TV programs are re-broadcast around the world, many of them through American broadcasters and their subsidiaries (such as HBO Asia, CNBC Europe and CNN International). Many of these distributors broadcast mainly American programming on their TV channels.  In 2006, a survey of 20 countries by Radio Times found seven American shows in the ten most-watched: CSI: Miami, Lost, Desperate Housewives, The Simpsons, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Without a Trace and The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm | title=CSI show 'most popular show in the world' | publisher=BBC | date=2006-07-31 | accessdate=2013-10-23 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070902205017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm| archivedate= 2 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
American films are also extremely popular around the world, often dominating cinemas. Adjusting for inflation, the highest grossing film of all time is Gone with the Wind. Often part of the negotiating in free trade agreements between the U.S. and other nations involves screen quotas. One such case is Mexico, which abolished screen quotas following the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S.[tpl]cite web|url= http://x.adelantesi.com/news/story.php?ID=387|title =Dual forces fuel Mexican film industry|publisher =Adelante|accessdate=2007-08-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070811131415/http://x.adelantesi.com/news/story.php?ID=387  |archivedate = 2007-08-11[/tpl] Recently South Korea has agreed to reduce its quota under pressure from the U.S. as part of a free trade deal.[tpl]cite web|url = http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1085923.php/South_Korea_cuts_local_film_quotas_to_meet_US_FTA%A0demand|title = South Korea cuts local film quotas to meet US FTA demand|publisher = M&C|accessdate=2007-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929114933/http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1085923.php/South_Korea_cuts_local_film_quotas_to_meet_US_FTA%A0demand| archivedate= 29 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Many U.S.-based artists, such as Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson are recognized worldwide and have sold over 500 million albums each.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/faq/faq.asp?qid=8|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Elvis.com|accessdate=2007-08-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225542/http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/faq/faq.asp?qid=8| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Michael Jackson's album Thriller, at 100 million sales, is the best-selling album of all time.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/16112006/jackos_back|title=Jackos Back|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2007-08-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070916112432/http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/16112006/jackos_back| archivedate= 16 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==American business and brands==

Of the top ten global brands, seven are based in the United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.finfacts.com/brands.htm | title=The Global Brands Scorecard 2006 | work=BusinessWeek | date=2006-08-02 | accessdate=2007-08-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070820120024/http://www.finfacts.com/brands.htm| archivedate= 20 August 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Coca-Cola, which holds the top spot, is often viewed as a symbol of Americanization.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/ko.html | title=The Coca-Cola Company | publisher=NYSE Euronext | accessdate=2007-08-24[/tpl] Fast food is also often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as Starbucks, McDonald's,Karen DeBres, "A Cultural Geography of McDonald's UK," Journal of Cultural Geography, 2005 Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Domino's Pizza among others have numerous outlets around the world.
Many of the world's biggest computer companies are also U.S. based, such as Microsoft, Apple, Intel, Dell and IBM, and much of the software bought worldwide is created by U.S. based companies. Carayannis and Campbell note that "The USA occupies, also in global terms, a very strong position in the software sector."Elias G. Carayannis and David F. J. Campbell, Mode 3 Knowledge Production in Quadruple Helix Innovation Systems (2011) p. 42  
In Germany in the 1920s, the American efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially Fordism.Noland (1975) "Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and social democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," Feminist Studies. Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+
During the Cold War, the Americanization was the method to counter the processes of Sovietization around the world. Education, schools, and universities in particularly, became the main target for Americanization. However, the resistance to Americanization of the university community restrained it.

==Visibility==

During the 15 years from 1950 to 1965, American investments in Europe soared by 800% to $13.9 billion, and in the European Economic Community rose 10 times to $6.25 billion. Europe's share of American investments increased from 15% to 28%. The investments were of very high visibility and generated much talk of Americanization. Even so American investments in Europe represented only 5% of the total European investment and American-owned companies in the European Economic Community employ only 2 or 3% of the total labor force. The basic reason for the U.S. investments is no longer lower production costs, faster economic growth, or higher profits in Europe, but the desire to maintain a competitive position based largely on American technological superiority. Opposition to U.S. investments, originally confined to France, later spread to other European countries. Public opinion began to resent American advertising and business methods, personnel policies, and the use of the English language by American companies. Criticism was also directed toward the international currency system which was blamed for inflationary tendencies as a result of the dominant position of the U.S. dollar.Niels Grosse, "American Investments In Europe," Europa-Archiv, 1967, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 23-32  However by the 1970s European investments in the U.S. increased even more rapidly than vice versa, and Geir Lundestad finds there was less talk of the Americans buying Europe.[tpl]cite book|author=Geir Lundestad|title=The United States and Western Europe since 1945: from "Empire" by invitation to transatlantic drift|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zv6wUcVwNsUC&pg=PA221|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928397-2|page=221[/tpl] 

==Historiography==

Berghahn (2010) analyzes the debate on the usefulness of the concepts of 'Americanization' and 'Westernization'. He reviews the recent research on the European-American relationship during the Cold War that has dealt with the cultural impact of the United States upon Europe. He then discusses the relevant work on this subject in the fields of economic and business history. Overall, the article tries to bring out that those who have applied the concept of 'Americanization' to their research on cultural and/or economic history have been well aware of the complexities of trans-Atlantic relations in this period, whether they were viewed as a two-way exchange or as a process of circulation.[ref]Volker R. Berghahn, "The debate on 'Americanization'  among economic and cultural historians," Cold War History, Feb 2010, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 107-130
