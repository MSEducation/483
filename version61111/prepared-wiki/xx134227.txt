CATEGORIES: Danish monarchy, Lists of mottos

The use of a royal motto ([tpl]lang-da|valgsprog[/tpl]) is an old tradition among Danish monarchs, dating back at least 500 years. The use of such a motto was a way for a monarch to emphasize values or beliefs he / she held dear. In earlier times, these mottos were often shown on Danish coinage, often in a Latin form.
