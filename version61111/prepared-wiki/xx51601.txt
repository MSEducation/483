[[File:FinnBirdMimic.jpg|thumb|Some hawk-cuckoos resemble hawks like the Shikra.]] In Batesian mimicry the mimic shares signals similar to the model, but does not have the attribute that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g. unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (including Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study.Bates H. W. 1863. The naturalist on the river Amazons. Murray, London.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Bates | first1 = H. W. | year = 1961 | title = Contributions to an insect fauna of the Amazon valley. Lepidoptera: Heliconidae | url = | journal = Transactions of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–566 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1860.tb00146.x[/tpl] Mimics are less likely to be found out when in low proportion to their model, a phenomenon known as negative frequency dependent selection which applies in most other forms of mimicry as well. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable in times and places where both the model and the mimic occur and where the model is more abundant than the mimic.Sterns & Hoekstra, Evolution: An Introduction 5th Edition, Pg. 464  This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry however, which is described next.
Examples:

====Müllerian====

Müllerian mimicry describes a situation where two or more species have very similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first Bates could not explain why this should be so; if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? The German naturalist Fritz Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: If two species were confused with one another by a common predator, individuals in both would be more likely to survive.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Müller | first1 = Fritz | year = 1878 | title = Ueber die Vortheile der Mimicry bei Schmetterlingen | url = | journal = Zoologischer Anzeiger | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 54–55 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Müller | first1 = F. | year = 1879 | title = Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies. (R. Meldola translation.) | url = | journal = Proclamations of the Entomological Society of London | volume = 1879 | issue = | pages = 20–29 [/tpl] This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived regarding species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear identity of mimic and model are also blurred. In cases where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers however it is more realistic to speak of each as comimics than of a distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge toward something intermediate between the two.Flannery, T. F. (2007) "Community ecology: Mimicry complexes". Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117280/community-ecology Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.[tpl]cite journal | author=Huheey, James E. | year = 1976 | title = Studies in warning coloration and mimicry VII — Evolutionary consequences of a Batesian–Müllerian spectrum: A model for Müllerian mimicry | journal = Evolution | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 86–93 | doi = 10.2307/2407675 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author= Benson, W.

Examples:

====Emsleyan / Mertensian====

Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry describes unusual cases where deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Emsley | first1 = M. G. | year = 1966 | title = The mimetic significance of Erythrolamprus aesculapii ocellatus Peters from Tobago | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 663–64 | doi = 10.2307/2406599 [/tpl] as a possible answer for the problem [tpl]which|date=July 2013[/tpl] of Coral Snake mimicry in the New World. It was elaborated on by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Mertens | first1 = R. |  year = 1956 | title = [tpl]lang|de|Das Problem der Mimikry bei Korallenschlangen[/tpl] | url = | journal = Zool. Jahrb. Syst | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 541–76 [/tpl] Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Hecht | first1 = M.

M. |  year = 1969 | title = Review of Mimicry in plants and animals by Wolfgang Wickler | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 243 | doi = 10.2307/2762 | last2 = Wickler | first2 = Wolfgang [/tpl]
This scenario is a little more difficult to understand, as in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g. bright colors in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal would rather profit from being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there is some other species that is harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator may learn to recognize its particular warning colors and avoid such animals. A deadly species will then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism, if this results in fewer attacks than camouflage would.
The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry),[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Jouventin | first1 = P. | last2 = Pasteur | first2 = G. | last3 = Cambefort | first3 = J. P. | year = 1977 | title = Observational  Learning of Baboons and Avoidance of Mimics: Exploratory Tests | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 214–218 | doi = 10.2307/2407558 [/tpl] is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic programming to be wary of certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, it has been shown that some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared Turquoise-browed Motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = S. M. | year = 1975 | title = Innate  Recognition of Coral Snake Pattern by a Possible Avian Predator | url = | journal = Science | volume = 187 | issue = 4178| pages = 759–760 | doi = 10.1126/science.187.4178.759 |bibcode = 1975Sci...187..759S | pmid=17795249[/tpl] Other colors with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides one alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Greene | first1 = H. W. | last2 = McDiarmid | first2 = R. W. | year = 1981 | title = Coral snake mimicry: Does it occur? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 213 | issue = 4513| pages = 1207–12 | doi = 10.1126/science.213.4513.1207 | pmid = 17744739 |bibcode = 1981Sci...213.1207G [/tpl]
Examples:

====Wasmannian====

Wasmannian mimicry refers to cases where the mimic resembles a model along with which it lives (inquiline) in a nest or colony. Most of the models here are social insects such as ants, termites, bees and wasps.Wasmann, E. 1894. Kritisches Verzeichniss der myrmecophilin und termitophilen Arthropoden. Felix Dames, Berlin xi + 231 pp.

====Mimetic weeds====

Vavilovian mimicry describes weeds which come to share characteristics with a domesticated plant through artificial selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Vavilov | first1 = N. I. | year = 1951 | title = The origin, variation, immunity and breeding of cultivated plants (translation by K. S. Chester) | url = | journal = Chronica Botanica | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 1–366 [/tpl] Selection against the weed may occur either by manually killing the weed, or by separating its seeds from those of the crop. The latter process, known as winnowing, can be done manually or by a machine.
Vavilovian mimicry presents an illustration of unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. While some cases of artificial selection go in the direction desired, such as selective breeding, this case presents the opposite characteristics. Weeders do not want to select weeds that look increasingly like the cultivated plant, yet there is no other option. One case is Echinochloa oryzoides, a species of grass which is found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields. The plant looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = S. | year = 1983 | title = Mimicry in Plants | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 257 | issue = 3| pages = 76–83 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0987-76 [/tpl] A similar problem in agriculture is pesticide resistance: farmers do not wish to select for weeds that have increasingly similar resistance to pesticides as the crop itself, yet that is the inevitable effect. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, as in the case of rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.
Vavilovian mimicry can be classified as defensive mimicry, in that the weed mimics a protected species. This bears strong similarity to Batesian mimicry in that the weed does not share the properties that give the model its protection, and both the model and the dupe (in this case people) are harmed by its presence. There are some key differences, though; in Batesian mimicry the model and signal receiver are enemies (the predator would eat the protected species if it could), whereas here the crop and its human growers are in a mutualistic relationship: the crop benefits from being dispersed and protected by people, despite being eaten by them. In fact, the crop's only "protection" relevant here is its usefulness to humans. Secondly, the weed is not eaten, but simply destroyed. The only motivation for killing the weed is its effect on crop yields. Finally, this type of mimicry does not occur in ecosystems unaltered by humans.

====Protective egg decoys====

Unlike the previously mentioned forms of mimicry, Gilbertian mimicry involves only two species. The potential host / prey drives away its parasite / predator by mimicking it, the reverse of host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It was coined by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare mimicry systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.L. E. Gilbert (1975) Ecological consequences of a coevolved mutualism between butterflies and plants. In L. E. Gilbert, P. H. Raven (eds. [tpl]Clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl]) Coevolution of Animal and Plants pp. 210–40. Austin and London, University of Texas Press. 
This form of protective mimicry occurs in the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins which deter herbivorous animals, however some Heliconius butterfly larvae have evolved enzymes which break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near each existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Additionally, most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs will hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies due to these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps.Campbell, N. A. (1996) Biology (4th edition), Chapter 50. Benjamin Cummings, New York. ISBN 0-8053-1957-3. This acts as a further defense of the plant against the caterpillars.
The use of eggs is not essential to this system, only the species composition and protective function. [tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] Many other forms of mimicry also involve eggs, such as cuckoo eggs mimicking those of their host (the reverse of this situation), or plants seeds (often those with an elaiosome) being dispersed by ants, who treat them as they would their own eggs.

====Protective mimicry within a species====

Browerian mimicry, named after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower,[tpl]cite book |last=Brower |first=L. P. |year=1970 |chapter=Plant poisons in a terrestrial food chain and implications for mimicry theory |editor-first=K. L. |editor-last=Chambers |title=Biochemical Coevolution |location=Corvallis, Oregon, USA |publisher=Oregon State Univ. |pages=69–82 |isbn= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Brower | first1 = L. P. | last2 = Van Brower | first2 = J. V. Z. | last3 = Corvino | first3 = J. M. | year = 1967 | title = Plant poisons in a terrestrial food chain | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 893–98 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.4.893 | pmid=5231352 | pmc=224631 | bibcode=1967PNAS...57..893B[/tpl] is a form of automimicry; where the model belongs to the same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the Monarch and the Queen from the danaine subfamily, who feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As the levels of toxin will vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals will be more toxic than others. The less palatable organisms will therefore be mimics of the more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected. This need not be the case however; in sexually dimorphic species one sex may be more of a threat than the other, which could mimic the protected sex. Evidence for this possibility is provided by the behavior of a monkey from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus Anaphe, but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Bigot | first1 = L. | last2 = Jouventin | first2 = P. | year = 1974 | title = [tpl]lang|fr|Quelques expériences de comestibilité de Lépidoptères gabonais faites avec le mandrill, le cercocèbe à joues grises et le garde-bœufs[/tpl] | url = | journal = Terre Vie | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 521–43 [/tpl]

===Aggressive===

Aggressive mimicry describes predators (or parasites) which share the same characteristics as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism which is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can be treated as a form of predator,Begon, M., Townsend, C., Harper, J. (1996) Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities (third edition) Blackwell Science, London host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.
The mimic may have a particular significance for duped prey.
