Orgasm (from Greek ὀργασμός orgasmos "excitement, swelling"; also sexual climax) is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure.[tpl]Cite book| publisher = Little, Brown | isbn = 0-316-54987-8| page = 366 | last = Masters | first = William H. | first2=Virginia E. last2=Johnson |author3=Reproductive Biology Research Foundation (U.S.) | title = Human Sexual Response | year= 1966[/tpl]See pages 133–135 for orgasm information, and page 76 for G-spot and vaginal nerve ending information.

They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations are expressed. The period after orgasm (known as a refractory period) is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin, as well as endorphins (or "endogenous morphine").[tpl]Cite journal|author=Exton MS, Krüger TH, Koch M, et al. |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287–94 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6[/tpl]

The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the central nervous system such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic ("bordering") areas of the brain.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Georgiadis JR, Reinders AA, Paans AM, Renken R, Kortekaas R |title=Men versus women on sexual brain function: prominent differences during tactile genital stimulation, but not during orgasm |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=3089–101 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19219848 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20733[/tpl] There are also a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, such as anorgasmia.

Orgasm in non-human animals has been studied significantly less than orgasm in humans, but research on the subject is ongoing.

==Definitions==

In a clinical context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, along with the characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth. This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region. However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Levine, R.J.|year=2004|title=An orgasm is... who defines what an orgasm is?|journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume=19|pages=101–107 |doi=10.1080/14681990410001641663[/tpl] At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal Clinical Psychology Review.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Mah K, Binik YM |title=The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=823–56 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11497209 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6[/tpl]
There is some debate whether certain types of sexual sensations should be accurately classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour.[tpl]Cite book| author =  Schwartz, Bob | title = The One Hour Orgasm: A New Approach to Achieving Maximum Sexual Pleasure | publisher = Breakthru Publishing |date=May 1992 | isbn = 0-942540-07-7[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm.[tpl]cite web|author=Kenneth Mah, Yitzchak M. Binik|title=Do all orgasms feel alike? Evaluating a two-dimensional model of the orgasm experience across gender and sexual context|work=The Journal of Sex Research|date=May 2002|accessdate=27 August 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91475118.html[/tpl] In these and similar cases, the sensations experienced are subjective and do not necessarily involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.

==Achieving orgasm==

===In general===

Orgasms can be achieved by a variety of activities. In men, sufficient sexual stimulation of the penis can be achieved during vaginal or anal intercourse, oral sex (fellatio), non-penetrative sex or masturbation. In women, sufficient sexual stimulation can be achieved during vaginal intercourse, oral sex (cunnilingus), non-penetrative sex or masturbation. Orgasm may also be achieved by the use of a sex toy, such as a sensual vibrator or an erotic electrostimulation. It can additionally be achieved by stimulation of the nipples, uterus, or other erogenous zones, though this is rarer.Otto, Herbert A. (1988) New Orgasm Options: Expanding Sexual Pleasure.[tpl]cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 0-8018-9396-8|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&pg=PA108&dq=anal+orgasm#v=onepage&q=anal%20orgasm&f=false|author =Barry R.

In addition to physical stimulation, orgasm can be achieved from psychological arousal alone, such as during dreaming (nocturnal emission for males or females)[tpl]cite journal|title=Functional MRI of the brain during orgasm in women|journal=Annual review of sex research|volume= 16|pages= 62–86|year=2005 |pmid= 16913288|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/302148/Functional-MRI-of-the-Brain-During-Orgasm-In-Women |author=Komisaruk, B., & Whipple, B.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Tracee|last=Cornforth|title=The Clitoral Truth.

Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had spinal cord injury (SCI). Although SCI very often leads to loss of certain sensations and altered self-perception, a person with this disturbance is not deprived of sexual feelings such as sexual arousal and erotic desires.
A person may experience multiple orgasms,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Dunn ME, Trost JE |title=Male multiple orgasms: a descriptive study |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=377–87 |date=October 1989 |pmid=2818169 |doi=10.1007/BF01541970[/tpl] or an involuntary orgasm such as in the case of forced sexual contact (during rape or sexual assault). An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of shame caused by internalization of victim-blaming attitudes.http://www.anugraha.info/Traningdownload.php?file=20111213044253Trauma.pdf&arg3=resource&op=center D.

Scientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which "appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm," but "the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. In one controlled study by Vance and Wagner (1976), independent raters could not differentiate written descriptions of male versus female orgasm experiences".

===In males===

====General variabilities====

In men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the penis. This is usually accompanied by ejaculation, but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a "dry orgasm") or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm (which may be a case of delayed ejaculation, a nocturnal emission or a case of anorgasmic ejaculation). Men may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the prostate (see below).[tpl]cite web|title= The male hot spot – Massaging the prostate|publisher=Go Ask Alice!|date=27 September 2002|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate[/tpl]

====Two-stage model====

The traditional view of male orgasm is that there are two stages: emission following orgasm, almost instantly followed by a refractory period. In 1966, Masters and Johnson published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation.[tpl]cite web| title=Masters and Johnson | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html | publisher=The Discovery Channel | accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060518002107/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html  |archivedate = 18 May 2006[/tpl] Their work included women and men, and, unlike Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953,[tpl]cite book|title=Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society|isbn = 0-495-00742-0|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|page=338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&pg=PA338&dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&f=false|author=Margaret L. Andersen, Howard Francis Taylor[/tpl] tried to determine the physiological stages before and after orgasm.
Masters and Johnson argued that, in the first stage, "accessory organs contract and the male can feel the ejaculation coming; two to three seconds later the ejaculation occurs, which the man cannot constrain, delay, or in any way control" and that, in the second stage, "the male feels pleasurable contractions during ejaculation, reporting greater pleasure tied to a greater volume of ejaculate". They reported that, unlike females, "for the man the resolution phase includes a superimposed refractory period" and added that "many males below the age of 30, but relatively few thereafter, have the ability to ejaculate frequently and are subject to only very short refractory periods during the resolution phase". Masters and Johnson equated male orgasm and ejaculation and maintained the necessity for a refractory period between orgasms.

====Subsequent and multiple orgasms====

In contrast to the two-stage model of male orgasm, Kahn (1939) equalized orgasm and ejaculation and stated that several orgasms can occur and that "indeed, some men are capable of following orgasm up with a third and a fourth" orgasm. Though it is rare for men to achieve multiple orgasms, Kahn's assertion that some men are capable of achieving them is supported by men who have reported having multiple, consecutive orgasms, particularly without ejaculation. Males who experience dry orgasms can often produce multiple orgasms, as the refractory period is reduced.
An increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period.Panksepp, Jaak (2004). Textbook of biological psychiatry. Wiley-IEEE. p. 129. Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin,[tpl]Cite news | last1 = Haake| first1 = P. | last2 = Exton| first2 =  M.S. | last3 = Haverkamp| first3 = J. | last4 = Krämer| first4 = M. | last5 = Leygraf| first5 = N. | last6 = Hartmann| first6 = U. | last7 = Schedlowski| first7 = M. | last8 = Krueger| first8 = T.H.C. | date=April 2002 | title = Absence of orgasm-induced prolactin secretion in a healthy multi-orgasmic male subject | periodical = International Journal of Impotence Research | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–135 | url = http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v14/n2/full/3900823a.html | doi = 10.1038/sj/ijir/3900823 | accessdate = 2007-07-30 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]  which represses dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal. Because of this, there is currently an experimental interest in drugs which inhibit prolactin, such as cabergoline (also known as Cabeser or Dostinex). Anecdotal reports on cabergoline suggest it may be able to eliminate the refractory period altogether, allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession. At least one scientific study supports these claims,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, et al. |title=Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males |journal=The Journal of Endocrinology |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14656205 |doi=10.1677/joe.0.1790357[/tpl] although cabergoline is a hormone-altering drug and has many potential side effects. It has not been approved for treating sexual dysfunction.
Another possible reason for the lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at Rutgers University in 1995. During the study, six fully ejaculatory orgasms were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent refractory period.[tpl]Cite journal| first=B. | last=Whipple |author2=B. Myers|author3=B.

Haake et al. observed a single male individual producing multiple orgasms without elevated prolactin response.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Haake P, Exton MS, Haverkamp J, et al. |title=Absence of orgasm-induced prolactin secretion in a healthy multi-orgasmic male subject |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=133–5 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11979330 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900823[/tpl]
A number of books have described various techniques which they assert will allow men to achieve multiple orgasms. Most multi-orgasmic men (and their partners) report that refraining from ejaculation results in a far more energetic post-orgasm state.Havelock Ellis Studies in the Psychology of Sex, vol. vi, p. 552, F. A. Davis Co., 1910, Kindle Edition 2008 ISBN B0016PEMOS One technique for refraining from ejaculation is to put pressure on the perineum, about halfway between the scrotum and the anus, just before ejaculating to prevent ejaculation. This can, however, lead to retrograde ejaculation, i.e., redirecting semen into the urinary bladder rather than through the urethra to the outside. It may also cause long term damage due to the pressure put on the nerves and blood vessels in the perineum, akin to that reported by some males who ride bicycles with narrow seats for extended periods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/upd-06-30-04-2.html | title=NIOSH Update:Bicycle Saddles Without Protruding Noses Reduce Pressure Associated With Erectile Dysfunction Measure | accessdate=2 April 2011 |date=30 June 2004 | last=Blosser | first=Fred  | quote=In a 2002 NIOSH report, perineal pressure was associated with genital numbness in a group of bicycle-patrol police officers, and with a decrease in the amount of time that the officers had erections during sleep..[/tpl] Men who have had prostate or bladder surgery, for whatever reason, may also experience dry orgasms because of retrograde ejaculation.

===In females===

====General orgasmic factors and variabilities====

In women, the most common way to achieve orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the clitoris; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to achieve orgasm,[tpl]cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|work=WebMD|accessdate=18 August 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archivedate=2009-01-13[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Psychiatry: Diagnosis & therapy.

====Clitoral and vaginal categories====

Discussions of female orgasm are complicated by orgasms in women typically being divided into two categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm.[tpl]cite book|title=Sex and Society, Volume 2|isbn =0761479074|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2009|page=590|accessdate=17 August 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&pg=PA590&lpg=PA590&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation[/tpl] In 1973, Irving Singer theorized that there are three types of female orgasms; he categorized these as vulval, uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, "these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies". In 1982, Ladas, Whipple and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation).[tpl]cite book|title=Human Sexuality: Biological, Psychological, and Cultural Perspectives|isbn = 0-7890-2672-4|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2009|page=276|accessdate=11 February 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lDQoIhOwwdYC&pg=PA276&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false|author=Anne Bolin, Patricia Whelehan[/tpl] In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed cervix stimulation as being able to cause a fourth type of female orgasm.
Female orgasms by means other than clitoral or vaginal/G-spot stimulation are less prevalent in scientific literature and most scientists contend that no distinction should be made between "types" of female orgasm. This distinction began with Sigmund Freud, who postulated the concept of "vaginal orgasm" as separate from clitoral orgasm. In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, the consequences of this theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile-vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction.[tpl]cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =Cengage Learning|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = March 15, 2014| isbn = 0495095109 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U7YkU4f6J4iI2gX864HYCQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =1-59213-151-4|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37–38|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false|author=Janice M.

The first major national surveys of sexual behavior were the Kinsey Reports. Alfred Kinsey was the first researcher to harshly criticize Freud's ideas about female sexuality and orgasm when, through his interviews with thousands of women, Kinsey found that most of the women he surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms. He "criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women" and "viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response" and the vagina as "relatively unimportant" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that "few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated". He "concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration is mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation".
Masters and Johnson's research into the female sexual response cycle, as well as Shere Hite's, generally supported Kinsey's findings about female orgasm.[ref][tpl]cite book | title = Sex and Gender | publisher =Cambridge University Press|year= 2002|pages=85–88| accessdate =25 August 2012| isbn = 0521635330|url =http://books.google.com/?id=BJ1V9r_J0sUC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false | author= John Archer, Barbara Lloyd[/tpl]

====Clitoral and vaginal relationships====

Accounts that the vagina is capable of producing orgasms continue to be subject to debate because, in addition to the vagina's low concentration of nerve endings, the G-spot's location is inconsistent and appears to be nonexistent in some women, and may be an extension of another structure (such as the Skene's gland or the clitoris, which is a part of the Skene's gland).[tpl]cite book|authors=Richard Balon, Robert Taylor Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders |publisher= American Psychiatric Pub|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|page=258|isbn=1585629057|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC&pg=PA258[/tpl] In a January 2012 The Journal of Sexual Medicine review examining years of research into the existence of the G-spot, scholars stated that "reports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth".
Possible explanations for the G-spot were examined by Masters and Johnson, who were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing that the majority of their female subjects could only have clitoral orgasms, they found that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as Elisabeth Lloyd.
Australian urologist Helen O'Connell's 2005 research additionally indicates a connection between orgasms experienced vaginally and the clitoris, suggesting that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina and that therefore clitoral and vaginal orgasms are of the same origin. Some studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse,[tpl]cite book|authors=David M. Buss, Cindy M. Meston|title=Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between)|publisher= Macmillan|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|pages=35–36|isbn=1429955228|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&pg=PA35[/tpl] but O'Connell suggests that the clitoris's interconnected relationship with the vagina is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot. Having used MRI technology which enabled her to note a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the "clitoral bulbs" and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina, she stated that the vaginal wall is the clitoris; that lifting the skin off the vagina on the side walls reveals the bulbs of the clitoris—triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue. O'Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of cadavers and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks. They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones, and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.
French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to that of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D sonography of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina, arguing that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible.See here for the 2009 King's College London's findings on the G-spot and page 145 for ultrasound/physiological material with regard to the G-spot.

Buisson and Foldès suggested "that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction".
Supporting a distinct G-spot is a study by Rutgers University, published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be – when several women stimulated themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine. "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. "It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It's a region, it's a convergence of many different structures." Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledged a series of essays published in March 2012 in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women.

====Other factors and research====

Regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, known as anorgasmia, is significantly more common in women than in men (see below). In addition to sexual dysfunction being a cause for women's inability to reach orgasm, or the amount of time for sexual arousal needed to reach orgasm being variable and longer in women than in men, other factors include a lack of communication between sexual partners about what is needed for the woman to reach orgasm, feelings of sexual inadequacy in either partners, a focus on only penetration (vaginal or otherwise), and men generalizing women's trigger for orgasm based on their own sexual experiences with other women.Dr. Gail Saltz and Dr. Drew Pinsky interview.

Masters and Johnson found that men took about four minutes to reach orgasm with their partners. Women took about 10–20 minutes to reach orgasm with their partners, but four minutes to reach orgasm when they masturbated. Scholars state "many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse sex" and that "even the word foreplay suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'... ...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have faked an orgasm". Ian Kerner stated, "It's a myth that using the penis is the main way to pleasure a woman." He cites research concluding that women reach orgasm about 25% of the time with intercourse, compared with 81% of the time during oral sex.[tpl]cite web |last=Rob|first=Baedeker |title=Sex: Fact and Fiction.

In the first large-scale empirical study worldwide to link specific practices with orgasm, reported in the Journal of Sex Research in 2006, demographic and sexual history variables were comparatively weakly associated with orgasm. Data was analyzed from the Australian Study of Health and Relationships, a national telephone survey of sexual behavior and attitudes and sexual health knowledge carried out in 2001–2002, with a representative sample of 19,307 Australians aged 16 to 59. Practices included "vaginal intercourse alone (12%), vaginal + manual stimulation of the man's and/or woman's genitals (49%), and vaginal intercourse + manual + oral (32%)" and the "encounters may also have included other practices. Men had an orgasm in 95% of encounters and women in 69%. Generally, the more practices engaged in, the higher a woman's chance of having an orgasm. Women were more likely to reach orgasm in encounters including cunnilingus".[tpl]cite journal|title=Sexual practices at last heterosexual encounter and occurrence of orgasm in a national survey|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=August 2006 |pmid=17599244 |doi=10.1080/00224490609552320 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=217–26 |author=Richters J, Visser R, Rissel C, Smith A.[/tpl]
Other studies suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal androgens are more likely to experience orgasm during vaginal intercourse than other women.

===Anal and nipple stimulation in males and females===

In both sexes, pleasure can be derived from the nerve endings around the anus and the anus itself, such as during anal sex. It is possible for men to achieve an orgasm through prostate stimulation alone. The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male homologue (variation) to the Skene's glands (which are believed to be connected to the female G-spot).[tpl]cite web|first=Nicola|last=Jones|title=Bigger is better when it comes to the G spot|publisher=New Scientist|date=July 2002|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2495-bigger-is-better-when-it-comes-to-the-g-spot.html[/tpl] Prostate stimulation can produce a "deeper" orgasm, described by some men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.[tpl]cite book|authors=Ellen Lewin, William Leap, William L.

For women, other than nerve endings found within the anus and rectum, anal pleasure may be achieved through indirect stimulation of the clitoral "legs" — extensions of the clitoris that flank the urethra, urethral sponge, and vagina, and extend back toward the pubis. Indirect stimulation of the clitoris through anal penetration may be caused by the shared sensory nerves; especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The G-spot area, considered to be interconnected with the clitoris, may also be accessible through anal penetration; besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration is made possible because of the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity, allowing for general indirect stimulation.[tpl]cite book |first=Victoria|last=Zdrok| title = The Anatomy of Pleasure | publisher =Infinity Publishing|year = 2004|pages=100–102|accessdate = July 5, 2013| isbn = 0741422484 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=Cx62zwSwbcsC&pg=PA100&dq=.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XIzXUbWJF4XK9gTu8oCoDA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl]See page 3 for women preferring anal to vaginal, and page 15 for reaching orgasm through indirect stimulation of the G-spot.

The aforementioned orgasms are sometimes referred to as anal orgasms,[tpl]cite book|author =Marlene Wasserman|title=Pillowbook: creating a sensual lifestyle|isbn = 1-77020-009-6|publisher=Oshun|year=2007|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BC74fx9DrqoC&pg=PA95&dq=anal+orgasm#v=onepage&q=anal%20orgasm&f=false[/tpl] but sexologists and sex educators generally believe that orgasms derived from anal penetration are the result of the anus's proximity to the clitoris or G-spot in women, and the prostate in men, rather than orgasms originating from the anus itself.

On rare occasions, stimulation of the breast area during sexual intercourse or foreplay, or solely having the breasts fondled, creates mild to intense orgasms, sometimes referred to as a breast orgasm or nipple orgasm, in some women. According to one study, by Herbert Otto, which questioned 213 women, 29% of them had experienced an orgasm of this kind at one time or another. Research suggests that the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain."[tpl]Cite book|last=Levay|first=Simon|author2=Sharon McBride Valente|title=Human Sexuality, Second Edition|publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc.|date=15 November 2005|isbn =978-0-87893-465-2[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] An orgasm is believed to occur in part because of the hormone oxytocin, which is produced in the body during sexual excitement and arousal. It has also been shown that oxytocin is produced when a man or woman's nipples are stimulated and become erect.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Levin R, Meston C |title=Nipple/Breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=450–4 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16681470 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x[/tpl]
A study published in the July 2011 The Journal of Sexual Medicine was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain, and concluded that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. "Four major nerves bring signals from women's genitals to their brains," said researcher Barry Komisaruk of Rutgers University. "The pudendal nerve connects the clitoris, the pelvic nerve carries signals from the vagina, the hypogastric nerve connects with the cervix and uterus, and the vagus nerve travels from the cervix and uterus without passing through the spinal cord (making it possible for some women to achieve orgasm even though they have had complete spinal cord injuries)." Komisaruk cited one reason for this possibility to be oxytocin, which is also released during labor and triggers uterus contractions. Nipple stimulation triggers uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain. Komisaruk also relayed, however, that preliminary data suggests that nipple nerves may directly link up with the relevant parts of the brain without uterine mediation, acknowledging the men in his study who showed the same pattern of nipple stimulation activating genital brain regions.

==Medical aspects==

===Physiological responses===

Masters and Johnson were some of the first researchers to study the sexual response cycle in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They described a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals.
In the 1970s, Helen Singer Kaplan added the category of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness and the failure of communication can interfere with desire and orgasm.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kaplan HS |title=Hypoactive sexual desire |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |year=1977 |pmid=864734|doi=10.1080/00926237708405343[/tpl] In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression.[tpl]Cite news| first=Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 |  url =http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work =Scientific American | accessdate =16 July 2009 [/tpl] In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled by the rest of the orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested that it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Basson R |title=The female sexual response: a different model |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=51–65 |year=2000 |pmid=10693116 |doi=10.1080/009262300278641[/tpl]

====Males====

As a man nears orgasm during stimulation of the penis, he feels an intense and highly pleasurable pulsating sensation of neuromuscular euphoria. These pulses begin with a throb of the anal sphincter and travel to the tip of the penis. They eventually increase in speed and intensity as the orgasm approaches, until a final "plateau" (the orgasmic) pleasure sustained for several seconds. The length of a man's orgasm has been estimated at 10–15 seconds on average, though it is possible for them to last up to 30 seconds.
During orgasm, a human male experiences rapid, rhythmic contractions of the anal sphincter, the prostate, and the muscles of the penis. The sperm are transmitted up the vas deferens from the testicles, into the prostate gland as well as through the seminal vesicles to produce what is known as semen. The prostate produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. The process takes from three to ten seconds, and produces a pleasurable feeling. Ejaculation may continue for a few seconds after the euphoric sensation gradually tapers off. It is believed that the exact feeling of "orgasm" varies from one man to another. Normally, as a man ages, the amount of semen he ejaculates diminishes, and so does the duration of orgasms. This does not normally affect the intensity of pleasure, but merely shortens the duration. After ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs, during which a man cannot achieve another orgasm. This can last anywhere from less than a minute to several hours or days, depending on age and other individual factors.

====Females====

A woman's orgasm may last slightly longer or much longer than a man's.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Roy J.|author2=Gorm Wagner|title=Orgasm in women in the laboratory—quantitative studies on duration, intensity, latency, and vaginal blood flow|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=1985|page=439|volume=14|issue=5|doi=10.1007/BF01542004|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01542004|accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title = Women fall into 'trance' during orgasm |work=The Times  | date = 20 June 2005| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article535521.ece|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715222511/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article535521.ece|archivedate=15 July 2011|accessdate =6 August 2012| location=London[/tpl] Women's orgasms have been estimated to last, on average, approximately 20 seconds, and to consist of a series of muscular contractions in the pelvic area that includes the vagina, the uterus, and the anus. For some women, on some occasions, these contractions begin soon after the woman reports that the orgasm has started and continue at intervals of about one second with initially increasing, and then reducing, intensity. In some instances, the series of regular contractions is followed by a few additional contractions or shudders at irregular intervals. In other cases, the woman reports having an orgasm, but no pelvic contractions are measured at all.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Bohlen|first=Joseph G.|author2=James P.

Women's orgasms are preceded by erection of the clitoris and moistening of the opening of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans moves inward under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.[tpl]cite web| title = Anatomic and physiologic changes during female sexual response | work = Clinical Proceedings | publisher = Association of Reproductive Health Professionals | url = http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080708005232/http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archivedate = 2008-07-08 | accessdate =1 February 2007 [/tpl]
Elsewhere in the body, myofibroblasts of the nipple-areolar complex contract, causing erection of the nipples and contraction of the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum at the start of orgasm.[tpl]cite journal|journal= Sexual and Relationship Therapy |volume= 21 |issue= 1 |pages=  237–249| url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/csmt/2006/00000021/00000002/art00011 | title=The Breast/Nipple/Areola Complex and Human Sexuality | accessdate=2 April 2011 |date=2 May 2006 | publisher = Routledge | last=Levin | first=Roy | quote=Areola corrugation immediately after orgasm physically signals that orgasm has occurred | doi=10.1080/14681990600674674[/tpl] A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina, anus, and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most women find these contractions very pleasurable.
Researchers from the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands correlated the sensation of orgasm with muscular contractions occurring at a frequency of 8–13 Hz centered in the pelvis and measured in the anus. They argue that the presence of this particular frequency of contractions can distinguish between voluntary contraction of these muscles and spontaneous involuntary contractions, and appears to more accurately correlate with orgasm as opposed to other metrics like heart rate that only measure excitation. They assert that they have identified "the first objective and quantitative measure that has a strong correspondence with the subjective experience that orgasm ultimately is" and state that the measure of contractions that occur at a frequency of 8–13 Hz is specific to orgasm. They found that using this metric they could distinguish from rest, voluntary muscular contractions, and even unsuccessful orgasm attempts.[tpl]Cite journal|author=van Netten JJ, Georgiadis JR, Nieuwenburg A, Kortekaas R |title=8–13 Hz fluctuations in rectal pressure are an objective marker of clitorally-induced orgasm in women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=279–85 |date=April 2008 |pmid=17186125 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9112-9[/tpl]
Since ancient times in Western Europe, women could be medically diagnosed with a disorder called female hysteria, the symptoms of which included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and "a tendency to cause trouble".[tpl]cite book |author=Maines, Rachel P. |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |isbn=0-8018-6646-4[/tpl] Women considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo "pelvic massage" — stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced "hysterical paroxysm" (i.e., orgasm). Paroxysm was regarded as a medical treatment, and not a sexual release. The disorder has ceased to be recognized as a medical condition since the 1920s.

===Brain===

There have been very few studies correlating orgasm and brain activity in real time, owing to cultural barriers and technical difficulties. However a series of studies conducted by Gert Holstege and his colleagues at the University of Groningen have established physiological characteristics which are unique to orgasm, including brain activity, as well as variation in the responses between men and women.
One study examined 12 healthy women using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. "Differences were reported on the brain changes associated with men and women during stimulation. However, the same changes in brain activity were observed in both sexes in which the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear and anxiety shut down. Regarding these changes, Holstege said, in an interview with The Times, "What this means is that deactivation, letting go of all fear and anxiety, might be the most important thing, even necessary, to have an orgasm."[tpl]Cite news| first=Mark | last=Henderson | title=Women fall into 'trance' during orgasm | date=20 June 2005 |  url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1964119.ece |work=The Times|accessdate =8 December 2011 | location=London[/tpl]
While stroking the clitoris, the parts of the female brain responsible for processing fear, anxiety and behavioral control start to relax and reduce in activity. This reaches a peak at orgasm when the female brain's emotion centers are effectively closed down to produce an almost trance-like state. Holstege is quoted as saying, at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development: "At the moment of orgasm, women do not have any emotional feelings."[tpl]Cite news| first= Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 |  url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work =Scientific American | accessdate =7 July 2009 [/tpl]
Initial reports indicated that it was difficult to observe the effects of orgasm on men using PET scan, because the duration of male orgasm was shorter. However, a subsequent report by Rudie Kortekaas, et al. stated, "Gender commonalities were most evident during orgasm... From these results, we conclude that during the sexual act, differential brain responses across genders are principally related to the stimulatory (plateau) phase and not to the orgasmic phase itself."
Research has shown that like in women, the emotional centers of a man's brain also deactivate during orgasm, but to a lesser extent than in women. Brain scans on both sexes have shown that the pleasure centers of a man's brain show more intense activity than in women during orgasm.The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain: The Neuroscience of How, When, Why, and Who we love, Judith Horstman (2011)
Human brain wave patterns show distinct changes during orgasm, which indicate the importance of the limbic system in the orgasmic response. Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain.
EEG tracings from volunteers during orgasm were first obtained by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954.[tpl]cite journal|year=1954 |title= Studies on EEG and sex function orgasm |journal=Diseases of the nervous system|volume=15|issue=7|pages=218–20|last1= Mosovich |first1=A.|last2= Tallaferro |first2=A.

Further studies in this direction were carried out by Sem-Jacobsen (1968), Heath (1972), Cohen et al (1976),[tpl]cite journal|date=May 1976|title=Electroencephalographic laterality changes during human sexual orgasm|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|publisher=Springer Netherlands|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01541370|quote=Left and right parietal EEGs were recorded while seven subjects experienced sexual climax through self-stimulation.|pmid=952604|doi=10.1007/BF01541370 |last1=Cohen|first1=Harvey D.|last2=Rosen|first2=Raymond C.|last3=Goldstein|first3=Leonide|pages=189–99[/tpl] and others. Sarrel et al reported a similar observation in 1977. These reports continue to be cited.[ref]As examples, take:

===Health===

====General====

Orgasm, and sexual activity as a whole, are physical activities that can require exertion of many major bodily systems. A 1997 study in the BMJ based upon 918 men age 45–59 found that after a ten-year follow-up, men who had fewer orgasms were twice as likely to die of any cause as those having two or more orgasms a week.Sex and Death, Are They Related?[tpl]Verify source|need some more bibliographic info|date=November 2009[/tpl] A follow-up in 2001 which focused more specifically on cardiovascular health found that having sex three or more times a week was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of heart attack or stroke. (Note that as a rule, correlation does not imply causation.)
There is some research suggesting that greater resting heart rate variability is associated with orgasms through penile-vaginal intercourse without additional simultaneous clitoral stimulation.

====Dysfunction and satisfaction====

The inability to have orgasm is called anorgasmia, ejaculatory anhedonia, or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, he is said to have sexual anhedonia. Difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation is significantly more common in women than in men,[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 18350761 | volume=77 | issue=5 | title=Diagnosis and treatment of female sexual dysfunction | date=March 2008 | pages=635–42 | author=Frank JE, Mistretta P, Will J | journal = American family physician|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2008/0301/p635.html[/tpl] though sexual dysfunction is common for both women (43%) and men (31%), and is associated with age and educational attainment.
About 15% of women report difficulties with orgasm, 10% have never climaxed, and 40–50% have either complained about sexual dissatisfaction or experienced difficulty becoming sexually aroused at some point in their lives.[tpl]cite web|first=Robert|last=Birch |title=Did you orgasm?|publisher=Sexualhealth.com|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://www.sexualhealth.com/article/read/women-sexual-health/orgasm/486/|archivedate=16 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716044630/http://www.sexualhealth.com/article/read/women-sexual-health/orgasm/486/[/tpl] A 1994 study by Laumann et al. found that 75% of men and 29% of women always have orgasms with their partner.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States |journal=University of Chicago Press (Also reported in the companion volume, Michael et al, Sex in America: A Definitive Survey.) |year=1994 |pmid= |accessdate=3 January 2012|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/resources/FAQ.html#orgasm |author=Laumann, E., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., and Michaels [/tpl] Women are much more likely to be nearly always or always orgasmic when alone than with a partner. However, in a 1996 study by Davis et al., reported in the Journal of Sex Research, 62% of women in a partnered relationship said they were satisfied with the frequency/consistency of their orgasms. Additionally, many women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.[tpl]cite journal |title=Predicting sexual satisfaction in women: Implications for counselor education and training |journal=Journal of Counseling & Development|volume= 82(2) |pages=158–166 |year=2004 |pmid= |accessdate=4 March 2011|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/resources/FAQ.html#orgasm[/tpl]
Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Female showed that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.Kinsey, A.; Pomeroy, W.; Martin, C., & Gebhard, P. Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), ISBN 978-0-253-33411-4. Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do. Like Kinsey, scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) found that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do, and that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking. In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009), published in the Journal of Sex Research, found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.[tpl]cite journal|ref=harv|title=Sexual Desire, Communication, Satisfaction, and Preferences of Men and Women in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationships|first1=Diane|last1=Holmberg|first2=Karen Lyndsay|last2=Blair|pages=57–66|doi=10.1080/00224490802645294|issn=1559-8519|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=46|issue=1|year=2009|publisher=Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality|format=PDF|url=http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf[/tpl]
Specifically in relation to simultaneous orgasm and similar practices, many sexologists claim that the problem of premature ejaculation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/IES/italy.html |title=The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Italy |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl] is closely related to the idea encouraged by a scientific approach in early 20th century when mutual orgasm was overly emphasized as an objective and a sign of true sexual satisfaction in intimate relationships.
If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be attributed to an inability to relax, or "let go." It seems to be closely associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction. Often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, in his 1927 book Die Funktion des Orgasmus (published in English in 1980 as Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis) was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined neurosis in terms of blocks to having orgastic potency. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.
Menopause may involve loss of hormones supporting sexuality and genital functionality. Vaginal and clitoral atrophy and dryness affects up to 50%–60% of postmenopausal women.[tpl]cite journal |pmid = 10022110 | volume=281 | issue=6 | title=Sexual dysfunction in the United States: prevalence and predictors | date=February 1999 | journal=JAMA | pages=537–44 | author=Laumann EO, Paik A, Rosen RC |doi = 10.1001/jama.281.6.537[/tpl]  Testosterone levels in men fall as they age.

==Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions==

===Selective pressure and mating===

Because male orgasms that expel sperm from the body into the vagina during sexual intercourse may result in conception, researchers have several hypotheses about the role, if any, of the female orgasm in the reproductive and therefore evolutionary process. Wallen K and Lloyd EA stated, "In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity."
Desmond Morris suggested in his 1967 popular-science book The Naked Ape that the female orgasm evolved to encourage physical intimacy with a male partner and help reinforce the pair bond. Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in Darwinian evolution by leading the female to select mates who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. If males were motivated by, and taken to the point of, orgasm in the same way as females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.

===Fertility===

There are theories that the female orgasm might increase fertility. For example, the 30% reduction in size of the vagina could help clench onto the penis (much like, or perhaps caused by, the pubococcygeus muscles), which would make it more stimulating for the male (thus ensuring faster or more voluminous ejaculation). The British biologists Baker and Bellis have suggested that the female orgasm may have an "upsuck" action (similar to the esophagus' ability to swallow when upside down), resulting in the retaining of favorable sperm and making conception more likely.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1272 |last=Baker |first=R.

Desmond Morris proposed that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, sometimes called the "Poleax Hypothesis" or the "Knockout Hypothesis," is now considered highly doubtful. A 1994 Learning Channel documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her pelvic muscles contracted and her cervix repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the vaginal fornix, as if to ensure that sperm would proceed by the external orifice of the uterus, making conception more likely.[tpl]cite video | people=Desmond Morris (host) |date=1994 | title=The Human Animal | medium=TV | publisher=The Learning Channel[/tpl] Elisabeth Lloyd has criticized the accompanying narration of this film clip which describes it as an example of "sperm upsuck."[tpl]cite web|url=http://mypage.iu.edu/%7Eealloyd/Reviews.html#IsntItObviousThat |title=Reviews |publisher=Mypage.iu.edu |accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl]
Evolutionary psychologists Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, in their discussion of the female orgasm, address how long it takes for females to achieve orgasm compared to males, and females' ability to have multiple orgasms, hypothesizing how especially well suited to multiple partners and insemination this is. They quote primate sexuality specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm "seems far-fetched" because "females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale promiscuous mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units." On the other hand, Dixson states that "Gibbons, which are primarily monogamous, do not exhibit obvious signs of female orgasm."[tpl]cite book |title=Sex at Dawn |isbn=0062207946 |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2012 |page=263 |last=Ryan |first=Christopher |first2=Cacilda |last2=Jethá[/tpl]
The female promiscuity explanation of female sexuality was echoed at least 12 years earlier by other evolutionary biologists, and there is increasing scientific awareness of the female proceptive phase.[tpl]cite news |last=Browne |first=Anthony |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver |title=Women are promiscuous, naturally |department=UK News |date=2 September 2000 |newspaper=The Guardian[/tpl] Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, he appears to have doubts, when he writes, "One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition." Ryan and Jethá use this as evidence for their theory that partible paternity and promiscuity were common for early modern humans.

===Adaptive or vestigial female orgasm===

The clitoris is homologous to the penis; that is, they both develop from the same embryonic structure. While researchers such as Geoffrey Miller, Helen Fisher, Meredith Small and Sarah Blaffer Hrdy "have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution," others, such as Donald Symons and Stephen Jay Gould, have asserted that the clitoris is vestigial or nonadaptive, and that the female orgasm serves no particular evolutionary function. However, Gould acknowledged that "most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site" and stated that his nonadaptive belief "has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense". He explained that although he accepts that "clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys," "all these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a spandrel or an adaptation". He said that the "male biologists who fretted over adaptionist questions simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit" due to their Darwinian, summum bonum beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.
Proponents of the nonadaptive hypothesis, such as Elisabeth Lloyd, refer to the relative difficulty of achieving female orgasm through vaginal sex, the limited evidence for increased fertility after orgasm and the lack of statistical correlation between the capacity of a woman to orgasm and the likelihood that she will engage in intercourse.[tpl]cite journal | first = Meredith L. | last = Chivers | first2 = Michael W. | last2 = Wiedermana | title = A Narrow (But Thorough) Examination of the Evolutionary Significance of Female Orgasm | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–105 | year= 2007 | pmid = | doi =  10.1080/00224490709336797 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162790350.html[/tpl] "Lloyd is by no means against evolutionary psychology. Quite the opposite; in her methods and in her writing, she advocates and demonstrates a commitment to the careful application of evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior," stated Meredith L. Chivers. She added that Lloyd "meticulously considers the theoretical and empirical bases for each account and ultimately concludes that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm" and that Lloyd instead "views female orgasm as an ontogenetic leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness, just as males have nipples that serve no fitness-related function".
A 2005 twin study found that one in three women reported never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed. This variation in ability to orgasm, generally thought to be psychosocial, was found to be 34% to 45% genetic. The study, examining 4000 women, was published in Biology Letters, a Royal Society journal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4616899.stm |title=Female orgasm is 'down to genes[tpl]'-[/tpl] |work=BBC |date=7 June 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Kate M |last2=Cherkas |first2=Lynn F |last3=Spector |first3=Tim D |title=Genetic influences on variation in female orgasmic function: a twin study |journal=Biology Letters |type=Abstract |date=22 September 2005 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=260–263 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0308[/tpl] Elisabeth Lloyd has cited this as evidence for the notion that female orgasm is not adaptive.
Miller, Hrdy, Helen O'Connell and Natalie Angier have criticized the "female orgasm is vestigial" hypothesis as understating and devaluing the psychosocial value of the female orgasm. Hrdy stated that the hypothesis smacks of sexism.[tpl]cite news| author=Christopher Shea| title=Orgasmic science|work=The Boston Globe| date=24 April 2005[/tpl]  O'Connell said, "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive." O'Connell used MRI technology to define the true size and shape of the clitoris, suggesting that it extends into the anterior wall of the vagina (see above).
O'Connell describes typical textbook descriptions of the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, saying that the work of Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the early 19th century provides a most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy. She argues that the bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm. By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is why it has been "historically ignored," mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.[tpl]cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=21 October 2002|accessdate=21 December 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=29 June 2011|archiveurl=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html[/tpl]

===Other theories===

Brody Costa et al. suggest that women's vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length.[tpl]cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with vaginal (not clitoral) sex education, focusing mental attention on vaginal sensations, intercourse duration, and a preference for a longer penis|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|pages=2774–81 |date=August 2010 |pmid=19732304 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01469.x |volume=7 |issue=8 |author=Brody S, Weiss P.[/tpl] Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip.[tpl]cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=June 2011 |pmid=21676178 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02331.x |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=2793–9 |author=Brody S, Costa RM.[/tpl] His research indicates that "a prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle has been associated with greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories." However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus.
An empirical study carried out in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between inability to have a vaginal orgasm and psychosexual immaturity. In the study, women reported their past month frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various psychopathologies. The study concluded that a "vaginal orgasm was associated with less somatization, dissociation, displacement, autistic fantasy, devaluation, and isolation of affect." Moreover, "vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores comparable to those of established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups." In the study, a vaginal orgasm (as opposed to a clitoral orgasm) was defined as being triggered solely by penile–vaginal intercourse.[tpl]cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with less use of immature psychological defense mechanisms|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|pages=1167–1176 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00786.x |author=Brody S, Costa R.M.|volume=5|issue=5[/tpl] According to Wilhelm Reich, the lack of women's capacity to have a vaginal orgasm is due to a lack of orgastic potency, which he believed to be the result of culture's suppression of genital sexuality.Reich, Wilhelm (1984) Children of the Future: On the Prevention of Sexual Pathology. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, footnote on p. 142: "1949: The statement that the girl's clitoral masturbation is normal is also due to the then prevalent psychoanalytic concept that the little girl had no vaginal genatility. The lack of vaginal genatility was later shown by sex-economy to be an artifact of our culture, which suppresses genitality completely and instills castration anxiety not only in the boy but also in the girl. This creates a true secondary drive in the form of penis envy and predominance of clitoral genitality. Psychoanalytic theory mistook these artificial secondary drives for primary, natural functions."

==Tantric sex==

Tantric sex, which is not the same as Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana), is the ancient Indian spiritual tradition of sexual practices. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Some practitioners of tantric sex aim to eliminate orgasm from sexual intercourse by remaining for a long time in the pre-orgasmic and non-emission state. Advocates of this, such as Rajneesh, claim that it eventually causes orgasmic feelings to spread out to all of one's conscious experience.[tpl]Cite book| author = Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shree | title = Tantra, Spirituality, and Sex | year= 1983 | isbn = 0-88050-696-2 | publisher = Rajneesh Foundation Internat. | location = Rajneeshpuram, Or.[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| author = Chia, Mantak & Abrams, Douglas | title = The Multi-Orgasmic Man | publisher = Harper San Francisco | year= 1996 | isbn = 0-06-251336-2[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Advocates of tantric and neotantric sex who claim that Western culture focuses too much on the goal of climactic orgasm, which reduces the ability to have intense pleasure during other moments of the sexual experience, suggest that eliminating this enables a richer, fuller and more intense connection.[tpl]Cite book| author = Douglas, N & Slinger, P | title = Sexual Secrets: The Alchemy of Ecstasy | publisher = Destiny Books | year= 1979 | isbn = 0-89281-266-4[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

==Literature==

Orgasm has been widely described in literature over the centuries. In antiquity, Latin literature addressed the subject as much as Greek literature: Book III of Ovid's Metamorphoses retells a discussion between Jove and Juno, in which the former states: "The sense of pleasure in the male is far / More dull and dead, than what you females share."Ovid, Met. III, 320-21 (translated by Sir Samuel Garth, John Dryden, et al, 1717). In the original in Latin, Ovid writes: maior vestra profecto est, / quam quae contingit maribus. Juno rejects this thought; they agree to ask the opinion of Tiresias ("who had known Venus/Love in both ways," having lived seven years as a female).Met. III, 323 (translated by A. S. Kline, 2000). Tiresias offends Juno by agreeing with Jove, and she strikes him blind on the spot (Jove lessens the blow by giving Tiresias the gift of foresight, and a long life).Met. III, 335. Earlier, in the Ars Amatoria, Ovid states that he abhors sexual intercourse that fails to complete both partners.[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] Jornal de Letras, Artes e Ideias, Ano XXV/Number 930. 24 May to 6 June 2006.
The theme of orgasm survived during Romanticism and is incorporated in many homoerotic works. In FRAGMENT: Supposed to be an Epithalamium of Francis Ravaillac and Charlotte Cordé, Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), "a translator of extraordinary range and versatility",Webb, 1976, p. 2. wrote the phrase "No life can equal such a death." That phrase has been seen as a metaphor for orgasm,"Hellenism and Homoeroticism in Shelley and his Circle", by John Lauritsen (2008). Consulted on 10 December 2009. and it was preceded by the rhythmic urgency of the previous lines "Suck on, suck on, I glow, I glow!", which has been seen as alluding to fellatio. For Shelley, orgasm was "the almost involuntary consequences of a state of abandonment in the society of a person of surpassing attractions".Plato, 2001. Edward Ellerker Williams, the last love of Shelley's life, was remembered by the poet in "The Boat on the Serchio", which has been considered as possibly "the grandest portrayal of orgasm in literature":

  The Serchio, twisting forth
Between the marble barriers which it clove
  At Ripafratta, leads through the dread chasm
The wave that died the death which lovers love,
  Living in what it sought; as if this spasm
Had not yet passed, the toppling mountains cling,
  But the clear stream in full enthusiasm
Pours itself on the plain....

Again, Shelley, in this poem, associates orgasm with death when he writes "the death which lovers love". Curiously, in French literature, the term la petite mort (the little death) is a famous euphemism for orgasm;[tpl]Cite journal|author=Georgiadis J, Kortekaas R, Kuipers R, Nieuwenburg A, Pruim J, Reinders A, Holstege G |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes associated with clitorally induced orgasm in healthy women |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=3305–16 |year=2006 |pmid=17156391 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05206.x[/tpl] it is the representation of man who forgets himself and the world during orgasm. Jorge Luis Borges, in the same vision, wrote in one of the several footnotes of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" that one of the churches of Tlön claims Platonically that "All men, in the vertiginous moment of coitus, are the same man. All men who repeat a line from Shakespeare are William Shakespeare."Borges, Ficciones, p.28 Shakespeare himself was knowledgeable of this idea: lines "I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes" and "I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom", said respectively by Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing and by King Lear in the homonymous play,MUCH ADO, v ii 99–101. & Lear, iv vi 201. are interpreted as an option to die in a woman's lap to experience a sexual orgasm.Partridge, 2001, p.118. Sigmund Freud with his psychoanalytic projects, in "The Ego and the Id" (1923), speculates that sexual satisfaction by orgasm make Eros ("life instinct") exhausted and leaves the field open to Thanatos ("death instinct"), in other words, with orgasm Eros fulfills its mission and gives way to Thanatos.See Freud, Sigmund. "The Ego and the Id". The Hogarth Press Ltd. London, 1949. Quoted by Vida Íntima: Enciclopédia do Amor e do Sexo, Abril Cultural, Vol. 1, 1981, São Paulo, Brazil, p. 66-67. Other modern authors have chosen to represent the orgasm without metaphors. In novel Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928), by D. H. Lawrence, we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: "As he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her..."D. H. Lawrence, New York: Grove Press, 1969, cited by BANKER-RISHKIN; GRANDINETTI, 1997, p.141
