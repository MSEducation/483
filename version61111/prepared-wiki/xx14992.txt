==Sports==

In sports, most have a defined set of competitions, trophies or achievements that constitute a Grand Slam. This is usually because there is such an amount of competitions or trophies available that it would be impossible for any one player or team to enter them all, let alone win them. The defined competitions/trophies are usually considered to be the biggest, most desirable ones to win within that sport, often referred to as the 'Majors' of a given sport. Otherwise, in sports that have few competitions/trophies available a Grand Slam is defined as winning every competition/trophy you are eligible for in a given year; this is usually limited to domestic competitions/trophies in the field of internal/national league sports.
