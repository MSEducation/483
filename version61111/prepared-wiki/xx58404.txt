Alastair John Campbell (born 25 May 1957) is a British journalist, broadcaster, political aide and author, best known for his work as Director of Communications and Strategy for prime minister Tony Blair between 1997 and 2003. Campbell describes himself as a "communicator, writer and strategist" on his website, while others have described him as Labour's "unelected, but ... hardly underscrutinised" spin doctor.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alastair-campbell-the-spin-doctor-who-became--the-story-585828.html|title=Alastair Campbell: The spin doctor who became the story|date=5 July 2003|accessdate=5 July 2003|first=Donald|last= MacIntyre[/tpl]

==Early and personal life==

Campbell was born on 25 May 1957 in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, son of a Scottish veterinary surgeon, Donald Campbell, and his wife Elizabeth.[tpl]cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|edition=18th|isbn=1-870520-10-6|publisher=Debrett's|page=263[/tpl] Campbell's parents had moved to Keighley when his father became a partner in a local veterinary practice.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Aireworth Vetinaary Surgery|url= http://www.aireworthvets.co.uk/contact/history|accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl] Donald was a Gaelic-speaker from the island of Tiree; his wife was from Ayrshire. Campbell has two elder brothers, Donald and Graeme, and a younger sister, Elizabeth. Even though Alastair was born in Yorkshire, he would go over the county border to Lancashire to watch Burnley F.C. with his father.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.trusupporter.com/videos.php?team=burnley&id=243|title=Videos |publisher=Trusupporter|accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
He attended Bradford Grammar School for a short period of time, followed by City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied modern languages, French and German, for which he received an upper second (2:1). He later claimed he wrote essays based solely on works of literary criticism, often rather than having read the works themselves. He spent a year in the south of France as part of his academic degree course.
Campbell became interested in journalism. His first published work was Inter-City Ditties, his winning entry to a readers' competition in Penthouse Forum, the journalistic counterpart to the Penthouse pornographic magazine. This led to a lengthy stint writing pieces for the magazine with such titles as  Busking with Bagpipes and The Riviera Gigolo, written in a style calculated to lead readers at the time to believe they were descriptions of his own sexual exploits.[tpl]cite book|author=Oborne, Peter and Simon Walters|year=2004|title=Alastair Campbell|publisher=Aurum|isbn=1-84513-001-4|pages=25–32[/tpl]
Campbell became a sports reporter on the Tavistock Times. His first significant contribution to the news pages was coverage of the Penlee lifeboat disaster. As a trainee on the Plymouth-based Sunday Independent, then owned by Mirror Group Newspapers, he met his partner Fiona Millar, with whom he has three children; two sons (born November 1987 and July 1989) and a daughter (born May 1993). Campbell is an atheist.10 O'Clock Live, 8 February 2012

==National newspapers==

In 1982 Campbell moved to the London office of the Daily Mirror, Fleet Street's sole remaining big-circulation supporter of the Labour Party. He became a political correspondent before in 1986 moving to Today, a full-colour tabloid newspaper which was at the time trying to turn leftward, where he worked as a news editor. His rapid rise and its accompanying stress led to alcohol abuse."Cracking Up". BBC Two television documentary written and presented by Alastair Campbell. Broadcast Sunday, 12 October 2008.

===Alcoholism and depression===

Campbell was admitted to hospital in 1986 when he travelled to Scotland to cover Neil Kinnock's visit to Glasgow. He was detained by the police for his own safety after being observed behaving oddly. Police contacted his partner and following her calls to friends in Scotland the police let a family friend take Campbell to Ross Hall Hospital, a private BMI hospital in Glasgow where she and her father visited him. Over the next five days as an in-patient he was given medication to calm him, and he realised that he had an alcohol problem after seeing a psychiatrist. Campbell said that from that day onwards he counted each one that he did not drink alcohol, and did not stop counting until he had reached thousands.
Campbell returned to England, preferring to stay with friends near Cheltenham, rather than return to London (and his partner) where he did not feel safe. His condition continued with a phase of depression, and he was reluctant to seek further medical help. He eventually cooperated with treatment from his family doctor.
He has been a prominent supporter and advocate for the mental health anti-stigma campaign, Time to Change.[tpl]cite news|author=Darren Devine|title=Alastair Campbell on his battle with depression|date=28 October 2010 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/alastair-campbell-battle-depression-1894125|newspaper=Western Mail|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl]

===Return to work===

Campbell's first son was born in 1987. He returned to the Daily Mirror, where he had to restart at a low grade and work night shifts, but he rebuilt his career and became political editor.
He was a close adviser of Neil Kinnock, going on holiday with the Kinnocks, and worked closely with Robert Maxwell. Campbell punched The Guardian journalist Michael White after White joked about "Captain Bob, Bob, Bob...bobbing" in the Atlantic Ocean shortly after Maxwell's drowning in 1991. Campbell later put this down to stress at the thought of himself and others losing their job following the demise of the Daily Mirror proprietor.
After leaving the Mirror in 1993, Campbell became political editor of Today. He was working there when Labour leader John Smith died in 1994. He was a well-known face and helped to interview the three candidates for the new Labour Party leader; it was later revealed he had already formed links with Tony Blair.

==Politics and government==

Shortly after Blair won the leadership of the Labour Party in 1994, Campbell left Today to become his spokesman. Having recovered and become teetotal, he told Blair about his alcoholism, which Blair did not see as a problem.[tpl]cite book|author=Alastair Campbell|title=The Blair Years|page=entry for 6 April 2002|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-09-951475-3|year=2007|nopp=true[/tpl] He played an important role in the run-up to the 1997 general election, working with Peter Mandelson to co-ordinate Labour's campaign. He also worked hard to win support from the national media for the Labour Party, particularly from the newspapers who for many years had been anti-Labour. By March 1997, many of the leading newspapers – including the Sun, once a staunch Thatcherite paper – had declared their support for Labour.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842|publisher=BBC News|title= bThe rise and fall of New Labour|date=3 August 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100805051127/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842|archivedate=5 August 2010[/tpl]
He moved into government when Labour won the general election in May 1997 and was the Prime Minister's chief press secretary until 2000. He then moved to the post of Prime Minister's Director of Communications which gave him a strategic role in overseeing government communications. He was sponsored by the US President George W. Bush to complete the London marathon in aid of a cancer charity, Leukaemia Research.

===Iraq War===

In the run-up to the Iraq War Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the "September Dossier" in September 2002 and the "Iraq Dossier" (or "Dodgy Dossier") in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over possible weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. Both have been criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered, on Campbell's orders, to be consistent with a speech given by George W. Bush and statements by other United States officials. On 9 September 2002, Campbell sent a memo to John Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, in which Campbell directed that the British dossier be "one that complements rather than conflicts with" the US claims.
Later in 2003, commenting on WMDs in Iraq he said, "Come on, you don't seriously think we won't find anything?".'Did I say that', Observer magazine 29 March 2009 He resigned in August 2003 during the Hutton Inquiry into the death of David Kelly. Kelly's view that the government exaggerated the Iraqi threat in the Iraq Dossier, told to BBC journalists Andrew Gilligan and Susan Watts, had led to Campbell battling with the BBC. When Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon revealed to Campbell that Dr Kelly had talked to the BBC, Campbell had then decided, in his own words, to use this fact to "fuck Gilligan". The counsel for the Kelly family said to Lord Hutton: 'The family invite the inquiry to find that the government made a deliberate decision to use Dr Kelly as a pawn as part of its strategy in its battle with the BBC.'[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/forget-conspiracies-the-official-version-is-scandalous-enough-2114230.html|first= Kim|last= Sengupta|title=Forget conspiracies: the official version is scandalous enough|page= 11|work= The Independent|publisher= Independent Newspapers Ltd|location= London|date= 23 October 2010|accessdate=24 October 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101024200802/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/forget-conspiracies-the-official-version-is-scandalous-enough-2114230.html| archivedate= 24 October 2010 |deadurl=no[/tpl] He claimed in June 2013 that Tony Blair had "greater commitment to wartime truth" than Winston Churchill.
Campbell gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 12 January 2011.

==Later career==

Campbell worked again for the Labour Party in the run-up to the May 2005 general election. Sir Clive Woodward recruited Campbell to manage relations with the press for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005. Campbell wrote a column for The Times during the tour.
Throughout his time in Downing Street, Campbell kept a diary which reportedly totalled some two million words. Selected extracts, titled The Blair Years, were published on 9 July 2007. Subsequent press coverage of the book's release included coverage of what Campbell had chosen to leave out, particularly in respect of the relationship between Blair and his Chancellor and successor, Gordon Brown. Campbell expressed an intention to one day publish the diaries in fuller form, and indicated in the introduction to the book that he did not wish to make matters harder for Brown in his new role as prime minister, or to damage the Labour Party.
Campbell has his own website and blog, as well as several pages on social networking websites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog.php |title=Hear the latest from Alastair's Blog: Sign up for RSS feed |publisher=Alastaircampbell.org|accessdate=11 May 2009| archivedate=23 April 2009 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090423205534/http://alastaircampbell.org/blog.php|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] He uses these platforms to discuss British politics and other topics close to his heart. So far, Campbell's commentaries and views have garnered media attention and generated interest among various online communities. In October 2008, he broadcast the personal story of his mental illness in a television documentary partly to reduce the stigma of that illness. He has written a novel on the subject entitled All in the Mind.
Campbell appeared as a mentor in the BBC Two series The Speaker in April 2009 offering his advice on persuasive speaking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/speaker/improve/persuasion/|title=Alastair Campbell, Speaker Mentor – "Define your key message"|date=April 2009|publisher=The Speaker, BBC|accessdate=10 May 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090411061829/http://www.bbc.co.uk/speaker/improve/persuasion/|archivedate=11 April 2009 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
He is a lifelong supporter of Burnley Football Club and writes about their exploits in a column called "Turf Moor Diaries" for the FanHouse UK football blog .[tpl]cite web|url=http://football.fanhouse.co.uk/staff/alastair-campbell/|title=Alastair's Turf Moor Diaries |publisher=football.fanhouse.co.uk[/tpl] He is regularly involved in events with the club.
Campbell made his first appearance on the BBC One political discussion programme Question Time on 27 May 2010. At the opening of the edition, presenter David Dimbleby said that the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition would not allow a front bench member of the government to appear on the show unless Campbell was dropped. The BBC refused to do this. The government later accused the BBC of behaving improperly for allowing Campbell to appear as a more in-depth version of his diaries was due to be published the following week, and a Downing Street spokesman told The Guardian, "Campbell seemed to be on because he's flogging a book next week, so the BBC haven't behaved entirely properly here." Campbell said that he had waited until Labour were in opposition before appearing on the show and that the date was a coincidence as it was the only time he was free. He suggested the discord was part of a Conservative anti-BBC agenda. The minister who had been scheduled to appear was the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws who Campbell produced a picture of during the programme. Three days later Laws resigned his post following revelations about possible irregularities in his expenses claims in The Telegraph the day before.
Campbell appeared on BBC's Top Gear in July 2010 where he was booed by the audience but set a time of 1:47 around the Top Gear test track in the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment. He was second-fastest at that time.[tpl]cite news|last=Boden|first=Nicola|title= Alastair Campbell finally meets his match as he is roundly booed by Top Gear audience|publisher=Daily Mail|work=Mail Online|date=6 July 2010|accessdate=11 July 2012|location=London |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1292090/Alastair-Campbell-booed-appears-Top-Gear.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100707001409/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1292090/Alastair-Campbell-booed-appears-Top-Gear.html|archivedate=7 July 2010[/tpl]
He also took part in the 2011 Channel Four television series Jamie's Dream School.
In June 2012 he was guest presenter of Have I Got News For You where he surprised the audience by playing the bagpipes. The episode was also notable for the feuding between Campbell and Have I Got News For You regular Ian Hislop.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/qwqcw/have-i-got-news-for-you--series-43---episode-8|title=HIGNFY Series 43 Episode 8|journal=Radio Times|accessdate=11 July 2012|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120605025452/http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/qwqcw/have-i-got-news-for-you--series-43---episode-8|archivedate=5 June 2012[/tpl]
In 2011, Campbell contacted the Metropolitan Police with suspicions that his phone was hacked by the News of the World in 2003.
Campbell presented and narrated the 20 February 2012 edition of BBC current affairs programme Panorama, which was entitled Britain's Hidden Alcoholics. Campbell stated that he is an alcoholic, although he has not drunk alcohol since 1986.
In 2012, Campbell made his first appearance in an acting role with a small part in an episode of the BBC drama Accused.
In May 2012, Campbell took a job at PR agency Portland Communications, at the invitation of Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. Along with Tony Blair, Campbell has also provided consultancy services to the government of Kazakhstan on "questions of social economic modernisation."
In an interview with Chat Politics, Campbell declared his regret at not standing in the United Kingdom general election, 1997 and admitted he finds it "depressing" that younger people with far more experience of YouTube and Twitter were not ready to carry out his former role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chatpolitics.org/portfolio/alastair-campbell/|work= chatpolitics.org|author=Shaun O'Mahoney|title=Alistair Campbell On spin, Cherie Blair, Iraq, The Thick of It, and Scottish Independence|accessdate=31 March 2014 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140331161916/http://www.chatpolitics.org/portfolio/alastair-campbell/|archivedate=4 April 2014[/tpl]

==Stage and screen portrayals==

A regular feature of comedy programme Bremner, Bird and Fortune was a satirical version of Campbell's discussions with Tony Blair, in which Rory Bremner played Blair and Andrew Dunn played Campbell. In 2005, Campbell was played by Jonathan Cake in the Channel 4 television film The Government Inspector, based on the David Kelly Case. The following year, he was portrayed by Mark Bazeley in the Stephen Frears film The Queen – a role reprised by Bazeley in 2010 follow-up The Special Relationship, also written by Peter Morgan but this time directed by Richard Loncraine. Alex Jennings, who portrayed Prince Charles in The Queen, portrayed Campbell in the television drama A Very Social Secretary.International Movie Database, Alex Jennings (I). In an episode of Dead Ringers his close relationship with Tony Blair is satirised in an imaginary scenario where Blair is divorcing his wife. He is asked if it will be difficult to sack the person he most loves and cherishes replying "I'm not sacking Alastair Campbell".
It is also widely believed that the character of Malcolm Tucker from the BBC political satire comedy The Thick of It is loosely based on Campbell. Tucker is famous for his short fuse and use of very strong language. In an interview with Mark Kermode on BBC2's The Culture Show, Campbell denied that the two are similar in any relevant way, but admitted to his liberal use of profanities in the workplace.[tpl]cite web]]|date=4 August 2009|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFaizGw860|title=Alastair Campbell views In the Loop|publisher=YouTube[/tpl]
