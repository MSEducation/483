The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)[tpl]usc|42|1395dd[/tpl] is an act of the United States Congress, passed in 1986 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). It requires hospitals to provide emergency health care treatment to anyone needing it regardless of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. There are no reimbursement provisions. Participating hospitals may not transfer or discharge patients needing emergency treatment except with the informed consent or stabilization of the patient or when their condition requires transfer to a hospital better equipped to administer the treatment.
EMTALA applies to "participating hospitals." The statute defines "participating hospitals" as those that accept payment from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Medicare program.[tpl]usc|42|1395dd[/tpl] (e)(2) The term "participating hospital" means a hospital that has entered into a provider agreement under section [tpl]usc|42|1395cc[/tpl] of this title. "Because there are very few hospitals that do not accept Medicare, the law applies to nearly all hospitals."Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act summary, Families USA. The combined payments of Medicare and Medicaid, $602 billion in 2004,Key Medicare and Medicaid Statistics from kff.org or roughly 44% of all medical expenditures in the U.S., make not participating in EMTALA impractical for nearly all hospitals. EMTALA's provisions apply to all patients, not just to Medicare patients.Text of act from law.cornell.eduEMTALA FAQ Website / Information from Garan Lucow Miller, P.C
The cost of emergency care required by EMTALA is not directly covered by the federal government. Because of this, the law has been criticized by some as an unfunded mandate.Fact Sheet: EMTALA from the American College of Emergency Physicians accessed 2007-11-01 Uncompensated care represents 6% of total hospital costs.American Hospital Association, Trends Affecting Hospitals and Health Systems 2011, Chapter 4, Slide 7 

==Mandated and non-mandated care==

Congress passed EMTALA to combat the practice of "patient dumping," i.e., refusal to treat people because of inability to pay or insufficient insurance, or transferring or discharging emergency patients on the basis of high anticipated diagnosis and treatment costs. The law applies when an individual has a medical emergency "and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition."
The U.S. government defines an emergency department as "a specially equipped and staffed area of the hospital used a significant portion of the time for initial evaluation and treatment of outpatients for emergency medical conditions."American College of Emergency Physicians: EMTALA Fact Sheet, accessed 2007-10-05. This means, for example, that outpatient clinics not equipped to handle medical emergencies are not obligated under EMTALA and can simply refer patients to a nearby emergency department for care.
An emergency medical condition is defined as "a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual's health the health of an unborn child in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of bodily organs." For example, a pregnant woman with an emergency condition must be treated until delivery is complete unless a transfer under the statute is appropriate.
Patients treated under EMTALA may not be able to pay or have insurance or other programs pay for the associated costs but are legally responsible for any costs incurred as a result of their care under civil law.

===Non-covered medical conditions===

Not all medical problems are covered by EMTALA, meaning that a person cannot assume that if they are ill, they will be treated. Specifically, EMTALA does not cover non-emergency situations. The hospital is allowed to determine that there is no emergency, using their normal screening procedure, and then refuse EMTALA treatment http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/guide/spec/freehosp.htm.

====Examples of conditions not considered emergencies by courts or hospitals====

A significant portion of emergency room visits are considered not emergencies as defined by EMTALA and are therefore not covered http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/cashing-check?page=2. The medical profession refers to these cases as "non-emergent".
If a patient is already in the hospital for another reason and develops an emergency condition, EMTALA similarly does not apply. http://www.nursinglaw.com/emtala8.htm

==Hospital obligations==

Hospitals have three obligations under EMTALA: 

===Amendments===

Since its original passage, Congress has passed several amendments to this act. Additionally, state and local laws in some places have imposed additional requirements on hospitals. These amendments include the following:

==Effects==

===Improved health services for uninsured===

The most significant effect is that, regardless of insurance status, participating hospitals cannot deny urgent medical assistance. Currently EMTALA only requires that hospitals stabilize the emergency. According to some analyses of the U.S. health care safety net, EMTALA is an incomplete and strained program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/Threadbare-Holes-in-America-s-Health-Care-Safety-Net-report.pdf |title=Threadbare: Holes in America's Healthcare Safety Net |accessdate=2007-10-22 |authors=Catherine Hoffman and Susan Starr Sered |date=November 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Unisured |quote=Health conditions that are not immediately life-threatening, but urgent and should be managed initially by specialists, fall through the holes in the safety net.[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2000/Americas-Health-Care-Safety-Net/Insurance%20Safety%20Net%202000%20%20report%20brief.pdf |title=Report Brief.

===Cost pressures on hospitals===

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 55% of U.S. emergency care now goes uncompensated.The Uninsured: Access to Medical Care, American College of Emergency Physicians, accessed 2007-10-05 [tpl]Dead Link|date=July 2012[/tpl]  When medical bills go unpaid, health care providers must either shift the costs onto those who can pay or go uncompensated. In the first decade of EMTALA, such cost-shifting amounted to a hidden tax levied by providers.(Peter Harbage and Len M. Nichols, Ph.D., "A Premium Price: The Hidden Costs All Californians Pay In Our Fragmented Health Care System," New America Foundation, 12/2006) For example, it has been estimated that this cost shifting amounted to $455 per individual or $1,186 per family in California each year.
However, because of the recent influence of managed care and other cost control initiatives by insurance companies, hospitals are less able to shift costs, and end up writing off more in uncompensated care. The amount of uncompensated care delivered by nonfederal community hospitals grew from $6.1 billion in 1983 to $40.7 billion in 2004, according to a 2004 report from the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, but it is unclear what percentage of this was emergency care and therefore attributable to EMTALA.
Financial pressures on hospitals in the 20 years since EMTALA's passage have caused them to consolidate and close facilities, contributing to emergency room overcrowding.http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medstar-washington-hospital-center-to-cut-more-than-200-jobs-due-to-financial-woes/2013/11/11/913dfbd4-4afe-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html According to the Institute of Medicine, between 1993 and 2003, emergency room visits in the U.S. grew by 26 percent, while in the same period, the number of emergency departments declined by 425.Fact Sheet: The Future of Emergency Care: Key Findings and Recommendations, Institute of Medicine, 2006, accessed 2007-10-07. Ambulances are frequently diverted from overcrowded emergency departments to other hospitals that may be farther away. In 2003, ambulances were diverted over a half a million times, not necessarily due to patients' inability to pay.
