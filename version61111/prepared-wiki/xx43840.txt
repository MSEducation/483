</ref>  The faint comet [[38P/Stephanâ€“Oterma]] would probably not show a coma if it had a perihelion distance beyond Jupiter's orbit at 5&nbsp;AU.  By the year 2200, comet [[78P/Gehrels]] will probably migrate outwards into a centaur-like orbit.

==Theories of origin==

The study of centaur development is rich in recent developments but still hampered by limited physical data. Different models have been put forward for possible origin of centaurs. 
Simulations indicate that the orbit of some Kuiper-belt objects can be perturbed, resulting in the object's expulsion so that it becomes a centaur. Scattered disc objects would be dynamically the best candidatesfor instance, the centaurs could be part of an "inner" scattered disc of objects perturbed inwards from the Kuiper belt http://www.zanestein.com/page4_1.htm. for such expulsions, but their colours do not fit the bicoloured nature of the centaurs. Plutinos are a class of Kuiper-belt object that display a similar bicoloured nature, and there are suggestions that not all plutinos' orbits are as stable as initially thought, due to perturbation by Pluto.
Further developments are expected with more physical data on KBOs.
