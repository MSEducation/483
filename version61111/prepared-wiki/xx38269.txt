Lake Agassiz was an immense glacial lake located in the middle of the northern part of North America. Fed by glacial meltwater at the end of the last glacial period, its area was larger than all of the modern Great Lakes combined, and at times it held more water than contained by all lakes in the world today.
First postulated in 1823 by William H. Keating, it was named by Warren Upham in 1879 after Louis Agassiz, when Upham recognized that the lake was formed by glacial action.

==Geological progression==

During the last Ice Age, northern North America was covered by a glacier, which alternately advanced and deteriorated with variations in the climate.  This continental ice sheet formed during the period now known as the Wisconsin glaciation, and covered much of central North America between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago.  As the ice sheet disintegrated, it created at its front an immense proglacial lake, formed from its meltwaters, as the retreat of glacial margins is not caused by a reversal of the glacier's flow, but rather from melting of the ice sheet.[tpl]cite book|author=Ojakangas RW, Matsch CL|title=Minnesota's Geology|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minnesota|isbn=0816609535|pages=106–110[/tpl]
Around 13,000 years ago, the lake came to cover much of Manitoba, northwestern Ontario, northern Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, and Saskatchewan. At its greatest extent, it may have covered as much as [tpl]convert|440000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], larger than any currently existing lake in the world (including the Caspian Sea) and approximately the size of the Black Sea.[tpl]cn|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The lake drained at various times south through the Traverse Gap into Glacial River Warren (parent to the Minnesota River, a tributary of the Mississippi River),[tpl]cite journal | last = Fisher| first = Timothy G. | title = Chronology of glacial Lake Agassiz meltwater routed to the Gulf of Mexico | journal = Quaternary Research | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–76 | date = March 2003|doi=10.1016/S0033-5894(03)00011-5 [/tpl] east through Lake Kelvin (modern Lake Nipigon) to what is now Lake Superior,[ref]
