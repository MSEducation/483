THE CENTER HILL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FIRE
Saturday, 11 February 1989 at 17:42 PM
Company 38 rolled up to find roughly 1/2 of an abandoned “U”
shaped one-story elementary school with fire through the roof. The
old building, located at 2455 Bankhead Highway NW in the Center
Hill neighborhood, had been vacant for several years and was for sale
by the Board of Education. Vandals had stripped the building of
wiring and piping and most of the windows were broken out. Many
holes were punched in the plaster on wood lathe walls in the older
portions of the building so fire moved very rapidly. The original
building formed the bottom of the “U” and some tough firefighting
saved the legs of the “U” due to the change in construction from the
wood frame with brick veneer of the original building to block walls
and a Tectum roof deck over the newer sections. The lack of wood
in the roof design slowed the fire slightly and gave the responding
companies time to get lines laid and make a stand. Eventually the
incident grew to a Three Alarm Fire including Automatic Aid from
Fulton County Company 11. Control was gained at 19:07 after
two Ladder Pipes, four deluge guns and numerous hand lines were
operated. Firefighter Fairus Elder of Company 16 injured a knee
during overhaul operations. The remainder of the building was
demolished leaving only a vacant lot at the site today.
