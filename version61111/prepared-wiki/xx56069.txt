[[Palmer Method]]

CATEGORIES: Penmanship, 1894 introductions, Latin calligraphy

The Palmer Method of penmanship instruction was developed and promoted by Austin Palmer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was largely created as a simplified and less "feminine" style than the "Spencerian Method", which had been the major standardized system of handwriting since the 1840s.Tyler; RobinDVC (2010-04-12). Palmer Method of Penmanship. NYU Dead Media Archive, 12 April 2010. Retrieved from http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Palmer_Method_of_Penmanship#Precursors_and_Palmer.27s_Method. The Palmer Method soon became the most popular handwriting system in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Under the method, students were taught to adopt a uniform system of cursive writing with rhythmic motions.  Left-handers were usually made to use their right hands.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The method developed around 1888 and was introduced in his 1894 book Palmer's Guide to Business Writing. Palmer's method involved "muscle motion" in which the more proximal muscles of the arm were used for movement, rather than allowing the fingers to move in writing. In spite of opposition from the major publishers, this textbook enjoyed great success: in 1912, 1 million copies were sold throughout the country. The method won awards, including the Gold Medal at the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, in 1915, and the Gold Medal at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1926.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Proponents of the Palmer Method emphasized its plainness and speed, that it was much faster than the laborious Spencerian Method, and allowed the writer to effectively compete with the typewriter.Trubek, Anne (2009-12-17).

To educators, the method's advocates emphasized regimentation, and that the method would thus be useful in schools to increase discipline and character, and could even reform delinquents.Smith, Tracy (2011-01-23).

The Palmer Method began to fall out of popularity in the 1950s, and was eventually supplanted by the Zaner-Bloser method, which sought to teach children manuscript before teaching them cursive, in order to provide them with a means of written expression as soon as possible, and thus develop writing skills.Alston, Jean;  and Taylor, Jane (1987). Handwriting: Theory, Research and Practice. Nichols Publishing Company, New York, 1987. Retrieved from http://books.google.com/books/about/Handwriting.html?id=Jpg9AAAAIAAJ. The D'Nealian method, introduced in 1978, sought to address problems raised by the Zaner-Bloser method, returning to a more cursive style. The Palmer method ended when the company stopped publishing in the 1980s.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
