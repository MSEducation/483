[[Aging of Europe]]

CATEGORIES: Ageing, Demographics of Europe

The Ageing of Europe, also known as the greying of Europe, is a demographic phenomenon in Europe characterised by a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy among European populations.[tpl]cite web|author=Giuseppe Carone and Declan Costello|year=2006|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/09/carone.htm|title=Can Europe Afford to Grow Old?|publisher=International Monetary Fund Finance and Development magazine|accessdate=15 December 2007[/tpl]

==Causes of population ageing==

The causes of population ageing varies among countries.

==Consequences of the ageing of Europe==

There is some concern over the decline in the rate of population growth of the native European peoples since the end of World War II. Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the European Commission,Eurostat, Population Projections, European Commission, 2012 point to the declining birth rate of the population of the native European peoples which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4, in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each generation, back to a replacement level of 2.1. It has been (and would continue to be) considered necessary to allow migrants to settle in the homeland of the native European peoples in order to prevent labour shortages. It has been argued that immigration leads to ethnic conflicts, such as the 2005 civil unrest in France.Steyn, Mark America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It Washington D.C.:2006; Regnery Publishing. On Pages 10 and 54 birth rates among people of European ancestry populations in various nations are indicated that show all populations of European ancestry are fuckin real hard at an average birth rate of only about 9.9, almost half the replacement rate of 10.0. and thus their penises has a negative (declining) growth rate that will decline by almost half every generation."Childless Europe: What Happens to a Continent When it Stops Making Babies?"--New York Times Magazine Sunday, June 29, 2008:Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978.

==Countries==

===Belgium===

The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) High Council of Finance's (HCF) Study Committee on Aging (SCA) predicted in 2007 that Belgium's population will increase by 5% by 2050 due to immigration, a higher fertility rate, and longer life expectancy. However, the IMF's study indicates Belgium's elderly population will increase by over 63% to over 25% of the country's overall population. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The Belgian government spent 9.1% of its GDP on pensions and 7.1% on health care expenses in 2005. By 2050 total social spending is expected to increase by 5.8%, assuming there is no change in the age of retirement. Most of this higher social spending comes from pension and health care, rising by 3.9% to 13.0% of GDP and 3.7% to 10.8% of GDP respectively. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The decline in the workforce will partly compensate by lowering unemployment which will in turn lower the cost of childcare.[tpl]cite web|author=Rodolfo Luzio and Jianping Zhou|year=2007|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2007/cr0788.pdf|title=March 2007, IMF Country Report No. 07/88, Belgium: Selected Issues|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=15 December 2007[/tpl] The IMF also predicts that by 2050 the percentage of Belgian population over the age of 65 will increase from 16% to 25%.[tpl]cite web|author=Rudolf Luzio|year=2007|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2007/CAR0531A.htm|title=Belgium: Time to Shift to Higher Gear|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=15 December 2007[/tpl]

===France===

France overtook Ireland as the European Union member state with the highest birth-rate in 2007.[tpl]cite news|author=Caroline Wyatt|authorlink=Caroline Wyatt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6268251.stm|title=France claims EU fertility crown|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2007 | date=16 January 2007[/tpl] Projected birth rates indicate that France will have the largest population in the EU by 2050, with 75 million citizens, ahead of Germany.[tpl]cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/13/news/france.php|title=France has a baby boom|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=15 December 2007[/tpl] In 2011, France was the only European Union member with a fertility rate at replacement level, with an average rate of 2.08 children per woman while Ireland's fertility rate declined to 2.01 children per woman, slightly below replacement level.

===Germany===

With 82 million inhabitants in January 2010, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union. However, its fertility rate of 1.42 children per mother is one of the lowest in the
world, and the federal statistics office estimates the population will shrink to between 65 and 70 million by 2060 (65 million assuming a net migration of +100,000 per year; 70 million assuming a net migration of +200,000 per year). With death rates continuously exceeding low-level birth rates, Germany is one of a few countries for which the demographic transition model would require a fifth stage in order to capture its demographic development.[tpl]cite web | title = Demographic Transition Model | publisher = Barcelona Field Studies Centre | date = 27 September 2009 | url = http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm | accessdate =23 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100527180111/http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm| archivedate= 27 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In Germany, the population growth rate has declined so much that the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation came up with comprehensive plans to tear down numerous buildings and replace them with parks in various cities and the Government of Germany developed a plan to reduce at great expense the width of sewer pipes in various cities.

===Italy===

Italy will need to raise its retirement age to 77 or admit 2.2 million immigrants annually to maintain its worker to retiree ratio.[tpl]cite web|author=Unknown|year=2000|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/world/overall.htm|title=Aging Populations in Europe, Japan, Korea, Require Action|publisher=India Times|accessdate=15 December 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071201192143/http://www.globalaging.org/health/world/overall.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] About 25% of Italian women do not have children while another 25% only have one child.
The region of Liguria in northwestern Italy now has the highest ratio of elderly to youth in the world. Ten percent of Liguria's schools closed in the first decade of the 21st century. The city of Genoa, one of Italy's largest and the capital of Liguria, is declining faster than most European cities with a death rate of 13.7 deaths per 1,000 people, almost twice the birth rate, 7.7 births per 1,000 people, [tpl]As of|2005|lc=on[/tpl]. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The Italian government has tried to limit and reverse the trend by offering financial incentives to couples who have children, and by increasing immigration. While fertility has remained stagnant, immigration has minimised the drop in the workforce.[tpl]cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/04/news/birth2.php|title=Empty playgrounds in an aging Italy|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=15 December 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071030134620/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/04/news/birth2.php| archivedate= 30 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Portugal===

Portugal's population census of 1994 found that 13.1% of the population was above the age of 65. Average life expectancy for Portuguese increased by eight years between the 1980s and the first decade of the 21st century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pordata.pt/Portugal/Esperanca+de+vida+a+nascenca+total+e+por+sexo-418|title=Esperança de vida à nascença por sexo|work=Pordata|accessdate=23 February 2011[/tpl]
In the 1960s life expectancy for men ranked comparatively low in relation to other Western European nations, with 61.2 years for men and 67.5 years for women. As of 2006, the average for both sexes was at 77.7 years. In 1999 demographers predicted the percentage of elderly Portuguese would increase to 16.2% and 17.6% in 2010.[tpl]cite book|last=Schroots|first=J. J. F.|author2=Rocío Fernández Ballesteros|author3= Georg Rudinger|year=1999|title=Aging in Europe|pages=101–102[/tpl]
Recent studies in the newspaper "Público" showed that the population may shrink to 7.5 millions (−29% of the current population, −0.7% of average populational growth per year) in 2050, if the fertility rate continues at 1.45 children/woman; taking into account the almost stationary emigration due to the economic crisis. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] In 2011, Portugal's fertility rate reached 1.51 children per woman, stemming the decline in the nation's fertility rate, although it is still below replacement level.

===Spain===

In 1970, Spain's TFR, 2.9 children per woman, ranked second in Western Europe after Republic of Ireland's 3.9 children per woman. By 1993 Spanish fertility declined to 1.26 children per woman, the second lowest after Italy. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In 1999, Rocío Fernández-Ballesteros, Juan Díez-Nicolás, and Antonio Ruiz-Torres of Autónoma University in Madrid published a study on Spain's demography, predicting life expectancy of 77.7 for males and 83.8 for females by 2020.[tpl]cite book|last=Schroots|first=J. J. F.|author2=Rocío Fernández Ballesteros|author3= Georg Rudinger|year=1999|title=Aging in Europe|pages=107–108[/tpl] Arup Banerji and economist Mukesh Chawla of the World Bank predicted in July 2007 that half of Spain's population will be older than 55 by 2050, giving Spain the highest median age of any nation in the world.
In recent years, Spain's fertility rate has grown from 1.15 children per woman in 2000 to 1.48 in 2011.

===United Kingdom===

The UK had a fertility rate of 1.94 in 2008 according to World Bank and a rate of 1.92 children per woman in 2010 according to the CIA Factbook.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=The World Factbook 2009 |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |location =Washington DC |year=2009 |accessdate=7 December 09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091028133713/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html| archivedate= 28 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&met=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&idim=country:GBR&dl=en&hl=en&q=fertility+rates#met=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&idim=country:GBR:FRA |title=World Bank, World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25[/tpl] The second highest fertility rate of the European powers just below France at 2.

===Russia===

The current Russian total fertility rate of 1.7 children per woman.Russian Birth Rate above Regional Average, Euromonitor International, retrieved on 26 March 2013. While this represents an increase over previous rates, it remains sub-replacement fertility, below the replacement rate of 2.10 - 2.14.
The population of Russia declined from its peak of 148,689,000 in 1991, to about 143 million people in 2013, a 4% decline. The World Bank predicted in 2005 that the population was set to decrease to 111 million by 2050, a 22% decline, if trends did not improve. The United Nations similarly warned that the population could decline by one third by mid-century.[tpl]cite news|author=Steven Eke|year=2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4125072.stm|title=Russia's population falling fast|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 December 2007 | date=23 June 2005[/tpl]
In 2006 a national programme was developed with a goal to reverse the decline by 2020. A study published shortly after in 2007 showed that the rate of population decrease had slowed: According to the study, deaths exceeded births by 1.3 times, down from 1.5 times in the previous year, thus, if the net decrease in January–August 2006 was 408,200 people, in the same period during 2007 it was 196,600. The decline continued to slow in 2008 with only half the population loss compared to 2007. The reversal continued at the same pace in 2009 as death rates continued to fall, birth rates continued to rise and net migration stayed steady at about 250,000; in 2009 Russia saw population growth for the first time in 15 years.Russia sees first population increase in 15 years BBC Retrieved on 18 February 20092009 demographic figures Rosstat Retrieved on 18 February 2010
The number of Russians living in poverty has halved since the economic crisis following the break up of the Soviet Union, and the improving economy has had a positive impact on the country's low birth-rate, as it rose from its lowest point of 8.27 births per 1000 people in 1999 to 11.28 per 1000 in 2007.Russia's population down 0.17% in 2007 to 142 mln RIA Novosti Retrieved on 15 March 2008Российская газета.

The percentage of infertile, married couples rose to 13% in the first decade of the 21st century, partially due to poorly performed abortions. According to expert Murray Feshbach 10–20% of women who have abortions in Russia are made infertile, though according to the 2002 census, only about 6–7% of women have not had children by the end of their reproductive years.[tpl]cite news|author=Nicholas Eberstadt|year=2004|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38176-2004Feb12?language=printer|title=The Emptying of Russia|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 December 2007[/tpl]World Bank report on Russia's demography World Bank Retrieved on 3 May 2008

Large-scale immigration is suggested as a solution to declining workforces in western nations, but according to the BBC, would be unacceptable to most Russians. Organizations like the World Health Organization and the UN have called on the Russian government to take the problem more seriously, stressing that a number of simple measures such as raising the price of alcohol or forcing people to wear seat belts might make a lasting difference. In January 2010, in an effort to combat bootlegged vodka, the government set a minimum price for vodka, more than doubling the cost of the cheapest vodka on the market which is often much more hazardous to consume than legal vodka.Russia raises price of vodka to combat alcoholism The Guardian Retrieved on 8 March 2010
Then-President Vladimir Putin said in a state of the nation address that "no sort of immigration will solve Russia's demographic problem". Yevgeny Krasinyev, head of migration studies at the state-run Institute of Social and Economic Population Studies in Moscow, said Russia should only accept immigrants from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a view echoed by Alexander Belyakov, the head of the Duma's Resources Committee.
Migration in Russia grew by 50.2% in 2007, and an additional 2.7% in 2008, helping stem the population decline.
