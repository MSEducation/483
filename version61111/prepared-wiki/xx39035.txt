King's College London (informally King's or KCL) is a public research university located in London, United Kingdom, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. King's is arguably the third-oldest university in England, having been founded by King George IV and the Duke of Wellington in 1829, receiving its royal charter in the same year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article4767634.ece|title=Profile: Durham University|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=12 September 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|first=David|last=Byers[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/dates.aspx|title=About King's – Dates |publisher=King's College London|accessdate=15 June 2012[/tpl] "1829 – The Duke of Wellington fights a duel with the Earl of Winchilsea in defence of his simultaneous role in the foundation of King's College and his support of the Roman Catholic Relief Act.

==History==

===Foundation===

King's College, so named to indicate the patronage of King George IV, was founded in 1829 in response to the theological controversy surrounding the founding of "London University" (which later became University College London) in 1827.Cockburn, King, McDonnell (1969), pp. 345–359[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/foundation.aspx | title=Foundation|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=9 February 2013 [/tpl] London University was founded, with the backing of Utilitarians, Jews and non-Anglican Christians, as a secular institution, intended to educate "the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later"Hearnshaw (1929), p. 38 giving its nickname, "the godless college in Gower Street".Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 958
The need for such an institution was a result of the religious and social nature of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which then educated solely the sons of wealthy Anglicans.[tpl]cite web|last=Banerjee|first=Jacqueline|title= The University of London: The Founding Colleges|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/education/ulondon/2.html|accessdate=26 May 2007[/tpl] The secular nature of London University was disapproved by The Establishment, indeed, "the storms of opposition which raged around it threatened to crush every spark of vital energy which remained".MacIlwraith (1884), p. 32 Thus, the creation of a rival institution represented a Tory response to reassert the educational values of The Establishment.Thompson (1990), p. 5 More widely, King's was one of the first of a series of institutions which came about in the early nineteenth century as a result of the Industrial Revolution and great social changes in England following the Napoleonic Wars.[tpl]citation|title=King's College London and Somerset House|url=http://issuu.com/kingscollegelondon/docs/booklet_produced_by_the_college_to_promote_the_ide/1|page=2|publisher=King's College London|date=c. 1963|accessdate=12 February 2013 [/tpl] By virtue of its foundation King's has enjoyed the patronage of the monarch, the Archbishop of Canterbury as its Visitor and during the nineteenth century counted among its official governors the Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Mayor of London.
Rumours in the press of a competing institution in the tradition of the established church appeared in 1827, but the idea was first defined early in 1828 by Reverend Dr George D'Oyly, Rector of Lambeth, in an open letter to Sir Robert Peel, the then Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/a-e/10do85-1 |title=D'OYLY, Reverend Dr George (1778–1846)|publisher=King's College London College Archives|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/sir-robert-peel-2nd-baronet/ |title=Sir Robert Peel 2nd Baronet|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=9 February 2013 [/tpl] A scheme emerged during the summer of 1828 and a public meeting to launch King's, chaired by the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, and attended by the Archbishops of York, Canterbury and Armagh, and two members of the Cabinet (Peel and the Earl of Aberdeen) was held on 21 June 1828. A committee of twenty-seven was appointed to raise funds and to frame regulations and building plans, but the sum raised by subscription was inadequate. The Crown granted a site lying between the Strand and the Thames to the College and building began in 1829.
A royal charter to incorporate King's College was granted by George IV on 14 August 1829, stating the intention of the new College:
The government of the College was vested in a council consisting of nine official governors, five of whom were clergymen, eight life governors, a treasurer, and 24 other members of the Corporation. Several potential sites for the College were discussed including Buckingham Palace and Regent's Park, however eventually the Treasury provided a site between the Strand and the Thames, running parallel to the yet unfinished Somerset House at a peppercorn rent in perpetuity.Thompson (1990), p. 6[tpl]cite book| title = House of Lords Sessional Papers 1801–1833 – Appendix to seventh Report of Commissioners of Woods, Forests & Land Revenue| url = http://books.google.com/?id=e9JbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA48| accessdate = 3 March 2013| volume = 270| year = 1830| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationary Office| page = 48 [/tpl] Schedule of Grants in Perpetuity of Parts of the Land Revenue of the Crown: "A piece of Ground in the parish of St. Mary-le-Strand, on the East side of Somerset house bounded on the West side by the area next the Building on the East side of Somerset house occupied by the Audit, Tax, and other Offices, on the North side by houses in the Strand on the East side by Strand Lane, and on the South side by the River Thames, except such right of Carriageway and Footway as therein mentioned as a Site for a College to be erected thereon, and called 'King's College, London'".

====Duel in Battersea Fields, 21 March 1829====

The Duke of Wellington's simultaneous support for an Anglican King's College and the Roman Catholic Relief Act, which was to lead to the granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters wished for King's to be subject to the Test Acts, like the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where only members of the Church of England could matriculate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begskings.html |title=Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster – King's College London|publisher=Institute of Education|accessdate=13 February 2013 [/tpl] "Londoners who did study, for example in Oxford or Cambridge, had to be quite rich and also members of the Anglican Church." but this was not Wellington's intent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=2723 |title=The famous Duel|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=13 February 2013 [/tpl]
Winchilsea and about 150 other contributors withdrew their support of the new College in response to Wellington's support of Catholic emancipation. Accusations against Wellington were published in a letter to the Standard on 14 March where Winchilsea charged the Prime Minister with insincerity in his support for the new College.Harte (1986), p. 73[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/wellington/duel/insult |title=Winchilsea insults Wellington|publisher=King's College London College Archives|accessdate=13 February 2013 [/tpl] In a letter to Wellington he wrote, "I have come to view the College as an instrument in a wider programme designed to promote the Roman Catholic faith and undermine the established church." Winchilsea also accused the Duke to have in mind "insidious designs for the infringement of our liberty and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State".Holmes (2002), p. 275
The letter provoked a furious exchange of correspondence and Wellington accused Winchilsea of imputing him with "disgraceful and criminal motives" in setting up King's College. When Winchilsea refused to retract the remarks, Wellington – by his own admission, "no advocate of duelling" and a virgin duellist – demanded satisfaction in a contest of arms: "I now call upon your lordship to give me that satisfaction for your conduct which a gentleman has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give."
The result was a duel in Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/document.doc?id=41 |title=Duel Day – Questions and Answers|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=9 February 2013 [/tpl] Winchilsea did not fire, a plan he and his second almost certainly decided upon before the duel; Wellington took aim and fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether Wellington missed on purpose. Wellington, noted for his poor aim, claimed he did, other reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/wellington/duel/fire |title=Open Fire! |publisher=King's College London College Archives |accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] Honour was saved and Winchilsea wrote Wellington an apology. "Duel Day" is still celebrated on the first Thursday after 21 March every year, marked by various events throughout the College, including re-enactments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=539&year=2007|title=Alumni celebrate Duel Day|publisher=King's College London|year=2007|accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl]

===19th century===

King's opened in October 1831 with William Otter, a clergyman, appointed as first Principal and lecturer in divinity. Despite the intentions of its founders and the chapel at the heart of its buildings, the initial prospectus permitted, "nonconformists of all sorts to enter the college freely".Hearnshaw (1929), p. 80 William Howley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, presided over the opening ceremony in which a sermon was given in the chapel by Charles Blomfield, the Bishop of London, on the subject of combining religious instruction with intellectual culture. The governors and the professors, except the linguists, had to be members of the Church of England but the students did not,Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 462 though attendance at Chapel was compulsory.Prospectus of King's College, London: academical year 1854-5, p. 7
The College was divided into a Senior department and a Junior department, also known as King's College School, which was originally situated in the basement of the Strand Campus. The Junior department started with 85 pupils and only three teachers, but quickly grew to 500 by 1841, outgrowing its facilities and leading it to relocate to Wimbledon in 1897 where it remains today, though it is no longer associated with the College. Within the Senior department teaching was divided into three courses. A general course comprised divinity, classical languages, mathematics, English literature and history. Secondly, there was the medical course. Thirdly, miscellaneous subjects, such as law, political economy and modern languages, which were not related to any systematic course of study at the time and depended for their continuance on the supply of occasional students. In 1833 the general course was reorganised leading to the award of the Associate of King's College (A.K.C.), the first qualification issued by King's. The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today to students and staff who take an optional three-year course alongside their studies.
The river frontage was completed in April 1835 at a cost of £7,100,Thompson (1986), p. 6 its completion a condition of the College securing the site from the Crown. Unlike those in the school, student numbers in the Senior department remained almost stationary during the first five years of the College's existence. During this time the medical school was blighted by inefficiency and the divided loyalties of the staff leading to a steady decline in attendance. One of the most important appointments was that of Charles Wheatstone as professor of Experimental Philosophy.
At this time, neither King's, nor "London University" had the ability to confer degrees, a particular problem for medical students who wished to practise. Amending this situation was aided by the appointment of Henry Brougham, as Lord Chancellor, who was chairman of the governors of "London University". In this position he automatically became a governor of King's. In the understanding that the government was unlikely to grant degree-awarding powers on two institutions in London, negotiations led to the colleges federating as the "University of London" in 1836, "London University" thus becoming University College. The governors at King's were offended at the exclusion of divinity from the syllabus by the federal university which was founded as an examining body and advised students to take the Oxford or Cambridge examinations, however, the power of the university to confer degrees marked a period of limited expansion at the College.
In 1840 the College opened King's College Hospital on Portugal Street near Lincoln's Inn Fields, an area composed of overcrowded rookeries characterised by poverty and disease. The governance of the hospital was later transferred to the corporation of the hospital established by the King's College Hospital Act 1851, and eventually moved to new premises in Denmark Hill, Camberwell in 1913. The appointment in 1877 of Joseph Lister as professor of clinical surgery greatly benefited the medical school, and the introduction of Lister's antiseptic surgical methods gained the hospital an international reputation. In 1855 the College pioneered evening classes in London. In 1882 the King's College London Act amended the constitution, the objects of the College extended to include the education of women.

The King's College London Act 1903, abolished all remaining religious tests for staff, except within the Theological department. The end of the World War I saw an influx of students, which strained existing facilities to the point where some classes were held in the Principal's house. A government proposal to relocate the College premises to Bloomsbury was considered, but finally rejected in 1925.Harte (1986), p. 203 During the Second World War most students and staff were evacuated out of London to Bristol and Glasgow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/the-blitz|title=King's and the Blitz, September 1940|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] The College buildings were used by the Auxiliary Fire Service with a number of College staff, mainly those then known as College servants, serving as firewatchers.

One of the most famous pieces of scientific research performed at King's were the crucial contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, together with Raymond Gosling, Alex Stokes, Herbert Wilson and other colleagues at the Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics at King's.Maddox (2002), p. 124[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/wilkinsfranklin.aspx |title=Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=21 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/biohealth/research/divisions/randall/about/history/dna.aspx |title=King's, DNA & the continuing story |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=21 January 2013[/tpl]
Major reconstruction of the College began in 1966 following the publication of the Robbins Report on Higher Education. A new block facing the Strand designed by E. D. Jefferiss Mathews was opened in 1972. The College underwent several mergers with other institutions, including Queen Elizabeth College and Chelsea College of Science and Technology in 1985, the Institute of Psychiatry in 1997, and the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals were reincorporated in 1998 after becoming independent of the College at the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/dates.aspx |title=Dates: 1900–1949 |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=King's College London[/tpl] In 1998 Florence Nightingale's original training school for nurses merged with the King's Department of Nursing Studies as the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery. The same year the College acquired the former Public Records Office building on Chancery Lane and converted it at a cost of £35 million into the Maughan Library, which opened in 2002.

===2001 to present===

In 2003, the College was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right, as opposed to through the University of London, by the Privy Council. This power remained unexercised until 2007, when the College announced that all students starting courses from September 2007 onwards would be awarded degrees conferred by King's itself, rather than by the University of London. The new certificates however still make reference to the fact that King's is a constituent college of the University of London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/services/examinations/certificates/CERTFAQ.pdf|title=Certificate FAQs|accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] All current students with at least one year of study remaining were in August 2007 offered the option of choosing to be awarded a University of London degree or a King's degree. In 2007, for the second consecutive year, students from the School of Law won the national round of the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. The Jessup moot is the largest international mooting competition in the world.

==Campus==

===Strand Campus===

The Strand Campus is the founding campus of King's. It is located on the Strand in the City of Westminster, sharing its frontage along the River Thames. Most of the Schools of Arts & Humanities, Law, Social Science & Public Policy and Natural & Mathematical Sciences (formerly Physical Sciences & Engineering) are housed here. The campus combines the Grade I listed King's Building of 1831 designed by Sir Robert Smirke, and the Byzantine Gothic College Chapel, redesigned in 1864 by Sir George Gilbert Scott with the more modern Strand Building, completed in 1972. The Chesham Building in Surrey Street was purchased after the Second World War. The Macadam Building of 1975 houses the Strand Campus Students' Union centre and is named after King's alumnus Sir Ivison Macadam, first President of the National Union of Students.
Marble statues of Sappho and Sophocles were bequeathed by Frida Mond in 1923, a friend of Israel Gollancz, Professor of English Language and Literature at King's. They were placed in the lobby of the King's Building, where they have remained ever since.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/the-mond-bequest|title=The Mond Bequest at King's College London: A Celebration|publisher=King's College London|date=March 2011|accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]

====Chapel====

The original college chapel was designed by Sir Robert Smirke and was completed in 1831 as part of the College building (later known as the King's building).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/principal/dean/chaplaincy/strand/chapel/history.pdf |title=A brief history of the Chapel |accessdate=20 January 2013 |publisher=King's College London[/tpl] Given the foundation of the university in the tradition of the Church of England the chapel was intended to be an integral part of the campus.Heulin (1979), p. 1 This is reflected in its central location within the King's Building on the first floor above the Great Hall, accessible via a grand double staircase from the foyer. The original chapel was described as a low and broad room "fitted to the ecclesiological notions of George IV's reign." However, by the mid nineteenth century its style had fallen out of fashion and in 1859 a proposal by the College Chaplain Reverend E. H. Plumptre that the original chapel should be reconstructed was approved by the College Council, who agreed that its "meagreness and poverty" made it unworthy of King's.
The College approached Sir George Gilbert Scott to make proposals. In his proposal of 22 December 1859 he suggested that, "There can be no doubt that, in a classic building, the best mode of giving ecclesiastical character is the adoption of the form and, in some degree, the character of an ancient basilica." His proposals for a chapel modelled on the lines of an classical basilica were accepted and the reconstruction was completed in 1864 at a cost of just over £7,000.

In December 2009, the College signed a 78-year lease to the East Wing of Somerset House.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/somersethouse/index.php?id=76 |title=The historic announcement |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=22 January 2013[/tpl] It has been described as one of the longest-ever property negotiations, taking over 180 years to complete.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2012/02Feb/The-Queen-opens-Somerset-House-East-Wing,-Kings-new-front-door.aspx |title=The Queen opens Somerset House East Wing |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] Since the College was built it has been in various discussions to expand into one of the wings of Somerset House itself, however, the relationship between the College and HM Revenue and Customs that occupied the East Wing were sometimes difficult.[tpl]cite journal|title=Report (2010)|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/publications/report/Report2010.pdf|publisher=King's College London|first=Geoff|last=Browell|year=2011|page=51|accessdate=12 February 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/somersethouse/index.php?id=27 |title=Background |publisher=King's College London |accessdate=22 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/history/since-the-18th-century |title=Since the 18th century|publisher=Somerset House Trust|accessdate=12 February 2013 [/tpl] Sir Robert Smirke's design of King's was sympathetic to that of Somerset House which is situated adjacent to the Strand Campus.Harte (1986), p. 72 Indeed, a condition of the College acquiring the site in the 1820s was that it should be erected "on a plan which would complete the river front of Somerset House at its eastern extremity in accordance with the original design of Sir William Chambers" which had for so long offended "every eye of taste for its incomplete appearance".
In 1875, a dispute arose when new windows were added to the façade overlooking the College. Following a complaint by the College Council at the loss of privacy, the response of the Metropolitan Board of Works was that "the terms under which the college is held are not such as to enable the Council to restrict Her Majesty from opening windows in Somerset House whenever she may think proper". By the end of World War I the College began to outgrow its premises which led to rekindled efforts to acquire the East Wing. There was even a suggestion that the College should be relocated to new premises in Bloomsbury to alleviate space concerns, however, these plans never came to fruition. Instead, a new top floor was added to the King's Building to house the Anatomy Department and other buildings along Surrey Street were purchased.
Following the publication of the Robbins Report on Higher Education in 1963 a further attempt was made to acquire the East Wing. The Report recommended a large expansion in student numbers accommodated by a new building programme. The "quadrilateral plan" was to create a campus stretching from Norfolk Street in the east to Waterloo Bridge Road in the west. Plans were also drawn up for modern high-rise buildings along the Strand and Surrey Street to house a new library and laboratories. A contemporary report stated that the redevelopment would provide "London with a university precinct on the Strand of which the capital could be proud". The plans were revisited in the early 1970s by the then Principal, Sir John Hackett, however, progress was prevented by funding problems and the unwillingness of the Government to re-house its civil servants. In 1971 the Evening Standard led a public campaign for Somerset House to be transformed into a new public arts venue for London. Proposals were also aired for the relocation of the Tate Gallery to the site. In the 1990s the eventual vacation by government departments and a comprehensive restoration programme saw the opening of the Courtauld Gallery, the Gilbert and Hermitage collections and the Edmond J. Safra Fountain Court.
In early 2010 a £25 million renovation of the East Wing was undertaken and took 18 months to complete. On 29 February 2012, Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the building. It is home to the School of Law, a public exhibition space called the Inigo Rooms curated by the King's Cultural Institute as well as adding a further entrance to the Strand Campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cultural/inigo-rooms/index.aspx |title=Inigo Rooms|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=22 January 2013[/tpl]

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms displayed on the College Charter is that of George IV. The shield depicts the royal coat of arms together with an inescutcheon of the House of Hanover, while the supporters embody the College motto of [tpl]lang|lat|sancte et sapienter[/tpl]. No correspondence is believed to have survived regarding the choice of this coat of arms, either in the College Archives or at the College of Arms, and a wide variety of unofficial adaptations have been used during the history of the College. The current coat of arms was developed following the mergers with Queen Elizabeth College and Chelsea College in 1985, and incorporates aspects of their heraldry. The College's coat of arms, in heraldic terminology, is:[tpl]citation|title=King's College London Corporate identity guidelines|year=2008|page=4|author=King's College London[/tpl]

==Student life==

===King's College London Students' Union===

Founded in 1873, King's College London Union Society which later developed into King's College London Students' Union, better known by its acronym KCLSU, is the oldest Students' Union in London (University College London Union being founded in 1893)[tpl]cite web|url=http://uclu.org/ |title=UCLU |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=University College London Union[/tpl] and has a claim to being the oldest Students' Union in England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/dates.aspx |title=Dates: 1850–1899 |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=King's College London[/tpl] "1873 – The first students' Union Society is instituted at King's."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/k-o/10ki80-1 |title=KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: Union of Students |date=March 2001 |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=King's College London Archives[/tpl] "Records, 1874–1994, of King's College London Union Society, Students' Union, and other student societies". The Students' Union provides a wide range of activities and services, including over 50 sports clubs (which includes the Boat Club which rows on the River Thames and the Rifle Club which uses the College's shooting range located at the disused Aldwych tube station beneath the Strand Campus),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kclsu.org/page.asp?section=1196&sectionTitle=Clubs |title=Clubs |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=KCLSU[/tpl] over 200 activity groups,[tpl]cite web|url=http://kclsu.org/page.asp?section=1149&sectionTitle=Activities |title=Activities |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=KCLSU[/tpl] a wide range of volunteering opportunities, two bars/eateries (The Waterfront and Guy's Bar), a shop (King's Shop) and a gym (Kinetic Fitness Club). Between 1992 and 2013 the Students' Union operated a nightclub, Tutu's, named after alumnus Desmond Tutu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/farewell-tutus|title=Farewell Tutu's: nightclub closes after over 20 years|publisher=King's College London Alumni Online|accessdate=12 September 2013[/tpl]
The former President of KCLSU Sir Ivison Macadam, after whom the Students' Union building on the Strand Campus has since been named, went on to be elected as the first President of the National Union of Students, and KCLSU has played an active role there and in the University of London Union ever since.
KCLSU publishes a monthly newspaper called Roar! which carries news stories, reviews and features on a range of topics and reporting on Students' Union events, campaigns, clubs and societies, as well as coverage of the arts, books and fashion.
Reggie the Lion (informally Reggie) is the official mascot of the Students' Union. In total there are three Reggies in existence. The original can be found on display in the Macadam Building in the Students' Union student centre at the Strand Campus. A papier-mâché Reggie lives outside the Great Hall at the Strand Campus and a small sterling silver incarnation is displayed during graduation ceremonies.

===Sports===

There are over 50 sports clubs, many of which compete in the University of London and British Universities & Colleges (BUCS) leagues across the South East. The annual Macadam Cup is a varsity match played between the sports teams of King's College London proper (KCL) and King's College London Medical School (KCLMS).

===Student-led think tank===

In November 2011, KCL students founded London's first student-led think tank, the KCL Think Tank. With a membership of around 2000, it is the largest organisation of its kind in Europe.[tpl]cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Kieran|title=Opening up the think tank|url=http://thegatewayonline.com/articles/student-life/kcl-think-tank-society|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Gateway|date=30 October 2012[/tpl] This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, NGOs and other policymakers with their ideas.

===Rivalry with University College London===

Competition within the University of London is most intense between King's and University College London, the two oldest institutions. Indeed, the University of London when it was established has been described as "an umbrella organisation designed to disguise the rivalry between UCL and KCL."Thompson (1990), p. 7 In the early twentieth century, King's College London and UCL rivalry was centred on their respective mascots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelondonvarsity.com/#/history/4541866243|title=History – The London Varsity|publisher=The London Varsity|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden tobacconist's sign of a kilted Jacobite Highlander purloined from outside a shop in Tottenham Court Road during the celebrations of the relief of Ladysmith in 1900. King's later addition was a giant beer bottle representing "bottled youth". In 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas – Reggie the Lion, who made his debut at a King's-UCL sporting rag in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with T-squares. Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual freshers' processions by King's students around Aldwych in which new students were typically flour bombed.
Although riots between respective College students occurred in central London well into the 1950s, rivalry is now limited to the rugby union pitch and skulduggery over mascots, with an annual Varsity match taking place between King's College London RFC and University College London RFC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unisportonline.co.uk/The-London-Varsity-LIVE/Sports-News/|title=The London Varsity Live|date=29 February 2012|publisher=UniSportOnline|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]

===Rivalry with the London School of Economics===

On 2 December 2005, tensions between King's and the London School of Economics (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in Aldwych near the Strand Campus) diverted off from the annual "barrel run" and caused an estimated £32,000 (The Beaver, LSESU student newspaper, 26 September 2006) of damage to the English department at King's.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4506664.stm|title=Students in university rampage|publisher=BBC News |date=7 December 2005|accessdate=20 November 2006[/tpl] Principal Sir Rick Trainor called for no retaliation and LSE Students' Union were forced to issue an apology as well as foot the bill for the damage repair. While LSE officially condemned the action, a photograph was published in The Beaver which was later picked up by The Times that showed LSE Director Sir Howard Davies drinking with members of the LSE Students' Union shortly before the barrel run and subsequent "rampage" began. King's appears to have been targeted, however, principally owing to its close proximity to LSE rather than by any ill-feeling. There is also somewhat of a sporting rivalry between the two institutions, albeit to a lesser extent than with UCL.
