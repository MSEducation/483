[[Northern State Conference (IHSAA)]]

The Northern State Conference is the name of two separate IHSAA-Sanctioned athletic conferences. The current version is an eight-member conference within the Northern Indiana counties of Elkhart, LaPorte, Marshall, St. Joseph, and Starke Some Schools draw students from Fulton, Kosciusko and Pulaski counties.
The earlier NSC lasted from 1954 to 1963, including schools from Carroll, Elkhart, Jasper, Marshall, Newton, St. Joseph, and Starke counties. Jimtown was the only holdover from the earlier conference into the modern one, though Bremen and Knox did join the current version in the 1980s.
In 2013, Culver and Knox announced that they would be leaving the conference after the 2014-2015 school year in order to join the Hoosier North Athletic Conference with three schools from the Midwest Conference and Independent North Judson. LaVille and Triton will also join the HNAC at the same time. This will effectively end the conference, as the remaining four schools will join the Northern Indiana Athletic Conference for the 2015-16 school year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/nic-expands-adding-bremen-jimtown-new-prairie-and-glenn/25629210 |title=UPDATE: NIC expands, adding Bremen, Jimtown, New Prairie and Glenn |author=Pete Byrne |publisher=WSBT TV, South Bend, IN |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl]
