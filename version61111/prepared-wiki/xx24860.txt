[[Politics of Iran]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Iran, Government of Iran, Economy of Iran

The politics of Iran take place in a framework of theocracy in a format of Syncretic politics that is guided by an Islamist ideology. The December 1979 constitution, and its 1989 amendment, define the political, economic, and social order of the Islamic Republic of Iran, declaring that  Shi'a Islam of the Twelver school of thought is Iran's official religion.
Iran has an elected president, parliament (or Majlis), and an "Assembly of Experts" (which elects the Supreme Leader of Iran), and local councils. According to the constitution all candidates running for these positions must be vetted by the Guardian Council (with the exception of those running for "Assembly of Experts") before being elected.
In addition there are nontransparent unelected organizations (usually under Supreme Leader's control) trying to "protect the state's Islamic character".IRAN: POLITICS, THE MILITARY AND GULF SECURITY by Darius Bazargan, v.1, n.3, September 1997

==Political conditions==

As in almost all revolutions, the early days of the government were characterized by political tumult. In November 1979 the American embassy was seized and its occupants taken hostage and kept captive for 444 days. The eight-year Iran–Iraq War killed hundreds of thousands and cost the country billions of dollars.  By mid-1982, a succession of power struggles eliminated first the center of political spectrum and then the RepublicansMoin, Khomeini (2001), p.21-234Arjomand, Said Amir, The Turban for the Crown : The Islamic Revolution in Iran, Oxford University Press, c1988,  p.144Bakhash, Shaul, Reign of the Ayatollahs : Iran and the Islamic Revolution by Shaul, Bakhash, Basic Books, c1984  p.158-9 leaving the Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters in power.
Iran's post-revolution challenges have included the imposition of economic sanctions and suspension of diplomatic relations with Iran by the United States because of the hostage crisis and other acts of terrorism that the U.S. government and some others have accused Iran of sponsoring. Emigration has cost Iran "two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)."

(Keddie, Modern Iran, 2003, p.274)
The Islamic Republic Party was Iran's ruling political party and for some years its only political party until its dissolution in 1987. Iran had no functioning political parties until the Executives of Construction Party formed in 1994 to run for the fifth parliamentary elections, mainly out of executive body of the government close to the then-president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. After the election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997, more parties started to work, mostly of the reformist movement and opposed by hard-liners. This led to incorporation and official activity of many other groups, including hard-liners.
The Iranian Government is opposed by a few armed political groups, including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, the People's Fedayeen, and the Kurdish Democratic Party.
For other political parties see List of political parties in Iran.

==Supreme Leader==

The most powerful political office in the Islamic Republic is that of the Supreme Leader, of which there have been two: the founder of the Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and his successor, Ali Khamenei.
Historically the Supreme Leader has remained aloof from election politics. However, in the 2009 election, some of the pronouncements by Ali Khamenei were perceived by many to favor the incumbent candidate.
The Leader appoints the heads of many powerful posts - the commanders of the armed forces, the director of the national radio and television network, the heads of the major religious foundations, the prayer leaders in city mosques, and the members of national security councils dealing with defence and foreign affairs. He also appoints the chief judge, the chief prosecutor, special tribunals and, with the help of the chief judge, half of the 12 jurists of the Guardian Council – the powerful body that decides both what bills may become law and who may run for president or parliament.[ref]"Who's in Charge?" by
Ervand Abrahamian London Review of Books, 6 November 2008[/ref] Also according to Iranian constitution the Supreme Leader asserts the authority of the president. He can veto the laws made by the parliament and traditionally he permits for presidential candidates to proclaim their candidacy

==Executive branch==

The Constitution defines the President as the highest state authority after the Supreme Leader. The President is elected by universal suffrage, by those 18 years old and older,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]  for a term of four years. Presidential candidates must be approved by the Council of Guardians prior to running. After being elected, the president must be appointed by the Supreme Leader. The President is responsible for the implementation of the Constitution and for the exercise of executive powers, except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader. The President appoints and supervises the Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. Currently, 10 Vice-Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of 21 ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature. Unlike many other states, the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces. Although the President appoints the Ministers of Intelligence and Defense, it is customary for the President to obtain explicit approval from the Supreme Leader for these two ministers before presenting them to the legislature for a vote of confidence.

==Legislative branch==

The current legislature of Iran is unicameral. Before the Iranian Revolution, the legislature was bicameral, with the senate (upper house) half elected, half appointed by the Shah. The senate was removed in the new constitution.

===Parliament===

The Parliament of Iran, or Majlis, comprises 290 members elected for four-year terms. The Parliament drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. All Parliament candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the Council of Guardians.

===Guardian Council===

The Guardian Council is composed of 12 jurists, including six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader, and six jurists elected by the Majles from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial System. The Council interprets the constitution and may reject bills from parliament deemed incompatible with the constitution or Sharia (Islamic law). These are referred back to parliament for revision. In a controversial exercise of its authority, the Council has drawn upon a narrow interpretation of Iran's constitution to veto parliamentary candidates.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
As of the early 1990s, the Guardian Council vets (approves) candidates for national election in Iran.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
According to the CIA World Factbook, The Guardian Council is a part of the Executive branch of the government.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#Govt |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]

===Expediency Council===

The Expediency Council has the authority to mediate disputes between the Majlis and the Council of Guardians, and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, making it one of the most powerful governing bodies in the country.
Its members include heads of the three government branches, the clerical members of the Guardian Council and various other members appointed by the supreme leader for three-year terms. Cabinet members and parliamentary leaders also serve as temporary members when issues under their jurisdictions are under review.
U.S. Department of State Background Notes, Iran Chamber Society: "The Structure of Power in Iran," BBC: "Iran: Who Holds the Power?"

==Judicial branch==

The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the Judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the supreme court and the chief public prosecutor. There are several types of courts including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and "revolutionary courts" which deal with certain categories of offenses, including crimes against national security. The decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed. The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving lay people. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader. The Court’s rulings are final and cannot be appealed.

==Assembly of Experts==

The Assembly of Experts, which meets for at least two days, twice annually,Khobregan - Ashnaee[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] comprises 86 "virtuous and learned" clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms. Based on the laws approved by the first Assembly, the Council of Guardians has to determine candidates' eligibility using a written examination. The Assembly elects the Supreme Leader and has the constitutional authority to remove the Supreme Leader from power at any time. As all of their meetings and notes are strictly confidential, the Assembly has never been known to challenge any of the Supreme Leader's decisions.

==Political parties and elections==

These are the most recent elections that have taken place.

===Political pressure groups and leaders===

Active student groups include the pro-reform "Office for Strengthening Unity" and "the Union of Islamic Student Societies';

==Military==

The military and the Corps of the Guardians (often mistranslated as guards) of the Islamic Revolution (or Sepaah in Persian meaning the Corps) are charged with defending Iran's borders and Baseej (Persian for Mobilization) militia are charged with maintaining both external and internal security.

==Administrative divisions==

Iran consists of 31 provinces (ostaan-haa, singular: ostan): Ardabil, Azarbayjan-e Gharbi, Azarbayjan-e Sharqi, Alborz (Karaj), Bushehr, Chahar Mahall va Bakhtiari, Esfahan, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hamadan, Hormozgan, Ilam, Kerman, Kermanshahan, North Khorasan, Khorasan, South Khorasan, Khuzestan, Kohkiluyeh va Buyer Ahmadi, Kordestan, Lorestan, Markazi, Mazandaran, Qom, Qazvin, Semnan, Sistan va Baluchestan, Tehran, Yazd, Zanjan.
The provinces are each headed by a governor general. The provinces are further divided into counties, districts, and villages.

==Local government==

Local councils are elected by public vote to 4-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran. According to article 7 in Iran's Constitution, these local councils together with the Parliament are "decision-making and administrative organs of the State". This section of the constitution was not implemented until 1999 when the first local council elections were held across the country. Councils have many different responsibilities including electing mayors, supervising the activities of municipalities; studying the social, cultural, educational, health, economic, and welfare requirements of their constituencies; planning and coordinating national participation in the implementation of social, economic, constructive, cultural, educational and other welfare affairs.

==Public finance and fiscal policy==

===Budget===

Iran has two types of budget:
A unique feature of Iran's economy is the large size of the religious foundations whose combined budgets make up more than 30% that of the central government.Economist, Jan 18, 2003The Rise of the Pasdaran: RAND corporation Retrieved June 10, 2010Abrahamian, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p. 178

====Revenues====

In 2004, about 45 percent of the government's budget came from exports of oil and natural gas revenues, although this varies with the fluctuations in world petroleum markets and 31 percent came from taxes and fees. Overall, an estimated 50 percent of Iran's GDP was exempt from taxes in FY 2004.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf
As of 2010, oil income accounts for 80% of Iran's foreign currency revenues and 60% of the nation's overall budget.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=130736&sectionid=351020102|title=No Operation|publisher=Presstv.com|date=Jun 16, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl] Any surplus revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas are to be paid into the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF). The approved "total budget", including state owned commercial companies, was $295 billion for the same period.
The Government seeks to increase the share of tax revenue in the budget through the implementation of the economic reform plan through more effective tax collection from businesses.

====Expenditures====

Because of changes in the classification of budgetary figures, comparison of categories among different years is not possible. However, since the Revolution the government's general budget payments have averaged:
For a breakdown of expenditures for social and economic purposes, see attached chart.
In FY 2004, central government expenditures were divided as follows:
Among current expenditures, wages and salaries accounted for 36 percent; subsidies and transfers to households accounted for 22 percent (not including indirect subsidies). Earmarked expenditures totaled 13 percent of the central government total. Between FY 2000 and FY 2004, total expenditures and net lending accounted for about 26 percent of GDP. According to the Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs, Iran's subsidy reforms would save 20 percent of the country's budget.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/152977.html |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date=November 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]
According to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed in this very structure, the government could save at least 30 to 35 percent on its expenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1316.html |title=Ten Million Iranians Under "Absolute Poverty Line" |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2010-03-20 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]

In 2013 Iran's external debts stood at $7.2 billion compared with $17.3 billion in 2012.Iran's external debts cut by $10b, hit $7.2b: Central Bank Chief. Tehran Times, May 27, 2013. Retrieved August 24, 2013.

Notes:
 1) Since 2002, the latest International Monetary Fund Guidelines on government financial statistics have been used as a model to prepare annual budgetary acts. Accordingly, revenues are classified into “taxes and other revenues”, and “oil sales” which had earlier been classified as revenue are now referred to as "transfer of capital assets".
2) In 2007/08, it includes budget supplement at Rls. 9,500 billion.
3) The government budget does not include state revenues and expenses derived from state owned commercial entreprises.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
 4) The government budget does not account for subsides paid to state owned commercial enterprise. See also Subsidy reform plan.
 5) Excluding special revenues and expenditures and the figure for transparency in the price (subsidy) of energy bearers.

==Complexity of the system==

According to the constitution, the Guardian Council oversees and approves electoral candidates for most national elections in Iran. The Guardian Council has 12 members, six clerics, appointed by the Supreme Leader and six jurists, elected by the Majlis from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial System, who is appointed by the Supreme Leader. According to the current law, the Guardian Council approves the Assembly of Experts candidates, which in turn supervise and elect the Supreme Leader.
The reformists say this system creates a closed circle of power.Mojahedin-enghelab[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Iranian reformists, such as Mohammad-Ali Abtahi have considered this to be the core legal obstacle for the reform movement in Iran.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308224 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308301 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146307117 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/media.asp?id=10588595 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Media - Articles |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=1779650752 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2004-01-11 |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]
