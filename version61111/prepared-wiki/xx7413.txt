The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology[tpl]cite journal | last = Milgram | first = Stanley | year = 1963 | title = Behavioral Study of Obedience | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–8 | pmid = 14049516 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 | doi = 10.1037/h0040525[/tpl] as PDF. and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.[tpl]cite book |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View |publisher=Harpercollins |year=1974 |isbn=0-06-131983-X |ref=harv |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MlpEAAAAMAAJ[/tpl]
The experiments began in July 1961, three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Milgram devised his psychological study to answer the popular question at that particular time: "Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices?"[tpl]cite web | url=https://www.google.ca/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=%22Could+it+be+that+Eichmann+and+his+million+accomplices+in+the+Holocaust+were+just+following+orders%3F+Could+we+call+them+all+accomplices%3F%22 | title=Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders?

The experiments were also controversial and considered by some scientists to be unethical and physically or psychologically abusive. Psychologist Diana Baumrind considered the experiment "harmful because it may cause permanent psychological damage and cause people to be less trusting in the future."[tpl]cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=Diana|title=Some Thoughts on Ethics of Research: After Reading Milgram's "Behavioral Study of Obedience|journal=American Psychologist|year=1964|volume=19|pages=421–423|doi=10.1037/h0040128|issue=6[/tpl]

==The experiment==

Three individuals were involved: the one running the experiment, the subject of the experiment (a volunteer), and a confederate pretending to be a volunteer. These three people fill three distinct roles: the Experimenter (an authoritative role), the Teacher (a role intended to obey the orders of the Experimenter), and the Learner (the recipient of stimulus from the Teacher). The subject and the actor both drew slips of paper to determine their roles, but unknown to the subject, both slips said "teacher". The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read "learner", thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the "teacher". At this point, the "teacher" and "learner" were separated into different rooms where they could communicate but not see each other. In one version of the experiment, the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a heart condition.
The "teacher" was given an electric shock from the electroshock generator as a sample of the shock that the "learner" would supposedly receive during the experiment. The "teacher" was then given a list of word pairs that he was to teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-volt increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the teacher would read the next word pair.
The subjects believed that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, there were no shocks. After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject. After several times banging on the wall and complaining about his heart condition, all responses by the learner would cease.
At this point, many people indicated their desire to stop the experiment and check on the learner. Some test subjects paused at 135 volts and began to question the purpose of the experiment. Most continued after being assured that they would not be held responsible. A few subjects began to laugh nervously or exhibit other signs of extreme stress once they heard the screams of pain coming from the learner.
If at any time the subject indicated his desire to halt the experiment, he was given a succession of verbal prods by the experimenter, in this order:
If the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum 450-volt shock three times in succession.
The experimenter also gave special prods if the teacher made specific comments. If the teacher asked whether the learner might suffer permanent physical harm, the experimenter replied, "Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on." If the teacher said that the learner clearly wants to stop, the experimenter replied, "Whether the learner likes it or not, you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly, so please go on."

==Results==

Before conducting the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage. Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock. Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim refuses to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue and, they believed that "only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board."[tpl]cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Some Conditions of Obedience and Disobedience to Authority |journal=Human Relations |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=57–76 |year=1965 |doi=10.1177/001872676501800105 |ref=harv[/tpl]
In Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, though many were very uncomfortable doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment; some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment. Throughout the experiment, subjects displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. Subjects were sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting their lips, groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures.
Milgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article, "The Perils of Obedience", writing:

The original Simulated Shock Generator and Event Recorder, or shock box, is located in the Archives of the History of American Psychology.
Later, Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world, with similar results.[tpl]harvnb|Milgram|1974[/tpl] Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment's locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered, backstreet office in a bustling city, as opposed to at Yale, a respectable university. The level of obedience, "although somewhat reduced, was not significantly lower." What made more of a difference was the proximity of the "learner" and the experimenter. There were also variations tested involving groups.
Thomas Blass of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County performed a meta-analysis on the results of repeated performances of the experiment. He found that the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages remains remarkably constant, 61–66 percent, regardless of time or place.[tpl]cite journal |last=Blass |first=Thomas |title=The Milgram paradigm after 35 years: Some things we now know about obedience to authority |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=955–978 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb00134.x|ref=harv[/tpl] as PDF[tpl]cite journal |author=Blass, Thomas |title=The Man Who Shocked the World |journal=Psychology Today |volume=35 |issue=2 |date=Mar–Apr 2002 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200203/the-man-who-shocked-the-world[/tpl]
None of the participants who refused to administer the final shocks insisted that the experiment itself be terminated, nor left the room to check the health of the victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist Philip Zimbardo asked him about that point.Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo Ph.D. Updated Edition, "Power of the Situation," http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6059627757980071729, reference starts at 10min 59 seconds into video.
Milgram created a documentary film titled Obedience showing the experiment and its results. He also produced a series of five social psychology films, some of which dealt with his experiments.Milgram films. Accessed 4 October 2006.

==Criticism==

===Ethics===

The Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the research ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and inflicted insight suffered by the participants. In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were "glad" or "very glad" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding).[tpl]harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=195[/tpl] Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the Vietnam War), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:
[tpl]Cquote|While I was a subject in 1964, though I believed that I was hurting someone, I was totally unaware of why I was doing so. Few people ever realize when they are acting according to their own beliefs and when they are meekly submitting to authority… To permit myself to be drafted with the understanding that I am submitting to authority's demand to do something very wrong would make me frightened of myself… I am fully prepared to go to jail if I am not granted Conscientious Objector status. Indeed, it is the only course I could take to be faithful to what I believe. My only hope is that members of my board act equally according to their conscience…[tpl]cite book |author=Raiten-D'Antonio, Toni |title=Ugly as Sin: The Truth about How We Look and Finding Freedom from Self-Hatred |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bPxLyFEi3-EC&pg=PA89 |date=1 September 2010 |publisher=HCI |isbn=978-0-7573-1465-0|page=89[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=200[/tpl][/tpl]
Milgram argued that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about human nature.  Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's methodology. Author Gina Perry found[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] an unpublished paper in Milgram's archives that shows Milgram's own concern with how believable the experimental set-up was to subjects involved.  Milgram's unpublished analysis indicated that many subjects suspected that the experiment was a hoax, a finding that casts doubt on the veracity of his results. In the journal Jewish Currents, Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a "teacher", suspicious "that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period."Dimow, Joseph. "Resisting Authority: A Personal Account of the Milgram Obedience Experiments", Jewish Currents, January 2004.

===Applicability to Holocaust===

Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that "a common psychological process is centrally involved in both laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany events." Professor James Waller, Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College, formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments do not correspond well to the Holocaust events:
In the opinion of Thomas Blass—who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment (The Man Who Shocked The World) published in 2004—the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words:
[tpl]Cquote|Milgram's approach does not provide a fully adequate explanation of the Holocaust. While it may well account for the dutiful destructiveness of the dispassionate bureaucrat who may have shipped Jews to Auschwitz with the same degree of routinization as potatoes to Bremerhaven, it falls short when one tries to apply it to the more zealous, inventive, and hate-driven atrocities that also characterized the Holocaust.[tpl]cite web | url=http://analyse-und-kritik.net/en/1998-1/AK_Blass_1998.pdf | title=The Roots of Stanley Milgram's Obedience Experiments and Their Relevance to the Holocaust | publisher=Analyse und Kritik.net | year=2013 | accessdate=20 July 2013 | author=Blass, Thomas | format=PDF file, direct download 733 KB[/tpl][/tpl]

===Charges of data manipulation===

After an investigation of the test, Australian psychologist Gina Perry claimed that Milgram had manipulated his results."About Gina," gina-perry.com "Overall, over half disobeyed," Perry claimed.  For those who obeyed, there were, on one occasion, many more than four promptings, in fact as many was 26.Gina Perry (2012) Behind the Shock Machine: the untold story of the notorious Milgram psychology experiments, Scribe Publications. ISBN 978-1921844553. Several times, in fact, some subjects asked to swap places with the learner. Perry further claims that some subjects thought the entire procedure was a reality TV show.Tom Whipple, "Famous 'Nazi in all of us' experiment manipulated: Australian psychologist," The Australian (October 8, 2013).

==Interpretations==

Professor Milgram elaborated two theories:

===Alternative interpretations===

In his book Irrational Exuberance, Yale Finance Professor Robert Shiller argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments:
[tpl]Cquote|People have learned that when experts tell them something is all right, it probably is, even if it does not seem so.  (In fact, it is worth noting that in this case the experimenter was indeed correct: it was all right to continue giving the "shocks" — even though most of the subjects did not suspect the reason.)[tpl]cite book |author=Shiller, Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |year=2005 |page=158 |edition=2nd[/tpl][/tpl]
In a 2006 experiment, a computerized avatar was used in place of the learner receiving electrical shocks.  Although the participants administering the shocks were aware that the learner was unreal, the experimenters reported that participants responded to the situation physiologically "as if it were real".[tpl]cite journal |author=Slater M, Antley A, Davison A, et al. |editor1-last=Rustichini |editor1-first=Aldo |title=A virtual reprise of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=e39 |year=2006 |pmid=17183667 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000039 |pmc=1762398[/tpl]
For a 2009 episode of the BBC science documentary series Horizon, the Milgram experiment was replicated. Of the twelve participants, only three refused to continue to the end of the experiment. Speaking during the episode, social psychologist Clifford Stott discussed the influence that the idealism of scientific enquiry had on the volunteers. He remarked: "The influence is ideological. It's about what they believe science to be, that science is a positive product, it produces beneficial findings and knowledge to society that are helpful for society. So there's that sense of science is providing some kind of system for good."[tpl]Cite episode|title=How Violent Are You?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kk4bz|accessdate=8 May 2013|series=Horizon|serieslink=Horizon (BBC TV series)|credits=Presenter: Michael Portillo.

==Replications and variations==

===Milgram's variations===

In Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (1974), Milgram describes nineteen variations of his experiment, some of which had not been previously reported.
Several experiments varied the immediacy of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, thirty percent of participants completed the experiment.
In Experiment 8, women were the participants; previously, all participants had been men. Obedience did not significantly differ, though the women communicated experiencing higher levels of stress.
Experiment 10 took place in a modest office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, purporting to be the commercial entity "Research Associates of Bridgeport" without apparent connection to Yale University, to eliminate the university's prestige as a possible factor influencing the participants' behavior. In those conditions, obedience dropped to 47.5 percent, though the difference was not statistically significant.
Milgram also combined the effect of authority with that of conformity. In those experiments, the participant was joined by one or two additional "teachers" (also actors, like the "learner"). The behavior of the participants' peers strongly affected the results. In Experiment 17, when two additional teachers refused to comply, only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment. In Experiment 18, the participant performed a subsidiary task (reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner's answers) with another "teacher" who complied fully. In that variation, 37 of 40 continued with the experiment.Milgram, old answers. Accessed 4 October 2006. [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Replications===

Around the time of the release of Obedience to Authority in 1973–74, a version of the experiment was conducted at La Trobe University in Australia. As reported by Perry in her 2012 book Behind the Shock Machine, some of the participants experienced long-lasting psychological effects, possibly due to the lack of proper debriefing by the experimenter.[tpl]cite news|last=Elliott|first=Tim|title=Dark legacy left by shock tactics|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/dark-legacy-left-by-shock-tactics-20120425-1xlfw.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2012-04-26[/tpl]
In 2002, the British artist Rod Dickinson created The Milgram Re-enactment, an exact reconstruction of parts of the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used. An audience watched the four-hour performance through one-way glass windows.History Will Repeat Itself: Strategies of Re-enactment in Contemporary (Media) Art and Performance, ed. Inke Arns, Gabriele Horn, Frankfurt: Verlag, 2007[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.milgramreenactment.org|title=The Milgram Re-enactment|accessdate=2008-06-10[/tpl] A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in Glasgow in 2002.
A partial replication of the experiment was staged by British illusionist Derren Brown and broadcast on UK's Channel 4 in The Heist (2006).[tpl]cite web|url= http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=y6GxIuljT3w|title=The Milgram Experiment on YouTube|accessdate=2008-12-21[/tpl]
Another partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that "current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry M.|title=Replicating Milgram: Would People Still Obey Today?|journal=American Psychologist|year=2008 [/tpl] Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2765416&page=1|title=The Science of Evil|accessdate=2007-01-04[/tpl]
In the 2010 French documentary Le Jeu de la Mort (The Game of Death), researchers recreated the Milgram experiment with an added critique of reality television by presenting the scenario as a game show pilot. Volunteers were given €40 and told they would not win any money from the game, as this was only a trial. Only 16 of 80 "contestants" (teachers) chose to end the game before delivering the highest-voltage punishment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124838091|title=Fake TV Game Show 'Tortures' Man, Shocks France|accessdate=2010-10-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |title=Fake torture TV 'game show' reveals willingness to obey       |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-03-18 [/tpl]
The experiment was performed on Dateline NBC on an episode airing April 25, 2010.
The Discovery Channel aired the "How Evil are You" segment of Curiosity on October 30, 2011.  The episode was hosted by Eli Roth, who produced results similar to the original Milgram experiment, though the highest-voltage punishment used was 165 volts, rather than 450 volts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/how-evil-are-you.htm |title=Curiosity: How evil are you? |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl]
Due to increasingly widespread knowledge of the experiment, recent replications of the procedure have had to ensure that participants were not previously aware of it.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Other variations===

Charles Sheridan and Richard King (at the University of Missouri and the University of California, Berkley, respectively) hypothesized that some of Milgram's subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking, so they repeated the experiment with a real victim: a "cute, fluffy puppy" who was given real, albeit apparently harmless, electric shocks. Their findings were similar to those of Milgram: half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout. Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment, and some openly wept. In addition, Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher, meaning that for higher shock levels, subjects were more hesitant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.holah.co.uk/files/sheridan_king_1972.pdf|title=Sheridan & King (1972) – Obedience to authority with an authentic victim, Proceedings of the 80th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association 7: 165–6.|accessdate=2013-03-03[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Blass|1999|p=968[/tpl]
