[[Caca Bonita]]

CATEGORIES: Papa Roach EPs, 1995 EPs

Caca Bonita is the second EP by Californian rock band Papa Roach. It was released in 1995, recorded on a blue cassette tape. It consists of two demo tracks that would later be revamped, for an almost completely different sound, for their 1997 album, Old Friends from Young Years.

==Release==

As a demo tape it had a very limited release and as a result has become possibly the most sought after and valuable of all of Papa Roach's older releases. According to one fan after meeting Jacoby Shaddix after a show, he was told that not even the band themselves own a copy.

On Fuse TV's Daily Download, Dave Buckner explained the reason for the name Caca Bonita. The title for the EP means Pretty Shit in Spanish. It came when future bass guitarist Tobin Esperance was in his high school Spanish class, and the teacher went up to him and asked him a question, and all that Tobin could say was Caca Bonita.
