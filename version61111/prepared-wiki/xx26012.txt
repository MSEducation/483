[[Exquisite corpse]]

CATEGORIES: Paper-and-pencil games, Surrealist techniques, Collaboration, Random text generation

Exquisite corpse, also known as exquisite cadaver (from the original French term cadavre exquis) or rotating corpse, is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun," as in “The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge”) or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.

==History==

The technique was invented by Surrealists and is similar to an old parlour game called Consequences in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism principal founder André Breton reported that it started in fun, but became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion started about 1925, but Pierre Reverdy wrote that it started much earlier, at least before 1918.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Morgue_%5Bthe_corpses%5D.html|title=Morgue|last=Reverdy|first=Pierre|date=March 1918|publisher=Nord-Sud|accessdate=28 March 2009[/tpl]
In a variant now known as picture consequences, instead of sentences, portions of a person were drawn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/great-works/cozens-alexander-a-blot-tigers-c177080-744402.html|title=Cozens, Alexander: A Blot: Tigers (c. 1770–80)|quote=about Alexander Cozens|accessdate=24 September 2008|date=13 April 2007|last=Lubbock|first=Tom|work=The Independent|publisher=[/tpl]
Later the game was adapted to drawing and collage, producing a result similar to children's books in which the pages were cut into thirds, the top third pages showing the head of a person or animal, the middle third the torso, and the bottom third the legs, with children having the ability to "mix and match" by turning pages. The game has also been played with the usual orientation of foldings and four or fewer people, and there have been examples with the game played with only two people and the paper being folded widthwise and breadthwise, resulting in quarters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/photo.php?pid=8404780&id=728120642&ref=nf|last=Dumaine, Bernard and McKain|first=Janelle|title=4-panel exquisite corpse|accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl] It has been played by mailing a drawing or collage—in progressive stages of completion—to the players, and this variation is known as "Exquisite Corpse by airmail",[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] apparently regardless of whether the game fares by airmail or not.
The name is derived from a phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, "Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau." ("The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.")Breton, André (7 October 1948), Le Cadavre Exquis: Son Exaltation, exhibition catalogue, La Dragonne, Galerie Nina Dausset, Paris (October 7–30).[tpl]cite book|last=Brotchie|first=Alastair|coauthors=Mel Gooding|title=Surrealist Games|publisher=Redstone Press|year=1991|location=London|pages=143–144|isbn=1-870003-21-7[/tpl] André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends in an old house at 54 rue du Chateau (no longer existing). In the beginning were Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Prévert, Benjamin Péret, Pierre Reverdy, and André Breton. Other participants probably included Max Morise, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Simone Collinet, Tristan Tzara, Georges Hugnet, René Char, Paul, and Nusch Éluard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Bretons_Remembrances.html|title=Breton Remembers|last=Breton|first=André|date=7 October 1948[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pusanweb.com/poetryplus/poetryplus16/corpse/exquisite.htm#exquisite|title=The Exquisite Corpse|year=2009|publisher=Poetry Plus|accessdate=28 March 2009[/tpl]
Henry Miller often partook of the game to pass time in French cafés during the 1930s.

==Modern examples==

William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin were hugely influenced by Surrealism, mostly when referring to the cut-up technique, whose principles dialogue with the Cadavre Exquis play invented by the Surrealists.
Apichatpong Weerasethakul's 2000 film, Mysterious Object at Noon uses this technique with a mixture of documentary and fictional film.
The Exquisite Corpse Project, a 2012 feature-length comedy written using the exquisite corpse technique.
"Exquisite Corpse", a song by Shriekback from the 1992 album Sacred City.
Ecuadorian rock band Cadáver Exquisito are known by the use of this technique in order to create the lyrics for many of their songs.
