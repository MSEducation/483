The Lizard Head Wilderness is a wilderness area in southwest Colorado. It contains [tpl]convert|41309|acre|km2[/tpl] and is jointly managed by the Uncompahgre and San Juan National Forests. It is [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of the town of Telluride and is named for a prominent rock formation that is said to look like a lizard's head. Lizard Head itself is [tpl]convert|13113|ft|m[/tpl] and is a volcanic spire of crumbling rock. Due to the steepness of the cliffs and the poor quality of the rock for fixing ropes, only experienced mountaineers should attempt to summit the spire. Another [tpl]convert|37|mi|km[/tpl] of trails in this infrequently visited wilderness, are also strenuous and should be attempted by more advanced backpackers.[tpl]cite web |title=Lizard Head Wilderness |publisher=Wilderness.net |url=http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Lizard%20Head%20Wilderness |accessdate=August 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Lizard Head Wilderness Area |publisher=Colorado Wilderness |url=http://www.coloradowilderness.com/wildpages/lizard.html |accessdate=August 11, 2012[/tpl]
The area includes three prominent fourteeners: El Diente Peak ([tpl]convert|14159|ft|m[/tpl]), Wilson Peak ([tpl]convert|14017|ft|m[/tpl]), and Mount Wilson ([tpl]convert|14246|ft|m[/tpl]). The area includes the headwaters of the west fork of the Dolores River.
