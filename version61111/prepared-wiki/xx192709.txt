Love is the third album by Scottish group Aztec Camera, released in November 1987 on the WEA label.
Love was something of a stylistic departure for the group.  Various big-name producers were involved in the recording of the album which, with its radio-friendly hooks and glossy production values was an attempt to break the group in the American market.  It failed to do so, but did become Aztec Camera's most commercially successful album in the United Kingdom, where it reached #10 on the albums chart.  The single "Somewhere in My Heart" was also the group's most successful, peaking at #3.
Inevitably the nature of the album led to some accusations of sell out,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] and it remains an album which divides opinion.
