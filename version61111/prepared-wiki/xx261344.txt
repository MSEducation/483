In the north aisle is the Norman bowl of the font and further east the small turret steps behind a glass door that in earlier times led up into a rood loft. Although parts date from the 13th and 14th centuries the interior, as it is seen today, shows the work that was carried out in 1847 when the south, west and north walls were rebuilt except a portion east from the Lady Chapel. The nave and tower arches were reconstructed in the 15th century.[tpl]cite book |title=West Country Churches |last=Robinson |first=W.J. |year=1915 |publisher= Bristol Times and Mirror Ltd|location=Bristol |pages=202â€“205[/tpl]
