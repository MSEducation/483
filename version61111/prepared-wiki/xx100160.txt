CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Basilicata

Palazzo San Gervasio is a small agricultural town and comune in the province of Potenza, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata.  Its history dates back over 900 years.  It is bounded by the comuni (Municipalities) of Acerenza, Banzi, Forenza, Genzano di Lucania, Maschito, Spinazzola (BA), Venosa.  
While the regional Lucanian dialect is still spoken amongst the older inhabitants, it has largely been replaced because the younger generations have been taught the standard form of Italian in school.
