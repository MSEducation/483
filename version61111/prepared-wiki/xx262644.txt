==About the award==

NSERC's Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering was first awarded in 1991 to Raymond Lemieux, a chemist working at University of Alberta.[tpl]cite web|title=Past Winners|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Herzberg-Herzberg/Past-Anciens_eng.asp?Year=1993|publisher=Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl]  Mathematician James Arthur from the University of Toronto was the 1999 recipient,[tpl]cite web|title=Past Winners|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Herzberg-Herzberg/Past-Anciens_eng.asp?Year=1999|publisher=Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] the last year before the award was renamed in honour of Gerhard Herzberg, the winner of the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  NSERC decided to rename the award after Herzberg because they felt he embodied the two main qualities of the award, namely research contributions that are of high quality and influential.
The Herzberg medal is awarded to a scientist or engineer working at a facility in Canada.  It is considered Canada's top award for science and engineering.  Eligible facilities include universities, government and private labs.  Nominations can be submitted by any Canadian citizen or permanent resident.  The winner is chosen by a selection committee representing different scientific disciplines, who make a recommendations to the current NSERC president.[tpl]cite web|title=NSERC - Gerhard Herzberg - Call for nominations|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Herzberg-Herzberg/Nomination-Nomination_eng.asp|publisher=Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|accessdate=2011-01-08[/tpl]  The award consists of a gold medal, and the guarantee of at least $1 million to use for research or for establishing research chairs, fellowships or scholarships in the recipients' name.
