No school uniform is enforced, but are however required to follow school dress code; either uniform as sold by the school or school colours; green, white, grey, black and yellow. Students are required to carry an identification card and are allowed to leave the school premises during their non-timetabled periods. Student parking is also available for students driving to and from school.
