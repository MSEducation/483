==Plot==

The story is centred around specialist registrar Rob Lake (Max Beesley), who starts the first series in a new post in the Obstetrics and gynaecology Department at the fictional South Central Infirmary, under the guidance of consultant obstetrician Roger Hurley (Patrick Baladi).

==Broadcast history==

The first series debuted on BBC Three as the channel at this time was trying to break out into hour-long dramas. The first series soon made the move to a terrestrial channel as BBC Two aired it in the late 2004.  With end of the first series left open-ended, BBC Three and BBC Two co-commissioned a second series, increasing the number of episodes from six to ten.  
BBC Two debuted the second series in September 2005 with BBC Three airing the next episode straight after the episode on BBC Two. Despite widespread critical acclaim, the BBC did not order a third series as it was not possible to renew the co-commission from both BBC3 and BBC2.
After the second series ended, Max Beesley told BBC Radio 1's The Chris Moyles Show that an additional one or two episodes were being planned to conclude the series. The drama has been described as a "dark, sometimes funny" take on the favourite genre made popular through shows such as Casualty and Holby City.
The series, starring Max Beesley, Keith Allen and Patrick Baladi has developed a cult following with its gritty storylines and gruesome theatre scenes.  The series was also broadcast to American audiences on digital channel BBC America during the late summer/early autumn of 2005.
The last episode was broadcast on 13 December 2006 on BBC Three.

==Series 1==

It soon becomes apparent to Lake that Hurley, a friendly and professional doctor with a strong academic background, is nevertheless incompetent as a surgeon and regularly bungles surgical procedures, to the detriment of his patients. Hurley is, however, protected by a shroud of silence: "Doctors look after doctors" is a commonly repeated phrase in the series.   
Initially, Lake seeks to become a 'whisteblower' after seeing Hurley's gross incompetence and negligence, particularly after he badly mishandles a  birth in which an abruption occurred, leaving the mother suffering substantial brain damage. 
However, pressure from outside authorities, hospital politics and blackmail from Hurley eventually forces Lake into silence. Unable to oust him yet forced to work with him, Lake soon seeks a way out and finds one with a post at another hospital. But Hurley, despite agreeing that he should move on, changes his mind, scuppers Lake's opportunity by informing his new employers there of some of the mistakes Lake had made and his real reasons for wanting to leave. 
At the end of the season, Lake is stuck in the doldrums at the same hospital whilst Hurley soon comes in line for promotion as the hospital's clinical director.

==Series 2==

The series continues with the main overlying storyline of the constant struggle between Hurley and Lake. 
At the start of the second series, Lake is about to leave the hospital but, with no real job prospects elsewhere, he decides to remain. Lake and Hurley then begin to form a respectful professional relationship, with Lake turning a blind eye to Hurley's incompetence. 
Despite this, Donna Rix, a nurse with whom Lake was having an affair, views Hurley's ineptitude with increasing alarm. She starts to vocalize her distress and sends anonymous letters to Hurley and other members of staff in an attempt to bring wider attention to this issue. Lake, seeing this, pleads with Donna to act with restraint, claiming that Hurley will be brought down but not in this fashion. 
Towards the end of the series, Hurley's life begins to take a downward spiral. Attempts to have another child are scuppered after he finds out he has a low sperm count and furthermore, is suspected of having an affair with a fellow doctor, soon leading to the breakdown of his marriage.

==Finale==

This 90-minute finale of the whole series, aired only on BBC Three, took up the story approximately three years after the end of the previous season. 
Rob is now placed at a University Hospital and is about to father a child with co-worker Polly Grey (Tamzin Malleson). Hurley's life however has continued to deteriorate. He is forced to resign from his position after being arrested for indecent exposure and takes up a new job coincidentally at Rob's new place of work. Donna on the other hand has left nursing altogether and has become a journalist. 
When Lake and Hurley meet up once more, old tensions are revived. However, Hurley's reputation has experienced significant decline and is a far weaker figure in Lake's eyes. Consequently, he renews his attacks on Hurley's incompetence with renewed vigour, especially after encountering another maternal and foetal death at the hands of Hurley; and also by the fact Lake has begun to show symptoms of almost certainly fatal disease, vCJD due to Hurley cutting Lake during a surgical operation, so feels he has little to lose. 
Around this time, Lake's girlfriend Polly then goes into labour. Complications soon arise and the baby has to be delivered surgically, bringing Lake into direct conflict with Hurley. Hurley begins to operate,  however halfway through, Lake, fearing further harm to mother and child,  forces him to step aside and allow him to finish. The birth goes through successfully, but Polly is so distraught by the process that she promises that he will never see her or his baby. Consequently, Lake, without a family and with a potentially fatal disease decides to fully indict Hurley. Knowing that it will ruin his career, Lake reports Hurley to the General Medical Council, subsequently suspending him from his position as consultant at University Hospital. The special ends with Lake sitting down with a fellow consultant where he then finds out whether he has contracted the human strain of Mad cow disease; however they are not revealed to the viewer.

==Style==

The series was quite different from most other archetypal British hospital dramas. The surgical scenes were notable for their graphic nature, offering intimate detail of various procedures, the operational complications dealt with in explicit detail. As a result the themes were also often dark and depressing, including negligence, manipulation and death. 
The storyline closest to one of love was the Rob and Donna affair, and even that was portrayed at times as being sordid and depraved, underlining the sombre nature of the show.
