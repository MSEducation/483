The Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase is an American Grade I NSA sanctioned steeplechase race run each fall over the rolling hills of Moorland Farms in Far Hills, New Jersey.  Set over a 2⅝ mile course during the one day Far Hills Races, it has 14 national fences, and a purse of $300,000.  This new purse, increased in 2006, makes it the richest event in American steeplechase racing.
The race dates back to 1899 and was long the premier stakes in U.S. jump racing.  Past winners include 11 of the 14 steeplechasers inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame: Flatterer (also a close second in the 1987 Champion Hurdle), Zaccio, Café Prince, Bon Nouvel, Neji, Oedipus, Elkridge, Bushranger, Battleship (in 1938 became the only winner of this race and the Aintree Grand National), Jolly Roger and Good and Plenty. 
The race has been held at Belmont Park, at Saratoga Race Course, and at Morris Park racetracks, as well as the steeplechase meets at Fair Hill, Maryland and Charlottesville, Virginia.
The Grand National (once called the American Grand National) is one of the oldest races in steeplechasing and one of the most important outside Europe.  It has been brought back from oblivion by the dedication of a combination of steeplechase enthusiasts.  Run in 2006 for the 14th time in its latest incarnation, the day of steeplechasing at Far Hills includes seven races, the most important of which is the Grand National.
