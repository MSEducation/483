The town was first settled on May 7, 1829, when its founder, Hiram Capron, bought the land for $10,000[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald A.|title=At the forks of the Grand : 20 historical essays on Paris, Ontario|page=15|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3616620[/tpl]  and built a mill on the present townsite.  The town of Paris was officially established in 1856.  Since the late 1990s, Paris has experienced substantial population growth, which may be in part attributed to the rising popularity of rural communities among GTA bound commuters (see bedroom community) and the completion of Highway 403 between Hamilton and Woodstock.
Paris was named for the nearby deposits of gypsum, used to make plaster of Paris. Paris is referred to as "the cobblestone capital of Canada" (in reference to a number of aged cobblestone houses). Paris, Ontario is located at [tpl]Coord|43|12|N|80|23|W|[/tpl].
