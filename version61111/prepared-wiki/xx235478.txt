Great Moments in History was a dramatic radio series broadcast on NBC in 1927-28. It offered recreations of famed historical situations.
The program was the creation of actor-director Gerald Stoop, a New York Theater Guild member, and playwright Henry Fisk Carlton, an English instructor at New York University and a graduate of Harvard's Dramatic Work Shop. Carlton was previously involved in the production of other NBC programs, including Re-told Tales and House of Myths.
The series featured major figures of history, such as Alexander Hamilton. One show in the series, "Paul Revere's Ride", employed this dialogue:
Carlton felt every aspect had to be dramatized with elaborate details, as he explained, "To make your audience see, it is necessary to make your characters describe what they see."Miami News-Record, February 19, 1928.
