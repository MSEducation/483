Inka is a Polish roasted grain beverage. Developed in the late 1960s during the communist era, Inka has been produced in Skawina since 1971, a centre of coffee production since the early 20th century. Currently it is manufactured by GRANA Sp. Z O.O. While it was used in part as a coffee substitute to alleviate coffee shortages in the 1970s, Inka remains popular, in part to the fact that it is caffeine-free. It is exported to Canada and the United States as Naturalis Inka in packaging reminiscent of that used in Poland in the early 1990s.
Inka is a roasted mixture of rye, barley, chicory, and sugar beet. Cereals make up 72% of the content and in the classic version there are no artificial ingredients or other additives. Additional varieties include supplements or flavouring.http://www.grana.pl/en/our_brands/

Inka is sold in the following varieties:
