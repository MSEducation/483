[[2002–03 Prva HNL]]

CATEGORIES: Prva HNL seasons, 2002–03 domestic association football leagues, 2002–03 in Croatian football

The 2002–03 Prva HNL was the twelfth season of Prva HNL, the national championship for men's association football teams in Croatia, since its establishment in 1992. The season started on 24 July 2002 and ended on 31 May 2003. NK Zagreb were the defending champions, having won their first championship title the previous season. Dinamo Zagreb won the title, after a win against Varteks on 17 May 2003.

==Teams==

The league format was changed from the previous 2001–02 season and the number of teams were reduced from sixteen to twelve for the 2002–03 Prva HNL. Because of this, the four bottom-placed teams were automatically relegated to Druga HNL at the end of the season, while the 11th placed Šibenik and 12th placed Kamen Ingrad qualified for the Relegation play-offs. Both clubs then went on to win the two-legged play-off ties against second level sides Vukovar '91 and Istra Pula. Therefore no team was promoted from the 2001–02 Druga HNL and all twelve teams which contested the 2002–03 Prva HNL were also top flight members in the previous season.
