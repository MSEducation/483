CORE Music Foundation began as C.O.R.E., a network of united hip hop artists working together to obtain success in the music industry, promoting creative endeavors and preserving the true essence of hip-hop culture. C.O.R.E. was founded by Yakira Levi-Arnold in 1995.http://www.coremusicfoundation.org/CORE_Music_Foundation/About_CORE.htmlIn 1996, the network formed a student chapter sponsored by Columbia College Chicago. 
On January 21, 2005, CORE Music Foundation was incorporated as a  not-for-profit corporation in the State of Illinois. CORE Music Foundation NFP is a public charity, exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
CORE Music Foundation currently facilitates workshops and residencies at Schools, Libraries, Park districts, Temples of worship, and other public places. 
Geographically, CORE Music Foundation currently directs most of its efforts in the Englewood and Austin areas of Chicago. We have developed close working relationships with Chicago Public Schools as a vendor, Illinois Arts Council as an Arts in Education program facilitator, and with the Center for Community Arts Partnerships (CCAP) at Columbia College Chicago for programming and teaching the Arts at various community schools. 
CORE Music Foundation has joined forces with Chicago Public Schools-Service Learning Program to provide high-school students with the opportunity to earn community service credit hours as required for graduation.
