The South West Coast Path is England's longest waymarked long-distance footpath (and one of the longest in the UK) and a National Trail. It stretches for [tpl]convert|630|mi|km|0[/tpl], running from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Since it rises and falls with every river mouth, it is also one of the more challenging trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft (35,031 m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/reckoner.html| author=South West Coast Path Association| title=Distance reckoner| accessdate=25 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024195604/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/reckoner.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl]
The final section of the path was designated as a National Trail in 1978.[tpl]cite web| last =Countryside Agency| title =Coast Path is a £300M Money Spinner for the South West| publisher =Countryside Agency| date =25 September 2003| url =http://195.92.230.86/LAR/archive/presscentre/coastpath.asp| accessdate = 1 February 2008[/tpl] Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status, either as a National Park or one of the Heritage Coasts. The path passes through two World Heritage Sites: the Dorset and East Devon Coast, known as the Jurassic Coast, was designated in 2001,[tpl]cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1029 | author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | title=Dorset and East Devon Coast | accessdate=27 November 2007[/tpl] and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape in 2007.[tpl]cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1215 | author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre| title=Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape | accessdate=26 November 2007[/tpl]
In the 1990s it was thought that the path brought £15 million into the area each year,[tpl]cite web| last =Andrews| first =Philip| title = The Countryside Agency and Regional Development Agencies| publisher =Countryside Agency| year =1997| url =http://www.countryside.gov.uk/LAR/archive/board_meetings/annexes/CA_AP99_02.asp| accessdate = 1 February 2008[/tpl] but new research in 2003 indicated that it generated around £300 million a year in total, which could support more than 7,500 jobs. This research also recorded that 27.6% of visitors to the region came because of the Path, and they spent £136 million in a year. Local people took 23 million walks on the Path and spent a further £116 million, and other visitors contributed the remainder. A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around £300 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2009/310709.aspx|title=Mapping the gaps in England's coastal access|date=31 July 2009|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=31 July 2009[/tpl]

==History of the path==

The path originated as a route for the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They needed to be able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/swcp_intro.html |title=This is the South West Coast Path! |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=South West Coast Path Association |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024195615/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/swcp_intro.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl] The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.
The path is a designated National Trail, largely funded by Natural England. It was created in stages, with its final section, Somerset and North Devon, opening in 1978. It is maintained by a dedicated South West Coast Path Team.
The South West Coast Path Association, a registered charity, exists to support the interests of users of the path. The Association was formed in 1973 and since then it has campaigned for improvements to the path. Its services include accommodation guides and completion certificates.

==Route description==

The route is described here anticlockwise, from Minehead to Poole. The distance and total ascent between any two points, in either direction, can be obtained from The South West Coast Path Association Distance Reckoner. A survey carried out in 1999 and 2000 found that at that time the path had 2,473 signposts or waymarks, and included 302 bridges, 921 stiles, and 26,719 steps.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/GPSsurvey.html | author=SWCPA | title=GPS Survey Results | accessdate=29 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103001013/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/GPSsurvey.html |archivedate = 3 November 2007[/tpl] In practice, any such calculation is soon out of date because of path diversions due to landslips or access changes.
Many walkers take about eight weeks to complete the path, often dividing this into sections walked over several years.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/swcp_intro.html | author=SWCPA | title= This is the South West Coast Path | accessdate=29 November 2007 |quote=We estimate that 8 weeks are required for the average walker to complete our path. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024195615/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/swcp_intro.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl] In contrast, a team of six Royal Marines, taking turns in pairs to run two-hour sections, completed the path in six days in 2004[tpl]cite news | work=The BBC | title=Marines near the end of path run | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/3673043.stm | accessdate=5 December 2007 | date=30 April 2004[/tpl] and in 2012 a runner ran the entire path in 16 days, 9 hours and 57 minutes.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/newsapp/article/35/| author= The South West Coast Path Team | title= New Coast Path record set | accessdate=16 November 2012[/tpl] A new record for completing the path was set on 11 May 2013, when two runners completed the trail in 14 days, 14 hours and 45 minutes.[tpl]cite web|first=South West Coast Path National Trails|title=New Record Set for Completing the Coast Path|url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/newsapp/article/73/|publisher=South West Coast Path National Trail|accessdate=16 May 2013[/tpl]

===Somerset===

The South West Coast Path starts from the western side of Minehead, in Somerset, at a marker erected in 2001 and partly paid for by the South West Coast Path Association.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/tour/html/MineheadMarker.html | author=SWCPA | title=Photo tour: Minehead marker | accessdate=19 November 2007[/tpl] The path follows the waterfront past the harbour to Culver Cliff before climbing up on a zigzag path through woodland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/PathNews.html | author=SWCPA | title=Path News | accessdate=19 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024185205/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/PathNews.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl] Entering the Exmoor National Park, it cuts inland past North Hill, Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at Hurlestone Point. After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way.
The scenery of rocky headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a Heritage Coast in 1991.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/west/series6/exmoor.shtml |title=Flying High |accessdate=3 December 2007 |work=BBC [/tpl] The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the diversity of species present.[tpl]cite web | title=Exmoor Coastal Heaths | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004152.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=12 August 2006[/tpl] The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Parishchs.htm |title=Parish Churches |accessdate=24 October 2007 |work=Somerset County archives [/tpl] The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, a few hundred yards north of the National Park Centre at County Gate.

===North Devon===

The next big headland is Foreland Point, after which the path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its herd of goats,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6470297.stm |title=Poisoned peppers meant for goats |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=BBC News  | date=20 March 2007[/tpl] then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.
At [tpl]convert|1043|ft|m|0[/tpl] this is the highest point on the path.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/trail.asp?PageId=31 |title=South West Coast Path |accessdate=5 December 2007 |work=National Trails [/tpl] With a cliff face of [tpl]convert|800|ft|m|0[/tpl], it is described as the highest cliff on mainland Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/visiting/visitor-map-old/gw-hangmans |title=Combe Martin and the Hangmans |publisher=Exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk |accessdate=11 October 2012[/tpl] The path now leaves the Exmoor National Park and enters the village of Combe Martin, which claims to have the longest village street in England (two miles ([tpl]convert|2|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only[/tpl])).[tpl]cite web|author=BBC Devon | title=Home Town: Combe Martin | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/hometown/combe_martin.shtml | accessdate=9 January 2008[/tpl]
After rounding Widmouth Head, the path passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay and enters the seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island and The Balmoral, The Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.
The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs and follows the cliff top past several small bays including Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse, into Rackham Bay. It then rounds Morte Point, passing the nearby village of Mortehoe before turning south to enter the long sandy Morte Bay which includes Woolacombe and Putsborough. Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from Croyde Bay, and the surfing mecca of Croyde and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay, which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wide expanse of Saunton Sands, which takes its name from Saunton, merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England[tpl]cite web | url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/unesco.htm| title=Braunton Burrows | work=UK Biosphere Reserves Review |quote=Braunton Burrows is a prime British sand dune site, the largest sand dune system in England | accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl] and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=UKM+02&mode=all | title=Braunton Burrows | work= UNESCO – MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory | accessdate=27 November 2007[/tpl] It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs, and the dune slacks are also rich. The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northdevonbiosphere.org.uk/assets/Resources/Documents/BAP/Sand-Dunes.pdf |title=Sand Dunes |accessdate=7 June 2012 |work=North Devon Biosphere [/tpl]
From Braunton Burrows the South West Coast Path turns inland following the Braunton Canal to Braunton and then along north bank of the River Taw, following part of the route of the old Ilfracombe Branch Line, past the perimeter of the Royal Marines Base Chivenor towards Barnstaple where the new Barnstaple Western Bypass now forms the closest bridge over the Taw to the sea. After crossing medieval Barnstaple Long Bridge, the path then turns west following the disused Bideford & Instow Railway line along southern bank of the Taw past Fremington Quay and the Fremington Quay Cliffs SSSI to Instow at the joint estuary of the Rivers Taw and Torridge and the Taw-Torridge Estuary (SSSI). The ferry which used to operate at Instow ceased on the retirement of the ferryman in 2007,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/river_crossings.html| author=SWCPA | title=River crossings | accessdate=19 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024195609/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/river_crossings.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007[/tpl] so the path now goes upstream to cross the river by the 13th-century bridge at Bideford, which is the site of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and terminus of the North Devon Railway.
The path continues north beside the Torridge Estuary, in places following the route of the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period,[tpl]cite journal |last=Berridge |first=Peter |coauthors=Alison Roberts |year=1986 |title=The Mesolithic Period in Cornwall |journal=Cornish Archeology |volume=25 |issue= |url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/documents/CAS25-1s.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho!

The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues on to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to the island of Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border.

===North Cornwall===

The path crosses into Cornwall at Marsland Mouth and continues south-westwards along this rocky coast, past Morwenstow then Higher and Lower Sharpnose Points. Beyond Sandy Mouth, the walking becomes easier through Bude, a popular surfing resort, and along Widemouth Bay. Returning to the cliffs, the path continues on to Crackington Haven, past Cambeak and further south (over "High Cliff", Southern Britain's highest sheer-drop cliff at [tpl]convert|735|ft|m|0[/tpl]), and from there to Boscastle, the scene of flooding in 2004.
Tintagel and its castle are associated with the conception of the legendary King Arthur[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.15398 |title=Tintagel Castle: background information |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=English Heritage [/tpl] and a 15th-century house that was later used as a post office.[tpl]cite web | author=National Trust| title=Tintagel Old Post Office | url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-tintageloldpostoffice/| accessdate=25 November 2007| authorlink=National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071114050236/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-tintageloldpostoffice/ | archivedate=14 November 2007[/tpl] The path continues to Trebarwith Strand, Tregardock, then to Port Gaverne, Port Isaac, and Port Quin, three small harbours. Overlooking Port Quin is Doyden Castle, a 19th-century folly.
The scenery is now less wild, the cliffs less high. Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.golowan.org/Timeline.html |title=A Time-Line for Cornwall |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Golowan |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071117174509/http://www.golowan.org/Timeline.html |archivedate = 17 November 2007[/tpl] but the path heads straight past to Pentire Head then swings eastwards again into Polzeath. The estuary of the River Camel forces a detour away from the sea to Rock and the Black Tor Ferry that takes walkers into Padstow.
From Stepper Point the path again runs along low sea cliffs to Trevone and Harlyn Bay then around Trevose Head. From here-—weather permitting-—the coast can be seen from Hartland in Devon to beyond St Ives in the west. The path runs southwards through Constantine Bay to Porthcothan then passes around Park Head to reach Mawgan Porth.
The long, sandy Watergate Bay leads to St Columb Porth and Newquay. A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer weekends has helped the town prosper as a seaside resort popular with surfers and clubbers. On the far side of the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There are seasonal ferries to Crantock and a footbridge which is passable at low tide, otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge.
The path now skirts Pentire Point West and then Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay, another surfing beach. After passing round Penhale and crossing Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth, then climbs out the other side back onto a stretch of cliffs past Kligga Head to the village of St Agnes. Past St Agnes Head, a breeding ground for kittiwakes,[tpl]cite book|last=Andrews | first=Robert|title=Rough Guide to Devon and Cornwall| page=297 |isbn=1-84353-312-X| year=2004|url=http://books.google.com/books?q=184353312X| quote=St Agnes Head is edged by cliffs which support the area's largest colony of breeding kittiwakes, fulmars and guillemots|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London[/tpl] lies the ruins of Towanroath Mine and the inlet at Chapel Porth. Next are the ruins of Wheal Charlotte mine and then Porthtowan village.
After passing Nancekuke firing ranges, the path drops into Portreath, once a busy port serving inland tin mines around Redruth. Beyond lies Carvannel Downs with Samphire Island just off the coast, and then the Reskajeage Downs. Beyond the cove at Hell's Mouth, the path runs northwards to pass around Navax Point and Godrevy Point, offshore from which lies Godrevy Island with its lighthouse.

===West Cornwall===

Turning into the wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop down onto the sands at low tide, the path follows the line of the sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for explosives manufacture for many years,[tpl]cite web | title=Upton Towans Nature Reserve | work=Cornwall Wildlife Trust | url=http://www.cornwallwildlifetrust.org.uk/nature_reserves/where_to_find_the_nature_reserves_1/upton_towans | accessdate= 7 June 2012 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110114130206/http://www.cornwallwildlifetrust.org.uk/nature_reserves/where_to_find_the_nature_reserves_1/upton_towans |archivedate =14 January 2011[/tpl]Earl, Bryan (1978). Cornish Explosives. Penzance: The Trevithick Society. ISBN 0-904040-13-5. the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to the west side of the tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.
Rising back onto low cliffs, the path rounds Carrack Gladden and enters Carbis Bay, it then follows alongside the St Ives Bay railway line into St Ives; a bustling town favoured by artists since the 19th century, which is home to the Tate St Ives art gallery and the Barbara Hepworth Museum. The path passes the east-facing Portminster Beach and goes around "The Island", a headland, to the north-facing Portmeor Beach.
The coast now shows the open and ancient landscape of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Nuan Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Botallack Mine.
From Cape Cornwall at St Just, the Path heads southwards to sandy Whitesand Bay and the village of Sennen. At the end of the sands the path turns westwards one last time to reach Land's End. This is the most westerly point of the English mainland.
After passing Land's End the path continues further south past Pordenack Point and Mill Bay before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head. Beyond the tiny village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan. The next bay lies below Porthcurno. It is overlooked by the open-air Minack Theatre and is where the Eastern Cable Company's cable came ashore, the first telegraph link with India.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brunel200.com/legacy/sw_arts_projects/porthcurno_telegraph_museum.htm |title=Porthcurno Telegraph Museum |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Brunel 200 legacy [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/CandW/Eastern/ |title=The Evolution of Cable & Wireless, Part 2 |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications [/tpl] Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock.
The next village is Penberth, then a series of bays are separated by the headlands of Merthen Point, Boscawen Point, and Tater Du with its lighthouse built in 1965.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/tater_du.html |title=Tater Du Lighthouse |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Trinity House [/tpl] Lamorna Cove is a favourite with artists such as S. J. "Lamorna" Birch, who lived there in a small cottage. Then, after rounding Carn Du, the path turns northwards towards Mousehole and Penlee Point. This section of the path follows a road into Newlyn, but a diversion via Paul allows walkers to follow a quieter inland path. Newlyn has a busy fishing harbour and is again favoured by artists, known as the Newlyn School;[ref]
