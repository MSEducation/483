Yuzhoupliosaurus is an extinct genus of plesiosaur from the Middle Jurassic of China. The genus is known only from a lower jaw, a vertebra, and fragments of a pectoral girdle. It is believed this genus lived in fresh water.

==Etymology==

The genus was named after Yuzhou (禹州), the previous name of Chungking- a major city on the Yangtze River, and where the first fossil of  Yuzhoupliosaurus was found.

==Description==

Paleontologists believe Yuzhoupliosaurus to have been approximatively 4 meters long. The lower jaw contains five pairs of large teeth and 23 or 234 smaller teeth. The cervical vertebra are considered "high and short". The anterior cervical ribs are double-headed while the posterior cervical ribs are single-headed. The coracoids are elongated and the clavicles are well developed.
