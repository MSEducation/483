It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 75 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous officially Francophone country. 
It is bordered by the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west; and is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|sing=on[/tpl] stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9 km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa.
The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country and is sometimes referred to as the "African world war" because it involved nine African nations and twenty armed groups.[ref]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly known as, in chronological order, Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Republic of the Congo, and Zaïre. Although located in the Central African UN subregion, the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).[tpl]cite web |title=Member States |work=Southern African Development Community: Towards a common future |url=http://www.sadc.int/member-states [/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name "Democratic Republic of the Congo" was the official name of the country from 1964–71. In 1992, the Sovereign National Conference voted to change to name from "Zaire", but it was never put into practice.From Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo - Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja (Nordiska Afrikainstitutat 2004) It was restored by former president Laurent Kabila following the fall of long time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.[tpl]cite book|author=Yusuf, A.

==History==

===Early history===

===Congo Free State (1877–1908)===

Belgian exploration, and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding, mainly from Arab–Swahili slave traders such as the infamous Tippu Tip,The East African slave trade. BBC World Service | The Story of Africa. who was well-known to Stanley. Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony.Keyes, Michael. The Congo Free State – a colony of gross excess. September 2004. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold, professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization Association Internationale Africaine, actually played one European rival against another. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property and named it the Congo Free State. Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). It took years to complete. Nearly all such projects were aimed at increasing the capital which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony, leading to exploitation of Africans.Hochschild, Adam. King Leopold's Ghost, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999; ISBN 0-547-52573-7
In the Free State, colonists brutalized the local population to produce rubber, for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. The sale of rubber made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in Brussels and Ostend to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the Force Publique, was called in and made a practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives as a means of enforcing rubber quotas a matter of policy. During the period of 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically; it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River.Fage, John D. (1982). The Cambridge history of Africa: From the earliest times to c. 500 BC, Cambridge University Press. p. 748; ISBN 0-521-22803-4 A government commission later concluded that the population of the Congo had been "reduced by half" during this period, but determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.
The actions of the Free State's administration sparked international protests led by British reporter Edmund Dene Morel and British diplomat turned Irish rebel Roger Casement, whose 1904 report on the Congo condemned the practice. Noted writers such as Mark Twain and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also protested, and Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness was set in the Congo Free State. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Belgian Congo (1908–1960)===

In 1908, the Belgian parliament, despite initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially that from the United Kingdom) and took over the Free State from the king. From then on, as a Belgian colony, it was called the Belgian Congo and was under the rule of the elected Belgian government.

===Independence and political crisis (1960–1965)===

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the Mouvement National Congolais or MNC Party, led by Patrice Lumumba, won the parliamentary elections. Patrice Lumumba thus became the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The parliament elected as President Joseph Kasavubu, of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the Parti Solidaire Africain (or PSA) led by Antoine Gizenga, and the Parti National du Peuple (or PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko. (Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium) The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or "Republic of the Congo" in English). Shortly after independence, the provinces of Katanga (led by Moise Tshombe) and South Kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership."Jungle Shipwreck", Time Magazine, 25 July 1960. Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm|title=The United Nations and the Congo |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk|date=30 March 2007|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite."Hearts of Darkness", allacademic.com
As the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name "Republic of Congo" upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as "Congo-Léopoldville" and "Congo-Brazzaville", after their capital cities. Another way they were often distinguished during the 1960s, such as in newspaper articles, was that "Congo-Léopoldville" was called "The Congo" and "Congo-Brazzaville" was called simply "Congo". [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
On 5 September 1960, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared Kasavubu's action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed. (cf. Sécession au Katanga – J.Gerald-Libois -Brussels- CRISP)
On 17 January 1961, Katangan forces and Belgian paratroops – supported by the United States CIA and Belgium – kidnapped Patrice Lumumba, and after being beaten and tortured, Lumumba was shot and killed.http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/21/patrice_lumumba_50_years_later_remembering Patrice Lumumba: 50 Years Later, Remembering the U.S.-Backed Assassination of Congo’s First Democratically Elected Leader Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (Collège des Commissaires) with Evariste Kimba. The Katanga secession was ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments, of Joseph Ileo, Cyrille Adoula and Moise Tshombe, took over in quick succession.
Lumumba had previously appointed Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC). [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Lumumba, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to maintain "order" in the new state by neutralizing Kasavubu and Lumumba in a coup by proxy. A constitutional referendum after Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the country's official name being changed to the "Democratic Republic of the Congo." In 1971 it was changed again to the "Republic of Zaïre". [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Zaïre (1971–1997)===

The new president had the support of the United States because of his staunch opposition to Communism, believing that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A one-party system was established, and Mobutu declared himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe human rights violations, political repression, a cult of personality and corruption. (Mobutu demanded every Congolese banknote be printed with his image, hanging of his portrait in all public buildings, most businesses, and on billboards. It was common for ordinary people to wear his likeness on their clothing.) [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Corruption became so prevalent the term "le mal Zairois" or "Zaïrean Sickness",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html|title="Zaïre: The Hoax of Independence", The Aida Parker Newsletter #203, 4 August 1997|publisher=cycad.com[/tpl] meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself.Young, C. & Turner, T. (1985) The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State, p. 74; ISBN 978-0-299-10110-7 By 1984, Mobutu was said to have $4 billion (USD), an amount close to the country's national debt, deposited in a personal Swiss bank account. International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaïre became a "kleptocracy" as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds.
In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa country was now Democratic Republic of The Congo – Kinshasa, Stanleyville became Kisangani, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Coquihatville became Mbandaka. This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s.
In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaïre, its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaïre River. In 1972, Mobutu changed his own legal name from Joseph-Désiré Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (translated as "the all powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, shall go from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake"[tpl]cite news|author=Gbadolite, Adam Zagorin|date=22 February 1993|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977788,00.html|title=Mobutu Sese Seko: Leaving Fire in His Wake|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl]), although he only ever used the first three of his new names. Furthermore, he decreed that Christian names had to be Africanized and prohibited the wearing of Western-style clothing by anyone in his country. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
During the 1970s and 1980s, he was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In June 1989, Mobutu was the first African head of state invited for a state visit with newly elected President George H.W. Bush.Johns, Michael (29 June 1989) "Zaïre's Mobutu Visits America", Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #239. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a Cold War ally. Opponents within Zaïre stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until the conflict forced him to flee Zaire in 1997. Thereafter, the nation chose to reclaim its name of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, since the name Zaïre carried strong connections to the rule of Mobutu.

===Civil wars===

By 1996, following the Rwandan Civil War and genocide and the ascension of a Tutsi-led government, Rwandan Hutu militia forces (Interahamwe) fled to eastern Zaïre and used refugee camps as a base for incursion against Rwanda. They allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaïre.Thom, William G. "Congo-Zaïre's 1996–97 civil war in the context of evolving patterns of military conflict in Africa in the era of independence", Conflict Studies Journal at the University of New Brunswick, Vol. XIX No. 2, Fall 1999. A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaïre to overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately control the mineral resources of Zaïre, launching the First Congo War. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, becoming the Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre (AFDL). In 1997, Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
