==Origins==

The land was originally part of the estates of Bordesley Abbey. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the property passed to Thomas Windsor Hickman.

==Development==

The estate remained a seat of the Windsor-Clive family (who were made Earls of Plymouth) until it was sold to the state in the 20th century. There are several ruins of earlier houses on the estate, and a large number of listed buildings, structures and statues.[tpl]cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/search?q=Hewell+Grange |title=Search: +Hewell +Grange |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18[/tpl]
Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth (1857–1923) commissioned Bodley and Garner to build the current house in 1884–91.

==The House==

The House is of Cheshire Red Sandstone[tpl]cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-156208-hewell-grange-tutnall-and-cobley |title=Hewell Grange - Tutnall And Cobley - Worcestershire - England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date=1903-08-15 |accessdate=2012-04-18[/tpl] with a tile roof.  It is of an Elizabethan E-plan, modelled on Montacute House, Somerset.  The exterior is Jacobethan, of three storeys, the interior Italianate.  The house is dominated by the massive Great Hall, comprising half the total space of the house.[tpl]harvnb|Brooks & Pevsner|p=627[/tpl]  The elaborate decoration is largely "well-preserved."  The Chapel in the porch contains carving by Detmar Blow.

==Prison==

The house was used as a Borstal from 1946 to 1991, when it became HM Prison Hewell Grange, a Category D open prison.
