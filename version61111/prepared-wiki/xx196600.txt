[[The Pacemakers (funk band)]]

CATEGORIES: American funk musical groups

The Pacemakers were a late-1960s American funk group that consisted of bassist William "Bootsy" Collins, his older brother Phelps "Catfish" Collins on guitar, Philipp√© Wynne on vocals, and drummer Will Jackson (later replaced by Frankie "Kash" Waddy). 
The Pacemakers were little-known outside Cincinnati, Ohio, until 1969. After most of James Brown's band quit over a pay dispute, The Pacemakers were hired in 1970 as replacements. They formed the cornerstone of Brown's new backup band, The J.B.'s.
