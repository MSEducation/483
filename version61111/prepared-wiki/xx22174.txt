[[Heteroecious]]

CATEGORIES: Parasitology

A heteroecious parasite is one that requires at least two hosts. The primary host is the host in which the parasite spends its adult life; the other is the secondary host.  Both the primary host and an unrelated alternate host are required for the parasite to complete its life cycle.  This can be contrasted with an autoecious parasite which can complete its life cycle on a single host species.  Many rust fungi are prime examples of a heteroecious life cycle.Schumann, G. & D'Arcy, C. (2010). Essential plant pathology. APS Press
