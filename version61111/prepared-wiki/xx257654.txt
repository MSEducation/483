Dolm church ([tpl]lang-no|Dolm kirke[/tpl]) is a parish church in the municipality of Hitra in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The church is located on the southern coast of the island of Dolmøya at Dolmvarden.
The white stone church was originally built in 1188 and was the main church on the island of Hitra. It was built in the Romanesque style with rounded arches and thick stone walls. The church has burned down many times, most recently in 1920.  The church was rebuilt again during the 1920s, but the new Hitra church was built across the strait in Melandsjøen in 1927 and it became the new main church for the parish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkdalsmenighetene.no/hitra/dolm_kirke.htm|title=Dolm kirke|language=Norwegian|publisher=Orkdals prosti|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://home.online.no/~j-g-foss/ekroll1.html|first=Øystein|last=Ekroll|year=2004|title=Dolm kirke på Hitra|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
