Sense and Nonsense is an American game show hosted by Bob Kennedy which ran on New York City TV station WABD from 1951-1954. The show consisted of two three-child teams using their five senses to complete challenges and earn money, with the high-scoring team returning on the next show.
Sponsored by Coca-Cola (specifically "Coke in-a-bottle"), and with a somewhat-unorthodox Monday-Wednesday-Friday airing schedule, Sense has since gained something of a "cult following" among fans of early television. While only shown on WABD, it is often considered a DuMont Television Network program due to not only being on the network's flagship affiliate, but having several production "quirks" typical of many DuMont programs.

==Episode status==

Only one episode is known to exist, from February 19, 1954 (one commercial mentions the upcoming weekend and celebrating George Washington's birthday with Coke in-a-bottle, showing a boy and girl doing so in Colonial attire and powdered wigs). Among other things, the episode is notable for a young Leonard Frey playing on the challenging team.
This episode is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, but can be purchased on DVD through various public-domain retailers and is available for viewing on the Internet Archive.
