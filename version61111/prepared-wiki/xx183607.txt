==History==

In 1980, Pan American World Airways acquired National Airlines, thus getting a domestic United States route network for the first time in its history. To cater for flight connections to smaller airports, the installation of a feeder network soon became necessary. For this task, a number of airlines flying large narrow body jet equipment were contracted on codeshare-like agreements:
The focus of the Pan Am Express network was put on feeding into Pan Am's hub at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The (North-)Eastern United States were particularly well covered, but there also were connections from mid-Western cities to the West Coast.
In 1987, Pan Am acquired Ransome Airlines, which was subsequently renamed Pan Am Express and began operating under the banner and aircraft livery of Pan Am thus became the only regional banner carrier (Commercial Aviation) henceforth."BUSINESS PEOPLE; Planner for Pan Am Heads Commuter Unit," The New York TimesFlight International: The new world of Pan American.

When Pan Am declared bankruptcy in early 1991 and was forced to sell its New York hub to Delta Air Lines, Pan Am Express was relocated to Miami International Airport. From there, a number of destinations in Florida and the Bahamas were served, until the brand was shut down together with its parent on December 4, 1991.
