A minimill is traditionally a secondary steel producer; however, 
Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers), as well as one 
of its competitors, Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills 
exclusively.  Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, 
recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of 
manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with 
scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually 
DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material.  A 
typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap 
melting, a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of 
chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster 
for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a 
rolling mill.
Originally the minimill concept was adapted to production of bar 
products only, such as concrete reinforcing bar, flats, 
angles, channels, pipe, and light rails. Since the late 1980s, 
successful introduction of the direct strip casting process has made
minimill production of strip feasible.  Often a minimill will be 
constructed in an area with no other steel production, to take advantage
of local resources and lower-cost labour.  Minimill plants may 
specialize, for example, making coils of rod for wire-drawing 
use, or pipe, or in special sections for transportation and agriculture.
Capacities of minimills vary; some plants may make as much as 3,000,000 
tons per year, a typical size is in the range 200,000 to 400,000 tons 
per year, and some old or specialty plants may make as little as 50,000 
tons per year of finished product. Nucor Corporation, for example, 
annually produces around 9,100,000 tons of sheet steel from its 4 sheet 
mills, 6,700,000 tons of bar steel from its 10 bar mills and 2,100,000 
tons of plate steel from its 2 plate mills.
Since the electric arc furnace can be easily started and stopped on a 
regular basis, minimills can follow the market demand for their products
easily, operating on 24 hour schedules when demand is high and cutting 
back production when sales are lower.
