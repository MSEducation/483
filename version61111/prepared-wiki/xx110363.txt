==Personal==

Michaela originally hails from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, growing up as one of five adopted children. Her childhood was marked with diversity, as her parents and siblings do not share the same ethnic backgrounds, which has subsequently led her to be a strong advocate for the rights of children. Though she's lived and worked in the United States for several years she still maintains her Canadian citizenship.
Michaela graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts.
She speaks Portuguese, in addition to English, and was an avid snowboarder until a recent knee surgery.
