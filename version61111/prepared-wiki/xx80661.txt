Haldir is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's  fictional universe of Middle-earth. He is introduced in The Silmarillion as a Chieftain of the Folk of Haleth in the First Age. He was the elder son of Halmir and married Glóredhel of the House of Hador, the elder sister of Galdor the Tall who married Haldir's sister Hareth. The son of Haldir and Glóredhel was Handir and their grandson Brandir the Lame.
As a son-in-law of Hador, he fostered Hareth's sons Huor and Húrin in Brethil, as was the custom of the Edain in those times. With them he joined the ambush of Orcs that came from the Pass of Sirion soon after the Dagor Bragollach, and the forces of his father Halmir utterly defeated the enemies.
After his father prepared the Folk of Brethil to join the Union of Maedhros, Haldir obeyed the summons of Fingon, and with Hundar his brother he led many warriors to the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and joined the forces of Húrin, now Lord of Dor-lómin.
Haldir was slain with most of his men in the rearguard of Fingon's retreating army.[tpl]ME-ref|Silm|"Of the Fifth Battle"[/tpl] To Brethil only three men returned, and learning the news of the fall of her husband, Glóredhel grieved and died. The Folk of Haleth was ruled afterwards by their son Handir.

==Other versions of the legendarium==

Originally the leader of the Men of Brethil slain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad was called Hundor or Hundar (his father was Haleth the Hunter). The latter name was later transferred to his brother.
