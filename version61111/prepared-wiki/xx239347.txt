Staff at the refuge also manage Cedar Point and West Sister Island refuges. The three refuges together now protect approximately [tpl]convert|9000|acre|km2[/tpl] of habitat and some of the last remnants of the "Great Black Swamp" in the heart of the Lake Erie marshes.
The Lake Erie Marsh Region has historically been important to fish, migratory waterfowl, songbirds, and shorebirds. Large numbers of migrating songbirds stop in the area to rest during their spring migration. This amazing wildlife spectacle attracts a large number of visitors from across the country.
Ottawa Refuge has been designated as a site of regional significance in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network. In 2002, Birder's World readers voted the refuge as one of their Top 15 favorite spots to see birds, and the American Bird Conservancy has identified the refuge as an Important Bird Area.
