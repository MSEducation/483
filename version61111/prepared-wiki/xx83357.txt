William Dale Goodman (March 22, 1926 – October 1, 1984) was an American baseball player. An outstanding hitter and fielder, he was one of the most versatile players of his era. He played every position in Major League baseball except catcher and pitcher. He batted .300 in 16 Major League seasons (over .300 in five seasons and .290 or better in eleven seasons). His career .376 on-base percentage made him an ideal lead-off hitter.

==Early years==

Goodman was born in Concord, North Carolina, and played Textile League baseball in Concord before signing with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in [tpl]by|1944[/tpl] at just eighteen years old.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aChCBw-PmHQC&pg=PA566&lpg=PA567&dq|author=David L.

===Minor League===

Goodman hit .336 his first season in Atlanta. He left baseball temporarily, serving in the United States Navy during World War II in [tpl]by|1945[/tpl]. While assigned to the Pacific Theater on Ulithi with Major Leaguer Mickey Vernon and future Baseball Hall of Famer, Larry Doby, both Goodman and Vernon encouraged Doby to become a Major League baseball player.
Goodman returned to the Atlanta Crackers in [tpl]by|1946[/tpl] to bat .389 and lead his team to the Southern Association's playoff series championship. On February 8, [tpl]by|1947[/tpl], he was sold to the Boston Red Sox.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19470208&id=ZBM9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=ei4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=5223,5653123|title=Atlanta Sells Bill Goodman to Boston Sox|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=February 8, 1947[/tpl] Goodman entered his first Spring training battling Sam Mele for the open right field job.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X4VPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RNEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6757,2939443&dq|author=Harry Grayson|date=April 2, 1947|title=Red Sox' Plethora of Talent Has Cronin Much More Jovial Than He Was Last Fall|newspaper=Portsmouth Times[/tpl] With Mele winning the job, Goodman batted .182 in limited play through May of the [tpl]mlby|1947[/tpl] season before being reassigned to the American Association's Louisville Colonels, where he batted .340 over the remainder of the season.

===Boston Red Sox===

Goodman spent the Spring with the Red Sox in 1947 playing in 12 games, 2 in the outfield, and 10 filling in at second base for an injured Bobby Doerr,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5C9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DE8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4030,5096237&dq|author=Joe Reichler|date=April 16, 1948|title=Major League Clubs Hit By Injury Wave As Openers Approach|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times[/tpl] He made his first start as a Major League third baseman on May 20, 1948 [tpl]mlby|1948[/tpl].Baseball Reference.Com, Billy Goodman, "Debut: April 19, 1947 (age 21)http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/goodmbi01.shtml[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE194805200.shtml|title=Cleveland Indians 13, Boston Red Sox 4|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=May 20, 1948[/tpl] From there, Goodman moved across the diamond to first base for the remainder of the season in the Majors. He batted .310 with 66 runs batted in as a rookie. His first Major League home run, and only home run of the season, was a grand slam off the Detroit Tigers' Virgil Trucks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET194807290.shtml|title=Boston Red Sox 8, Detroit Tigers 1|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=July 29, 1948[/tpl]

====1950, hit .354====

He was named to the first of two American League All-Star rosters in [tpl]mlby|1949[/tpl], and appeared during the bottom of the 8th inning of the All-Star Game as a defensive replacement for Washington Senators first baseman Eddie Robinson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS194907120.shtml|title=1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=July 12, 1949[/tpl] Early in the [tpl]mlby|1950[/tpl] season, Goodman suffered a chip fracture in his left ankle that cost him a month of play.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=30g1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=qXEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=996,3196598&dq|title=Billy Goodman Crippled; Red Sox Call Walt Dropo|newspaper=The Day (New London)|date=May 2, 1950[/tpl] Power hitting rookie first baseman Walt Dropo earned himself a place in the everyday starting line-up in Goodman's absence, batting .348 with ten home runs and 33 RBIs. Goodman found himself without a starting position upon his return, however, injuries to Bobby Doerr and third baseman Johnny Pesky kept Goodman in the line-up semi-regularly. After Ted Williams injured himself in the All-Star game,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e5oVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vwsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3156,1050889&dq|title=Ted Williams Fractures Elbow in All-Star Game|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=July 13, 1950[/tpl] Goodman took over in left field for the Bosox, and batted .338 with 23 RBIs filling in for the Boston legend. Playing five different positions over the course of the season, Goodman logged enough at-bats to win the American League batting title with a .354 batting average (Stan Musial, National League, .346) and was the runner-up in AL Most Valuable Player Award balloting to New York Yankees shortstop, Phil Rizzuto.
Goodman resumed his utility player role in [tpl]mlby|1951[/tpl]. He began the season playing first base when Dropo fractured his right wrist.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ciAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tmQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3391,4692424&dq|title=Red Sox are Shut Out, 2-0, by Cards in St. Petersburg|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=April 3, 1951[/tpl] He shifted over to right field upon Dropo's return, but was back at first when Dropo was optioned to the Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres at the end of June for "more work."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mrgKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cE4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4807,3935087&dq|title=Dropo Optioned to San Diego|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=June 24, 1951[/tpl] He spent most of the month of August at second base when Bobby Doerr's bad back kept him out of the line-up. In all, Goodman played five different positions, and batted .297 with fifty RBIs and 92 runs scored. His 638 plate appearances were third highest on the team behind Dom DiMaggio and Ted Williams.
Doerr retired at the end of the season,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1HxaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ek8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=1726,3006363&dq|title=Doerr to Quit at Season's End|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=September 23, 1951[/tpl] opening a regular position for Goodman at second base in [tpl]mlby|1952[/tpl]. He batted over .300 each of the next three seasons, and was moved into the lead-off spot in manager Lou Boudreau's batting order in [tpl]mlby|1953[/tpl], where he would remain for the rest of his career in Boston. He was elected to start the All-Star Game as a second baseman that season despite being sidelined for a month by one of the more bizarre baseball injuries. While arguing with first base umpire Jim Duffy, Goodman was restrained by teammate Jim Piersall. Piersall pulled Goodman toward the dugout, and in doing so, strained Goodman's rib cartilage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yClgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T28NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2832,1568149&dq|title=Goodman's Anger Leads to Injury|newspaper=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix|date=May 11, 1953[/tpl]
In [tpl]by|1954[/tpl], Goodman returned to his "jack of all trades" role with the Bosox. After starting the season at second, he moved over to third when the Sox traded George Kell to the Chicago White Sox.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XCRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pFgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4601,3044211&dq|title=Kell-Hatton Trade Puts Goodman In Infield Lineup|newspaper=The Robesonian|date=May 24, 1954[/tpl] He moved to left field when Ted Williams was sidelined by a virus infection in his right lung.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xUkoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aQUGAAAAIBAJ&pg=4528,3653709&dq|title=Williams Has Lung Infection|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=June 15, 1954[/tpl] Upon Williams' return, he began platooning at first with Harry Agganis (despite the fact that both were left-handed batters) until he was shifted back to second base in the beginning of August.
He had a starting job at second base again in [tpl]mlby|1955[/tpl], and led the team with 100 runs scored while logging a team high 719 plate appearances. Both were career highs, as were his 176 hits and 99 walks. He began losing playing time to Ted Lepcio at second base toward the end of the [tpl]mlby|1956[/tpl] season. He was relegated to pinch hitting duties early in the [tpl]mlby|1957[/tpl] season before a mid-season trade sent him to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Mike Fornieles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XSEgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NmgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,4903508&dq|title=Red Sox Swap Billy Goodman for Orioles' Mike Fornieles|newspaper=Lewiston Daily Sun|date=June 15, 1957[/tpl]

===Baltimore Orioles===

Goodman was immediately inserted into the starting line-up in Baltimore, and hit a home run in his first game as an Oriole.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE195706140.shtml|title=Cleveland Indians 7, Baltimore Orioles 2|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=June 14, 1957[/tpl] He mostly played third base, filling in for an injured George Kell,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7R4uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y4AFAAAAIBAJ&pg=601,1457424&dq|title=Geo. Kell OK, No Fracture|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|date=June 11, 1957[/tpl] but also played first, second, short, left field and right field. He batted .308 with three home runs and 33 RBIs in 73 games for the Orioles. At the end of the season, he, Tito Francona and Ray Moore were dealt to the Chicago White Sox for Larry Doby, Jack Harshman and Jim Marshall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WEgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CCYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6443,3626156&dq|title=Chisox Get Francona, Moore & Goodman|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|date=December 4, 1957[/tpl] Chicago later sent pitcher Russ Heman to Baltimore as part of this deal when it was discovered by the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hd5YAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gPcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5594,7372324&dq|title=White Sox Told to Complete Deal|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=January 31, 1958[/tpl]

===Chicago White Sox===

In 1958, with Nellie Fox at second base, Goodman shifted to third with the White Sox. He was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the month of May. Upon his return, he quickly shot up among the American League leaders in batting, with his average peaking at .336 in late July.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R3E0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_ckEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2056,3445010&dq|title=Billy Goodman Now Has Batting Title In AL|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=July 22, [tpl]mlby|1958[/tpl][/tpl]
At 33 years old at the start of the [tpl]mlby|1959[/tpl] season, Goodman was used in a lefty-righty platoon with Bubba Phillips at third base. The 1959 White Sox reached the World Series for the first time since the infamous [tpl]wsy|1919[/tpl] World Series. It was also the first and only World Series of Goodman's career. Goodman appeared in five of the six games of the [tpl]wsy|1959[/tpl] World Series, driving in and scoring one run in the White Sox's 11-0 game one victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA195910010.shtml|title=1959 World Series, Game One|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=October 1, 1959[/tpl] He also went two-for-three in game three, and was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning to load the bases with the White Sox down by two runs (they ended up scoring one).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN195910040.shtml|title=1959 World Series, Game Three|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|date=October 4, 1959[/tpl] Overall, he batted .231 (3-for-13) in Chicago's six game loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
