Stoke-on-Trent ([tpl]Audio|en-uk-StokeOnTrent.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]; often abbreviated to Stoke), also called the Potteries, is a city in Staffordshire, England, which forms a linear conurbation stretching for 12 miles (19 km), with an area of [tpl]convert|36|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl]. Together with Newcastle-under-Lyme and Kidsgrove, Stoke forms the Stoke-on-Trent Built-up Area. With the neighbouring boroughs of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire Moorlands, the three form North Staffordshire, which in 2011 had a population of 469,000.
The conurbation continues to be polycentric, having been formed by a federation of six separate towns and numerous villages in the early 20th century. The settlement from which the federated town (it was not a city until 1925) took its name was Stoke-upon-Trent, where the administration and chief mainline railway station were located. After the union, Hanley emerged as the primary commercial centre in the city, despite the efforts of its rival, Burslem. The three other component towns are Tunstall, Longton and Fenton.
Stoke-on-Trent is considered to be the home of the pottery industry in England and is commonly known as the Potteries. Formerly a primarily industrial conurbation, it is now a centre for service industries and distribution centres.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The name Stoke is taken from the town of Stoke-upon-Trent, the original ancient parish, with other settlements being chapelries.Mayor backs Stoke name change Stoke derives from the Old English stoc, a word that at first meant little more than place, but which subsequently gained more specific – but divergent – connotations. These variant meanings included dairy farm, secondary or dependent place or farm, summer pasture, crossing place, meeting place and place of worship. It is not known which of these was intended here, and all are feasible. The most frequently suggested interpretations derive from a crossing point on the Roman road that ran from present-day Derby to Chesterton or the early presence of a church, said to have been founded in 670 AD. Because Stoke was such a common name for a settlement, some kind of distinguishing affix was usually added later, in this case the name of the river.
The motto of Stoke-on-Trent is Vis Unita Fortior which can be translated as: United Strength is Stronger, or Strength United is the More Powerful, or A United Force is Stronger.Facts and figures about Stoke-on-Trent

===Administration===

An early proposal for a federation took place in 1888, when an amendment was raised to the Local Government Bill which would have made the six towns into districts within a county of “Staffordshire Potteries”. It was not until 1 April 1910 that the “Six Towns” were brought together. The county borough of Hanley, the municipal boroughs of Burslem, Longton, and Stoke, together with the urban districts of Tunstall and Fenton now formed a single county borough of Stoke-on-Trent.[tpl]cite news |title=A New County Borough |work=The Times |location=UK |date=21 March 1910[/tpl] The combined borough took the name “town of Stoke”.
In 1919, the borough proposed to expand further and annex the neighbouring borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Wolstanton United Urban District, both to the west of Stoke. This never took place, due to strong objections from Newcastle Corporation.[tpl]cite news |title="Greater Potteries" Scheme: Extension of Stoke-on-Trent |work=The Times |location=UK |date=25 April 1919[/tpl] A further attempt was made in 1930, with the promotion of the Stoke-on-Trent Extension Bill.[tpl]cite news |title=Stoke-on-Trent Bill: Extension of the City |work=The Times |location=UK |date=2 May 1930[/tpl] Ultimately, Wolstanton was instead added to Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1932. Although attempts to take Newcastle, Wolstanton and Kidsgrove (north of Tunstall) were never successful, the borough did expand in 1922, taking in Smallthorne Urban District and parts of other parishes from Stoke upon Trent Rural District. The borough was officially granted city status in 1925, with a Lord Mayor from 1928. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent initially applied for city status in 1925, citing its importance as the centre of the pottery industry, it was refused by the Home Office as it had fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, when a direct approach was made to King George V, who agreed that the borough ought to be a city. The public announcement of the elevation to city status was made by the King during a visit to Stoke on 4 June 1925.[tpl]cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=J.

The county borough was abolished in 1974, and Stoke became a non-metropolitan district of Staffordshire. Its status as a unitary authority was restored on 1 April 1997, although it remains part of the ceremonial county of Staffordshire. For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG23).

===Industry===

====Pottery====

Since the 17th century, the area has been almost exclusively known for its industrial-scale pottery manufacturing.thepotteries.org Companies such as Royal Doulton, Dudson Ltd, Spode (founded by Josiah Spode), Wedgwood (founded by Josiah Wedgwood), Minton (founded by Thomas Minton) and Baker & Co. (founded by William Baker) were established and based there. The local abundance of coal and clay suitable for earthenware production led to the early (initially limited) development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal enabled the import of china clay from Cornwall together with other materials and facilitated the production of creamware and bone china.
Other production centres in Britain, Europe and worldwide had a considerable lead in the production of high quality wares. Methodical and highly detailed research and experimentation, carried out over many years, nurtured the development of artistic talent throughout the local community and raised the profile of Staffordshire Potteries. This was spearheaded by one man, Josiah Wedgwood, and later by other local potters such as Thomas Whieldon, along with scientists and engineers.  With the industry came a large number of notable ceramic artists including Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, Charlotte Rhead, Frederick Hurten Rhead and Jabez Vodrey.

====Coal mining====

North Staffordshire was a centre for coal mining. The first reports of coal mining in the area come from the 13th century. The Potteries Coalfield (part of the North Staffordshire Coalfield) covers [tpl]convert|100|sqmi|km2|-2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.staffspasttrack.org.uk/exhibit/coal/historical%20overview/historicaloverview.htm |title=Coal Mining in North Staffordshire |publisher=Staffordshire County Council, Keele University, Staffordshire Learning Net |work=Staffordshire Past Track |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl]
Striking coal miners in the Hanley and Longton area ignited the nationwide 1842 General Strike and its associated Pottery Riots.[tpl]cite book |last=Fyson |first=R |editor1-first=Epstein |editor1-last=J |editor2-last=Thompson |editor2-first=D |title=The Chartist Experience: Studies in Working-Class Radicalism and Culture, 1830–1860 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1982 |chapter=The Crisis of 1842: Chartism, the Colliers' Strike and the Outbreak in the Potteries |pages=194–195, 214–216 |isbn=978-0-333-32972-6[/tpl]
When coal mining was nationalised in 1947, about 20,000 men worked in the industry in Stoke-on-Trent. Notable Collieries included Hanley Deep Pit, Trentham Superpit (formerly Hem Heath, Stafford and Florence Collieries), Fenton Glebe, Silverdale, Victoria, Mossfield, Parkhall, Norton, Chatterley Whitfield and Wolstanton. The industry developed greatly, and new investments in mining projects were planned within the City boundaries as recently as the 1990s.stokecoll.ac.uk Evening Sentinel (28 March 1991) Page 22 Co. However, 1994 saw the last pit to close as the Trentham Superpit was shut.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.urbed.com/cgi-bin/main.cgi?org_code=fffgggretyuiopef57&option=article&doc_id=44 |title=Trentham Lakes – Successful URBED strategy |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl]
The Stoke mining industry set several national and international records. Wolstanton Colliery, when modernised, had the deepest mining shafts in Europe at 3,197 ft.ISBN 978-0-19-955129-3 The Riches Beneath our Feet: How Mining Shaped Britain by Geoff Coyle (2010) In 1933, Chatterley Whitfield Colliery became the first Colliery in the country to mine one million tons of coal. In the 1980s Florence Colliery in Longton repeatedly set regional and national production records; in 1992 the combined Trentham Superpit (Hem Heath and Florence) was the first mine in Europe to produce 2.5 million saleable tonnes of coal.
Today the mines are all closed, though the scars of mining still remain on the landscape. Slag heaps are still visible on the skyline, now covered with flora and fauna. The Chatterly Whitfield site reopened as a museum two years after its closure in 1976. The museum closed in 1991 and the site became a local nature reserve. It was declared a Scheduled Ancient Monument by English Heritage in 1993.Local Nature Reserves – Whitfield Valley[ref]
The Friends of Chatterley Whitfield[/ref] The abandoned subterranean mines are inaccessible, though they still add complications to many building projects and occasionally cause minor tremors, detectable only by specialised equipment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/8486316.stm|title=Mine works cause tremors in Stoke-on-Trent |date=28 January 2010|work=BBC News |accessdate=29 January 2010[/tpl]
The Phoenix Trust, an independent not-for-profit foundation, is campaigning to turn Stoke-on-Trent and the wider North Staffordshire Coalfield into a World Heritage Site due to its historic economic significance, its leading role in the industrial revolution, and as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northstaffordshire.co.uk/?page_id=26 |title= North Staffordshire Coalfield – Potential World Heritage Site |publisher=The Phoenix Trust |date=July 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2011[/tpl]

====Steel====

The iron and steel industries occupied important roles in the development of the city, both before and after federation. Especially notable were those mills located in the valley at Goldendale and Shelton below the hill towns of Tunstall, Burslem and Hanley. Shelton Steelworks' production of steel ended in 1978—instead of producing crude steel, they concentrated on rolling steel billet which was transported from Scunthorpe by rail. The rolling plant finally closed in 2002.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.search.exploringthepotteries.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=451&originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault%2Easp&page=&records=&direction=&pointer=2191&text=1&resource=553 |title=Blast furnace demolition at Shelton Bar Steel Works |accessdate=20 May 2007 |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent museum[/tpl] From 1864 to 1927 Stoke housed the repair shops of the North Staffordshire Railway[tpl]cite book| last=Larkin |first=Edgar J |last2=Larkin |first2=John G |year=1988 |title=The Railway Workshops of Great Britain 1823–1986 |publisher=Macmillan Press |isbn=978-0-333-39431-1[/tpl] and was the home of independent railway locomotive manufacturers Kerr Stuart & Co.

Shelton Steel Works and the mining operations were heavily involved in the World War II industrial effort. Central to the RAF's success was the Supermarine Spitfire designed by Reginald Mitchell who, whilst born at 115 Congleton Road in the nearby village of Butt Lane, had his apprenticeship at Kerr Stuart & Co. Ltd's railway works.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/local_heroes/g_m/mitchell.shtml |title=Hugh Bourne, the religious reformer who also promoted social change |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC Stoke & Staffordshire |year=2002 |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl]

====Other====

The Michelin tyre company also has a presence in Stoke-on-Trent, and in the 1920s built their first UK plant in the city. In the 1980s nearly 9,000 workers were employed at the plant; in the early 2010s about 1,200 worked there.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

==Geography==

Stoke-on-Trent is situated about half-way between Manchester and Birmingham[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/cc/about-stoke-on-trent.en |title=Stoke-on-Trent – a changing city |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl] and adjoins the town and borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme, which is administered separately and is situated to the west. To the east is the Peak District, which includes part of the Staffordshire Moorlands District, as well as parts of Derbyshire, Greater Manchester and West and South Yorkshire.
For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG23) and is one of four counties or unitary districts that compose the "Shropshire and Staffordshire" NUTS 2 region.
Stoke-on-Trent is often known as "the city of five towns", because of the name given to it by local novelist Arnold Bennett. In his novels, Bennett used mostly recognisable aliases for five of the six towns (although he called Stoke "Knype"). However, Bennett said that he believed "Five Towns" was more euphonious than "Six Towns", so he omitted Fenton (now sometimes referred to as "the forgotten town").
As it is a city made up of multiple towns, the city forms a conurbation (although in this case the conurbation is bigger than Stoke itself, because the urban area of Stoke is now continuous with that of administratively-separate Newcastle).
The six towns run in a rough line from north to south along the A50 road – Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. Although the city is named after the original town of Stoke, and the City Council offices are located there, the city centre is usually regarded as being in Hanley, which had earlier developed into a major commercial centre.

===Suburbs===

As well as the Six Towns, there are numerous suburbs including Abbey Hulton, Adderley Green, Baddeley Green, Bentilee, Birches Head, Blurton, Bucknall, Bradeley, Chell, Cliffe Vale, Cobridge, Etruria, Fegg Hayes, Hartshill, Heron Cross, Meir, Meir Park, Meir Hay, Middleport, Milton, Norton le Moors, Penkhull, Shelton, Smallthorne, Sneyd Green, Trentham, Trent Vale and Weston Coyney.

===Climate===

Stoke-on-Trent, as with all of the United Kingdom, experiences a temperate maritime climate, lacking in weather extremes. The local area is relatively elevated, resulting in cooler temperatures year round compared to the nearby Cheshire plain; although on calm, clear nights this is often reversed as cold air drainage causes a temperature inversion to occur. As such, the Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle area are generally not susceptible to severe frosts. The nearest Met Office weather station is Keele University, about four miles west of the city centre.
The absolute high temperature is 32.9 °C (91.2 °F), recorded in August 1990, although more typically the average warmest day of the year should be 27.0 °C (80.6 °F). In total, just under six days should report a temperature of 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or above.
The absolute minimum temperature stands at −13.3 °C (8.1 °F), recorded during January 1963. In an average year, a total of 48.3 air frosts will be registered.
Rainfall averages around 785 mm a year, with 1 mm or more falling on just over 139 days. All averages refer to the 1971–2000 observation period.

==Demographics==

Based on the 2001 census, the total population of the city was 240,636 (2011 census, 249,000) in 103,196 households ).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/census/city-profile/ |title=City Profile |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=21 January 2007[/tpl] This was a decline of 3.5% since 1991.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/statistics/population/ |title=Population |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl] 51.3% of the population is female.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/census/age-structure/ |title=Age Structure |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=21 January 2007[/tpl] 96.3% of the population of Stoke-on-Trent were born in the UK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/census/ethnicity-and-religion/ |title=Ethnicity and Religion |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=21 January 2007[/tpl] 94.8% of the population identified themselves as white, 2.6% as Asian British Pakistani, 0.5% Asian British Indian and 0.3% as Black Afro Caribbean.

The average age of residents was 38½. A total of 24.2% of non-pensioner households were recorded as having no working adults.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/census/workless-households/|title=Workless households |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=21 January 2007[/tpl] In 2011 the population had increased to 249,000.

==Main sights==

The city's ceramics collection is housed in the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Hanley. Etruria Industrial Museum on the Caldon Canal, and Gladstone Pottery Museum in a former potbank in Longton are dedicated to the city's industrial heritage. Ceramica in Burslem used to be an interactive ceramics museum, but it closed in 2011 due to council funding cuts.
Most of the major pottery companies based in Stoke-on-Trent have factory shops and visitor centres. The £10 million Wedgwood Museum visitor centre opened in the firm's factory in Barlaston in October 2008. The Dudson Centre in Hanley is a museum of the family ceramics business, which is partly housed in a Grade II listed bottle kiln. It is also a volunteer centre. Burleigh in Middleport is the world's oldest working Victorian pottery. There are also smaller factory shops, such as Royal Stafford in Burslem, Moorcroft in Cobridge and Emma Bridgewater in Hanley. In addition, there are ambitious plans to open the huge Chatterley Whitfield Colliery as a mining museum, since it has been given Ancient Monument status.
The Elizabethan Ford Green Hall is a 17th-century farmhouse which is now a historic house museum in Smallthorne.
Many local people consider Trentham Gardens to be in Stoke-on-Trent but it is actually in the Borough of Stafford. It is just south of the city and a £100 million refurbishment was completed in 2005. Next door is Trentham Monkey Forest, which houses 140 Barbary Macaques in a [tpl]convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] enclosure that visitors can walk through.
The Alton Towers Resort is [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of Stoke-on-Trent and is one of the United Kingdom's best known attractions. The Waterworld indoor swimming complex on Festival Park near Hanley is also a significant children's attraction.
Each of the six towns in Stoke-on-Trent has at least one park. At nine hectares, Burslem Park is one of the largest registered Victorian parks in the UK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/download/asset/?asset_id=2167397|title=Burslem Park factsheet |accessdate=28 September 2010 |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council [/tpl] Park Hall Country Park in Weston Coyney is a National Nature Reserve, and its sandstone canyons are a Site of Special Scientific Interest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/leisure/parks/park-hall-country-park/ |title=Park Hall Country Park |accessdate=18 August 2008 |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council [/tpl] Hartshill Park in Stoke is also a nature reserve, and Bucknall Park is home to the City Farm.

==Economy==

North Staffordshire is a world centre for fine ceramics—a skilled design trade has existed in the area since at least the 12th century. But in the late 1980s and 1990s Stoke-on-Trent was hit hard by the general decline in the British manufacturing sector. Numerous factories, steelworks, collieries, and potteries were closed, including the renowned Shelton Bar steelworks. This resulted in a sharp rise in unemployment in the 'high-skilled but low-paid' workforce.
The pottery firm Wedgwood and its subsidiary Royal Doulton are based in nearby Barlaston, although much production now takes place in the firm's Indonesian factory. Portmeirion is based in Stoke town, and now owns the Spode and Royal Worcester ceramics brands. Ceramics firm Emma Bridgewater is based in Hanley; Burleigh Pottery is in Middleport; Wade Ceramics is in Etruria; Moorcroft and Royal Stafford are based in Burslem; Aynsley China is in Longton, and is one of the last remaining manufacturers of bone china in the city. Fine china manufacturer Dudson have premises in Hanley and Burslem. Churchill China have their main factory in Tunstall, while hotelware manufacturer Steelite is based in Middleport at the former Dunn Bennett site.
About 9,000 firms are based in the city.

===Leader and cabinet system===

Each cabinet member makes the decisions on their portfolio area and explains the decisions at the monthly cabinet meetings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/council-leader-and-cabinet/ |title=Leader and Cabinet system|work=Stoke-on-Trent Council|accessdate=28 February 2010[/tpl]
The current Leader of the Council is Cllr Mohammed Pervez who is also leader of the City's Labour Group, the majority group on the council.

===Lord Mayor===

The position of Lord Mayor is largely ceremonial. The title of Lord Mayor was first conferred on the City of Stoke-on-Trent by King George V on 10 July 1928. The role of Lord Mayor is decided upon by a vote amongst the elected councillors; the candidates are also selected from the councillors. The current Lord Mayor is Councillor Sheila Pitt.[tpl]Update after|2014|5|2[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/lord-mayor/current-lord-mayor/|title=Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent – Terry Crowe|work=Stoke-on-Trent Council|accessdate=4 June 2012[/tpl]
Between 1910 and 1928 the Borough, and later, City of Stoke-on-Trent had a Mayor rather than a Lord Mayor.

==Transport==

===Major roads===

Stoke-on-Trent is linked to the nearby M6 motorway at junctions 15 and 16 by the A500. Locally the A500 is known as the D road,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/7474.aspx |publisher=Highways Agency |date = June 2001|title=Good news for Stoke |accessdate=13 May 2007[/tpl] as its loop between the two motorway junctions, along with the straight section of the M6 between the junctions, resembles the shape of a capital letter D. Additionally, the number 500 expressed in Roman numerals is D. The A50 cuts through the city, providing an east-west link between the M6 and M1 motorways. Improvements to the road network have led to the construction of product distribution centres in the area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/business/economic-development/ |title=Doing Business in Stoke-on-Trent |work=Stoke-on-line |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |accessdate=13 November 2006[/tpl]

===Bus===

Local public transport is provided almost exclusively by bus. Bus services are mainly operated by Potteries Motor Traction, now owned by FirstGroup under the name First Potteries. There are also several smaller companies operating bus services in the city. There are central bus stations in Hanley and Longton. National Express operate long distance coach services from Hanley Bus Station. As part of the city's regeneration, a new bus station has been constructed in Hanley, allowing the old one to be demolished, making room for further redevelopment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/transport-and-streets/public-transport/new-bus-station---city-centre/ |title=New City Centre Bus Station |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent City Council |date=March 2013 |accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl]

==Education==

===Higher education===

There are four higher education institutions in the local area, the two further education colleges being City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and Stoke-on-Trent College. Formerly of Fenton, now located in a newly built structure on Leek Road, the Sixth Form college provides A-level teaching for around 1,800 students. Stoke-on-Trent College is much larger and less specialised, offering apprenticeships and adult education, and has a main campus (Cauldon Campus) in Shelton, and a secondary campus in Burslem.
The city is also home to Staffordshire University (formerly North Staffordshire Polytechnic), with its main site in Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent railway station. It gained its university status in 1992 as one of the post-1992 universities. Keele University School of Medicine uses facilities at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Hartshill. Keele University itself was founded as the University College of North Staffordshire in 1949 with major involvement by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and is located in the nearby village of Keele.

===Secondary education===

The city currently has fourteen secondary schools: Birches Head High, the Discovery Academy (with sites in Bucknall and Longton), Haywood High, Holden Lane High, Longton - the Co-operative Academy, Ormiston Horizon Academy, Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy, Sandon High, St Peter's Academy (with a new site in Fenton), St. Joseph's College, St. Margaret Ward Catholic College, St. Thomas More Catholic College, Stoke Studio College (with sites in Longton and Burslem), Thistley Hough Academy and Trentham High.
A major re-structure of Stoke-on-Trent's high school system was proposed in 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2007/11/15/education_proposals_sot_feature.shtml |title= All change for education in Stoke-on-Trent |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl] As part of these plans several established secondary schools closed or merged including Longton High School (closed 2010),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moderngov.stoke.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=8278 |title=Proposals for secondary school reorganisation: Longton and Sandon High Schools: APPENDIX 2 PROPOSAL TO DISCONTINUE (CLOSE) LONGTON HIGH SCHOOL AND ARTS COLLEGE |date= 10 June 2008 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl] Mitchell High and Edensor High (merged to form The Discovery Academy),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/education/building-schools-for-the-future/discovery-academy.en |title=The Discovery Academy |date=October 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]  St. Peter's CE High School and Berry Hill High (merged to form St Peter's Academy).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/education/building-schools-for-the-future/st-peters-academy.en |title=St Peter's Academy |date=October 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011[/tpl]

===Potters' Holidays===

One of the legacies of the pottery industry was Stoke's own version of the wakes week. Although better known in industrial Lancashire, the Stoke week is known locally as the Potters' Holidays[tpl]cite web |url=http://pitsnpots.co.uk/2009/06/potters-holidays-the-sad-demise |title=Potters Holidays – The Sad Demise! |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x2YRTP3m |archivedate= 8 March 2011[/tpl] or Potters' Fortnight and occurred the last week in June, the first week in July and another week in August. This gave what appeared to be strange school holidays—with the summer term having a two-week break at the end of June, then children returning to school for three weeks before taking a five-week summer holiday. This observance has disappeared from the local schools, due to decreased emphasis on traditional industries.

==Sport==

===Football===

Stoke-on-Trent is home to two professional Football League teams, and is one of the smaller cities in England that boasts two league clubs. The club bearing the area's name is Stoke City, who were formed in 1863 and is the second-oldest professional football club in England. They currently play at the Britannia Stadium at Trentham Lakes, Great Fenton, which has been their home since 1997 when they relocated from the Victoria Ground in Stoke after 119 years. They were among the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888, but did not win their first (and, to date, only) major trophy until 1972, when they lifted the Football League Cup. In 1985, they were relegated from the First Division and began a 23-year exile from the top flight of English football which did not end until they won promotion in 2008, by which time the First Division had become the Premier League. Stoke City reached the final of the F.A. Cup for the first time in 2011 but were defeated by Manchester City. Arguably the club's most famous player of all time was Stanley Matthews, who is perhaps the best known sportsperson from the city. He played football for Stoke City and Blackpool where he played in what became known as the Matthews Final. He also managed Port Vale from 1965 to 1968. He was the first active footballer to receive a Knighthood. The "wizard of dribble", as he became known, made 54 appearances for his country, scoring 11 times. There are two statues of Matthews in the city: one in Hanley, and one at the Britannia Stadium.
The city's other professional football club is Port Vale, who were formed in 1876 and play at Vale Park in the Burslem area. Previous stadiums include the Athletic Ground in Cobridge (1886–1913), and The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley (1913–1950). They joined the Football League in 1892 but were forced to resign in 1907 due to financial problems, only to return in 1919. Their highest league position came in 1931 when they finished fifth in the Football League Second Division. In 1954, while in the Third Division (North) they progressed to the FA Cup semi-final when they were knocked out by First Division West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park. This remains the furthest they have progressed in the competition. Unlike Stoke City, their local rivals in the Potteries derby, they have never played top division football and hold the record for most years spent in the second tier without ever playing in the first. After promotion was confirmed on the last day of the 2012/2013 season they will play the 2013/2014 season in League One (third tier). Individuals of note include John Rudge (who managed the club for 16 years from 1983–1999), and Roy Sproson (who made a record 837 appearances for the club from 1950 until 1972, and was later their manager).
In the past there existed Dresden United, a club which was disestablished before the city was federated; amateur clubs Meir KA and Eastwood Hanley operated between 1972–2010, and 1946–1997 respectively. Smallthorne based Norton United still compete in the North West Counties Football League, as do Hanley Town in the Staffordshire County Senior League.

===Other sports teams===

The city speedway team is the Stoke Potters. Speedway was staged at the Greyhound Stadium in Sun Street, Hanley intermittently between 1929 and 1939. In 1947 the Potters were part of the post war boom rising from Division Three of the National League to Division Two before closing in the early-1950s. The Potters were revived in 1960 and they raced in the Provincial League until the end of 1963 when the stadium was closed and the site redeveloped. Speedway was revived at Loomer Road in Newcastle-under-Lyme, initially as Chesterton, before it reverted to the Stoke name. For many years the Potters raced in the Premier League, the sports second division but as of November 2010 have dropped a division and in 2011 will race in the National League.
The ski race team based at the artificial ski slope in Festival Park compete in national Snowsport England and international FIS Fédération Internationale de Ski events.
The city has a number of amateur sports clubs, including rugby union and cricket, the latter competing in the North Staffs and South Cheshire Cricket League. The cricket ground in Longton is one of the venues used by Staffordshire County Cricket Club. As well as the Longton club, Meir Heath Cricket Club are also active, though the County Ground and the Michelin Ground are no longer used for cricket.
Stoke Spitfires was the name of the city's American football team. The team eventually folded in 1992 after a record of 35-34-1. In 1994 the Staffordshire Surge was formed and played their matches in and around Stoke-on-Trent. Currently the team play at Longton Rugby Club in Division One North of the British American Football League.

===Individual sports persons===

The city has a sporting Hall of Fame, opened in 2011 to honour sporting legends from the city. As of March 2011, it holds four names. Stanley Matthews and Phil Taylor, legends of football and darts respectively, were the first names to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/darts/8448265.stm|title=Darts champion Phil Taylor honoured by Stoke |date=8 January 2010|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 March 2011[/tpl] They were quickly followed by Port Vale legend Roy Sproson, and England's World Cup winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks (who spent five years with Stoke City).[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/9411597.stm|title=Gordon Banks inducted into Stoke-on-Trent Hall of Fame |date=2 March 2011|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 March 2011[/tpl]

===Public Art===

The outskirts of Tunstall will become home to a new public art statue called Golden by the end of 2013.

In October 2013 a sculpture commemorating the efforts of miners to rebuild the Czech village of Lidice devastated during the Second World War was unveiled. The [tpl]convert|6.8|m|ft|in[/tpl] high steel sculpture cost £100,000 to build and features 3,000 tags bearing the initials of people who promise to share the story of the 1942 Lidice Shall Live movement. The group was set up by former Stoke-on-Trent MP Sir Barnett Stross, who enlisted local miners to donate one day's pay a week to rebuild the village after Adolf Hitler ordered its destruction in revenge for the Murder of Reinhard Heydrich by British trained Czech resistance fighters. North Staffordshire-based Dashyline was commissioned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to create the artwork, which has been installed near Hanley bus station.£100k sculpture unveiled as tribute to miners who helped rebuild a devastated Czech community

===Literature===

Through the works of Arnold Bennett, described by some as the greatest realist writer of the 20th century,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2006/04/04/local_heroes_arnold_bennett_feature.shtml |title=Arnold Bennett – Potteries author |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC Stoke & Staffordshire |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl] the “Six Towns” were sometimes known as the “Five Towns”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/bennett.htm |title=Arnold Bennett Profile |work=Literary Heritage |publisher=Shropshire County Council |accessdate=6 May 2007[/tpl] In his novels, Bennett wrote about local events in the 19th century[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/li/specarc/archives/bennett.htm |title=Arnold Bennett Papers |publisher=Keele University |accessdate=20 May 2007[/tpl] and consistently changed all proper names and associations, thus Hanley became Hanbridge and Burslem became Bursley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thepotteries.org/people_famous/bennett/locations.htm |title=Arnold Bennett and The Potteries |publisher=Steve Birks[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Studies in the sources of Arnold Bennett's novels |last=Tillier |first= Louis |year=1969 |publisher=Didier |asin=B0006CRU2S[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Arnold Bennett and Stoke-on-Trent |last=Warrilow |first=E.

Bennett also changed the name of the local newspaper from The Sentinel to The Signal, an identity that was subsequently adopted by the city's commercial radio station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.signalradio.com/about.php |title=About Us |publisher=Signal Radio |accessdate=20 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927070425/http://www.signalradio.com/about.php  |archivedate = 27 September 2007[/tpl]

Staffordshire oatcakes (very different from the Scottish version and traditionally made in corner-shop style oatcake bakeries) are a much-loved local culinary speciality, though fame has yet to travel far outside Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire.

==Dialect==

The Potteries has a distinctive local dialect. Whilst it contains many non-standard words (e.g. nesh meaning “soft, tender, or to easily get cold”; and slat meaning “to throw”), the best known word is duck, which is used as a greeting to either men or women. It is believed to be derived from the Saxon word ducas, used to indicate respect; in Middle English this became duc or duk, which denotes a leader; in turn, it became the title Duke and the Old French word ducheé, which indicates the territory ruled by a Duke.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/voices2005/features/steve_birks.shtml |title=Voices – The history of the Potteries dialect |accessdate=14 May 2007 |work=BBC Stoke & Staffordshire |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl]
Another common variation on the standard English dialect is the use of the word shug for sugar. This is usually used as a term of endearment when closing a sentence, as in “Ta Shug” (thank you, sugar).
