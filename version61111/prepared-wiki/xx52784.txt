She then proceeded to add it to her successful 2010-12 "More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour. Vandross also recorded a version of this song on his Your Secret Love album in 1996. He made two public appearances at Diana Ross's Return to Love Tour at its opening in Philadelphia at First Union Spectrum and its final stop at Madison Square Garden in 2000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

In 1985, Vandross first spotted the talent of [tpl]Anchor|Jimmy Salvemini[/tpl]Jimmy Salvemini, who was fifteen at the time, on Star Search. Vandross thought Salvemini had the perfect voice for some of his songs, and contacted Salvemini, who was managed by his brother Larry. A contract was negotiated with Elektra records for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He even contacted old friends Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara to appear on the album.
After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross' 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the north section of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. Luther was driving at 48 mph in a 35 mph zone when his Mercedes veered across the double yellow center line of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 Mercury Marquis that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 Cadillac Seville head on.[tpl]cite news|title=Passenger Dies in Crash of Car Driven by R&B Singer Vandross|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-13/local/me-27701_1_singer-luther-vandross|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-01-20|date=1986-01-13[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=People in the News|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/People-in-the-News/id-a11e459e36b79d7f7c3271251693c404|newspaper=Associated Press|accessdate=2014-01-20|date=1986-01-18[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Luther Vandross Injured In Three-Car Collision; One Passenger Killed|url=http://books.google.pl/books?id=NrMDAAAAMBAJ&hl=pl&pg=PA14&img=1&zoom=3&hl=pl&sig=ACfU3U35HDzEevdZvVJ9kkhysxk7LQkc9w|journal=Spin|volume=69|issue=19|page=14|accessdate=2014-01-20|date=1986-01-27[/tpl] Luther Vandross and Jimmy Salvemini were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Larry Salvemini, who was riding on the front passenger seat, was killed during the collision. Vandross suffered three broken ribs, broken hip, several bruises and facial cuts. Jimmy, who sat in the back of the car, had cuts, bruises and contusions. In the same year, Vandross faced vehicular manslaughter charges as a result of Larry's death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence Vandross was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The singer pled no contest to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a wrongful death suit against him. The case was quietly settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family for about $630,000.[tpl]cite news|title=Local News in Brief : City Settles in Car Crash|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-10/local/me-27949_1_car-crash|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-02-18|date=1987-12-10[/tpl] The album called "Roll With It" was released later that year.

===2003–2005: Illness and death===

Vandross suffered from diabetes and hypertension, both of which may have been brought on by family genetics as well as lifestyle and nutrition.  He had just finished the final vocals for the album Dance With My Father (2003), on which he collaborated with pop rock artist Richard Marx, when on April 16, 2003 he suffered a severe stroke at his home in New York City. The stroke left him in a coma for nearly two months, during which time he also had to fight both meningitis and pneumonia (which required a tracheotomy). The stroke also left Vandross with noticeable difficulty speaking and singing, as well as confinement to a wheelchair.
Vandross appeared briefly on videotape at the 2004 Grammy Awards to accept his Song of the Year Award for "Dance With My Father". In addition to thanking his fans for their support throughout his ordeal and recovery, he said, "When I say goodbye it's never for long, because I believe in the power of love" (he sang the last six words). Following an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, he was never seen in public again.
