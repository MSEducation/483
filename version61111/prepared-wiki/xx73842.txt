[[List of oldest universities in continuous operation]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of universities and colleges, Educational institutions by year of establishment

This is a list of the oldest existing universities in the world. To be included in this table, an educational institution must satisfy a traditional definition of university[tpl]#tag:ref|"The statement that all universities are descended either directly or by migration from these three prototypes Paris, and Bologna depends, of course, on one's definition of a university. And I must define a university very strictly here. A university is something more than a center of higher education and study. One must reserve the term university for—and I'm quoting Rashdall here—"a scholastic guild, whether of masters or students, engaged in higher education and study," which was later defined, after the emergence of universities, as studium generale."[tpl]Citation | last = Hyde | first = J.

Chronologically, it must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history, and so some early universities, most notably the University of Paris (which was suspended from 1793 to 1896), the University of Salerno and the University of Montpellier are excluded (see map).
The word university is derived from the [tpl]lang-la|universitas magistrorum et scholarium[/tpl], roughly meaning "community of teachers and scholars". The term was coined by the Italian University of Bologna, which, with a traditional founding date of 1088, is considered the first university.Hunt Janin: "The university in medieval life, 1179–1499", McFarland, 2008, ISBN 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f.de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47–55 The origin of many medieval universities can be traced to the Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools which appear as early as the 6th century and were run for hundreds of years as such before their formal establishment as university in the high medieval period.[tpl]Cite book | last = Riché | first = Pierre | title = Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | location = Columbia | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-87249-376-8 |pages=126–127, 282–298[/tpl]

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities.Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emrgence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances."Verger, Jacques: "Patterns", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): A History of the University in Europe.

Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere."Makdisi, George: "Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages", Studia Islamica, No. 32 (1970), pp. 255–264 (264):|group=Note[/tpl]Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword.

==Medieval origins==

The university as an institution was historically rooted in that medieval society which it in turn influenced and shaped:

==Modern spread==

From the early modern period onwards, the university gradually spread from the medieval Latin west across the globe, eventually replacing all other higher-learning institutions and becoming the preeminent institution for higher education everywhere. This process occurred in the following chronological order:Rüegg, Walter (ed.): Geschichte der Universität in Europa, 3 vols., C.H. Beck, München 1993, ISBN 3-406-36956-1

==Founded before 1500==

The earliest and only universities before the colonization of the Americas were established and run in medieval Europe.

==Oldest universities by country or region after 1500 still in operation==

The majority of European countries had universities by 1500. After 1500, universities began to spread to other countries all over the world:
