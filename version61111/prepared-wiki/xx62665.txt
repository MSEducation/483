Gwinnett County Transit or GCT is the bus public transit system in Gwinnett County, Georgia, USA, one of metro Atlanta's three most populous suburban counties. (The others are Cobb County, which operates Cobb Community Transit, and Clayton County, which formerly operated Clayton County C-TRAN.)
It was formed in 2000, with express buses starting in November 2001 and local buses in November 2002, and has had greater-than-expected ridership since then. Routes connect to the most populated areas of the county, including Norcross and Lawrenceville. With the assistance of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA), express services are available to Atlanta, connecting with MARTA at the Doraville (NE10), Lindbergh Center (N6), Arts Center (N5), Midtown (N4), North Avenue (N3), Civic Center (N2), Peachtree Center (N1), and Five Points stations. Transfers are free between MARTA and GCT. On December 10, 2008, GCT began the official Breeze Card Pilot Launch on routes 10, 102, and 103A. The pilot is expected to last approximately two months according to a memorandum. On February 2, 2009, the pilot program began on the GRTA Xpress routes (410, 412, and 418) operated by GCT.
Along with Cobb, Gwinnett voted against MARTA in the 1970s and thus was left out of a system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] The lack of sales tax revenue from the two counties stunted the growth of MARTA; however, GRTA, created by former Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, has been seeking to create other solutions, such as transit for the entire Atlanta and surrounding areas. The Gwinnett Place Community Improvement District (GPCID) along with MARTA are seeking alternatives such as  light rail to Gwinnett through the Gwinnett Place area.
Gwinnett County Transit has 5 local bus routes. The Gwinnett Place Mall Transit Center Hub houses the transfer point for local routes; 10, 30, and 40. Gwinnett County Transit has 6 express bus routes, 3 of which belong to GRTA Xpress. The express routes are 101, 102, 103, 408, 410, 412, and 418. There are also routes 101A and 103A, which are used by reverse commuters on the AM and PM trips.
