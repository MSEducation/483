Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye is a 2004 experimental film adaptation of the 1928 novel Story of the Eye by the French writer Georges Bataille.  The film, directed by Andrew Repasky McElhinney, takes place in a seemingly abandoned house where a group of people engage in wordless acts of passion.  The film covers a period from evening to morning, and the sexual couplings among the members of the house becomes increasingly harrowing as daylight arrives.Mk Magazine News: Film: Georges Bataille's Story Of The Eye
Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye began as a video installation before being reconfigured into a feature-length film. It had its New York theatrical premiere in September 2004, and its support was led by Dave Kehr of the New York Times, who wrote of the production; “This is transgression in a literal sense, an act of aggression that Bataille would no doubt have appreciated. This is not a movie for passive consumption, but a film that bites back.”The New York Times > Movies > Movie Review | 'Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye': Exploring the Temptation to Look (and to Look Away)
