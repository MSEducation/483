The Nuremberg Code is a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation set as a result of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials at the end of the Second World War.

==Background==

On August 20, 1947,Annas, George J., and Michael A. Grodin. The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code. New York, NY: Oxford University Press Inc., 1992. Print. the judges delivered their verdict in the "Doctors' Trial" against Karl Brandt and 22 others.  These trials focused on doctors involved in the human experiments in concentration camps.[tpl]cite web|title=Eugenics/Euthanasia|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?ta=abcgeamrle&uh=eugenics_euthanasia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl]   The suspects were involved in over 3,500,000 sterilizations of German citizens. 
The trials began on December 9, 1946 in Nuremberg, Germany and were led exclusively by the United States. Harry Truman approved these trials in January 1946.http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/The%20Nuremburg%20Code.htm
Most of the suspects escaped punishment for their crimes.[tpl]cite web|last=Annas|first=George J.|title=The Review of: The Nazis Doctors and the Nuremberg Code: Human Rights in Human Experimentation|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v070/70.1br_annas.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] Several of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from pre-war ones and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments.  Following the Doctor's Trial, the guilty were eventually punished for their actions during the Holocaust.
In May of the same year, Dr. Leo Alexander had submitted to the Counsel for War Crimes six points defining legitimate medical research. The trial verdict adopted these points and added an extra four. The ten points constituted the "Nuremberg Code". Although the legal force of the document was not established and it was not incorporated directly into either the American or German law, the Nuremberg Code and the related[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-03.html|title=Patients' rights: from Alder Hey to the Nuremberg Code|last=Hurren|first=Elizabeth|date=May 2002|work=History & Policy| publisher= History & Policy|language=English|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom[/tpl] Declaration of Helsinki are the basis for the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Volume 46,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/45cfr46_00.html |title=Public Welfare |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date=2000-10-01 |accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] which are the regulations issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services governing federally funded human subjects research in the United States. In addition, the Nuremberg code has also been incorporated into the law of individual states such as California and other countries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
The Nuremberg code includes such principles as informed consent and absence of coercion; properly formulated scientific experimentation; and beneficence towards experiment participants.
