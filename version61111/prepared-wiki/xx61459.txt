León is a department (state) in northwestern Nicaragua (5,138 km2).   It is also the second largest city in Nicaragua, after Managua. It was founded by the Spaniards as León Santiago de los Caballeros and rivals Granada, Nicaragua, in the number of historic Spanish colonial churches, secular buildings, and private residences. As of 2007, the city had an estimated population of 191,076.http://www.inide.gob.ni/Anuarios/Anuario2007/ModuloII-Social/ModuloII_SeccionII.1.pdf which increases sharply during university season with many students coming from other regions of Nicaragua. It is the capital and municipality of León department.
León is located along the Río Chiquito (Chiquito River), some [tpl]convert|90|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] northwest of Managua, and some [tpl]convert|18|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] east of the Pacific Ocean coast. León has long been the political and intellectual center of the nation and its National Autonomous University of Nicaragua UNAN was founded in 1813, making it the second oldest university in Central America. León is also an important industrial, agricultural (sugar cane, cattle, peanut, plantain, sorghum) and commercial center for Nicaragua.

==History==

The first city named León in Nicaragua was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba about [tpl]convert|20|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] east of the present site. The city was abandoned in 1610 after a series of earthquakes.  The ruins of the city are known as "León Viejo" and were excavated in 1960. In the year 2000, León Viejo was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
León had been the capital of Nicaragua since colonial times, so naturally when Nicaragua withdrew from the United Provinces of Central America in 1839, León became the capital of the new nation. For some years the capital shifted back and forth between León and Granada, Nicaragua, with Liberal regimes preferring León and Conservative ones Granada, until as a compromise Managua was agreed upon to be the permanent capital in 1858.
In 1950 the city of León had a population of 31,000 people. Nicaraguan President and dictator Anastasio Somoza García was shot and mortally wounded in León on September 21, 1956.
