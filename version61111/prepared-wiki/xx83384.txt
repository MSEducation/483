==History==

Drury was founded as Springfield College in 1873 by Congregationalist church missionaries in the mold of other Congregationalist universities such as Dartmouth College and Yale University. Rev. Nathan Morrison, Samuel Drury, and James and Charles Harwood provided the school's initial endowment and organization; Samuel Drury's gift was the largest of the group and the school was soon renamed in honor of Drury's recently deceased son.
The early curriculum emphasized educational, religious, and musical strengths. Students came to the new college from a wide area, including the Indian Territories of Oklahoma. The first graduating class included four women.
When classes began in 1873, they were held in a single building on a campus occupying less than [tpl]convert|1+1/2|acre|2[/tpl]. Twenty-five years later the [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha|1|sing=on[/tpl] campus included Stone Chapel, the Presidentâ€™s House and three academic buildings. Today, the university occupies a [tpl]convert|115|acre|ha|1|sing=on[/tpl] campus, including the original historic buildings.
On April 28, 1960, Drury College was the setting for an episode of NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. Tennessee Ernie Ford sang his trademark "Sixteen Tons" and the hymn "Take My Hand, Precious Lord".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/FordShow4-5.htm|title=The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford|publisher=ernieford.com|accessdate=November 26, 2010[/tpl]

===Religious affiliations===

Drury, like Dartmouth and Yale, was founded by Congregationalist missionaries, and like these schools, it is no longer a religious institution. It remains affiliated with the Congregationalist church and its successor, the United Church of Christ. It has also been affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) since the founding of the Drury School of Religion in 1909.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=3013&NLID=39| title=Drury's Church Affiliation |publisher=Drury University|accessdate=2007-03-27[/tpl]

===Housing===

Freshmen are required to live in one of the three residence halls: Smith, Wallace, and Sunderland halls. Smith Hall and Wallace Hall are suite-style double-occupancy rooms, where two rooms share a bathroom. Sunderland Hall has suite-style single-occupancy rooms, with four students and two bathrooms in a suite. Freshmen in Sunderland Hall live in Living Learning Communities (LLC's), which is a group of students who have CORE Class together and are grouped by similar interests.
Students live on campus until they are age 21 or older, or are married. The majority of students live on-campus. Upperclassmen may choose live in university-owned apartments, fraternity houses, or the Summit Park Leadership Community. Summit Park residents (usually sophomores), in teams of four or eight, design a year-long service project and present it to a panel in the year prior in order to earn their spot in one of these 10 apartment units.

===Study abroad===

Drury's study abroad program is an integral part of the college experience. Almost half of the student body studies overseas at some point in short-term, semester, or year-long programs. Foreign learning is a requirement for most students with majors in the schools of Business and Architecture.
Drury also maintains a satellite campus in Aigina, Greece that is home to several of the university's most distinctive courses. Though the Center is quite popular with architecture students, it is attended by students across disciplines and majors.Drury University: About the Drury Center in Aigina, Greece
