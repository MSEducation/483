[[Expert elicitation]]

CATEGORIES: Scientific method

In science, engineering, and research, expert elicitation is the synthesis of opinions of authorities of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient data or when such data is unattainable because of physical constraints or lack of resources.  Expert elicitation is essentially a scientific consensus methodology.  It is often used in the study of rare events.  Expert elicitation allows for parameterization, an "educated guess", for the respective topic under study.  Expert elicitation generally quantifies uncertainty.
Expert elicitation tends to be multidisciplinary as well as interdisciplinary, with practically universal applicability, and is used in a broad range of fields.  Prominent recent expert elicitation applications are to climate change, modeling seismic hazard and damage, association of tornado damage to wind speed in developing the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and risk analysis for nuclear waste storage.
