[[Yamaha SY22]]

CATEGORIES: Yamaha synthesizers

The SY22 is a combined FM/sample-based synthesizer introduced by Yamaha in 1990, building on the vector synthesis technology developed by Sequential Circuits prior to their demise and takeover by Yamaha in 1987. A joystick allows the user to 'morph' between four different sound sources; two FM, and two sample-based. These joystick movements can be recorded and repeated for each note played.
