Mainbocher is a fashion label founded by the American couturier Main Rousseau Bocher (1890-1976), also known as Mainbocher.  Established in 1929, the house of Mainbocher successfully operated in Paris (1929-1939) and then in New York (1940-1971). Although often pronounced "Man-bo-shay," the designer's name is correctly pronounced "Maine-Bocker."[tpl]Citation | last = McConathy | first = Dale | title = American Fashion - The life and lines of Adrian, Mainbocher, McCardell, Norell and Trigère | publisher = The Fashion Institute of Technology, Quadrangle | pages = 115-200 | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-8129-0524-5[/tpl]

In 1937, he also designed the wedding dress and trousseau of her marriage to the former Edward VIII (the Duke of Windsor).

Mainbocher's last Paris collections created a storm of controversy.  Just as later Dior's "New Look", the "Mainbocher Corset," a nipped-in waist, radically altered the undefined silhouette of the thirties. This change, linked with the fame of his trousseau for the Duchess of Windsor, was a beginning of a new phase in fashion, eventually as influential as Coco Chanel's loosely cut, boxy jackets and skirts.  The corset that shaped Mainbocher's last Parisian collection was immortalized in 1939 by one of Horst's most famous photographs, known as the "Mainbocher Corset."The Mainbocher Corset captured by Horst  The corset itself, listed in Town and Country as one of the big events of 1939, caused a furor in France.  Mainbocher's corseted waist, defined bosom, and back draping was an abrupt shift in sihouette and introduced the Victorian motifs that were to pervade the forties.

==American years==

In 1940, Main Bocher relocated his business to New York on 57th Street next to Tiffany's and established "Mainbocher Inc." As a French-American designer of international reputation, Mainbocher returned to New York with wide publicity, the first American celebrity in the French fashion world.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The corset controversy proved to be a significant marketing opportunity; the house of Mainbocher teamed up with the Warner Brothers Corset Company and streamlined the design for mass production.
During the Second World War, Mainbocher lent his designs to the American Navy for the creation of the uniforms for the women only division of the Navy, called WAVES.
In New York, Mainbocher continued to design for generations of women like debutante Brenda Frazier, Doris Duke, Adele Astaire, Elizabeth Parke Firestone, Gloria Vanderbilt, Lila Wallace, Bunny Mellon, Babe Paley, Princess Maria Cristina de Bourbon, Kathryn Miller, and C. Z. Guest.  In 1947, eight of the New York Dress Institute's Ten Best-Dressed Women in the World were Mainbocher clients.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
After he achieved fame for dressing some of the world's most famous women, Mainbocher was commissioned to design the costumes for Leonora Corbett in the comic play Blithe Spirit (1941), for Mary Martin in the Broadway musicals One Touch of Venus (1943) and The Sound of Music (1959), for Tallulah Bankhead in the Broadway production Private Lives (1948), for Ethel Merman in the musical Call Me Madam (1950), for Rosalind Russell in the musical Wonderful Town (1953), for Lynn Fontanne in The Great Sebastians (1956), for Katharine Cornell in The Prescott Papers, for Irene Worth in the play Tiny Alice (1964), and for Lauren Bacall in the musical Applause (1970).[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In 1961, Mainbocher business moved to the K.L.M. Building on Fifth Avenue and continued until 1971 when Mainbocher, at the age of 81, closed the doors of his house.

In 2002, Mainbocher was honored with a bronze plaque on New York City's Fashion Walk of Fame in the legendary garment district.
Christian Dior: "Mainbocher is really in advance of us all, because he does it in America."The New York Times, Mainbocher Stands for a Fitting, March 25, 1956
Christian Lacroix: "Mainbocher, it's glamour, but with a sense of everyday glamour...  It's so pure, so new." Women's Wear Daily, What's old is new, Lacroix shows fashion history, November 8, 2007
Hamish Bowles: "I am absolutely crazy about Mainbocher’s clothes. I think they are so subtle, the detailing is so extraordinary, and they are so unbelievably evocative of such a particular time and place and milieu and lifestyle, of absolute subtle luxury. You can really see why a client like Wallis Windsor would have been drawn to his clothes, and why she became so emblematic of his work."Hamish Bowles, Interview Magazine, March 2009
