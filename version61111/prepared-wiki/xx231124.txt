[[North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics, Science competitions

The North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) is a linguistics competition for high school students in the United States and Canada that has been held since 2007. Around 1000 students participate annually.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/press-release2010.html |title=NACLO 2010 Press Release |accessdate=18 November 2008 |date=May 2010[/tpl] Since 2008 the contest has consisted of two rounds, the second being administered to the top scorers in the first round. The top-scoring students on the second round qualify for the International Linguistics Olympiad (ILO), one of the international science olympiads.

==History==

Since the mid-1960s, problem-solving competitions in linguistics for secondary school students have been taking place at various locations around the world. In Russia, the Moscow and St Petersburg Linguistic Olympiads are credited with inspiring hundreds of young talented scholars to choose linguistics as an academic major and profession. Presently there are national contests in Europe, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa, as well as North America. NACLO is part of a consortium that shares resources with other English-speaking contests such as the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad, OzCLO (Australia) and the All-Ireland Linguistics Olympiad. There is also an International Linguistic Olympiad in which students from many countries compete, as well as dozens of local competitions held in individual towns and schools across Europe and the USA.
In 1998 the first US Linguistics Olympiad was held at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, in 1998. 18 students participated the first year, 88 participated the second year, and 67 participated the third year of this local pilot program. From 2001 to 2006, the program existed as an informal, web-based educational activity known as the Linguistics Challenge.
The two US teams in each year won several awards at the ILO in 2007 and 2008. Each year, one of the two US teams won a gold medal (or first diploma) in the team contest. In addition, several team members won individual medals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ilolympiad.spb.ru/results.html |title=The Fifth International Linguistics Olympiad: Results |accessdate=18 November 2008 |date=August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://iol6.linguistics-bg.com/results.php |title=6th International Olympiad in Linguistics |accessdate=18 November 2008 |date=August 2008[/tpl]

==Format==

The format of the contest changed significantly between 2007 and 2008. The 2007 contest consisted of eight problems given in a single round open to all participants. The 2008 competition consisted of two rounds. The first round was open to all contestants and consisted of a three-hour, five-problem written examination. The top scorers on the open round advanced to the invitational round, which was a five-hour, seven-problem written examination divided into two parts; the first part lasted 3 and a half hours and contained five problems, while the second part lasted one and a half hour and contained two problems.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eugene/Naclo/rules.html |title=NACLO Rules (2008) |accessdate=18 November 2008 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University[/tpl] The top eight scorers from the invitational round were selected to participate in the ILO. The booklets with problems and solutions are available on the main NACLO website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/practice.php |title=NACLO 2009â€”Practice Problems |accessdate=18 November 2008 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |date=October 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
