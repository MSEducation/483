Zakrzewo ([tpl]IPAc-pl|z|a|'|k|sz|e|w|o[/tpl], 1936-45 [tpl]lang-de|Buschdorf[/tpl]) is a village in Złotów County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Zakrzewo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/broker/access/prefile/listPreFiles.jspa |title=Central Statistical Office (GUS) - TERYT (National Register of Territorial Land Apportionment Journal) |date=2008-06-01|language=Polish[/tpl] It lies approximately [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0[/tpl] north-east of Złotów and [tpl]convert|114|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the regional capital Poznań. The village has a population of 1,620.
Before 1945 the area was part of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia Germany, although Zakrzewo had a very strong and active Polish minority, headed by the parson of a local parish, Bolesław Domański. In 1935 the Nazi government changed the village's name to Buschdorf as part of a drive to Germanize Slavic-sounding placenames. For more on the history of the multi-ethnic historical area, see Złotów County.
A Blues Express festival is organized in Zakrzewo every July by the local culture centre.
