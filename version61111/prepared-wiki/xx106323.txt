Polemonium boreale (Boreal Jacobs-ladder) is a plant native to the most of the high arctic. In Greenland it is found only in a small area on the east coast. It is not very common.
The whole plant is pubescent, with long woolly hairs, glandular, and grows to 5–10 cm tall. The basal leaves are more or less alternate, and pinnate, with numerous leaflets. The flowers are produced in a more or less capitate inflorescence, each flower bell-shaped, blue, 15 mm long, 2.5 times longer than the calyx. The plant has a very unpleasant smell, and grows on gravelly slopes and in crevices.
