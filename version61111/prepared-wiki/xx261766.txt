Miranda Guinness, Countess of Iveagh (née Miranda Daphne Jane Smiley; August 1939 – 30 December 2010), was the daughter of Major Michael Smiley, of Castle Fraser, Kemnay, Aberdeenshire.

==Marriage and issue==

On 12 March, 1963, she married, Benjamin Guinness,Viscount Elveden (who, in September 1967, became the 3rd Earl of Iveagh), but they divorced in 1984. "Miranda Smiley was the most bewitching debutante of her season; gorgeous and glowing with life and humour, she was popular with the girls of her year as much as with men, and, in 1963, made the match she seemed destined for when she married Benjamin Guinness, 3rd Earl of Iveagh. Together, they were London's most dazzling golden couple, while in Ireland, still a social backwater, their glamour was practically divine."

Lord Iveagh was the heir to the Guinness fortune and he served as chairman of the company from 1965 to 1995. In 1976, he had a beer tanker, purpose-built to carry Guinness from the Dublin docks to England, named “The Miranda Guinness”, in her honour. In 1979, she was chosen as one of the world's best-dressed women.
They had four children: 
Arthur, the 4th Earl of Iveagh, The Hon. Rory, Lady Emma and Lady Louisa

==Tony Ryan==

Tony Ryan, the founder of Ryanair, was Miranda's lover for a period of six years.  "As a tutor and mentor, Miranda was perfect -- cultivated, instinctive and, above all, tactful. She guided him true, shaping his natural good taste into a kind of killer focus, geared towards architecturally important buildings, "serious" art (he favoured 16th- and 17th-Century Old Masters), and fine wines (he had a share in the Chateau Lascombes vineyard in Bordeaux). Along the way, they had fun together, hosting and attending parties for the kind of people Ryan wouldn't have had access to without her -- wealth alone is never sufficient passport to the world of intellectuals and aristocrats."

==Later years==

She celebrated her 70th birthday in August 2010 at a large party attended by many members of the family.
