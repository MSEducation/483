King's X toured considerably in promotion of their second album. The band's second London, England performance at the Astoria was filmed via camcorder.

Despite this, Pinnick described the show as "real encouraging."MFA Interview with Dug Pinnick of King's X MammasFallenAngels.com (December 16, 2009). Retrieved on 1-15-11.
In keeping with current concert trends, in late 2009, the band expressed interest in performing Gretchen Goes to Nebraska in its entirety on tour. Pinnick elaborated, "We like the idea of doing the whole of that record with a great light show, as part of something we’d call An Evening With King’s X. It wouldn’t be a full-blown tour, playing every hell-hole for three months. But we’d select specific, quality venues, make it special for the fans."King's X Taking Gretchen Back to Nebraska WeWillRockYouBlog.com (November 25, 2009). Retrieved on 1-15-11.
