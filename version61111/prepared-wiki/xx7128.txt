</ref> One such example can be seen in the ''In Search of...'' episode "The Man Who Would Not Die" (About [[Count of St. Germain]]), where it is stated "Evidence recently discovered in the British Museum indicates that St. Germain may have well been the long lost third son of [[Rákóczi]] born in Transylvania in 1694. If he died in Germany in 1784, he lived 90 years. The average life expectancy in the 18th century was 35 years. Fifty was a ripe old age. ''Ninety''... was forever."
This ignores the fact that the life expectancy generally quoted is the at birth number, which is an average that includes all the babies that die before their first year of life as well as people that die from disease and war. The genetics of humans and rate of aging were no different in pre-industrial societies than today, but people frequently died young because of untreatable diseases, accidents, and malnutrition. Many women did not survive childbirth, and individuals who reached old age were likely to succumb quickly to health problems.
It can be argued that it is better to compare life expectancies of the period after childhood to get a better handle on life span.[ref]
</ref> Life expectancy can change dramatically after childhood, as is demonstrated by the [http://www.richardcarrier.info/lifetbl.html Roman Life Expectancy table] where ''at birth'' the life expectancy was 25 but at the age of 5 it jumped to 48. Studies like [http://web.archive.org/web/20070713083310/http://www.plimoth.org/discover/myth/dead-at-40.php Plymouth Plantation; "Dead at Forty"] and [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html Life Expectancy by Age, 1850–2004] similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.
