==History==

Biblica was founded December 4, 1809, in New York City as the New York Bible Society by a small group of committed believers including such notables as Henry Rutgers, William Colgate and Theodorus Van Wyke.
Biblica experienced its first merger in 1819 when it merged with the New York Auxiliary Bible Society. Since then it has undergone the following changes:
The organization moved to Colorado Springs from New Jersey in 1988 and moved into its current facility in 1989.
Biblica’s international ministry began in 1810 with its sponsorship of William Carey’s Bible translation work in India. The worldwide work expanded in 1992 following the merger with Living Bibles International, through which Biblica developed its global translation ministry. The reach of Biblica around the world again expanded through its merger with Send the Light in 2007.
Biblica has provided more than 650 million Scripture pieces around the world in its 200-year history. In addition, Biblica’s Scripture online provides access to Bible texts in 26 languages to more than 85 million people per month.
