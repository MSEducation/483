[[La Salle Theater (Chicago)]]

CATEGORIES: Theatres in Chicago, Illinois

The La Salle Theater was an influential musical, vaudevillian, and dramatic playhouse in two Chicago locations, first at 137 East Madison Street, which, until December of 1902, had been named the Orpheon Music Hall.  The La Salle operated at that location until 1910.  Then it moved into a new facility at 110 West Madison, operating as playhouse until 1927, when film began to predominate.  The theater closed in the late 1940s.  In the Spring of 1950, the building was razed to make way for St. Peter's Church.

==Tenants & owners==

The original La Salle was owned by Anna Sinton Taft, wife the Charles Phelps Taft, who was the brother of U.S. President William Howard Taft.  The tenant, from about 1903 to about 1915, was Mort H. Singer, theater manager, and the La Salle Opera House Company, composed of Charles W. Murphy, owner of the Chicago Cubs, Harry Askin (1864–1934), and several other minor associates.
In June of 1917, Sinton sold the La Salle (from 118 to 116 West Madison) to S. W. Strauss & Co., headed by Albert L. Strauss (1871–1918). In 1927, La Salle began showing movies.  It closed in the late 1940s.  In the Spring of 1950, the building was razed to make way for St. Peter's Church. In 1913, The La Salle Theater was one of 36 Chicago theaters listed in the Chicago Daily News Almanac and Year-Book of 1914.
