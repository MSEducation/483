[[Afroinsectiphilia]]

The Afroinsectiphilia (African insectivores) is a clade that has been proposed based on the results of recent molecular studies.Asher, Robert J.; Bennet, Nigel and Lehmann, Thomas. "The new framework for understanding placental mammal evolution," BioEssays 31(8):853 Many of its constituent members  were once regarded as part of the order Insectivora, but Insectivora is now considered to be polyphyletic and is, as a result, possibly obsolete. This proposed classification is based on molecular studies only, and there is no morphological evidence for it.[tpl]cite book|title=The Rise of Placental Mammals: Origins and Relationships of the Major Extant Clades|first1=Kenneth David |last1=Rose|first2= J.

The golden moles and tenrecs are part of this clade. Some also regard the elephant shrews and aardvarks as part of it, although these two order are traditionally seen as primitive ungulates. The sister group of the Afroinsectiphilia is the Paenungulata, which were also traditionally regarded as ungulates.
If the clade of Afrotheria is genuine, then the Afroinsectiphilia are the closest relatives of the Pseudungulata (here regarded as part of Afroinsectiphilia) and the Paenungulata. In a classification governed by morphological data, both the Pseudungulata and Paenungulata are seen as true ungulates, thus not related to Afroinsectiphilia. However, DNA research is thought to provide a more fundamental classification.
