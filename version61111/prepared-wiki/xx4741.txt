[[Foreign relations of Italy]]

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of Italy

Foreign relations of the Italian Republic are the Italian government's external relations with the outside world. Located in Southern Europe, Italy, since its unification in 1861, has been considered a major European country. Italy is a founding member of the European Union and NATO. Its main allies are France, Greece, the United States, the other NATO countries, and the European Union. Italy also maintains strong relations with Russia and the Northern African countries, especially with its ex-colony Libya, until Italy's intervention in the military intervention against the country in 2011.
As a founding member of both the European Coal and Steel Community (the European Union's predecessor), and the Union for the Mediterranean, Italy is a historic key player in the Mediterranean region, where it is a Regional Power.

==Risorgimento (Unification)==

The Risorgimento was the era 1830–1870 that saw the emergence of a national consciousness. With French help Italians achieved independence from Austria and from the Pope, and secured national unification.Martin Collier, Italian Unification 1820-71 (2003)Taylor, Struggle for Mastery pp 99-125
The papacy secured French backing to resist unification. Pope Pius IX, fearing that giving up control of the Papal States would weaken the Church and allow the liberals to dominate conservative Catholics.[tpl]cite book|title=Pio Nono: A Study in European Politics and Religion in the Nineteenth Century|author=E.E.Y.

===1871-1922===

Italian foreign policy from the late nineteenth century to 1914, was tied in with the Triple Alliance with Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Italy was especially interested in acquiring colonies in North Africa, and it finally took control of Libya.  It also had an interest in East Africa, and made some acquisitions, but was badly defeated when it tried to invade  Abyssinia  (Ethiopia) in the 1890s.  It successfully conquered Ethiopia in the 1930s, in the face of international disapproval.  When the first world war broke out in 1914, Italy rejected its alliance with Germany, remain neutral for year, and then obtained secret treaties from the Allies that brought it into the war on their side.  Italian military performance in the First World War was humiliating, but Italy demanded its treaty rights in acquisitions from the Austro-Hungarian empire after the war.Denis Mack Smith, Modern Italy: A Political History (1997)  

===Colonialism===

Leaders of the new nation of Italy were enthusiastic about acquiring colonies in Africa, expecting it would legitimize their status as a power and help unify the people. In North Africa Italy first turned to Tunis, under nominal Ottoman control, where many Italian farmers had settled. Weak and diplomatically isolated, Italy was helpless and angered when France assumed a protectorate over Tunis in 1881.  
Italy developed its own colonial Empire. Italian colonies were Somalia and Eritrea; an attempt to occupy Ethiopia failed in the First Italo–Ethiopian War of 1895–1896. Italy was massively defeated at the Battle of Adwa in 1896.  Public opinion was angered at the national humiliation by an inept government. In 1911 the Italian people supported the seizure of what is now Libya.Giuseppe Maria Finaldi, Italian National Identity in the Scramble for Africa: Italy's African Wars in the Era of Nation-Building, 1870-1900 (2010)
Italian diplomacy succeeded in getting permission to seize Libya, with approval coming from Germany, France, Austria, Briatain and Russia.  A centerpiece of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, came when Italian forces took control of a few coastal cities against stiff resistance by Ottoman troops as well as the local tribesmen.  After the peace treaty gave Italy control it sent in Italian settlers, but suffered extensive casualties in its brutal campaign against the tribes.  In 1911, Giovanni Giolitti's government sent forces to occupy Libya and declared war on the Ottoman Empire which held Libya. Italy soon conquered and annexed Tripoli and the Dodecanese Islands. Nationalists advocated Italy's domination of the Mediterranean Sea by occupying Greece as well as the Adriatic coastal region of Dalmatia.Richard Bosworth, Italy: The Least of the Great Powers: Italian Foreign Policy Before the First World War (1979) William C.

===Fascism and war: 1922-45===

Benito Mussolini tried to develop an independent foreign-policy in the 1930s, but he alienated Britain and France with his invasion of Ethiopia, and became an informal partner of Nazi Germany with his support of the anti-Communist position in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.  Italy's joining the Axis partnership with Germany and Japan did not require it to go to war, but as France collapsed in 1940 it entered the Second World War and gained a slice of French territory.  Its wartime performance in the Balkans was poor, and required assistance from Germany.  Its performance against the British in North Africa was dismal, and despite large-scale German help, its army was forced to surrender in 1943.  Italy was too poorly organized, and militarily too weak to play a major role in the Second World War, and when the British, the Americans, and their Allies invaded Sicily and southern Italy in 1943.  Mussolini's failures became obvious and he was overthrown.  Germany, however, seized the peninsula, rescued Mussolini from prison, and set him up in a puppet regime that fought alongside the Germans against the Allies.Stephen Corrado Azzi, "The Historiography of Fascist Foreign Policy," Historical Journal (1993) 36#1  pp. 187-203 in JSTOR

===Postwar===

As the war ended, the Italian economy was in ruins but it was treated as a partner of the Allies. Italy received major financial assistance from the United States through the Marshall Plan (1948-51).  The US also provided financial and political support that kept the large communist element at bay in Italian politics.  Italy promoted European unity, joined NATO, and became an active member of the European Union.Sara Lorenzini, "The roots of a 'statesman': De Gasperi's foreign policy," Modern Italy (2009) 14#4 pp 473-484. 
In the 21st century, its economic performance has been sluggish, and the main foreign-policy issue concerns the large scale arrival of illegal immigrants from Africa and the Middle East.Elisabetta  Brighi, "Europe, the USA and the 'policy of the pendulum': the importance of foreign policy paradigms in the foreign policy of Italy (1989-2005)," Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans (2007) 9#2 pp 99-115
