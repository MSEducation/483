[[Regnitz]]

CATEGORIES: Main (river) basin, Rivers of Bavaria, Federal waterways in Germany

The Regnitz is a river in Bavaria, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is [tpl]Convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.
The river is formed by the confluence of the rivers Rednitz and Pegnitz, which meet in the city of Fürth. From there the Regnitz runs northwards through the cities of Erlangen and Forchheim. It finally meets the Main near the city of Bamberg.
Small portions of the Regnitz near Bamberg are incorporated into a canal connecting the Main with the Danube: the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, which runs parallel most of the way from Bamberg to Fürth.
