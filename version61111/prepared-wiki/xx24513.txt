Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter for Microsoft Corporation, with hand-hinting done by Thomas Rickner, then at Monotype. Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft's typography group. The name "Verdana" is based on verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dmxzone.com/go?6669 |title=Interview with Virginia Howlett, mother of Verdana |publisher=Dmxzone.com |date=2004-06-24 |accessdate=2013-09-21[/tpl]

==Distinctive visual identifiable characteristics==

Characteristics of the typeface are:

==Description==

Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger, Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on a computer screen.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm | title=Georgia & Verdana - Typefaces designed for the screen (finally) | year=2003 | accessdate=9 August 2013 | author=Will-Harris, Daniel[/tpl] The lack of serifs, large x-height, wide proportions, loose letter-spacing, large counters, and emphasized distinctions between similarly-shaped characters are chosen to increase legibility.
As an example of the attention given to making similar characters easily distinguishable, the digit 1 (one) in Verdana was given a horizontal base and a hook in the upper left to distinguish it from lowercase l (L) and uppercase I (i). This is similar to the digit 1 found in Morris Fuller Benton's sans-serif typefaces News Gothic and Franklin Gothic.

==Prevalence==

Released in 1996, Verdana was bundled with subsequent versions of the Windows operating system, as well as their Office and Internet Explorer software on both Windows and Mac OS. Since at least Mac OS X 10.4 it is even bundled with the operating system itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1538 |title=Apple.com - Mac OS X 10.4: Fonts list |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2013-09-21[/tpl] In addition, up until 2002[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,469394,00.asp | title=Microsoft Withdraws Free Web Fonts |author=Mark Hachman |publisher=ExtremeTech |date=2002-08-14 |accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq8.htm | title = TrueType core fonts for the Web FAQ |author=Microsoft |date=2002-07-25 |accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] it was available for download from Microsoft's web site as freeware (".exe" files for Microsoft Windows and in ".sit.hqx" archives for Mac OS X) under a proprietary license imposing some restrictions on usage and distribution, allowing it to be used by end users in any system supporting installation of "exe" or ".sit.hqx" files and supporting TrueType fonts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/eula.htm |title = TrueType core fonts for the Web EULA | author=Microsoft |date=2001-12-28 |accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl] The downloadable files are still available legally from third-party web sites; see the External links section.

==Combining characters bug==

In the past Verdana (v. 2.43) had an incorrect position for combining diacritical marks, causing them to display on the following character instead of the preceding. This made it unsuitable for Unicode-encoded text such as Cyrillic or Greek. This bug didn't usually reveal itself with Latin letters. This is because some font display engines substitute sequences of base character + combining character with a precomposed character glyph.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2004/week13/index.html |title=Underdots |publisher=Tenser.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21[/tpl] This bug was subsequently fixed in the version issued with Windows Vista. It is also fixed in Verdana version 5.01 font on Windows XP by installing the European Union Expansion Font Update from Microsoft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&DisplayLang=en|title=European Union Expansion Font Update|accessdate=2011-02-02[/tpl]

==Other design flaws==

The design of the english left quote “ in Verdana is unsuitable for its use as german right quote: It should be shaped like a "66", or in any case like a 180° rotated „. This quirk was fixed in Verdana Pro, but not any variant of the normal Verdana.

==Awards==

The typeface was nominated for the Best Of British Design Award on BBC Two's The Culture Show on January 26, 2006.

==Usage==

In 2008, during their merger with Northwest Airlines and resulting rebranding effort, Delta Airlines changed their official logo typeface from Times New Roman to Verdana.
IKEA caused furor in the graphic design world in 2009 when it changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography."Verdanagate," by "Armin" in "Brand New" blog, August 31, 2009 Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and designers.The Font War: Ikea Fans Fume over Verdana.
