[[Solar variation]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic phenomena, Solar phenomena, Climate forcing agents

Solar variation is the change in the amount of radiation emitted by the Sun (see Solar radiation) and in its spectral distribution over years to millennia. These variations have periodic components, the main one being the approximately 11-year solar cycle (or sunspot cycle). The changes also have aperiodic fluctuations.Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) total solar irradiance monitoring 1978 to present  (Satellite observations of total solar irradiance); access date 2012-02-03  In recent decades, solar activity has been measured by satellites, while before it was estimated using 'proxy' variables. Scientists studying climate change are interested in understanding the effects of variations in the total and spectral solar irradiance on Earth and its climate.
Variations in total solar irradiance were too small to detect with technology available before the satellite era, although the small fraction in ultra-violet light has recently been found to vary significantly more than previously thought over the course of a solar cycle.[tpl]cite journal | title=Solar forcing of winter climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere | journal=Nature Geoscience |date=9 October 2011 |author=Ineson S., Scaife A.A., Knight J.R., Manners J.C., Dunstone N.J., Gray L.J., Haigh J.D. |volume=4 |pages=753–7 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1282 |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n11/full/ngeo1282.html | issue=11 | bibcode=2011NatGe...4..753I[/tpl] Total solar output is now measured to vary (over the last three 11-year sunspot cycles) by approximately 0.1%,[tpl]cite journal |last=Willson |first=Richard C.|coauthors=H.S.

==History of study into solar variations==

The longest recorded aspect of solar variations are changes in sunspots. The first record of sunspots dates to around 800 BC in China and the oldest surviving drawing of a sunspot dates to 1128. In 1610, astronomers began using the telescope to make observations of sunspots and their motions. Initial study was focused on their nature and behavior.[tpl]cite web | title=Great Moments in the History of Solar Physics 1| work =Great Moments in the History of Solar Physics | url=http://web.hao.ucar.edu/public/education/sp/great_moments.html| accessdate = 2006-03-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060301083022/http://web.hao.ucar.edu/public/education/sp/great_moments.html |archivedate = 1 March 2006[/tpl]  Although the physical aspects of sunspots were not identified until the 20th century, observations continued. Study was hampered during the 17th century due to the low number of sunspots during what is now recognized as an extended period of low solar activity, known as the Maunder Minimum. By the 19th century, there was a long enough record of sunspot numbers to infer periodic cycles in sunspot activity. In 1845, Princeton University professors Joseph Henry and Stephen Alexander observed the Sun with a thermopile and determined that sunspots emitted less radiation than surrounding areas of the Sun. The emission of higher than average amounts of radiation later were observed from the solar faculae.[tpl]cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |journal=Proc.

Around 1900, researchers began to explore connections between solar variations and weather on Earth. Of particular note is the work of Charles Greeley Abbot. Abbot was assigned by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) to detect changes in the radiation of the Sun. His team had to begin by inventing instruments to measure solar radiation. Later, when Abbot was head of the SAO, it established a solar station at Calama, Chile to complement its data from Mount Wilson Observatory. He detected 27 harmonic periods within the 273-month Hale cycles, including 7, 13, and 39-month patterns. He looked for connections to weather by means such as matching opposing solar trends during a month to opposing temperature and precipitation trends in cities. With the advent of dendrochronology, scientists such as Waldo S. Glock attempted to connect variation in tree growth to periodic solar variations in the extant record and infer long-term secular variability in the solar constant from similar variations in millennial-scale chronologies.[tpl]cite book |author=Fritts, Harold C. |title=Tree rings and climate |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-12-268450-8 [/tpl]
Statistical studies that correlate weather and climate with solar activity have been popular for centuries, dating back at least to 1801, when William Herschel noted an apparent connection between wheat prices and sunspot records.[ref]
