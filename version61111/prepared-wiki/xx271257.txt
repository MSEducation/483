The 1981 Handsworth riots were three days of rioting that took place in the Handsworth area of Birmingham, England in July 1981.[tpl]cite book|last=Waddington|first=David P.|title=Contemporary issues in public disorder: a comparative and historical approach|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=61XZdjCj9PMC&pg=PA90|accessdate=24 September 2011|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-07913-6|pages=90–91[/tpl] The major outbreak of violence took place on the night of Friday 10/11 July, with smaller disturbances on the following two nights.[tpl]cite book|last=Southgate|first=Peter|editor=Field, Simon; Southgate, Peter|title=Public disorder: a review of research and a study in one inner city area|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ls_wAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 August 2011|series=Home Office Research Studies|year=1982|publisher=H.M.S.O.|location=London|isbn=0-11-340767-X|page=42|chapter= "Abstract: Disturbances of July 1981 in Handsworth, Birmingham - A Survey of the Views and Experiences of Male Residents[/tpl]
The riots were characterised by the Scarman report into the 1981 riots in England as "copycat riots" – taking place after the Brixton riots in London, and around the same time as the Toxteth riots in Liverpool and the Moss Side riots in Manchester – though some have argued that this is an oversimplification. The immediate flashpoint was an attack on a locally well-known Police Superintendent who was trying to calm rumours of an impending march by the right-wing National Front. The following disturbances resulted in 121 arrests and 40 injuries to police officers, alongside widespread damage to property.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=84135|title=Abstract: Disturbances of July 1981 in Handsworth, Birmingham - A Survey of the Views and Experiences of Male Residents (From Public Disorder, P 41-73, 1982, by Simon Field and Peter Southgate)|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=National Criminal Justice Reference Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice[/tpl]
Before the riots Handsworth had been considered to be a good example of successful community policing, though local Black British youths later disputed the claim that relations between them and the police had been amicable: around 40% of them had been stopped and searched over the previous 12 months. Handsworth had a mixed population of white, black and Asian residents, but surveys after the riots showed little evidence of significant racial tension. A week before the riots, during the weekend that saw CS gas used against rioters for the first time on the British Mainland in Toxteth, Liverpool, a reporter from The Times had visited a festival in Handsworth Park and found "8,000 people, black and white" in "a spirit as amiable and peaceful as a rural village fete".[tpl]cite news|first=Arthur|last=Osman|author2=Timmins, Nicholas|author3= Tendler, Stewart. |title=3am: Residents begin Toxteth evacuation Police use CS gas after admitting riot is out of control|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|page=1|date=6 July 1981|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] The most common reasons for the riots reported by participants were unemployment, boredom and the imitation of events elsewhere.
