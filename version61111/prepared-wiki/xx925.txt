The newly created South Sudan is among the 111 UN member states that supported the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. South Sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its Constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46452 |title=South Sudan says death penalty remains until constitution amended - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]
Among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils and bar associations formed a World Coalition Against the Death Penalty in 2002.

==Religious views==

The world's major religions have mixed opinions on the death penalty, depending on the sect, the individual believer, and the time period.

===Buddhism===

There is disagreement among Buddhists as to whether or not Buddhism forbids the death penalty. The first of the Five Precepts (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the Dhammapada states:
 "Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore you do not kill or cause to be killed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.14.irel.html|title=Dhammika Sutta: Dhammika|publisher=Accesstoinsight.org|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl] 
Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, "Him I call a brahmin who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill." These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this matter. Historically, most states where the official religion is Buddhism have imposed capital punishment for some offenses. One notable exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the Emperor Saga of Japan in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions continued to be conducted as a form of retaliation. Japan still imposes the death penalty, although some recent justice ministers have refused to sign death warrants, citing their Buddhist beliefs as their reason.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7694483.stm|title=Japan hangs two more on death row (see also paragraph 11)|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] Other Buddhist-majority states vary in their policy. For example, Bhutan has abolished the death penalty, but Thailand still retains it, although Buddhism is the official religion in both. Mongolia abolished the death penalty in 2012.
Many stories in Buddhist scripture stress the superior power of the Buddha's teaching to rehabilitate murderers and other criminals. The most well-known example is Angulimala in the Theravadan Pali canon who had killed 999 people and then attempted to kill his own mother and the Buddha, but under the influence of the Buddha he repented and entered the monkhood. The Buddha succeeded when the King and all his soldiers failed to eliminate the murderer by force.[tpl]cite web|title=Thai Buddhist perspective on the death penalty|url=http://deathpenaltythailand.blogspot.com/2008/07/thai-buddhist-perspective-on-death.html|work=Seminar of Monks at Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University, Chiangmai|publisher=Death Penalty Thailand[/tpl]
Without one official teaching on the death penalty, Thai monks are typically divided on the issue with some favoring abolition of the death penalty while others see it as bad karma stemming from bad actions in the past.

In the edicts of the great Buddhist king Ashoka (ca. 304–232 BC) inscribed on great pillars around his kingdom, the King showed reverence for all life by giving up the slaughtering of animals and many of his subjects followed his example. King Ashoka also extended the period before execution of those condemned to death so they could make a final appeal for their lives.
A close reading of texts in the Pali canon reveals different attitudes towards violence and capital punishment. The Pali scholar Steven Collins finds Dhamma in the Pali canon divided into two categories according to the attitude taken towards violence. In Mode 1 Dhamma the use of violence is "context-dependent and negotiable". A King should not pass judgement in haste or anger but the punishment should fit the crime, with warfare and capital punishment acceptable in certain situations. In Mode 2 Dhamma the use of violence is "context-independent and non-negotiable" and the only advice to kings is to abdicate, renounce the world and leave everything to the law of karma. Buddhism is incompatible with any form of violence especially warfare and capital punishment.

In the world that humans inhabit there is a continual tension between these two modes of Dhamma. This tension is best exhibited in the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta (Digha Nikaya 26 of the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon), the story of humanity's decline from a golden age in the past. A critical turning point comes when the King decides not to give money to a man who has committed theft but instead to cut off his head and also to carry out this punishment in a particularly cruel and humiliating manner, parading him in public to the sound of drums as he is taken to the execution ground outside the city. In the wake of this decision by the king, thieves take to imitating the King's actions and murder the people from whom they steal to avoid detection. Thieves turn to highway robbery and attacking small villages and towns far away from the royal capital where they won't be detected. A downwards spiral towards social disorder and chaos has begun.

===Christianity===

Views on the death penalty in Christianity run a spectrum of opinions, from complete condemnation of the punishment, seeing it as a form of revenge and as contrary to Christ's message of forgiveness, to enthusiastic support based primarily on Old Testament law.
Among the teachings of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew, the message to his followers that one should "Turn the other cheek" and his example in the story Pericope Adulterae, in which Jesus intervenes in the stoning of an adulteress, are generally accepted as his condemnation of physical retaliation (though most scholars[tpl]cite web|title=NETBible: John 7|publisher=Bible.org|url=http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Joh&chapter=7#n139|accessdate =2009-10-17[/tpl] See note 139 on that page.[tpl]cite journal|last=Keith|first=Chris|title=Recent and Previous Research on the Pericope Adulterae (John 7.53—8.11)|journal=Currents in Biblical Research|volume=6|issue=3|pages=377–404|year=2008|doi=10.1177/1476993X07084793|ref=harv[/tpl] agree that the latter passage was "certainly not part of the original text of St John's Gospel"'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005).) More militant Christians consider Romans 13:3–4 to support the death penalty. Many Christians have believed that Jesus' doctrine of peace speaks only to personal ethics and is distinct from civil government's duty to punish crime.
In the Old Testament, Leviticus [tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|20:2–27[/tpl] provides a list of transgressions in which execution is recommended. Christian positions on these passages vary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/exe_bibl2.htm|title=What The Christian Scriptures Say About The Death Penalty – Capital Punishment|publisher=Religioustolerance.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] The sixth commandment (fifth in the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches) is translated as "Thou shalt not kill" by some denominations and as "Thou shalt not murder" by others. As some denominations do not have a hard-line stance on the subject, Christians of such denominations are free to make a personal decision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/capitalpunishment_1.shtml|title=BBC – Religion & Ethics – Capital punishment: Introduction|publisher=BBC|date=3 August 2009|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]
Eastern Orthodox Christianity does not officially condemn or endorse capital punishment. It states that it is not a totally objectionable thing, but also that its abolishment can be driven by genuine Christian values, especially stressing the need for mercy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mospat.ru/en/documents/social-concepts/ix/|title=The Basis of the Social Concept, IX. 3|publisher=Mospat.ru|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl]
The Rosicrucian Fellowship and many other Christian esoteric schools condemn capital punishment in all circumstances.Heindel, Max (1910s), The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answers – Volume II: Question no.33: Rosicrucian Viewpoint of Capital Punishment, ISBN 0-911274-90-1The Rosicrucian Fellowship: Obsession, Occult Effects of Capital Punishment

====Roman Catholic Church====

St. Thomas Aquinas, a Doctor of the Church, accepted the death penalty as a deterrent and prevention method but not as a means of vengeance. (See Aquinas on the death penalty.) The Roman Catechism stated this teaching thus:
 Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tcomm05.htm|title=THE CATECHISM OF TRENT: The Fifth Commandment|publisher=Cin.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] 
In Evangelium Vitae, Pope John Paul II suggested that capital punishment should be avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in question, opining that punishment "ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent."Papal encyclical, Evangelium Vitae, 25 March 1995 The most recent edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church restates this view.Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. That the assessment of the contemporary situation advanced by John Paul II is not binding on the faithful was confirmed by Cardinal Ratzinger when he wrote in 2004 that,
 if a Catholic were to be at odds with the Holy Father on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/04-07ratzingerommunion.htm|title=Abortion – Pro Life – Cardinal Ratzinger on Voting, Abortion, and Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion|publisher=Priestsforlife.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] 
The 1911 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia suggested that Catholics must hold that "the infliction of capital punishment is not contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and the power of the State to visit upon culprits the penalty of death derives much authority from revelation and from the writings of theologians", but that the matter of "the advisability of exercising that power is, of course, an affair to be determined upon other and various considerations."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Capital Punishment (Death Penalty)|publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1 June 1911|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl]

====Protestants====

The Religious Society of Friends or Quaker Church is one of the earliest American opponents of capital punishment and unequivocally opposes execution in all its forms.
Southern Baptists support the fair and equitable use of capital punishment for those guilty of murder or treasonous acts, so long as it does not constitute as an act of personal revenge or discrimination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299|title=SBC Resolution: On Capital Punishment|accessdate=2010-10-26|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention[/tpl]
The Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops condemned the death penalty in 1988:
[tpl]Quote|This Conference: ... 3. Urges the Church to speak out against: ... (b) all governments who practise capital punishment, and encourages them to find alternative ways of sentencing offenders so that the divine dignity of every human being is respected and yet justice is pursued;....[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-33.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops, 1988, Resolution 33, paragraph 3. (b)|publisher=Lambethconference.org|accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl][/tpl]
The United Methodist Church, along with other Methodist churches, also condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior_print.asp?ptid=4&mid=1070|title=The United Methodist Church: Capital Punishment|publisher=Archives.umc.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalised persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2211|title=The United Methodist Church: Official church statements on capital punishment|publisher=Archives.umc.org|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl] The General Conference of the United Methodist Church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.
In a 1991 social policy statement, the ELCA officially took a stand to oppose the death penalty. It states that revenge is a primary motivation for capital punishment policy and that true healing can only take place through repentance and forgiveness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/socialstatements/deathpenalty/|title=ELCA Social Statement on the Death Penalty|publisher=Elca.org|date=4 September 1991|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl]
Community of Christ, the former Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), is opposed to capital punishment. The first stand against capital punishment was taken by the church's Presiding High Council in 1995. This was followed by a resolution of the World Conference in 2000. This resolution, WC 1273, states: [tpl]Quote|We stand in opposition to the use of the death penalty; and ... as a peace church we seek ways to achieve healing and restorative justice. Church members are encouraged to work for the abolition of the death penalty in those states and nations that still practise this form of punishment.[tpl]cite web|author=Communication Services of Community of Christ, Independence Mo. |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/statements/cptlpunish.asp |title=RLDS World Conference, Resolution 1273, Adopted April 8, 2000, entitled "Healing Ministry and Capital Punishment" |publisher=Cofchrist.org |date=2000-04-08 |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl][/tpl]
Several key leaders early in the Protestant Reformation, including Martin Luther and John Calvin, followed the traditional reasoning in favour of capital punishment, and the Lutheran Church's Augsburg Confession explicitly defended it. Some Protestant groups have cited Genesis 9:5–6, Romans 13:3–4, and
Leviticus 20:1–27 as the basis for permitting the death penalty.[tpl]Wayback |date=20060915114705 |url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm [/tpl][tpl]Wayback |date=20061214111249 |url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1304.htm [/tpl]
Mennonites, Church of the Brethren and Friends have opposed the death penalty since their founding, and continue to be strongly opposed to it today. These groups, along with other Christians opposed to capital punishment, have cited Christ's Sermon on the Mount (transcribed in Matthew Chapter 5–7) and Sermon on the Plain (transcribed in Luke 6:17–49). In both sermons, Christ tells his followers to turn the other cheek and to love their enemies, which these groups believe mandates nonviolence, including opposition to the death penalty.

====Mormonism====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also called Mormons) neither promotes nor opposes capital punishment, although the church's founder, Joseph Smith, Jr., supported it.[tpl]Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|p=435[/tpl] However, today the church officially states that it is a "matter to be decided solely by the prescribed processes of civil law."[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/public-issues/capital-punishment|title=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Public Issues|publisher=Newsroom.lds.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl]

===Hinduism===

A basis can be found in Hindu teachings both for permitting and forbidding the death penalty. Hinduism preaches ahimsa (or ahinsa, non-violence), but also teaches that the soul cannot be killed and death is limited only to the physical body. The soul is reborn into another body upon death (until Moksha), akin to a human changing clothes. The religious, civil and criminal law of Hindus is encoded in the Dharmaśāstras and the Arthasastra. The Dharmasastras describe many crimes and their punishments and call for the death penalty in several instances, including murder and righteous warfare.http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol17-18/vol17-18_art16_SASSARMA.pdf

===Islam===

Some forms of Islamic law, as in Saudi Arabia, may require capital punishment, but there is great variation within Islamic nations as to actual capital punishment. Apostasy in Islam and stoning to death in Islam are controversial topics. Furthermore, as expressed in the Qur'an, capital punishment is condoned. Instead, murder is treated as a civil crime and is covered by the law of retaliation, whereby the relatives of the victim decide whether the offender is punished with death by the authorities or made to pay diyah as compensation.
Muslims frequently refer to the story of Cain and Abel when referring to killing someone. The Qur'an says the following:
This verse, in accordance with the Mosaic Law, maintains that the punishment for murder is the death penalty. "Mischief in the land" has been interpreted universally to refer to one who upsets the stability of the entire nation or community, in that his actions seriously damage the society, either through corruption, war or otherwise.

===Judaism===

The official teachings of Judaism approve the death penalty in principle but the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely stringent. In practice, it has been abolished by various Talmudic decisions, making the situations in which a death sentence could be passed effectively impossible and hypothetical. A capital case could not be tried by a normal Beit Din of three judges, it can only be adjudicated by a Sanhedrin of a minimum of 23 judges.Mishnah Sanhedrin 1:4; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 2a Forty years before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in approximately the year 70 CE,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/rabbis/zakkai.htm|title=Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai|accessdate=May/5/13[/tpl] i.e. in approximately 30 CE, the Sanhedrin effectively abolished capital punishment,Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 41a) making it a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment, fitting in finality for God alone to use, not fallible people.
The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar, Maimonides said:
Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice". Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.Moses Maimonides, The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290, at 269–271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).
The state of Israel retains the death penalty only for Nazis convicted of crimes against humanity.Given that nearly all surviving Nazi perpetrators of the Shoah are in their 80s or 90s, it seems unlikely that there will any more executions. The only execution in Israeli history occurred in 1961, when Adolf Eichmann, one of the principal organizers of the Holocaust, was put to death after his trial in Jerusalem.
