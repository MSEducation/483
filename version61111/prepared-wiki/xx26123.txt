[[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure for manually preserving brain function until further measures to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.
According to the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines, CPR involves chest compressions at least [tpl]convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on[/tpl] deep and at a rate of at least 100 per minute to pump blood through the heart and thus the body. The rescuer may provide breaths by either exhaling into the subject's mouth or nose or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs; externally providing ventilation is termed artificial respiration. Current recommendations place emphasis on high-quality chest compressions over artificial respiration; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers.
CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart. Its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart. The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage. Administration of an electric shock to the subject's heart, termed defibrillation, is usually needed in order to restore a viable or "perfusing" heart rhythm.  Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms, namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity. CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable. In general, CPR is continued until the patient has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or is declared dead.

==Medical uses==

CPR is indicated for any person unresponsive with no breathing or breathing only in occasional agonal gasps, as it is most likely that they are in cardiac arrest.[tpl]rp|S643[/tpl] If a person still has a pulse but is not breathing (respiratory arrest) artificial respirations may be more appropriate, but, due to the difficulty people have in accurately assessing the presence or absence of a pulse, CPR guidelines recommend that lay persons should not be instructed to check the pulse, while giving healthcare professionals the option to check a pulse.(), "[tpl]cite web |author=European Resuscitation Council |title=Part 2: Adult basic life support |year=2005 |work=Guidelines for resuscitation  |url=https://www.erc.edu/index.php/guidelines_download_2005/en/ |quote=The following is a summary of the evidence-based recommendations for the performance of basic life support: Rescuers begin CPR if the victim is unconscious, not moving, and not breathing (ignoring occasional gasps)....[/tpl] In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma CPR is considered futile in the pulseless case, but still recommended for correctable causes of arrest.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vanden Hoek|first=TL|coauthors=Morrison, LJ, Shuster, M, Donnino, M, Sinz, E, Lavonas, EJ, Jeejeebhoy, FM, Gabrielli, A|title=Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S829–61|pmid=20956228|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069[/tpl]

===Standard===

A universal compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf |title=Highlights of the 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for CPR and ECC |format=PDF |work=American Heart Association |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]rp|8[/tpl]  With children, if at least 2 trained rescuers are present a ratio of 15:2 is preferred.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] In newborns a rate of 3:1 is recommended unless a cardiac cause is known in which case a 15:2 ratio is reasonable.[tpl]rp|S647[/tpl] If an advanced airway such as an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is in place, artificial ventilation should occur without pauses in compressions at a rate of 8–10 per minute.[tpl]cite journal |author=Berg RA, Hemphill R, Abella BS, et al. |title=Part 5: adult basic life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S685–705 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20956221 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970939 |url=[/tpl] The recommended order of interventions is chest compressions, airway, breathing or CAB in most situations,[tpl]rp|S642[/tpl] with a compression rate of at least 100 per minute in all groups.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] Recommended compression depth in adults and children is at least 5 cm (2 inches) and in infants it is [tpl]Convert|4|cm|in[/tpl].[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] As of 2010 the Resuscitation Council (UK) still recommends ABC for children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/pals.pdf|title=Resuscitation Council UK Paediatric Advanced Life Support Guidelines|accessdate=2010-10-24|format=PDF[/tpl] As it can be difficult to determine the presence or absence of a pulse, the pulse check has been removed for lay providers and should not be performed for more than 10 seconds by healthcare providers.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] In adults, rescuers should use two hands for the chest compressions, while in children they should use one, and with infants two fingers (index and middle fingers).[tpl]cite book|author=Mohun, Janet et al.|title=First Aid Manual|publisher=St John Ambulance, St Andrews Ambulance and British Red Cross[/tpl]

===Compression only===

Compression-only (hands-only or cardiocerebral resuscitation) CPR is a technique that involves chest compressions without artificial respiration.[tpl]rp|S643[/tpl]  It is recommended as the method of choice for the untrained or non-proficient because it is easier to perform and instructions are easier to give over a phone.[tpl]rp|S643[/tpl][tpl]rp|8[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Hüpfl M, Selig HF, Nagele P |title=Chest-compression-only versus standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume= 376|issue= 9752|pages= 1552–7|date=October 2010 |pmid=20951422 |pmc=2987687 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61454-7 |url=[/tpl]  In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compression-only CPR by the lay public has a higher success rate than standard CPR.  The exceptions are cases of drownings, drug overdose and arrest in children.  Children who receive compression-only CPR have the same outcomes as those having received no CPR.[tpl]rp|S646[/tpl]  The method of delivering chest compressions remains the same, as does the rate (at least 100 per minute).  It is hoped that the use of compression-only delivery will increase the chances of the lay public delivering CPR.[tpl]cite journal|last= Ewy|first=Gordon A|date=June 2008|title=Cardiocerebral Resuscitation: Could this new model of CPR hold promise for better rates of neurologically intact survival?|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://emsresponder.com/print/Emergency--Medical-Services/CARDIOCEREBRAL-Resuscitation/1$7857 |journal=EMS Magazine|publisher=Cygnus|volume=37|issue=6|doi= |pages=41–49[/tpl]  As per the American Heart Association, the beat of the Bee Gees song "Stayin' Alive" provides an ideal rhythm in terms of beats per minute to use for hands-only CPR.[tpl]cite news|title= Save a Life: Hands-Only CPR |publisher=Crowdrise.com|accessdate=2011-06-16|url=http://www.crowdrise.com/handsonlycpr/fundraiser/americanheart |archiveurl = http://www.crowdrise.com/handsonlycpr/fundraiser/americanheart |archivedate = June 21, 2011[/tpl]  One can also hum Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust", which is exactly 100 beats-per-minute and contains a memorable repeating drum pattern.[tpl]cite news|title= From Queen, The Best Song For CPR — Except For The Lyrics |accessdate=2012-05-29|url=http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2010/12/cpr-song |archiveurl = http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2010/12/cpr-song |archivedate = May 29, 2012[/tpl]  For those with non cardiac arrest and people less than 20 years of age, standard CPR is superior to compression-only CPR.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ogawa T, Akahane M, Koike S, Tanabe S, Mizoguchi T, Imamura T |title=Outcomes of chest compression only CPR versus conventional CPR conducted by lay people in patients with out of hospital cardiopulmonary arrest witnessed by bystanders: nationwide population based observational study |journal=BMJ |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c7106 |year=2011 |pmid=21273279 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7106|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Koenig KL |title=Compression-Only CPR Is Less Effective Than Conventional CPR in Some Patients |journal=JW Emerg Med |date=March 4, 2011 |url=http://emergency-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2011/304/1?q=etoc_jwem |volume=2011 |issue=304 |page=1[/tpl]

===Prone CPR===

Simultaneous maintenance of blood circulation and ventilation can be obtained by compressing the back if the victim is in prone position, by turning the head to the side and compressing the back.  Due to the head's being turned, the risk of vomiting and complications caused by aspiration pneumonia is significantly reduced, and the method means the patient continues to get air into their lungs without the need for mouth-to-mouth respiration.[tpl]cite journal|first1=Jeng|last1=Wei|first2=David|last2=Tung|first3=Sung-How|last3=Sue|first4=Shing-Van|last4=Wu|first5=Yi-Cheng|last5=Chuang|first6=Chung-Yi|last6=Chang|title=Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prone position: a simplified method for outpatients|journal=Journal of the Chinese Medical Association|publisher=Elsevier|date=21 July 2005|publication-date=May 2006|pages=202–206|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1726-4901/PIIS1726490109702199.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70219-9|pmid=16835981|volume=69|issue=5[/tpl]

===Pregnancy===

During pregnancy when a woman is lying on her back, the uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and thus decrease venous return. The uterus therefore should be pushed to the woman's left and the woman rolled 30°, or healthcare professionals should consider emergency Caesarean section.

===Other===

Interposed abdominal compressions may help adults in the hospital environment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cave DM, Gazmuri RJ, Otto CW, et al. |title=Part 7: CPR techniques and devices: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S720–8 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20956223 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970970 |url= |pmc=3741663[/tpl] No evidence suggests benefit pre hospital or in children.
Internal cardiac massage is manual squeezing of the exposed heart itself carried out through a surgical incision into the chest cavity, usually when the chest is already open for cardiac surgery.

==Effectiveness==

CPR serves as the foundation of successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, preserving the body for defibrillation and advanced life support. Even in the case of a "non-shockable" rhythm, such as Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) where defibrillation is not indicated, effective CPR is no less important. Used alone, CPR will result in few complete recoveries, though the outcome without CPR is almost uniformly fatal.[tpl]cite web|last=Sarver Heart Center|url=http://heart.arizona.edu/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Chest-Compression-Only CPR|accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl]
Studies have shown that immediate CPR followed by defibrillation within 3–5 minutes of sudden VF cardiac arrest dramatically improves survival. In cities such as Seattle where CPR training is widespread and defibrillation by EMS personnel follows quickly, the survival rate is about 20 percent for all causes and as high as 57 percent if a witnessed "shockable" arrest.[tpl]cite web|last=Public Health - Seattle & King County|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/news/2013/13090401.aspx|title=Heart attack survival rate continues to climb in King County|accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] In cities such as New York, without those advantages, the survival rate is only 5 percent for witnessed shockable arrest.[tpl]cite web|last=Resuscitation Academy|url=http://www.resuscitationacademy.com/index.php/about/|title=About|accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl]
Compression-only CPR may be less effective in children than in adults, as cardiac arrest in children is more likely to have a non-cardiac cause. In a 2010 prospective study of cardiac arrest in children (age 1–17) for arrests with a non-cardiac cause, provision by bystanders of conventional CPR with rescue breathing yielded a favorable neurological outcome at one month more often than did compression-only CPR (OR 5.54; 95% confidence interval 2.52–16.99). For arrests with a cardiac cause in this cohort, there was no difference between the two techniques (OR 1.20; 95% confidence interval 0.55–2.66).[tpl]cite pmid|20202679[/tpl] This is consistent with American Heart Association guidelines for parents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=20 |title=Checklist for Parents of Children with Arrhythmias |accessdate=2010-04-11 |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=American Heart Association [/tpl]
More patients achieve a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereby their heart spontaneously restarts, than ultimately survive to be discharged from hospital (see table above) because of other comorbidities or medical staff's inability to address the cause of the cardiac arrest.  Ultimately, only 5–10% of patients in cardiac arrest will survive after an attempted resuscitation.[tpl]cite web|last=WebMD Medical News|url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/32/1728_79637.htm|title=Real CPR isn't everything it seems to be|accessdate=2007-06-13[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

CPR is used on people in cardiac arrest in order to oxygenate the blood and maintain a cardiac output that vital organs survive. Blood circulation and oxygenation transport oxygen to the tissues. The brain may sustain damage without blood for four minutes and irreversible damage after about seven minutes.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Nathalie, MSN, RN|title=Anoxic Brain Damage|publisher=Third Age|url=http://www.thirdage.com/encyclopedia/anoxic-brain-damage-anoxic-brain-injury-hypoxic-brain-injury[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Mount Sinai Medical Centre|title=Anoxic Brain Injury|url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/anoxic-brain-damage|last=Tuhrim|first=Stanley[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Brass|first=Lawrence, MD|title=Heart Book.

Therefore, in general CPR is effective only if performed within seven minutes of the stoppage of blood flow.Newsweek 2007-05-07 The heart also rapidly loses the ability to maintain a normal rhythm. Low body temperatures, as sometimes seen in near-drownings, prolong the time the brain survives. Following cardiac arrest, effective CPR enables enough oxygen to reach the brain to delay brain stem death, and allows the heart to remain responsive to defibrillation attempts.

==Complications==

While CPR is a last resort intervention, without which a patient without a pulse will all but certainly die, the physical nature of how CPR is performed does lead to complications that may need to be rectified.  Common CPR complications are rib fractures, sternal fractures, bleeding in the anterior mediastinum, heart contusion,Myocardial contusion injury: redefining the diagnostic algorithm, M K Bansal, S Maraj,  D Chewaproug, A Amanullah.

The type and frequency of injury can be affected by factors such as gender and age.

==Adjunct devices==

While several adjunctive devices are available, none other than defibrillation, as of 2010, have consistently been found to be better than standard CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.[tpl]rp|S644[/tpl] These devices can be split into three broad groups: timing devices' those that assist the rescuer to achieve the correct technique,especially depth and speed of compressions; and those that take over the process completely.

===Timing devices===

Timing devices can feature a metronome (an item carried by many ambulance crews) in order to assist the rescuer in achieving the correct rate.  Some units can also give timing reminders for performing compressions, ventilating and changing operators.[tpl]cite web|title=Silicon Chip Article|url=http://www.siliconchip.com.au/cms/A_108147/article.html[/tpl]

As well as its use during actual CPR on a cardiac arrest victim, which relies on the rescuer carrying the device with them, these devices can also be used as part of training programs to improve basic skills in performing correct chest compressions.Public Health Initiative Uses PocketCPR to Help Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival Rates, October 20, 2008.

===Automatic devices===

There are also some automated devices available that take over the chest compressions for the rescuer. These have several advantages: they allow rescuers to focus on performing other interventions; they do not fatigue and begin to perform less effective compressions, as humans do; and they are able to perform effective compressions in limited-space environments such as air ambulances, where manual compressions are difficult. These devices use either pneumatic (high-pressure gas) or electrical power sources to drive a compressing pad on to the chest of the patient. One such device, known as the LUCAS, was developed at the University Hospital of Lund, is powered by the compressed oxygen supplies already standard in ambulances and hospitals, and has undergone numerous clinical trials, showing a marked improvement in coronary perfusion pressure[tpl]cite journal|journal=Resuscitation|last=Steen et al.|title=Evaluation of LUCAS, a new device for automated mechanical compression and active decompression|year=2002|volume=55|doi=10.1016/S0300-9572(02)00271-X|pages=285–99|pmid=12458066|first1=S|last2=Liao|first2=Q|last3=Pierre|first3=L|last4=Paskevicius|first4=A|last5=Sjöberg|first5=T|issue=3[/tpl] and return of spontaneous circulation.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Resuscitation|volume=69|last=Rubertsson et al.|title=Increased restoration of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest with the LUCAS device compared to manual chest compressions|year=2006[/tpl]
In August 2013, a 41-year-old woman living in a town near Melbourne in Australia was treated with the LUCAS device for 53 minutes while a stent was placed in an artery near her heart, clearing a 100% blockage. She was considered to be clinically dead for 40 minutes. She was discharged from the hospital a week later.Automatic CPR device saves life of woman who was clinically dead for over 40 minutes, ABC News Online, 19 August 2013
Artificial ventilation can be achieved with multiple devices. While manual bag valve mask devices supply oxygen-enriched air through a facial mask (without maintaining an open airway), automatic devices utilize an oropharyngeal airway (e.g., Bergman or Guedel airways), which ensures airway patency. They also have a nozzle for the rescuer with a protective mask mode, preventing any mouth-to-mouth contact. Another system called the AutoPulse is electrically powered and uses a large band around the patient's chest that contracts rhythmically in order to deliver chest compressions. This is also backed by clinical studies showing increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Casner|first=M|coauthors=Anderson, D; Isaacs, SM|title=The impact of a new CPR assist device on the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|journal=Prehospital Emergency Care|volume=9|issue=1|date=January–March 2005|pmid=16036830|pages=61–7|doi=10.1080/10903120590891714[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=295|issue=22|last=Hallstrom|first=Al|coauthors=Rea, Thomas; Sayre, Michael; Christenson, James; Anton, Andy; Mosesso, Vince; Ottingham, Lois; Olsufka, Michele; Pennington, Sarah; White, Lynn; Yahn, Stephen; Husar, James; Morris, Mary; Cob, Leonard|format=PDF|title=Manual chest compression vs use of an automated chest compression device during resuscitation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/jama;295/22/2620.pdf?ijkey=V96Oxk0wfyGibgF&keytype=finite[/tpl]

===Mobile apps===

To support training and incident management mobile apps have been published on the largest app markets. An evaluation of 61 available apps has revealed that a large amount does not follow international guidelines for basic-life support and many apps are not designed in a user-friendly way.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kalz|first=M|coauthors=Lenssen, N; Felzen, M; Rossaint, R; Tabuenca, B; Specht, M; Skorning, M|title=Smartphone Apps for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training and Real Incident Support: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation Study|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=16|issue=3|date=March 2014|pmid=24647361|pages=e89|doi=10.2196/jmir.2951[/tpl]

==Prevalence==

===Chance of receiving CPR===

Various studies suggest that in out-of-home cardiac arrest, bystanders, lay persons or family members attempt CPR in between 14%[tpl]cite journal|last=Swor|first=RA|coauthors=Jackson RE; Cynar M; Sadler E; Basse W; Boji B; Rivera-Rivera EJ; Maher A; Grubb W; Jacobson R et al.|title=Bystander CPR, ventricular fibrillation and survival in witnessed, unmonitored out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=June 1995|volume=25|issue=6|pmid=7755200|pages=780–4|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(95)70207-5|last2=Jackson|first2=RE|last3=Cynar|first3=M|last4=Sadler|first4=E|last5=Basse|first5=E|last6=Boji|first6=B|last7=Rivera-Rivera|first7=EJ|last8=Maher|first8=A|last9=Grubb|first9=W|display-authors=9[/tpl] and 45%[tpl]cite journal|last=Wik|first=L|coauthors=Steen PA; Bircher NH|title=Quality of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation influence outcome after prehospital cardiac arrest|journal=Resuscitation|date=December 1994|volume=28|issue=4|pages=195–203|pmid=7740189|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(94)90064-7[/tpl] of the time, with a median of 32%. This indicates that around a third of out-of-home arrests have a CPR attempt made on them. However, the effectiveness of this CPR is variable, and the studies suggest only around half of bystander CPR is performed correctly.[tpl]cite journal|last=Van Hoeyweghen|first=RJ|coauthors=Bossaert LL; Mullie|title=Quality and efficiency of bystander CPR. Belgian Cerebral Resuscitation Study Group|journal=Resuscitation|date=August 1993|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–52|pmid=8210731|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(93)90162-J[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=EJ|coauthors=Lombardi G; Gennis P|title=Effectiveness of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|journal=JAMA|date=December 1995|volume=274|issue=24|pmid=8568985|doi=10.1001/jama.274.24.1922|pages=1922–5[/tpl] A recent study has shown that members of the public having received CPR training in the past lack the skills and confidence needed to save lives. These experts believe that better training is needed to improve the willingness to respond to cardiac arrest.
Age correlates to the chance of CPR being commenced: Younger people are far more likely to have CPR attempted on them before the arrival of emergency medical services.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jackson|first=RE|coauthors=Swor RA|title=Who gets bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a witnessed arrest?|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|date=June 1997|volume=4|issue=6|pages=560–4|pmid=9189184|doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.1997.tb03574.x[/tpl] Bystanders more commonly administer CPR when in public than when at the patient's home. People with no connection to the victim are more likely to perform CPR than are a member of their family.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Bossaert|first=L|coauthors=Van Hoeyweghen R|title=Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Cerebral Resuscitation study group|journal=Resuscitation|year=1989|volume=17|issue=Suppl S55–69|pmid=2551021|pages=S55–69; discussion S199–206|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(89)90091-9[/tpl]
Cause of arrest correlates to the likelihood of a bystander initiating CPR. Lay persons are most likely to give CPR to younger cardiac arrest victims in a public place when it has a medical cause; victims in arrest from trauma, exsanguination or intoxication are less likely to receive CPR.
CPR may be more likely to be performed if the bystander is told to perform only the chest compression element of the resuscitation.

===Chance of receiving CPR in time===

CPR is likely to be effective only if commenced within 6 minutes after the blood flow stops[tpl]cite journal|last=Cummins|first=RO|coauthors=Eisenberg MS; Hallstrom AP; Litwin PE|title=Survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation|journal=American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=March 1985|volume=3|issue=2|pages=114–9|pmid= 3970766|doi=10.1016/0735-6757(85)90032-4[/tpl] because permanent brain cell damage occurs when fresh blood thereafter infuses the cells: The cells of the brain become dormant in as little as 4–6 minutes in an oxygen deprived environment and, therefore, cannot survive the reintroduction of oxygen in a traditional resuscitation. Research using cardioplegic blood infusion resulted in a 79.4% survival rate with cardiac arrest intervals of 72±43 minutes, traditional methods achieve a 15% survival rate in this scenario, by comparison. New research is currently needed to determine what role CPR, electroshock, and new advanced gradual resuscitation techniques will have with this new knowledge.[ref]
</ref>
A notable exception is cardiac arrest that occurs along with exposure to very cold temperatures.  Hypothermia seems to protect by slowing down metabolic and physiologic processes, greatly decreasing the tissues' need for oxygen.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kondratiev TV, Flemming K, Myhre ES, Sovershaev MA, Tveita T |title=Is oxygen supply a limiting factor for survival during rewarming from profound hypothermia? |journal=Am.

==Society and culture==

===Portrayed effectiveness===

CPR is often severely misrepresented in movies and television as being highly effective in resuscitating a person who is not breathing and has no circulation.
A 1996 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that CPR success rates in television shows was 75% for immediate circulation, and 67% survival to discharge.[tpl]cite journal|title=Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on Television - Miracles and Misinformation|volume=334|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1996-06-13|pages=1578–1582|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/334/24/1578|coauthors=Diem, Susan J MD; Lantos, John D MD; Tulsky, James A MD|accessdate=2009-02-01|doi=10.1056/NEJM199606133342406|author=Diem, S.

When educated on the actual survival rates, the proportion of patients over 60 years of age desiring CPR should they suffer a cardiac arrest drops from 41% to 22%.[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=Jones GK, Brewer KL, Garrison HG|title=Public expectations of survival following cardiopulmonary resuscitation|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|year=2000|volume=7|issue=1|pages=48–53|doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2000.tb01891.x|last1=Jones|first1=G. Kirk|pmid=10894242[/tpl]

===Stage CPR===

Chest compressions are capable of causing significant local blunt trauma, including bruising or fracture of the sternum or ribs.[tpl]cite web|title=Chicago CPR Classes|url=http://savingchicagocpr.com/Chicago/bls-for-healthcare-providers/|work=Chicago CPR Classes[/tpl]  Performing CPR on a healthy person may or may not disrupt normal heart rhythm, but regardless the technique should not be performed on a healthy person because of the risk of trauma.
The portrayal of CPR technique on television and film often is purposely incorrect. Actors simulating the performance of CPR may bend their elbows while appearing to compress, to prevent force from reaching the chest of the actor portraying the victim. Other techniques, such as substituting a mannequin torso for the "victim" in some shots, may also be used to avoid harming actors.

===Self-CPR hoax===

A form of "self-CPR" termed "cough CPR" was the subject of a hoax chain e-mail entitled "How to Survive a Heart Attack When Alone," which wrongly cited "ViaHealth Rochester General Hospital" as the source of the technique. Rochester General Hospital has denied any connection with the technique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viahealth.org/body_rochester.cfm?id=329|title=ViaHealth Rochester General Hospital statement on 'Cough CPR' email|accessdate=2007-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/homecure/coughcpr.asp|title=Snopes Urban Legends Reference - Cough CPR|accessdate=2007-06-13[/tpl]
"Cough CPR" in the sense of resuscitating oneself is impossible because a prominent symptom of cardiac arrest is unconsciousness,[tpl]cite journal |title=Cough CPR |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Australian Resuscitation Council |volume=27 |issue=3 |page=2 |year=2003 |format=PDF |url=http://www.resus.org.au/newsletters/newsletter_nov_2003.pdf[/tpl] in which case coughing is impossible, although myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur to give rise to the cardiac arrest, so a patient may not be immediately unconscious. However, the vast majority of people suffering chest pain from a heart attack will not be in cardiac arrest and CPR is not needed to begin with. In these cases, attempting "cough CPR" will increase the workload on the heart and may be harmful.
The American Heart Association (AHA) and other resuscitation bodies do not endorse "cough CPR", which it terms a misnomer as it is not a form of resuscitation. The AHA does recognize a limited legitimate use of the coughing technique: "This coughing technique to maintain blood flow during brief arrhythmias has been useful in the hospital, particularly during cardiac catheterization. In such cases the patient's ECG is monitored continuously, and a physician is present."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4535|title=Cough CPR|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=American Heart Association[/tpl] When coughing is used on trained and monitored patients in hospitals, it has been shown to be effective only for 90 seconds.[tpl]cite journal |title=Cough CPR |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Australian Resuscitation Council |volume=29 |issue=3 |page=2 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.resus.org.au/newsletters/newsletter_dec2005.pdf[/tpl]

===CPR learned from movies and television===

In at least one case, it has been alleged that CPR learned from a movie was used to save a person's life. In April 2011, it was claimed that nine-year-old Tristin Saghin saved his sister's life by administering CPR on her after she fell into a swimming pool, using only the knowledge of CPR that he had gleaned from a motion picture, Black Hawk Down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/arizona-year-boy-tristin-saghin-saved-sister-cpr/story?id=13428007|title=Arizona 9-year-old boy, Tristin Saghin, Saved Sister With CPR, Congratulated by Movie Producer Jerry Bruckheimer|accessdate=2011-04-24|publisher=ABC News[/tpl]

===Hands-Only CPR portrayed as more palatable version===

Less than 1/3 of those people who experience a cardiac arrest at home, work or in a public location have CPR performed on them. Most bystanders are worried that they might do something wrong.American Heart Association  On October 28, 2009 The American Heart Association and the Ad Council launched a Hands-Only CPR public service announcement and website as a means to address this issue.American Heart Association, Ad Council launch Hands-Only CPR campaign  In July 2011, new content was added to the website including a digital app that helps a user learn how to perform Hands-Only CPR.Americans can learn Hands-Only CPR with a new digital application

==History==

In the 19th century, Doctor H. R. Silvester described a method (The Silvester Method) of artificial respiration in which the patient is laid on their back, and their arms are raised above their head to aid inhalation and then pressed against their chest to aid exhalation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade/slide/ShortStory/7b.html|publisher=University College London|title=Silvester's method|accessdate=2007-06-12[/tpl] The procedure is repeated sixteen times per minute. This type of artificial respiration is occasionally seen in films made in the early 20th century.
A second technique, called the Holger Nielsen technique, described in the first edition of the Boy Scout Handbook in the United States in 1911, was a form of artificial respiration where the person was laid face down, with their head to the side, resting on the palms of both hands. Upward pressure applied at the patient’s elbows raised the upper body while pressure on their back forced air into the lungs, in essence the Silvester Method with the patient flipped over. This form is seen well into the 1950s (it is used in an episode of Lassie during the mid-1950s), and was often used, sometimes for comedic effect, in theatrical cartoons of the time (see Tom and Jerry's "The Cat and the Mermouse" 1949). This method would continue to be shown, for historical purposes, side-by-side with modern CPR in the Boy Scout Handbook until its ninth edition in 1979. The technique was later banned from first-aid manuals in the UK.
Similar techniques were described in early 20th century ju-jutsu and judo books, as being used as far back as early 17th century. A New York Times correspondent reported those techniques being used successfully in Japan in 1910. In ju-jutsu (and later on, judo) those techniques were called Kappo or Kutasu.[tpl]cite web|author=Special Correspondence THE NEW YORK TIMES. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE4D61E39E333A25757C0A96F9C946196D6CF |title=REVIVED BY JIU-JITSU. - A Strange Story from Japan - Apparently Dead Man Resuscitated. - View Article - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1910-09-04 |accessdate=2013-05-28[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|pmc = 2461172 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3893.318-a|title = Jiu-Jitsu Methods of Resuscitation|year = 1935|last1 = Cornwall|first1 = J.

However, it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the wider medical community started to recognize and promote artificial respiration combined with chest compressions as a key part of resuscitation following cardiac arrest. The combination was first seen in a 1962 training video called "The Pulse of Life" created by James Jude, Guy Knickerbocker and Peter Safar. Jude and Knickerbocker, along with William Kouwenhoven and Joseph S. Redding had recently discovered the method of external chest compressions, whereas Safar had worked with Redding and James Elam to prove the effectiveness of artificial respiration. It was at Johns Hopkins University where the technique of CPR was originally developed. The first effort at testing the technique was performed on a dog by Redding, Safar and JW Perason. Soon afterward, the technique was used to save the life of a child.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsarrhythmias.com/doctor/index.htm|publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine|title=Arrhythmias|accessdate=2008-09-06[/tpl] Their combined findings were presented at the annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960 in Ocean City, and gained widespread acceptance over the following decade, helped by the video and speaking tour they undertook. Peter Safar wrote the book ABC of Resuscitation in 1957. In the U.S., it was first promoted as a technique for the public to learn in the 1970s.See, e.g., "Award of the Heart", TIME magazine, November 28, 1973, retrieved on 05-28-2008 from time.com
Artificial respiration was combined with chest compressions based on the assumption that active ventilation is necessary to keep circulating blood oxygenated, and the combination was accepted without comparing its effectiveness with chest compressions alone. However, research over the past decade has shown that assumption to be in error, resulting in the AHA's acknowledgment of the effectiveness of chest compressions alone (see Compression only in this article).[tpl]cite journal|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/117/16/21621 |title=Hands-Only (Compression-Only) Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Call to Action for Bystander Response to Adults Who Experience Out-of-Hospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest|last1=Sayre |first1=Michael |last2=Berg |first2=Robert |last3=Cave |first3=Diana |last4=Page |first4=Richard |last5=Potts |first5=Jerald |last6=White |first6=Roger |journal=Circulation |pages=2162–2167 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18378619  |volume=117 |issue=16 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.189380 |accessdate=2008-04-02|author7=American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee[/tpl] On June 4th 2011 Jeremiah Kliesing "coded" at the Michael DeBakey VA hospital in Houston, Tx.

CPR has continued to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, and a de-emphasis on the respiration aspect. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant heart-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because people tend to be reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place.[ref]USA Today
American Heart Association revises CPR guidelines
 An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives a year in the USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.
A landmark study published Oct. 6 in The Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that bystanders who applied hands-only CPR were able to boost survival to 34% from 18% for those who got conventional CPR or none at all. In addition, the percentage of people willing to provide CPR rose from 28% in 2005 to 40% in 2009.[/ref]

==Administering CPR to animals==

CPR is feasible on animals, including cats and dogs.  The principles and practices are virtually identical to CPR for humans, though resuscitation is usually done through the animal's nose. Perform CPR only on unconscious animals to avoid the risk of being bitten; a conscious animal would not require chest compressions. Animals, depending on species, have a lower bone density than humans; CPR can, therefore, weaken bones.[tpl]cite web | title=CPR for Cats & Dogs | url=http://depts.washington.edu/learncpr/cat_dog.html | publisher=University of Washington School of Medicine[/tpl]
