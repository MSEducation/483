During construction, 6000-year-old Neolithic remains were found near Haskovo.[tpl]cite web|title=Bulgaria: Bulgarian Archaeologists Stumble Upon 8000-Year-Old Skeleton|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=121454|publisher=Novinite.com|date=24 October 2010[/tpl]
The construction of the Chirpan-Haskovo and the Haskovo-Harmanli sections of the motorway are co-funded by   EU funds allocated for Bulgaria,[tpl]cite web|title=Bulgaria: EU Approves Bulgaria's Major Operative Programs|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=87267|publisher=Novinite.com|date=7 November 2007[/tpl] while a small section at the Turkish border is co-funded with a loan from the IBRD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minfin.bg/bg/pubs/1/7538|publisher=Ministry of finance[/tpl] Its construction runs in the same direction as the existing route 8 road, which is mainly a two-lane road and carries much of the road freight to and from Turkey. The completion of the Maritsa motorway will attempt to reduce this congestion.
The motorway is named after the Maritsa River.
