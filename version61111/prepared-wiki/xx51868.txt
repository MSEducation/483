Schaefer Beer is a brand of American beer first produced in 1842 by the F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company.  Schaefer Beer is billed as America's oldest lager beer by its brewers. 
Until the mid-1970s, Schaefer Beer was the world's best selling beer before ceding the top spot to Budweiser. The brand was purchased by Stroh Brewery Company in 1981, and since 1999 has been produced by Pabst Brewing Company after Stroh was purchased by Pabst in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schaefer-beer.com/history/|title=History of Schaefer Beer|publisher=Schaefer Beer|accessdate=2012-04-09[/tpl]

==Advertising campaigns==

The advertising slogan for Schaefer beer is "Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one." An earlier advertising campaign from the 1950s asserted, "What do you hear in the best of circles? Schaefer, all around!"
During the 1970s and 1980s, Schaefer beer was one of the top selling beers in Puerto Rico. A large and quite famous Schaefer beer billboard was once displayed at the main entrance to the city of Bayamón. It became quite famous among Puerto Rican salsa fans and superstars like Frankie Ruiz, Tito Rojas, and Lalo Rodríguez.
Schaefer beer had major exhibitions at both of New York City's World's Fairs, held in Flushing Meadows Park. During both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New York World's Fair, Schaefer sponsored "Schaefer Center", a restaurant that used beer as an ingredient in many dishes.
An illuminated Schaefer beer advertisement once appeared in the outfield of Ebbets Field. If a player reached first base on a hit, the letter "h" would light up and if the official scorer ruled that a player reached first base due to an error, the "e" would light up.
