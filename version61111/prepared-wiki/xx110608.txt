End of Fashion was an Australian pop rock band from Perth, Western Australia. As of January 2014, the band is defunct, with former lead singer and guitarist Justin Burford explaining in a Facebook post: "Triple J Australian radio station ended the career path of End Of Fashion, no question." The group gained mainstream attention with its 2005 single, "O Yeah", that was voted into eighth position of the "Hottest 100" poll, compiled by Australian youth radio station, Triple J.[tpl]cite web|title=Bands|url=http://www.somethinginthewater.com.au/bands1.htm|work=Something in the Water|publisher=Something in the Water|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Something in the Water[/tpl] The group has released three studio albums.

==History==

===Formation===

The band was originally formed as a side-project by guitarists Burford and Rodney Aravena, together with drummer Malcolm Clark and bassist Jonathon Dudman. After two years, Burford and Aravena split from The Sleepy Jackson to devote their full attention to a band they named "End of Fashion". After a series of bass players and drummers—including Vanessa Thornton from Jebediah, Mike Hobbs, Hugh Jennings from Autopilot, and Nicholas Jonsson—the band settled on the line-up of Hobbs as drummer and Tom King as bass guitarist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/entertainment/13662129/fashies-in-return-to-form/ |title=Fashies in return to form - The West Australian |last=Collins |first=Simon |date=11 May 2012 |work=au.news.yahoo.com/thewest |accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl] The band name also represented the band's modus operandi, as Burford explained:
 
 I want to break down the walls – within that context, that image, we can do anything we want no matter whether it's super cheesy or punk, I want to kill fashion, see the end of it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2005/endfashion.htm |title=End Of Fashion guest program 2005 |date=30 July 2005 |work=abc.net. au/rage |accessdate=3 August 2012[/tpl]

In 2003, the band started work on its first recording, the four-track EP Rough Diamonds, with former Midnight Oil guitarist, Jim Moginie, as producer. The EP was jointly released through independent label Hello Cleveland! (artwork) and major label EMI.[tpl]cite web|title=Rough Diamonds / Anything Goes (EP)|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rough-Diamonds-Anything-Goes-EP/dp/B001JQ9XLG|work=Amazon.co.uk|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Amazon.co.uk|year=2012[/tpl]

In an interview with Time Out Sydney in February 2009, Burford revealed that Simon Fasolo had replaced Tom King as the band's bassist.

The second single released from the album was "Dying for You", a collaboration between Burford and Julian Hamilton of The Presets:
[tpl]quote|They got together at the end of 2007 and did some songwriting and "Dying for You" was the last song they had written. It was cool track so we bounced on it and did our thing. There were a couple of other tunes from their writing session, but "Dying for You" was a cut above the rest.|Rodney Aravena[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drumperth.com.au |title=Book of Fashionable Truths |work=drumperth.com.au |publisher=Drum Media |last=Hogan |first=Matthew |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes[/tpl][/tpl]

===Third album and break-up===

End of Fashion's third studio album Holiday Trip of a Lifetime was released on 4 May 2012. The album was independently produced and released, with the band writing the album over the period of one year. However, the band members parted ways following the album's release, and Burford's focus shifted towards acting and solo music work. Burford attracted media attention in January 2014 when he identified Triple J as the primary reason for the band's demise, explaining: "'The question becomes, when your entire fan base is tied up in a radio station and that station decides to no longer broadcast your output or even barely acknowledge your existence, where do you go from there?'"[tpl]cite web|title=End Of Fashion Frontman Slams Triple J For Career Downfall|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/end-of-fashion-frontman-slams-triple-j-for-career-downfall/|work=Music Feeds|accessdate=2 March 2014|author=Greg Moskovitch|date=30 January 2014[/tpl] Burford's perspective, initially published in a Facebook post,[tpl]cite web|title=Without mincing words ...|url=https://www.facebook.com/justin.burford.18/posts/10151831453307261?comment_id=28712594&offset=100&total_comments=115|work=Justin Burford on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=2 March 2014|author=Justin Burford|date=28 January 2014[/tpl] followed criticism of the radio station from other musicians and an article published by the Age newspaper, in which the journalist addressed the issue of whether Triple J has led to the "homogenisation of Australian music".[tpl]cite web|title=End Of Fashion's Justin Burford slams triple j: “They ended our career"|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/38273/End-Of-Fashions-Justin-Burford-slams-triple-j-They-ended-our-career|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=2 March 2014|author=Sarah Smith|date=30 January 2014[/tpl]
