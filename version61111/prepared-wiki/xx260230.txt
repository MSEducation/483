[[Quebec school board elections, 1985]]

CATEGORIES: 1985 elections in Canada

The Canadian province of Quebec held school board elections on December 9, 1985, to elect new trustees to Catholic and Protestant school boards. Many candidates were elected without opposition, and turnout was generally low.
Outside of the island of Montreal, one-third of all trustees were elected each year on a rotating basis.

==South Shore==

Turnout on the south shore of Montreal was especially low, with estimates ranging from between three and ten per cent.
