Ishøj Municipality (Danish: Ishøj Kommune) is a municipality (Danish: kommune) in Region Hovedstaden on the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in eastern Denmark.  The municipality covers 26 km², with a total population of 20,687 (2008), many of whom are Pakistani, African, Arab, or Turkish immigrants.  Its mayor is Ole Bjørstorp, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.
The main town, and the site of the municipal council, is the town of Ishøj, which has one of Scandinavia's biggest housing projects - Vejleåparken (formerly Ishøjplanen). More than 76% of the people living there are immigrants or have immigrant parents. Consequently, Ishøj has many nicknames, for instance such as Istanhøj (a merge between the names Istanbul and Ishøj). 
Neighboring municipalities are Vallensbæk to the east, Høje-Taastrup to the north and west, and Greve to the south.
Ishøj Municipality was not merged with other municipalities by January 1, 2007 as the result of nationwide Kommunalreformen ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007).
