==Career==

Budgie formed in 1967 in Cardiff, Wales under the name Hills Contemporary Grass. Their original line-up consisted of Burke Shelley on vocals and bass, Tony Bourge on guitar and vocals, and Ray Phillips on drums.[tpl]cite web|author=UK |url=http://www.myspace.com/budgieofficialmyspace |title=Budgie's MySpace page |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl] After performing several gigs in 1968, the band changed their name to Budgie the following year and recorded their first demo. The band originally formed under such names as Hills Contemporary Grass and Six Ton Budgie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+kingdom/south+glamorgan/cardiff/budgie |title=Artists :: BUDGIE |publisher=MusicMight |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl] Burke Shelley has said that the band's name came from the fact that he, "loved the idea of playing noisy, heavy rock, but calling ourselves after something diametrically opposed to that".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/the-top-14-birds-in-rock/ |title=Classic Rock » Blog Archive » The Top 14 Birds In Rock |publisher=Classicrockmagazine.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl]
Their debut album in strong blues-oriented hard rock lines was recorded at Rockfield Studios with Black Sabbath producer Rodger Bain[tpl]cite web|last=Henderson |first=Alex |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album |id=r2898 |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Budgie - Budgie |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl] and released in 1971, followed by Squawk in 1972. The third album, Never Turn Your Back On a Friend (1973), contained  "Breadfan", which was covered by Metallica in 1988, the band having covered another Budgie song, "Crash Course In Brain Surgery" earlier in their career. Ray Philips left the band before the fourth album In for the Kill! was recorded and was replaced by Pete Boot (b. Peter Charles Boot, 30 September 1950, West Bromwich, Staffordshire).[tpl]cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist |id=p12471 |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Budgie |publisher=AllMusic |date=2002-05-30 |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl]
In late 1974, the band were joined by drummer Steve Williams for the album Bandolier, for live shows promoting this album and the follow-up, If I Were Brittania I'd Waive the Rules, the band were augmented by Welsh guitarist Myf Isaac, but both Bourge and Isaac left mid 1978 and were replaced by ex Trapeze guitarist Robert Kendrick.  Music from the 1978 LP Impeckable was featured in the 1979 film J-Men Forever (shown frequently on the USA Network's "Night Flight" television series in the 1980s) which is now a cult classic. In late 1978, having been dropped by A&M and with no new recording contract, this line up floundered, and after 12 months Kendrick was replaced by "Big" John Thomas (b. 21 February 1952) in late 1979. This line up recorded two albums for Kingsley Wards 'Active' label: Power Supply (1980) and Nightflight (1981). 1982 saw them signed to RCA for Deliver Us From Evil their final recording for a "major label".
The band continued to have success during the New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene, playing the Reading Festival in 1980 and then headlining the festival in 1982.A brief history of the Reading festival fatreg.com They built a particular following in Poland,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] where they played as the first heavy metal band behind the Iron Curtain, in 1982.

They toured in 2002-6, mostly in the United Kingdom, the NYC/NJ area, Dallas, and with a few shows in Europe including the Sweden Rock Festival and a return to post-Communist Poland. In 1999 the band reunited in Letchworth and officially reformed.
In 2006 Budgie undertook a thirty five date United Kingdom tour and a new album,  titled You're All Living In Cuckooland, was released in the UK on 7 November that year. In 2007 they played dates in Sweden and Poland.
On 4 July 2007 Lees announced his departure from the band to concentrate on his teaching and solo career.
Following the departure of Lees, Dio lead guitarist and songwriter Craig Goldy offered his services while Ronnie James Dio was completing commitments with Heaven & Hell on their World Tour.
In February 2008 Craig Goldy accompanied Budgie on their first tour of Australia and has continued playing with Budgie as 'guest guitarist' for all of their shows.
Budgie's November 2010 tour of Eastern Europe had to be cancelled as Shelley was hospitalised on 9 November in Wejherowo, Poland with a 6 cm aortic aneurism. After surgery, he returned to Britain for recovery.[tpl]cite web|last=Shelley|first=Burke|title=Latest update 20 November|url=http://www.budgie.uk.com/news.html|publisher=Budgie.uk|accessdate=11 December 2010[/tpl] Since then the band halted any activities, as Shelley can`t sing and play at the same time.

==Musical style and legacy==

Budgie's music is a cross between the progressive metal textures of Rush and heaviness of Black Sabbath.  Burke Shelley's vocals have been compared to Geddy Lee due to his similar approach of high-pitched banshee wails (incidentally, Shelley and Lee are also the bass players in their respective bands).  Although Budgie remained quite obscure during their early career, many future stars of hard rock/metal have cited them as an important influence and covered their songs, including Iron Maiden,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/iron-maiden-mn0000098465/related |title=Iron Maiden - Similar Artists, Megadeth,Influenced By, Followers |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] Metallica,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/metallica-mn0000446509/related |title=Metallica - Similar Artists, Influenced By, Followers |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] Van Halen,[tpl]cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-for-the-kill%21-mw0000202013 |title=In for the Kill! - Budgie : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] Melvins,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/melvins-mn0000349157/related |title=Melvins - Similar Artists, Influenced By, Followers |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] Alice in Chains[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alice-in-chains-mn0000007920/related |title=Alice in Chains - Similar Artists, Influenced By, Followers |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] and Soundgarden.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/soundgarden-mn0000001098/related |title=Soundgarden - Similar Artists, Influenced By, Followers |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl]
