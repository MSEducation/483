==History==

In 1995 The Elephant Sanctuary was started on [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|1[/tpl] with one elephant, Tarra.
An internship program was established to train elephant caregivers in 1996.
A [tpl]convert|9000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on[/tpl] barn was added in 1999.
In 2001 a [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2|1|sing=on[/tpl] section of land with a [tpl]convert|25|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] lake was acquired.
Another [tpl]convert|1840|acre|km2|0[/tpl] was purchased and the sanctuary expanded to [tpl]convert|2700|acre|km2|0[/tpl] in 2003.
In 2004, the first two African elephants were accepted into the new African habitat.
The existing herd of Asian elephants was relocated to a new [tpl]convert|2200|acre|km2|0[/tpl] habitat to accommodate eight incoming elephants who needed to be quarantined in 2005. This new area includes a [tpl]convert|22000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] barn and [tpl]convert|20000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on[/tpl] hay barn which is able to hold up to 35,000 bales of hay.

==Facilities==

The development of the Sanctuary was done in several stages. It was originally built in phases and then expanded whenever funding was available or the elephants needed more space or accommodation. Twenty miles of double fencing encloses The Elephant Sanctuary's [tpl]convert|2700|acre|km2|0[/tpl]. In accordance with TWRA regulations and TAOS guidelines the quarantine area has a hot wire fence.

a company that trained and rented elephants to circuses, and which became widely known and fined for providing poor care for its elephants.
Tina, born at the Oregon Zoo in 1970, arrived at the sanctuary on August 11, 2003, from Vancouver. She died the following July.
November 17, 2004, it became home to two Asian elephants named Lota and Misty who came from the Hawthorn Corporation. Both Lota and Misty were diagnosed with a human strain of tuberculosis, a disease that was prevalent in the Hawthorn herd.
Lota died on February 9, 2005 of advanced tuberculosis.
On January 30, 2006, Minnie and Lottie were the first two of eight more Asian elephants to arrive at the Sanctuary from the Hawthorn Corporation. They were joined in subsequent days by Queenie, Liz, Debbie, Ronnie, Billie and Frieda. Unfortunately, Sue died December 30, 2005, before she reached the Sanctuary.
On July 21, 2006, Winkie, a female Asian elephant, knocked down and stepped on Joanna Burke, 36, Winkie's caregiver for 6 years, while Joanna was going to look at a sting to one of Winkie's eyes. Joanna was killed instantly. Winkie also injured director Scott Blais who was trying to intervene. Winkie had a reputation as a dangerous animal while she was living in a zoo but it was clear by her actions that Winkie was not acting out aggressively any more than trying to indicate she had pain from the sting and the subsequent treatment. On July 25, it was released that,  as per Joanna's wishes, Winkie would not be euthanized. A statement released by the Sanctuary stated the following: "Joanna made it perfectly clear in word and deed that no harm should come to any elephant no matter their action. She shared the Sanctuary's philosophy that Winkie will not be punished for her actions but managed in a way that keeps another innocent caregiver out of harm's way." Burke was interred  on the grounds of the Sanctuary on July 26, 2006, as per her wishes.
On July 25, 2006, the Sanctuary announced it will be adjusting its protocol with regard to any elephants who are affected with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Sanctuary protocols are a set of standards of elephant care and management the Elephant Sanctuary staff follow when dealing with their elephants. Currently, two of the elephants at the Sanctuary, Winkie and Flora, have been diagnosed with PTSD. "In respect of their condition, caregivers will adjust how they physically interact with the elephants".[tpl]cite web | title=Media Corrections | work=Newsroom| publisher=The Elephant Sanctuary | url=http://www.elephants.com/pr/Media_Corrections_7_06 | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-17[/tpl]
