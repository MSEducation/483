[[Elaunin]]

CATEGORIES: Structural proteins

Elaunin is a component of elastic fibers formed from a deposition of elastin between oxytalan fibers. It is found in the periodontal ligament and in the connective tissue of the dermis, particularly in association with sweat glands. The word elaunin is derived from the Greek verb ἐλαύνω "I steer".

==Identification==

Unlike Oxytalan fibres, elaunin fibres stain with orcein, aldehyde fuchsin and resorcin fuchsin without prior oxidation.
