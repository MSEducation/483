The brain contains very few cells that produce orexin; in a human brain, about 10,000 to 20,000 neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the axons from these neurons extend throughout the entire brain and spinal cord,[tpl] cite book | chapter = 3.

Orexin was discovered in 1998 almost simultaneously by two independent groups of rat-brain researchers.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sakurai T, Amemiya A, Ishii M, Matsuzaki I, Chemelli RM, Tanaka H, Williams SC, Richardson JA, Kozlowski GP, Wilson S, Arch JR, Buckingham RE, Haynes AC, Carr SA, Annan RS, McNulty DE, Liu WS, Terrett JA, Elshourbagy NA, Bergsma DJ, Yanagisawa M | title = Orexins and orexin receptors: a family of hypothalamic neuropeptides and G protein-coupled receptors that regulate feeding behavior | journal = Cell | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 573–85 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9491897 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80949-6 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = de Lecea L, Kilduff TS, Peyron C, Gao X, Foye PE, Danielson PE, Fukuhara C, Battenberg EL, Gautvik VT, Bartlett FS, Frankel WN, van den Pol AN, Bloom FE, Gautvik KM, Sutcliffe JG | title = The hypocretins: Hypothalamus-specific peptides with neuroexcitatory activity | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 322–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9419374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.1.322 | pmc = 18213 [/tpl] One group named it orexin, from orexis, meaning "appetite" in Greek; the other group named it hypocretin, because it is produced in the hypothalamus and bears a weak resemblance to secretin, a hormone found in the gut. The scientific community has not yet settled on a consensus for which word to use.

==Isoforms==

There are two types of orexin: orexin-A and -B (hypocretin-1 and -2). They are excitatory neuropeptide hormones with approximately 50% sequence identity, are produced by cleavage of a single precursor protein. Orexin-A is 33 amino acid residues long and has two intrachain disulfide bonds; orexin-B is a linear 28 amino acid residue peptide. Studies suggest that orexin-A may be of greater biological importance than orexin-B. Although these peptides are produced by a very small population of cells in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus, they send projections throughout the brain.  The orexin peptides bind to the two G-protein coupled orexin receptors, OX1 and OX2, with orexin-A binding to both OX1 and OX2 with approximately equal affinity while orexin-B binds mainly to OX2 and is 5 times less potent at OX1.[tpl]cite journal | author = Langmead CJ, Jerman JC, Brough SJ, Scott C, Porter RA, Herdon HJ | title = Characterisation of the binding of 3H-SB-674042, a novel nonpeptide antagonist, to the human orexin-1 receptor | journal = Br.

The orexins are strongly conserved peptides, found in all major classes of vertebrates.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

==Function==

The orexin system was initially suggested to be primarily involved in the stimulation of food intake, based on the finding that central administration of orexin-A increases food intake. In addition, it stimulates wakefulness and energy expenditure.

===Brown fat activation===

Obesity in orexin knockout mice is a result of inability of brown preadipocytes to differentiate into brown adipose tissue (BAT), which in turn reduces BAT thermogenesis. BAT differentiation can be restored in these knockout mice through injections of orexin. Deficiency in orexin has also been linked to narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. Furthermore narcoleptic people are more likely to be obese.  Hence obesity in narcoleptic patients may be due to orexin deficiency leading to brown-fat hypo activity and reduced energy expenditure.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sellayah D, Bharaj P, Sikder D | title = Orexin is required for brown adipose tissue development, differentiation, and function | journal = Cell Metab. | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 478–90 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 21982708 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.010 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111004123554.htm | laysource = ScienceDaily [/tpl]

===Wakefulness===

Orexin seems to promote wakefulness. Recent studies indicate that a major role of the orexin system is to integrate metabolic, circadian and sleep debt influences to determine whether an animal should be asleep or awake and active. Orexin neurons strongly excite various brain nuclei with important roles in wakefulness including the dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine and acetylcholine systems[tpl]cite journal | author = Sherin JE, Elmquist JK, Torrealba F, Saper CB | title = Innervation of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons by GABAergic and galaninergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the rat | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 4705–21 |date=June 1998 | pmid = 9614245 | doi = | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/18/12/4705 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lu J, Bjorkum AA, Xu M, Gaus SE, Shiromani PJ, Saper CB | title = Selective activation of the extended ventrolateral preoptic nucleus during rapid eye movement sleep | journal = J.

The discovery that an orexin receptor mutation causes the sleep disorder canine narcolepsy[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81965-0 | author = Lin L, Faraco J, et al. | title = The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene | journal = Cell | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 365–376 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10458611 [/tpl] in Doberman Pinschers  subsequently indicated a major role for this system in sleep regulation. Genetic knockout mice lacking the gene for orexin were also reported to exhibit narcolepsy.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81973-X | author = Chemelli RM, Willie JT, et al. | title = Narcolepsy in orexin knockout mice: molecular genetics of sleep regulation | journal = Cell | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–451 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10481909 [/tpl] Transitioning frequently and rapidly between sleep and wakefulness, these mice display many of the symptoms of narcolepsy.  Researchers are using this animal model of narcolepsy to study the disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mochizuki T, Crocker A, McCormack S, Yanagisawa M, Sakurai T, Scammell TE | title = Behavioral state instability in orexin knock-out mice | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 24 | issue = 28 | pages = 6291–300 |date=July 2004 | pmid = 15254084 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0586-04.2004 | url =  [/tpl] Narcolepsy results in excessive daytime sleepiness, inability to consolidate wakefulness in the day (and sleep at night), and cataplexy, which is the loss of muscle tone in response to strong, usually positive, emotions. Dogs that lack a functional receptor for orexin have narcolepsy, while animals and people lacking the orexin neuropeptide itself also have narcolepsy.
Central administration of orexin-A strongly promotes wakefulness, increases body temperature, locomotion and elicits a strong increase in energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation also increases orexin-A transmission.  The orexin system may thus be more important in the regulation of energy expenditure than food intake. In fact, orexin-deficient narcoleptic patients have increased obesity rather than decreased BMI, as would be expected if orexin were primarily an appetite stimulating peptide.  Another indication that deficits of orexin cause narcolepsy is that depriving monkeys of sleep for 30–36 hours and then injecting them with the neurochemical alleviates the cognitive deficiencies normally seen with such amount of sleep loss.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/12/sleep_deprivation | title = Snorting a Brain Chemical Could Replace Sleep |accessdate = 2008-02-05 | author= Alexis Madrigal | date= 2007-12-28 | publisher = Wired News, Condé Nast  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Deadwyler SA, Porrino L, Siegel JM, Hampson RE | title = Systemic and nasal delivery of orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) reduces the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in nonhuman primates | journal = J.

In humans, narcolepsy is associated with a specific variant of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.[tpl]cite journal | author = Klein J, Sato A | title = The HLA system. Second of two parts | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 343 | issue = 11 | pages = 782–6 |date=September 2000 | pmid = 10984567 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200009143431106| url =  [/tpl] Furthermore, genome-wide analysis shows that, in addition to the HLA variant, narcoleptic humans also exhibit a specific genetic mutation in the T-cell receptor alpha locus.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hallmayer J, Faraco J, Lin L, et al. | title = Narcolepsy is strongly associated with the TCR alpha locus | journal = Nat. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 708–11 |date=June 2009 | pmid = 19412176 | doi = 10.1038/ng.372 | url = | pmc = 2803042 [/tpl] In conjunction, these genetic anomalies cause the immune system to attack and kill the critical orexin neurons. Hence the absence of orexin-producing neurons in narcoleptic humans may be the result of an autoimmune disorder.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-05/sumc-nia042809.php | title = Narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, Stanford researcher says | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-05-03| format = | work = EurekAlert | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-05-31[/tpl]

===Food Intake===

Orexin increases the craving for food, and correlates with the function of the substances that promote its production.
Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells and acts as a long-term internal measure of energy state. Ghrelin is a short-term factor secreted by the stomach just before an expected meal, and strongly promotes food intake.
Orexin-producing cells have recently been shown to be inhibited by leptin (through the leptin receptor pathway), but are activated by ghrelin and hypoglycemia (glucose inhibits orexin production). Orexin, as of 2007, is claimed to be a very important link between metabolism and sleep regulation.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] Such a relationship has been long suspected, based on the observation that long-term sleep deprivation in rodents dramatically increases food intake and energy metabolism, i.e., catabolism, with lethal consequences on a long-term basis. Sleep deprivation then leads to a lack of energy. In order to make up for this lack of energy, many people use high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods that ultimately can lead to poor health and weight gain. Other dietary nutrients, amino acids, also can activate orexin neurons, and they can suppress the glucose response of orexin neurons at physiological concentration, causing the energy balance that orexin maintains to be thrown off its normal cycle.http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fendo.2013.00018/full

===Pharmacologic potential===

The research on orexin mimics is still in an early phase, although many scientists believe that orexin-based drugs could help narcoleptics and increase alertness in the brain without the side effects of amphetamines.
Merck reported at the Sleep 2012 conference that insomniacs taking an orexin blocker, suvorexant, fell asleep faster and slept an hour longer. Suvorexant was tested for three months on over a thousand patients in a phase III trial.
Preliminary research has been conducted that shows potential for orexin blockers in the treatment of alcoholism. Lab rats given drugs which targeted the orexin system lost interest in alcohol despite being given free access in experiments.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.worldcampaign.net/forum/view.php?id=1707 | author = Helen Puttick | title = Hope in fight against alcoholism | date = 2006-12-26 | publisher = The Herald [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lawrence AJ, Cowen MS, Yang HJ, Chen F, Oldfield B | title = The orexin system regulates alcohol-seeking in rats | journal = Br.

A study has reported that transplantation of orexin neurons into the pontine reticular formation in rats is feasible, indicating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies in addition to pharmacological interventions to treat narcolepsy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Arias-Carrión O, Murillo-Rodriguez E, Xu M, Blanco-Centurion C, Drucker-Colín R, Shiromani PJ | title = Transplantation of Hypocretin Neurons into the Pontine Reticular Formation: Preliminary Results | journal = Sleep | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 1465–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15683135 | doi = | url = http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/270802.pdf | format = | pmc = 1201562 [/tpl]
Because orexin-A receptors have been shown to regulate relapse to cocaine seeking, a new study investigated its relation to nicotine by studying rats. By blocking the orexin-A receptor with low doses of the selective antagonist SB-334,867, nicotine self-administration decreased and also the motivation to seek and obtain the drug. The study showed that blocking of receptors in the insula decreased self-administration, but not blocking of receptors in the adjacent somatosensory cortex. The greatest decrease in self-administration was found when blocking all orexin-A receptors in the brain as a whole. A rationale for this study was the fact that the insula has been implicated in regulating feelings of craving. The insula contains orexin-A receptors. It has been reported that smokers who sustained damage to the insula lost the desire to smoke.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081124174851.htm | title = Blocking A Neuropeptide Receptor Decreases Nicotine Addiction | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-12-01 | work = | publisher = ScienceDaily LLC | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-02-11[/tpl]

===Lipid metabolism===

Orexin-A (OXA) has been recently demonstrated to have direct effect on a part of the lipid metabolism. OXA stimulates glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that increased energy uptake is stored as lipids (triacylglycerol). OXA thus increases lipogenesis. It also inhibits lipolysis and stimulates the secretion of adiponectin. These effects are thought to be mostly conferred via the PI3K pathway because this pathway inhibitor (LY294002) completely blocks OXA effects in adipocytes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Skrzypski M, Le TT, Kaczmarek P, Pruszynska-Oszmalek E, Pietrzak P, Szczepankiewicz D, Kolodziejski PA, Sassek M, Arafat A, Wiedenmann B, Nowak KW, Strowski MZ | title = Orexin A stimulates glucose uptake, lipid accumulation and adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and isolated primary rat adipocytes | journal = Diabetologia |date=July 2011 | volume = 5 | issue = 47 | pages = 1841–52 | pmid = 21505958 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-011-2152-2 [/tpl] The link between OXA and the lipid metabolism is new and currently under more research.
Obesity in orexin-knockout mice is associated with impaired brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sellayah D, Bharaj P, Sikder D | title = Orexin is required for brown adipose tissue development, differentiation, and function | journal = Cell Metab. | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 478–90 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 21982708 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.010 | laysummary = http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-sanford-burnham-brown-fat-discovery-20111004,0,5359151.story | laysource = Orlando Sentinel [/tpl]

===Mood===

High levels of orexin-A have been associated with happiness in human subjects, while low levels have been associated with sadness.[tpl]cite journal | author = Blouin AM, Fried I, Wilson CL, Staba RJ, Behnke EJ, Lam HA, Maidment NT, Karlsson KÆ, Lapierre JL, Siegel JM | title = Human hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone levels are linked to emotion and social interaction | journal = Nature Communications | year = 2013 | volume = 4 | pages = 1547 | pmid = 23462990 | pmc = 3595130 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2461 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130307145720.htm | laysource = Science Daily [/tpl] The finding suggests that boosting levels of orexin-A could elevate mood in humans, being thus a possible future treatment for disorders like depression. Likewise, it helps explain the incidence of depression associated with narcolepsy.

==History and nomenclature==

In 1996, Gautvik, de Lecea, and colleagues reported the discovery of several genes in the rat brain, including one they dubbed "clone 35." Their work showed that clone 35 expression was limited to the lateral hypothalamus.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.16.8733 | author = Gautvik KM, de Lecea L, et al. | title = Overview of the most prevalent hypothalamus-specific mRNAs, as identified by directional tag PCR subtraction | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 16 | pages = 8733–8738 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8710940 | pmc = 38742 [/tpl]
Masashi Yanagisawa and colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, coined the term orexin to reflect the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) activity of these hormones. In their 1998 paper (with authorship attributed to Sakurai and colleagues) describing these neuropeptides, they also reported discovery of two orexin receptors, dubbed OX1R and OX2R.
Im 1998, Luis de Lecea, Thomas Kilduff, and colleagues also reported discovery of these same peptides, dubbing them hypocretins to indicate that they are synthesized in the hypothalamus and to reflect their structural similarity to the hormone secretin (i.e., hypothalamic secretin). This is the same group that first identified clone 35 two years earlier. De Lecea and colleagues were originally in search of novel genes expressed in the hypothalamus. To do this, they extracted selective DNA found in the lateral hypothalamus. They cloned this DNA and studied it under electron microscopy. Neurotransmitters found in this area were oddly similar to the gut hormone, secretin, so de Lecea decided to name the two forms of peptides hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279673/ These cells were first thought to reside and work only within the lateral hypothalamus area, but immunocytochemmistry tactics revealed the various projections this area truly had to other parts of the brain. A majority of these projections reached the limbic system and structures associated with it (including the amygdala, septum, and basal forebrain area).
The name of this family of peptides is currently an unsettled issue. The name "orexin" has been rejected by some due to evidence that the orexigenic effects of these peptides may be incidental or trivial (i.e., orexin induced subjects eat more because they are awake more), though this issue is also unsettled, while other groups maintain that the name "hypocretin" is awkward, pointing out that many neuropeptides have names that are unrelated to their most important functions, and that waking is one of the important factors that supports feeding behavior.  Both "orexin" and "hypocretin" will likely continue to appear in published works until a preferred name has been accepted by the scientific community.

==Selective ligands==

Several drugs[tpl]cite journal | author = Heifetz A, Morris GB, Biggin PC, Barker O, Fryatt T, Bentley J, Hallett D, Manikowski DP, Pal S,  Reifegerste R, Slack M, Law R |title=Study of Human Orexin-1 and -2 G-Protein-Coupled Receptors with Novel and Published Antagonists by Modeling, Molecular Dynamics Simulations, and Site-Directed Mutagenesis | journal = Biochemistry | year=2012 | volume = 51 | issue = 15 | pages = 3178–3197 | doi = 10.1021/bi300136h [/tpl] acting on the orexin system are under development, either orexin agonists for the treatment of conditions such as narcolepsy, or orexin antagonists for insomnia. No non-peptide agonists are yet available, although synthetic Orexin-A polypeptide has been made available as a nasal spray and tested on monkeys. Several non-peptide antagonists are in development however; SB-649,868 is under development by GlaxoSmithKline for sleep disorders and is a non-selective orexin receptor antagonist. Another OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonist (ACT-078573, almorexant) is a similar compound under development for primary insomnia by Actelion. A third entry is Merck's MK-4305.[tpl]cite journal | author = Baxter CA, Cleator ED, Karel MJ, Edwards JS, Reamer RA, Sheen FJ, Stewart GW, Strotman NA, Wallace DJ | title = The First Large-Scale Synthesis of MK-4305: A Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist for the Treatment of Sleep Disorder | journal = Organic Process Research & Development | year = 2011 | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 367–375 | doi = 10.1021/op1002853[/tpl]
Most ligands acting on the orexin system so far are polypeptides modified from the endogenous agonists Orexin-A and Orexin-B, however there are some subtype-selective non-peptide antagonists available for research purposes.

Orexins act on Gq-protein-coupled receptors signaling through phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium-dependent as well as calcium-independent transduction pathways. These include activation of electrogenic sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) and a non-specific cationic conductance, likely channels of the transient receptor potential canonical-(TRPC) type activation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, closure of G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channels (GIRK), and activation of protein kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and mitogen-associated protein kinase, also called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Postsynaptic actions of orexins on their numerous neuronal targets throughout the CNS are almost entirely excitatory.[tpl]cite journal | author = Selbach O, Haas HL | title = Hypocretins: the timing of sleep and waking | journal = Chronobiology International | volume = 23 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 63–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16687280 | doi = 10.1080/07420520500545961 | url =  [/tpl]
