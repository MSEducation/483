Craig Michael Conroy (born September 4, 1971) is an American former professional ice hockey player and currently the Special Assistant to the General Manager of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League. A sixth round selection of the Montreal Canadiens at the 1990 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft, Conroy played 1,009 NHL games for the Canadiens, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings during a professional career that spanned from 1994 to 2011. Internationally, he twice played with the United States National Team – at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and the 2006 Winter Olympics.
Developed as a defensive specialist through much of his career, Conroy was twice a finalist for the Selke Trophy as the league's top defensive forward and was nominated for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player. He played over 1,000 games in the NHL and was the second oldest player in league history to reach that milestone.  Conroy, who enjoyed his greatest offensive seasons with the Flames, is a former captain of the team and was twice honored by the organization for his leadership, dedication and humanitarian efforts.

==Professional career==

===Montreal and St. Louis===

Conroy was selected in the sixth round, 123rd overall, at the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. He turned professional in 1994 upon completing his college career in Clarkson.  At his first day of his first training camp with Montreal, he got into a fight with the team's star goaltender, Patrick Roy, after striking the latter with a slap shot in practice.[tpl]cite web |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/conroy-reaches-unlikely-milestone/article1775591/ |title=Conroy reaches unlikely milestone |work=Globe and Mail |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl] He spent the majority of the 1994–95 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Fredericton Canadiens, scoring 26 goals and 44 points in 55 games. He appeared in six games for Montreal that year.  He played his first NHL game on February 15, 1995, against the Hartford Whalers, and scored his first goal one night later against the New York Rangers.  Though he was an offensive star at Clarkson and Fredericton, the Canadiens sought to convert him to a defensive specialist in the NHL.
While he averaged over one point per game with Fredericton in 1995–96, Conroy again played only a handful of games with Montreal. He again began 1996–97 in the AHL, but was traded along with Pierre Turgeon and Rory Fitzpatrick to the St. Louis Blues for Murray Baron, Shayne Corson and a draft pick on October 29, 1996. Conroy appeared in five games with the Worcester IceCats in the AHL, but after earning a recall to St. Louis, established himself as a regular in the NHL and appeared in 61 games with the Blues that season.  Head coach Joel Quenneville worked to develop Conroy's abilities as a defensive forward and top faceoff specialist.  Conroy responded in 1997–98 by improving to 43 points and a career-high plus-minus rating of +20. In recognition of his season, he was named a finalist for both the Selke Trophy as the NHL's top defensive forward, and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player.
Conroy remained one of the league's top defensive forwards in 1998–99. While he missed several games with a high ankle sprain,[tpl]cite news |last=Luecking |first=Dave |title=Conroy leads Blues to win but suffers ankle injury |work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |date=1999-03-14 |page=F1[/tpl] he scored his first career hat trick on February 26, 1999, against the Calgary Flames and finished sixth in Selke Trophy voting that season. He faced a difficult season in 1999–2000 as Queneville adopted a new strategy that abandoned the concept of a checking line.  Conroy struggled at both ends of the ice, and frequently found his ice time limited as a result.[tpl]cite news |last=Luecking |first=Dave |title=Struggling to find role with Blues, Conroy vents frustration on Stars |work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |date=1999-12-13 |page=C6[/tpl] He finished the season with just 27 points. 
Looking to improve their team for a playoff run in 2000–01, the Blues dealt Conroy, along with a draft pick, to the Flames for Cory Stillman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/03/13/nhl010313.html |title=Blues carry the day at NHL trade deadline |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2001-03-14 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] The trade was initially unpopular in Calgary as the Flames had given up their leading scorer for Conroy, who noted that that was when he "learned not to read the papers or watch TV".[tpl]cite web |last=Mingo |first=Rita |url=http://nhl.fanhouse.com/2010/10/28/craig-conroy-recalls-icy-welcome-in-calgary-as-1-000th-game-loom/ |title=Craig Conroy recalls icy welcome in Calgary as 1,000th game looms |publisher=AOL Fanhouse |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl]

===Calgary and Los Angeles===

Opinion of the deal shifted considerably the following season as Conroy established himself as the Flames' first line center alongside Jarome Iginla.[tpl]cite news |last=Goold |first=Derrick |title=Conroy joins Turek in dazzling former team |work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |date=2001-10-23 |page=D1[/tpl] The pair developed good chemistry, and became the best of friends.[tpl]cite web |last=Board |first=Mike |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=541780 |title=Capturing Conroy |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |date=2010-10-27 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] Conroy scored career highs with 28 goals and 75 points, while Iginla reached the 50-goal plateau for the first time and led the league in scoring.  Iginla credited Conroy for making his breakout season possible. Additionally, Conroy was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for a second time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=541788 |title=Conroy to celebrate 1,000 games |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |date=2010-10-27 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] The Flames named him a co-captain along with Bob Boughner late in the 2001–02 season, and he held the role full-time in 2002–03.
Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002–03 with 59 points and again in 2003–04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games with a knee injury. Shortly before the 2003-04 season began, Conroy gave up the captaincy after having decided it was time for Iginla to take over leadership of the team.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=396926 |title=Iginla honored to be captain of Flames |publisher=National Hockey League |last=Rosen |first=Dan |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] He reached two milestones that season; he scored his 300th career point against the Vancouver Canucks on November 29, 2003 and played his 600th game against the Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2004. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs, their first trip to the post-season in eight seasons.  Conroy was a key player for the team as they upset the top three seeds in the Western Conference, the Canucks, Red Wings and San Jose Sharks en route to a seventh game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final.[tpl]cite news |last=Gardiner |first=Andy |title=Face it: Conroy a key to Flames' run |work=USA Today |date=2004-05-27 |page=C10[/tpl] He finished second on the team in playoff scoring with 17 points.[tpl]Cite book |title=2009–10 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |last=Hanlon |first=Peter |last2=Kelso |first2=Sean |year=2009 |page=142[/tpl] Following the season, Conroy was named to play with Team USA at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey,[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/worldcup04/news/story?page=teamusaroster |title=Team USA roster |publisher=ESPN |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] but appeared in only two games for the team.
Conroy left the Flames as a free agent following the playoff run as he opted to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings.[tpl]cite web |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/LosAngeles/2005/12/21/1362818-sun.html |title=Conroy holds court again |work=Calgary Sun |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl]  He later admitted that he did not truly wish to leave the Flames, but facing financial uncertainty with the 2004–05 NHL lockout looming, Conroy chose to accept the guaranteed contract.[tpl]cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Jean |url=http://communities.canada.com/calgaryherald/blogs/insideflames/archive/2009/01/31/parting-shot-a-conversation-with-craig-conroy.aspx |title=Parting shot: A conversation with Craig Conroy |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl] The lockout wiped out the first year of the deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20 goal mark for the third time and 60 points for the second time in his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second time, playing in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five points for the eighth place Americans.
Conroy struggled under new coach Marc Crawford early in the 2006–07 season, falling to five goals and sixteen points in 52 games for the Kings before he was traded back to the Flames on January 29, 2007, in exchange for Jamie Lundmark and two draft picks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=baf20a29-fac4-4bcc-bdca-9cce215ac864 |title=Conroy back with Flames |publisher=Canwest News Service |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] An emotional Conroy, who said he was happy to return to Calgary, scored two goals the following night in his second debut with the Flames to defeat his former Kings teammates, 4–1.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16897736/ |title=Kings already burned by Conroy trade |publisher=MSNBC Sports |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] Conroy finished the season by scoring 21 points in 28 games for Calgary, then scored 34 points in 2007–08.
The Flames re-signed Conroy to a new contract prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/06/27/flames-signings.html |title=Langkow, Conroy among Flames re-signed |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=b10df975-eef8-4199-9c90-f42b7cd1b791 |title=Conroy to sport 'A' for Flames' season opener |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] He scored his 500th career point on January 3, 2009, when he assisted on Todd Bertuzzi's game-winning goal in a 3–2 win against the Nashville Predators,[tpl]cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=290103027 |title=Flames' Bertuzzi breaks tie vs. Preds with 23.4 seconds left |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-01-03 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] and finished the year with 48 points. The 2009–10 NHL season proved a difficult one for Conroy, as he scored only three goals and twelve assists during a season shortened by wrist and knee injures along with a broken foot.[tpl]cite web |last=Busby |first=Ian |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/sports/hockey/2010/02/25/13018776-calsun.html |title=Flames back at it |work=Calgary Sun |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] He returned for another season as the Flames re-signed him to a one-year, two-way contract for the league minimum of $500,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=330242 |title=Flames sign Conroy to one-year contract |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2010-10-31[/tpl] At 39-years-old, Conroy played his 1,000th NHL game, against the Colorado Avalanche, on October 28, 2010. Only Grant Ledyard was older (age 40) when he reached that milestone.
Conroy played only nine more games after passing the milestone, and last played on December 20 against the Minnesota Wild. A healthy scratch in 32 of 50 games, and 28 of his final 29, Conroy was waived on January 25, 2011. After going unclaimed, he was left with the option of joining Calgary's AHL affiliate in Abbotsford or retiring.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=351317 |title=Conroy considering retirement after clearing waivers |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2011-01-28[/tpl] One week later, on February 4, 2011, Conroy formally announced his retirement and accepted a management position with the Flames organization, becoming the special assistant to general manager Jay Feaster.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2011/02/04/sp-conroy-status.html |title=Conroy retires, moves to Flames front office |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-04[/tpl]

==Off the ice==

Conroy has a wife, Jessie, and three daughters, Taylor, Sophia and Sydney. Conroy and his family chose to remain in Calgary following his retirement as a player, though they had considered other options including returning to his home town of Potsdam.[tpl]cite web |last=Odland |first=Kristen |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Conroy+clan+happy+stay+Calgary/4228380/story.html |title=Conroy clan happy to stay in Calgary |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
