Snes9x is an SNES emulator written in C++ with official ports for Linux, Microsoft Windows, AmigaOS 4, Mac OS X, MorphOS, iOS, PSP, and Android. Both Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 have an unofficial port named Snes8x.

==Background==

Development of Snes9x began in July 1997 when Snes96's Gary Henderson and Snes97's Jerremy Koot merged their respective emulators to create Snes9x. Since then, Snes9x has been unofficially ported to more platforms than any other emulator. The emulator does not meet the Free Software Foundation's free software definition or the Open Source Initiative's open source definition, since it is a violation of the license to sell Snes9x, and both definitions prohibit restrictions of use or discrimination against fields of endeavor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snes9x.com/journal.asp |title=Snes9x.COM: Developers Journal |publisher=snes9x.com |accessdate=March 27, 2012[/tpl] It is still being actively developed despite the departure of its original developers.
