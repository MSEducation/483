Orber Moreno Aquiles mo-RAY-noh (born April 27, 1977) is a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. Moreno last played in the majors for the New York Mets (2003â€“2004). Previously, Moreno played for the Kansas City Royals (1999). He bats and throws right-handed.
Moreno throws a sharp slider, a changeup, a cutter and has a good command of his low-90s fastball. Moreno made his debut in the 1999 season, ranking as one of the top Royals prospects, but he injured his arm in an off-field accident and aggravated it by pitching. He had surgery performed and rehabbed in the Triple-A in 2002, and then he showed up out of shape from the long layoff. He was released and signed with the Mets before the 2003 season.
In January 2008, Moreno signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers, but was released during spring training. In February 2010, Moreno signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/02/odds-ends--6.html
