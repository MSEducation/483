[[Statute of Autonomy]]

CATEGORIES: Statutes of Autonomy

Nominally, a Statute of Autonomy ([tpl]lang-es|Estatuto de Autonomía[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ca|Estatut d'Autonomia[/tpl], [tpl]lang-gl|Estatuto de Autonomía[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ast|Estatutu d' Autonomía[/tpl], [tpl]lang-eu|Autonomia Estatutua[/tpl]) is a law hierarchically located under the constitution of a country, and over any other form of legislation (including organic laws). This legislative corpus concedes autonomy (self-government) to a subnational unit, and the articles usually mimic the form of a constitution, establishing the organization of the autonomous government, the electoral rules, the distribution of competences between different levels of governance and other regional-specific provisions, like the protection of cultural or lingual realities.
In Spain, the process of devolution after the transition to democracy (1979) created 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, each having its own Statute of Autonomy. On June 18, 2006, Catalonia approved in referendum a new but controversial Catalan Statute of Autonomy, enhancing the degree of autonomy of this Spanish territory.
