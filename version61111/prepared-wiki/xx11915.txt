CATEGORIES: Transport in Western Sahara

Transport in Western Sahara is very limited, mostly by sea, road and air.

==Rail==

Western Sahara has no freight or passenger service railways, with the exception of a [tpl]Convert|5|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] section of the Mauritania Railway; which (since the closure of the Choum Tunnel), cuts across the extreme south-eastern corner of the territory. 

==Roads==

There are only [tpl]Convert|6200|km|mi[/tpl] of roads, of which [tpl]Convert|1350|km|mi[/tpl] are metalled.
A small network of highways provide limited ground travel connections. N1 highway is a major roadway traversing along the  Atlantic coastline of the country. There are a few roads in the north and only two roads in the south that branches off of N1.
All other roads are local ones in the various cities and towns.

==Ports==

Ports include:
The longest conveyor belt in the world is [tpl]Convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune.

==Airports==

There are 6 airfields, 3 with paved runways and 3 unpaved surfaces, and one helipad (military in Cape Bojador). Hassan I Airport is an international airport, but the carriers at the airport connect only to regional destinations (to Morocco or the Canary Islands).

==Buses==

There are only 4 companies licensed to use buses in Western Sahra which are: CTM, Supratours, Satas and Sat
CTM and Supratours buses have daily travels from Dakhla to Marrakech via Laayoune and Agadir
