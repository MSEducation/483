[[Labia majora]]

CATEGORIES: Mammal female reproductive system

The labia majora (singular: labium majus) are two prominent longitudinal cutaneous folds that extend downward and backward from the mons pubis to the perineum. The labia majora is homologous to the male scrotum.

==Embryology==

Embryologically, they develop from labioscrotal folds.Manual of Obstetrics. (3rd ed.). Elsevier. pp. 1-16. ISBN 9788131225561.

==Anatomy==

The labia majora constitute the lateral boundaries of the pudendal cleft, which contains the labia minora, interlabial sulci, clitoral hood, clitoral glans, frenulum clitoridis, the Hart's Line, and the vulval vestibule, which contains the external openings of the urethra and the vagina. Each labium majus has two surfaces, an outer, pigmented and covered with strong, crisp hairs; and an inner, smooth and beset with large  sebaceous follicles. Between the two there is a considerable quantity of  areolar tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling the dartos tunic of the scrotum, besides vessels, nerves, and glands. The labia majora are thicker in front, where they form by their meeting the  anterior commisure of the labia majora. Posteriorly, they are not really joined, but appear to become lost in the neighboring integument, ending close to, and nearly parallel to, each other. Together with the connecting skin between them, they form the posterior commisure of the labia majora or posterior boundary of the pudendum. The interval between the posterior commissure of the labia majora and the  anus, from 2.5 to 3Â cm. in length, constitutes the perineum. Between the labia majora and the inner thighs are the labiocrural folds. Between the labia majora and labia minora are the  interlabial sulci. Labia majora atrophy after menopause.

==Use in grafting==

The fat pad of the labia majora can be used as a graft, often as a so-called "Martius labial fat pad graft", and can be used, for example, in urethrolysis.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0090-4295(03)00117-1[/tpl]
