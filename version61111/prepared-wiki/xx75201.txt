The ackee, also known as achee, akee apple or akee (Blighia sapida) is a member of the Sapindaceae (soapberry family), as are the lychee and the longan. It is native to tropical West Africa in Cameroon, Gabon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?7271 |title=Taxon: Blighia sapida K.

The scientific name honours Captain William Bligh who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England in 1793 and introduced it to science. The common name is derived from the West African Akan akye fufo.[tpl]cite book | first=Allan | last=Metcalf | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1999 | title=The World in So Many Words | edition= | publisher= | location= | isbn=0-395-95920-9 [/tpl]
The fruit was imported to Jamaica from West Africa (probably on a slave ship) before 1778.[tpl]cite web | author= | year=| title=This is Jamaica | work=National Symbols of Jamaica | url= http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/symbols.html | accessdate=2006-06-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060619153047/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/symbols.html| archivedate= 19 June 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  Since then it has become a major feature of various Caribbean cuisines, and is also cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas elsewhere around the world.

==Botany==

Ackee is an evergreen tree that grows about 10 metres tall, with a short trunk and a dense crown. 
The leaves are pinnate,[tpl]cite book | author1=Vinken Pierre | author2=Bruyn, GW | year=1995 | title=Intoxications of the Nervous System | edition= | publisher=Elsevier Science B.V. | location=Amsterdam, Netherlands | isbn=0-444-81284-9 [/tpl] leathery, compound, [tpl]convert|15|–|30|cm[/tpl] long, with 6–10 elliptical obovate-oblong leaflets. Each leaflet is [tpl]convert|8|–|12|cm[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|5|–|8|cm[/tpl] broad.
The flowers are unisexual and fragrant. They have five petals, are greenish-white[tpl]cite book | first=Robert | last=Riffle | year=1998 | title=The Tropical Look | edition= | publisher= Timber Press| location= | isbn=0-88192-422-9 [/tpl] and bloom during warm months.[tpl]cite book | first=Kristen | last=Llamas | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=2003 | title=Tropical Flowering Plants: A Guide to Identification and Cultivation | edition= | publisher= Timber Press | location= | isbn=0-88192-585-3 [/tpl] 
The fruit is pear-shaped. When it ripens, it turns from green to a bright red to yellow-orange, and splits open to reveal three large, shiny black seeds, surrounded by soft, creamy or spongy, white to yellow flesh—arilli. The fruit typically weighs [tpl]convert|100|–|200|g[/tpl].

==Cultivation and uses==

Although native to West Africa, the use of ackee in food is especially prominent in Jamaican cuisine. Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica, and ackee and saltfish is the national dish. Ackee and codfish is ranked number two in the world by National Geographic survey of national dishes. Recently, ackee wine has been introduced in Jamaica and though it has resulted in a majority of curious and adventurous Jamaicans gravitating towards the newly introduced product it still has not appealed to others.http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/ National food dishes[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Independence/symbols.html |title=National Symbols |work=Emancipation & Independence |publisher=Jamaica Information Service |accessdate=2011-10-18[/tpl]
Ackee was introduced to Jamaica and later to Haiti, Cuba, Barbados and others. It was later introduced to Florida in the United States.   
Ackee pods are allowed to ripen on the tree before picking. Prior to cooking, the ackee arils are cleaned and washed. The arils are then boiled for approximately 5 minutes and the water discarded. The dried seeds, fruit, bark, and leaves are used medicinally.[tpl]cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= | date= |url=http://mansfeld.ipk-gatersleben.de/Mansfeld/Taxonomy/datenvoll.afp?module=mf&source=botnam&taxid=6907&akzanz=0&rehm=0 |title=Mansfeld's World Database of Agricultural and Horticultural Crops |work= |pages= |publisher= |accessdate=2006-06-01 |curly= [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Toxicity==

The unripened or inedible portions of the fruit contain the toxins hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B. Hypoglycin A is found in both the seeds and the arils, while hypoglycin B is found only in the seeds. Hypoglycin is converted in the body to methylenecyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA). Hypoglycin and MCPA are both toxic. MCPA inhibits several enzymes involved in the breakdown of acyl CoA compounds. Hypoglycin binds irreversibly to coenzyme A, carnitine and carnitine acyltransferases I and II[tpl]cite book | first= Parveen J.| last= Kumar | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=2006 | title= Clinical Medicine | edition= 5| publisher=Saunders (W.B.) Co Ltd | location= | isbn=978-0-7020-2579-2 [/tpl] reducing their bioavailability and consequently inhibiting beta oxidation of fatty acids. Beta oxidation normally provides the body with ATP, NADH, and acetyl CoA which is used to supplement the energy produced by glycolysis. Glucose stores are consequently depleted leading to hypoglycemia.[tpl]cite book | first= Vishwanath | last= SarDesai | title=Introduction to Clinical Nutrition | publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc. | location=New York | year=2003 | isbn=0-8247-4093-9[/tpl] Clinically, this condition is called Jamaican vomiting sickness. Ill effects occur only when the immature fruit is consumed.THE ACKEE FRUIT (BLIGHIA SAPIDA) AND ITS ASSOCIATED TOXIC EFFECTS, The Science Creative Quarterly

==Economic importance==

The ackee fruit is canned and is a major export product in Jamaica. In 2005, the ackee industry of Jamaica was valued at $400 million.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]  The importing of canned ackee into the U.S. has at times been restricted due to unripe ackee arilli being included. However, it is currently allowed, provided that the amount of hypoglycin present meets the standards of the Food and Drug Administration.
In 2005, the first commercial shipments of canned ackee from Haiti were approved by the United States FDA for shipment to the US market.
A canning plant in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is supplied with fruit from three commercial orchards on the outskirts of the city.
