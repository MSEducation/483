Note: Due to the postponement of Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Election 2013, there will be no set of SK Chairperson each barangay. Hence, there will be no election of officers for the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation Butuan City Chapter. Thus, the position will remain vacant until SK Election will be rescheduled.http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=Elections/2013BarangaySK/res/res9791
