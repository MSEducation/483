==Early life==

Born in New York City, Adler's parents, Henrietta Jacobson and Julius Adler, and his two maternal uncles, Irving and Hymie Jacobson were well-established popular stars of the Yiddish theatre, at the time in its heyday on New York's Lower East Side. Adler made his stage debut at an early age, appearing with his parents. The three Adlers played the London Palladium with Sophie Tucker in the 1950s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-04-10/entertainment/3611303_1_yiddish-theater-molly-picon-vaudeville|title=Yiddish theater star revels in the colorful continuity of his ethnic roots|date=10 April 2005|author=Outwater, Myra Yellin|publisher=Morning Call|accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] He continued to appear in Yiddish theatre throughout his teens, also appearing in mainstream American theatre as his parents made a similar "crossover," most notably appearing in productions of Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn.

In a review of Adler's one-man show Song and Dance Man, New York Times critic Richard F. Shepard wrote, "What is there that this man can't do? He kazotskys, he soft shoes, he fandangos...He makes the oldest jokes fresh and funny!...It is impossible to watch him without being seized by his infectious spirit, his complete enjoyment in what he is doing...he brings performing brilliance to the stage!"
