==Early life==

Statham was born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, England, the son of Eileen (née Yates), a dancer, and Barry Statham, a street seller and lounge singer.[tpl]Cite news|last=Khayyat|first=Oday|title=Fast Action Hero|publisher=NOX|publication-date=January 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20111113140420/http://www.nox-mag.com/article/Fast+Action+Hero+/ | archivedate=2011-11-13 | deadurl = yes | url=http://www.nox-mag.com/article/Fast+Action+Hero+/|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|coauthors=|title=STATHAM, Jason|publisher=BFI|year=2010|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/784287|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/fashion/03NITE.html | work=The New York Times | first=Monica | last=Corcoran | title=Action Bloke | date=3 September 2006[/tpl] He moved to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he initially chose not to follow his father's career working the local market stalls and decided to pursue the arts. He grew up with football player Vinnie Jones, alongside whom he would later go on to act. Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the local grammar school (1978–1983), which he had attended since the age of 11, a passion that he shared with diving.[tpl]cite web|title=Jason Statham Bio|url=http://www.dirt.com/jason-statham-bio/|work=dirt.com|publisher=www.dirt.com|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=www.dirt.com|date=14 June 2012[/tpl] He practised daily in perfecting his diving techniques, and was a member of Britain's National Diving Squad for twelve years.[tpl]cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article4860979.ece |work=The Times |location=UK | accessdate=8 June 2009 | title=Jason Statham, last action hero | date=5 October 2008 | first=Chrissy | last=Iley  [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/all-action/2008/07/12/1215658193266.html | title=All action | first=Helen | last=Barlow | date=13 July 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=1 November 2009 [/tpl]
Statham's life in the media began when he was spotted by the agency Sports Promotions specialising in sports modelling while he was training at London's Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. Afterwards, he became a model for the clothing brand French Connection. A spokesperson for the high street clothing chain said: "We chose Jason because we wanted our model to look like a normal guy. His look is just right for now: very masculine and not too male-modelly." However, he was still forced to follow in his father's footsteps as a street seller to make ends meet, selling "fake perfume and jewellery on street corners" according to Statham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD7qdNqozOs|title=Today Show Interview Jason Statham|publisher=Today Show|accessdate=11 March 2013[/tpl] He made small appearances in a few music videos including Comin' On Strong by The Shamen in 1993, Run to the Sun by Erasure in 1994 and Dream a Little Dream of Me by The Beautiful South in 1995.

==Career==

While working as a model for French Connection, he was introduced to fledgling British director Guy Ritchie[tpl]cite web|title=Jason Statham|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/celeb_profiles_entertainment/19_jason_statham.html|work=AskMen|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=AskMen|year=1996–2012[/tpl]  who was developing a film project and needed to fill the role of a street-wise con artist. After learning about Statham's past as a black market salesman, Ritchie cast him to play the role of "Bacon" in his 1998 Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.[tpl]cite web|title=Jason Statham|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342545|work=Filmbug|publisher=MISJA.COM|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Filmbug|year=1998–2012[/tpl] The movie was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped catapult Statham into the public eye. Statham's second collaboration with Ritchie came in the 2000 film Snatch, playing the role of "Turkish". Cast alongside popular actors Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio del Toro, and with the movie earning more than $80 million in box-office revenue, Statham was able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two movies in 2001: Ghosts of Mars and The One.
Statham was offered more film roles, and in 2002 he was cast as the lead role of driver Frank Martin in the action movie The Transporter, in which he was responsible for his own stunts (Statham has made this choice for all of his films).[tpl]cite web|title=10 Most Popular Actors Who Do Their Own Stunts|url=http://www.tiptoptens.com/2011/05/18/10-most-popular-actors-who-do-their-own-stunts/|work=Tip Top Tens|publisher=Tip Top Tens|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Sidrah Zaheer|year=2011[/tpl] He has studied Wing Chun kung fu, karate, and kickboxing.Jason Statham interview USAToday.com, 10 October 2002. The film spawned two sequels, Transporter 2 (2005) and Transporter 3 (2008).
He also played supporting roles in Mean Machine (2002), The Italian Job (2003) (in which he played Handsome Rob), and Cellular (2004) in which he played the lead villain. In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new project, Revolver, which was a critical and box office failure.
He played a dramatic role in the independent film London in 2006. That same year he played the lead role as Chev Chelios in the action film Crank which spawned the sequel Crank: High Voltage (2009).
In 2008, Statham starred in the British crime thriller The Bank Job and Death Race, a remake of Death Race 2000 (1975). American film critic Armond White hailed Statham's ascension as the leading international action film star. On the occasion of Death Race, White championed Statham's "best track record of any contemporary movie star."[tpl]cite web|last=White |first=Armond |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-19048-transcendent-thrill-drive.html |title=Transcendent Thrill Drive |publisher=Nypress.com |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] Later in 2008, White praised Statham's Transporter 3 as a great example of kinetic pop art.thumb|180px|left|Statham in 2006.
In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples (12 Monkeys). Statham stated "We've got a movie we're trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It’s not a remake or anything, but it's a little bit like that, about relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working title is The Grabbers."[tpl]cite news| last = Sampson| first = Thomas| title = Jason Statham up for The Grabbers| publisher=The Hollywood News| date = 17 September 2008| url = http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/artman2/publish/movie_news/Jason-Statham-up-for-The-Grabbers-26170908.php| accessdate =26 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li and Mickey Rourke, among others in The Expendables.

In 2011, Statham starred in the remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film, The Mechanic, and returned to British film in the police drama Blitz.
He also starred in the action film Killer Elite. The film was based on real events, which were the subject of Sir Ranulph Fiennes' fictional novel The Feather Men. Statham played an assassin named Danny who comes out of retirement to save an old friend, who was played by Robert De Niro.[tpl]cite news | last=Swart | first=Sharon | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003668.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2564 | title=Jason Statham embraces 'Killer Elite' | newspaper=Variety | date=14 May 2009 | accessdate=19 August 2010 [/tpl] In August 2011, he began filming Parker for director Taylor Hackford; the film was released in January 2013.
