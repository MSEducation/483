Founded in 1565, by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a captaincy of the Portuguese Empire. It later, in 1793, became the capital of the State of Brazil, a State of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. It subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960.

==History==

Europeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on January 1, 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, "January River"), by a Portuguese expedition under explorer Gaspar de Lemos captain of a ship in Pedro Álvares Cabral's fleet, or under Gonçalo Coelho.Jorge Couto, 1995, A Construção do Brasil, Lisbon: Cosmos. Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci participated as observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same expedition. The region of Rio was inhabited by the Tupi, Puri, Botocudo and Maxakalí peoples.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bairrodocatete.com.br/tamoios.html |title=índios Rio |publisher=Bairrodocatete.com.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony.
The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded by the Portuguese on March 1, 1565 and was named São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, in honor of St. Sebastian, the saint who was the namesake and patron of the then Portuguese Monarch D. Sebastião. Rio de Janeiro was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several, mostly French, pirates and buccaneers, such as Jean-François Duclerc and René Duguay-Trouin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |title=History of Rio |publisher=Paralumun.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes found gold and diamonds in the neighboring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, which is much farther to the northeast. And so in 1763, the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro. The kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of Europe. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u372084.shtml |title=Real Portuguese Family in Rio |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/africa_civiliza.html |title=A África civiliza |publisher=Multirio.rj.gov.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
When Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his new empire. Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.
Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighborhood now known as the historic Downtown business district (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's center of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains located between Botafogo and the neighborhood now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905.Boone, Christopher G. 1995. Streetcars and Politics in Rio de Janeiro: Private Enterprise versus Municipal Government in Mass Transit Delivery, 1903–1920. Journal of Latin American Studies 27: 343–365. Botafogo's natural beauty, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (though, this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14700720|title=Drugs and violence in Rio: The bottom line|accessdate=January 21, 2010|date=October 22, 2009|work=The Economist[/tpl][tpl]Subscription[/tpl]). Plans for moving the nation's capital city to the territorial centre had been occasionally discussed, and when Juscelino Kubitschek was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital.Juscelino Kubitschek and the city of Rio de Janeiro[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] Though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Brasília built, at great cost, by 1960. On April 21 that year the capital of Brazil was officially moved from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília.
Between 1960 and 1975, Rio was a city-state under the name Guanabara State (after the bay it borders). However, for administrative and political reasons, a presidential decree known as "The Fusion" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the State of Rio de Janeiro, the territory surrounding the city whose capital was Niterói, in 1975. Even today, some Cariocas advocate the return of municipal autonomy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rumoaocap.kit.net/autonomia.htm |title=Cariocas and Municipal Autonomy |publisher=Rumoaocap.kit.net |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.sirkis.com.br/noticia.kmf?noticia=4494037&canal=276&total=44&indice=10 |title=Carioca Dream and Autonomy |publisher=.sirkis.com.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
The city hosted the 2007 Pan American Games and will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. It was announced on October 2, 2009, that Rio will host the 2016 Olympic Games, beating the finalist competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city will become the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil.

==Geography==

Rio de Janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of Brazil's Atlantic coast (between a strait east to Ilha Grande, on the Costa Verde, and the Cabo Frio), close to the Tropic of Capricorn, where the shoreline is oriented east–west. Facing largely south, the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast, Guanabara Bay (Baía de Guanabara), and its entrance is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar)—a "calling card" of the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |title=Where is Rio de Janeiro? |publisher=Riobrazilblog.com |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]
The Centre (Centro), the core of Rio, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone (Zona Norte), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, reaching the beaches fringing the open sea, is cut off from the Centre and from the North Zone by coastal mountains. These mountains and hills are offshoots of the Serra do Mar to the northwest, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the Brazilian Highlands. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste), long cut off by the mountainous terrain, had been made more easily accessible by those on the South Zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century.Rio de Janeiro — History.com Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]

It was Brazil's capital until 1960, when Brasília took its place. Residents of the city are known as cariocas. The official song of Rio is "Cidade Maravilhosa", by composer André Filho.

===Climate===

Rio has a tropical savannah climate (Aw ) that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate (Am ) according to the Köppen climate classification, and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain from December to March.Rio de Janeiro Destination Guide from The Weather Channel. Retrieved December 2, 2007. In inland areas of the city, temperatures above [tpl]convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above [tpl]convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] can occur on a monthly basis.
Along the coast, the breeze, blowing  onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached, especially during autumn and winter, by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, causing frequent weather changes. It is mostly in summer that strong showers provoke catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.Rio de Janeiro Weather Forecast & Climate - Weather In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
It is said that the city had frost in its past, but it was never confirmed. Some areas within Rio de Janeiro state have snow grains and ice pellets with an even frequency (popularly called granizo, or "hail", although it is in fact melted and refrozen snow falling in the form of a ball—true hail, rather than just icy snow along showers, is much less common). These phenomena are definitely not rare or limited to a few regions, happening in the metropolitan area (including western suburbs of the city itself) at least three times in the 21st century,[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news| url=http://globotv.globo.com/globo-news/jornal-globo-news/v/chuva-de-granizo-atinge-zona-oeste-e-baixada-fluminense-do-rio/1853797/|title=Hail falls in Rio de Janeiro's West Zone and Baixada Fluminense |publisher=Globo News|date=2012-03-12 | accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]pt icon[/tpl] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2c-u7vOEdk Little hail shower – Nova Iguaçu, February 18th, 2013[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] 40-minute long granizo fall of February 23rd, 2013 destroys club and causes harm in at least 13 neighborhoods of Queimados, RJ said to be approximately each two decades or less in some regions.

Temperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. Winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (in the form of winds from the Amazon Forest), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an extratropical cyclone) and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over [tpl]convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual temperature feeling is over [tpl]convert|50|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high.[tpl]cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1502179-5606,00-COM+SENSACAO+TERMICA+DE+C+CARIOCAS+SE+REFUGIAM+DO+CALOR+NAS+PRAIAS.html|title=Com sensação térmica de 48°C, cariocas se refugiram do calor nas praias|trans_title=Feeling like 48°C, cariocas bathe in beaches trying to escape from the heat|publisher=G1|date=23 February 2010|accessdate=25 June 2013|language=Portuguese[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/sensa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-t%C3%A9rmica-rio-de-janeiro-chega-a-50-233457951.html|title=Sensação térmica no Rio de Janeiro chega a 50°C nesta terça-feira|trans_title=Rio de Janeiro will be feeling like 50°C this Tuesday|publisher=Yahoo!

There is also a slightly greater seasonal difference in the incidence of solar radiation people receive in Rio de Janeiro (or about anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere) in comparison to places in the Northern Hemisphere with similar climate and the same exact latitude as the Earth most closely approaches Sol (the local Sun) only 12 days after the Southern Hemisphere's summer solstice.

The wettest and driest months tend to be December and August respectively.

==City districts==

The city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), Santa Cruz and Campo Grande and the wealthy newer American-style Barra da Tijuca district.

===Downtown===

([tpl]Coord|22|54|19.4112|S|43|10|37.6608|W|scale:15000_region:BR|name=Downtown[/tpl])
Centro or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its financial centre. Sites of interest include the Paço Imperial, built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the Candelária Church, (the former cathedral), Sao Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, San Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Antonio and Sao Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral.  Around the Cinelândia square, there are several landmarks of the Belle Époque of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building. Among its several museums, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the Museu Histórico Nacional (National Historical Museum) are the most important. Other important historical attractions in central Rio include its Passeio Público, an 18th-century public garden. Major streets include Avenida Rio Branco and Avenida Vargas, both constructed, in 1906 and 1942 respectively, by destroying large swaths of the colonial city. A number of colonial streets, such as Rua do Ouvidor and Uruguayana, have long been pedestrian spaces, and the popular Saara shopping district has been pedestrianized more recently.

===South Zone===

([tpl]Coord|22.974199|S|43.199444|W|scale:75000_region:BR|name=South Zone[/tpl])
The South Zone of Rio de Janeiro ([tpl]lang-pt|Zona Sul[/tpl]) is composed of several districts, among which are São Conrado, Leblon, Ipanema, Arpoador, Copacabana, and Leme, which compose Rio's famous Atlantic beach coastline. Other districts in the South Zone are Glória, Catete, Flamengo, Botafogo, and Urca, which border Guanabara Bay and Santa Teresa, Cosme Velho, Laranjeiras, Humaitá, Lagoa, Jardim Botânico, and Gávea.
It is the wealthiest part of the city and the best known overseas; the neighborhood of Leblon in particular has the most expensive real estate in all of South America.
The neighbourhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties ("Reveillon"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. As of 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.Rio Reveillon[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of Urca and the Sugarloaf Mountain ('Pão de Açúcar'), whose name describes the famous mountain rising out of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage cable car trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views second only to Corcovado mountain.
Hang gliding is a popular activity on the Pedra Bonita (literally, "Beautiful Rock"). After a short flight, gliders land on the Praia do Pepino (Pepino, or "cucumber", Beach) in São Conrado.
Since 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is also located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityreporting.org/index.php?pageId=sub&lang=pt_BR&currentItem=article&docId=18381&c=Brasil&cRef=Brazil&year=2006&date=abril%202005 |title=Poluição afeta Pedra Branca |publisher=O Globo|accessdate=July 18, 2007|date=April 2005|language=Portuguese|first=Daniel Ernesto|last=Engelbrecht Ferreira[/tpl] The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the edge of the forest, in the Gávea district.

===North Zone===

The North Zone ([tpl]lang-pt|Zona Norte[/tpl]) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial bairro of Tijuca and its surrounding neighbourhoods and favelas), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until Baixada Fluminense and the city's Northwest.
This region is home to the Maracanã stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity football (soccer) venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did the World Cup final of 1950. In modern times its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000 fans; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracanã was site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football/soccer competition of the 2007 Pan American Games, and will host the final match of 2014 FIFA World Cup and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football matches of the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Besides Maracanã, the North Zone of Rio also holds other tourist and historical attractions, such as 'Manguinhos', the home of Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, a centenarian biomedical research institution with a main building fashioned like a Moorish palace, and the beautiful Quinta da Boa Vista, the park where the historic Imperial Palace is located. Nowadays, the palace hosts the National Museum, specialising in Natural History, Archaeology, and Ethnology.
The International Airport of Rio de Janeiro (Galeão – Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport, named after the famous Brazilian musician Antônio Carlos Jobim), the main campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at the Fundão Island, and the State University of Rio de Janeiro, in Maracanã, are also located in the Northern part of Rio.
This region is also home to most of the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Império Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, among others. Some of the main neighbourhoods of Rio's North Zone are Tijuca, which shares the Tijuca Rainforest with the South and Southwest Zones; Água Santa, Vila Isabel, Méier, São Cristovão, Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fundão, among others.
Many of the Rio de Janeiro's roughly 1000 shantytowns, or favelas, which makes it resembling many other cities in underdeveloped and developing countries, are located in Zona Norte."Reinventing Rio"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Reinventing-Rio.html, Alan Riding, Sept. 2010, Smithsonian

===West Zone===

The West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro makes up about 50% of the city area. It has two areas with very different characteristics: the southern part of West Zone is a rich area, considered an extension of the South Zone. The northern part of the West Zone is a suburb, considered an extension of the North Zone.
West Zone's south—Barra da Tijuca region
This area is the most recently modernized region of Rio de Janeiro. It includes Barra da Tijuca, Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Vargem Grande, Vargem Pequena, Grumari, Jacarepaguá as well minor neighbourhoods close to those cited here. There is a clear social contrast between this area and the Campo Grande/Santa Cruz area. Nevertheless, this area has its own favelas, such as Cidade de Deus, outlying the middle and upper class areas.
Westwards from the older zones of Rio, Barra da Tijuca is a flat complex of barrier islands of formerly undeveloped coastal land, which constantly experience new constructions and developments. It remains an area of accelerated growth, attracting some of the richer sectors of the population as well as luxury companies. High rise flats and sprawling shopping centers give the area a far more American feel than the crowded city centre.
The urban planning of the area, made in the late 1960s, resembles that of United States suburbs, through mixing zones of single-family houses with residential skyscrapers. The beaches of Barra da Tijuca are also popular with the city's residents. Barra da Tijuca is the home of Pan-American Village built for the 2007 Pan American Games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rio2016.org.br/en/Noticias/Noticia.aspx?idConteudo=428 |title=Bid Rio 2016 |publisher=Rio2016.org.br |accessdate=May 6, 2009[/tpl]
The highest hill in Rio is Pedra Branca peak (Pico da Pedra Branca), in Barra da Tijuca region, and one of the most famous hills in the city is the 842 metres (2,762 ft) high Pedra da Gávea (Crow's nest Rock) near South Zone. On the top of its summit is a huge rock formation (some, such as Erich von Däniken in his 1973 book, "In Search of Ancient Gods", claim it to be a sculpture) resembling a sphinx-like, bearded head that is visible for many kilometers around.
This is the area of the City that will hold most of the sports venues and competitions during the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. It will be home to the Olympic Village, Olympic Beach, and Olympic Park as well.
West Zone's north—Campo Grande/Santa Cruz region
This area is separated from the Barra da Tijuca by the Maciço da Pedra Branca and the Serra da Grota Funda. It has exhibited economic growth, mainly in the Campo Grande neighborhood. New industrial enterprises are being built in contemporarily lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous Rio de Janeiro's neighbourhoods, most notably Companhia Siderúrgica do Atlântico (CSA), a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, planned to be South America's largest steel works.CSA's steel mill is going to generate 18 thousand jobs in Rio de Janeiro's West Zone
A tunnel called Túnel da Grota Funda, projected to open to traffic until May 2012, will diminish the time of access to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro and creat a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz.Grota Funda's tunel: How can be the future's (suburban) feelings in Rio? — Veja Rio: As ruas do Rio

==Demographics==

According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro.2010 IGBE Census [tpl]pt icon[/tpl] The census revealed the following numbers: 3,234,812 White people (51.2%), 2,307,104 Pardo (mixed) people (36.5%), 724,197 Black people (11.5%), 46,484 East Asian people (0.7%), 6,320 Amerindian people (0.1%).2010 IGBE Census [tpl]pt icon[/tpl]
In 2010, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the 2nd most populous city in Brazil, after São Paulo.[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] The largest Brazilian cities - 2010 IBGE Census
In 2010, the city had 1,200,697 opposite-sex couples and 5,612 same-sex couples (see more at LGBT rights in Brazil). The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.
Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different indigenous peoples speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the French were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |title=Tem índio no Rio |publisher=Paginas.terra.com.br |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070813071626/http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |archivedate=August 13, 2007[/tpl]
Rio de Janeiro is home to the largest Portuguese population outside of Lisbon in Portugal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogluso-carioca.blogspot.com/2006/07/hospedaria-do-emigrante-em-so-paulo.html |title=Portuguese in Brazil and Rio |publisher=Blogluso-carioca.blogspot.com |date=July 29, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.pt/brasil2008/?idc=166&idi=13879 |title=Portuguese descent in the city of Rio de janeiro and Brazil |publisher=Presidencia.pt |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/portugueses.html |title=Brasil 500 anos |publisher=.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080523211354/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/portugueses.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008[/tpl] The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language—almost every person native to Brazil with some cultural contact with Rio and its inhabitants knows how to easily differentiate between fluminense and other Brazilian dialects.
People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39,74% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46,30% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20,36% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30,84%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51,20% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267664 people in 1890.http://books.google.com.br/books?id=QPDe42CBSeMC&pg=PA107&dq=endogamia+italianos&hl=pt-BR&ei=D3QOToa-L4SugQey7diCDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=endogamia%20italianos&f=false
The black community was formed with residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola or Mozambique, as well as more people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city.
Today, nearly half of the city's population is perceptibly by phenotype black or part black,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |title=Brasil 500 anos |publisher=.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080518220742/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |archivedate=May 18, 2008[/tpl] and a wide majority has some recent Subsaharan ancestor—white in Brazil has more to do with European-looking phenotypes rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different "racial" categories,Parra et ali, Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140919/#id2601616 or actually in a skin color and phenotype continuum between pálido (branco) or fair-skinned, branco moreno or swarthy Caucasian, mestiço claro or lighter skinned multiracial, pardo (mixed race) or and negro or black. Race classifications as they are is known in the Anglosphere are not followed in Brazilian culture (at least for most of the population), which captures the concept of cor or "color", the continuous range of phenotypes, and as such perceptions that now most Brazilians are "black rather than white" according to the census data are erroneous in a cultural relativistic viewpoint. Pardo, for example, in popular usage includes those who are caboclos (mestizos), mulatos (mulattoes), cafuzos (zambos), juçaras (archaic term for tri-racials) and westernized Amerindians (which are called caboclos as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.
European and Amerindian ancestries also have overwhelming and wide majorities respectively in Rio de Janeiro's population despite any classifications in IBGE's standardized racial groups, thus there were a bi-directional impact of miscegenation (in minor degree, it also happened in other multicultural white-majority regions, at least in some regions of the United States—a hypodescent society where there were the phenomena of passing—as well Argentina, and it is common elsewhere in Latin America) in both white and black populations.
As a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, one may find in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area communities of Levantine Arabs (mostly Christian or Irreligious), Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese,[tpl]cite web|author=Agencia Brasil |url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/noticia/2011-03-11/consulado-do-japao-no-rio-disponibiliza-telefone-para-prestar-informacoes-sobre-pais |title=Consulado do Japão no Rio disponibiliza telefone para prestar informações sobre o país | Agencia Brasil |publisher=Agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br |date=2011-03-11 |accessdate=2011-09-15[/tpl] Jews, and people from different parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as colony's settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Espírito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, and people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, of diverse origins, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core in itself).
According to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro, the "pardos" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found out to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures.
"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo |publisher=Meionews.com.br |date=|accessdate=2011-09-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]

Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, according to 2009 researches from Fundação Getúlio Vargas (known as [tpl]lang-pt|Novo Mapa das Religiões[/tpl]), nowadays rank first among Brazilian peripheries in Irreligion percentage (23.68%), and it is also the least Roman Catholic among Brazilian metropolitan areas, and trails only Boa Vista among the least Roman Catholic (51–52%) Brazilian capitals (Rio de Janeiro state, 15.95%, simultaneously only trails Roraima, 19.39%, in Irreligion), while Rio de Janeiro city is also the fifth Brazilian capital in the percent of Irreligious population (13.33%), changing nearly nothing since 2000 (while the first, Boa Vista, has 21.16%).Roraima heads in Irreligion percentage ranking, Rio de Janeiro state is in #2 Data from Fundação Getúlio Vargas. [tpl]pt icon[/tpl]Piauí is the most Roman Catholic state in Brazil despite growth in Evangelicals, Pentecostals and other Protestants Data from FGV.

==Economy==

Rio de Janeiro has the second largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by São Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$ 201 billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.52%), followed by commerce (23.38%), industrial activities (11.06%) and agriculture (0.04%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://gold.dreab.com/p-Rio_de_Janeiro_%28city%29 |title=Rio de Janeiro %28city%29 |publisher=Gold.dreab.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]Rio - BCG [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
Benefiting from the federal capital position occupied by a long period (1763–1960), the town became a dynamic center administrative, financial, commercial and cultural. Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$ 187.374.116.000, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$ 11,786.[tpl]cite news|last=Economist|title=Comparing Brazilian states with countries|url=http://www.economist.com/content/compare-cabana|work=Magazine|publisher=Economist|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=August 30, 2011[/tpl] It concentrates 68% of the state's economic strength and 7.91% of all goods and services produced in the country.Rio's economy [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE. For many years brings together the second largest industrial hub of Brazil, with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemical, gas, chemical, textile, printing, publishing, pharmaceutical, beverages, cement and furniture. However, the last decades indicated a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is acquiring more and more shades of a major national hub of services and businesses.Economy of Rio [tpl]en icon[/tpl] The Stock Exchange of Rio de Janeiro (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845 and located in the central region.
Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econômica Federal and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). After the transfer of the capital to Brasília, in 1960, it kept attracting more companies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |title=History of economy |publisher=Ibge.gov.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] especially after the discovery of oil in the Campos Basin, which produces most of the total oil production of Brazil. This made many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. The headquarters of BNDES, an important state institution, is also in Rio de Janeiro. The city is also the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel.
Rio ranks second nationally in industrial production[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=17&i=P&c=793 |title=IBGE – Economy of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] and second financial and service center, trailing only São Paulo. The city's industries produce processed foods, chemicals, petroleum products, pharmaceuticals, metal products, ships, textiles, clothing, and furniture. The service sector dominates the economy, however, and includes banking and the second most active stock market in Brazil, the Bolsa da Valores do Brasil. Tourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life and the city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portalemfoco.com.br/artigos.php?pag=artigo&artigoid=150 |title=Tourism in Rio |publisher=Portalemfoco.com.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
Because it was once the national capital, Rio de Janeiro was chosen as the site for the headquarters of many private, national, multinational, and state corporations, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. Despite the transfer of the capital to Brasília, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area, including those of Petrobrás, the state oil company, and the National Economic and Social Development Bank, a federal investment bank.
A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the older industries of metallurgy, engineering, and printing and publishing. Other manufacturing sectors focus on the production of shipyard-related materials, apparel and footwear, textiles, nonmetallic mineral products, food and beverages, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.
To attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://agricultura.ruralbr.com.br/noticia/2010/09/rio-de-janeiro-sera-a-capital-do-petroleo-entre-os-dias-13-e-16-de-setembro-3035609.html |title=Rio de Janeiro será a capital do petróleo entre os dias 13 e 16 de setembro - Agricultura |RuralBR |publisher=Agricultura.ruralbr.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]
As with manufacturing, Rio is an important financial centre, second only to São Paulo in volume of business in financial markets and in banking. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the Centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504192/Rio-de-Janeiro/29045/Climate# |title=Economy of Rio |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organizações Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: Jornal do Brasil, O Dia, and Business Rio.

==Culture and contemporary life==

Rio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.Brazil and the City of Rio [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festivalfestivaldorio.com.br has been held annually since 1999.http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0001488/overview Rio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television.http://www.theoilcommunity.com/?cp=locTopic&op=categoryData&ly=loc&li=92&ti=19 Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include Blame it on Rio; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed Central Station by Walter Salles who is also one of Brazil's best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, Black Orpheus, which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include Elite Squad and City of God (2002 film).
Rio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the Theatro Municipal; the National Museum of Fine Arts; the Carmen Miranda Museum; the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden; the Imperial Square; the Brazilian Academy of Letters; the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro; and the Natural History Museum.

===Tourism and recreation===

Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82 million international tourists a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rio2016.org/en/news/news/rio-de-janeiro-is-the-main-tourist-destination-in-the-south-hemisphere|title=Rio de Janeiro is the main tourist destination in the South Hemisphere|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2010[/tpl] The city sports world-class hotels, approximately 80 kilometres of beachland, and the famous Corcovado and Sugarloaf mountains. While the city has in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.Rio [tpl]en icon[/tpl] The fact that Brasília replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that São Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial center during the 20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline. Rio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernise the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.[tpl]cite book|title=Worldwide destinations casebook: the geography of travel and tourism|first1=Brian G.|last1=Boniface|first2=Christopher P.|last2=Cooper|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|isbn=0-7506-6440-1|pages=233–35[/tpl]

===Literature===

After Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a European-style bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo's A Moreninha (1884) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune. Rio in recent year has had a scheme where adults aged 18 to 25 where made to have literacy tests and education.
The first notable work of realism focusing on the urban lower-middle class is Manuel Antônio de Almeida's Memórias de um sargento de milícias (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.[tpl]cite web|author=Piers Armstrong |url=http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521825334_CCOL0521825334A008 |title=Rio's novel history |publisher=Cco.cambridge.org |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was Machado de Assis, that is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literatureCandido; Antonio. (1970) Vários escritos. São Paulo: Duas Cidades. p.18. and considered the introducer of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881);Faraco, Carlos Emílio e Moura, Francisco Mato. Português Projetos. São Paulo: Editora Ática, 2009, p.227. he had commented and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time.Gledson, John. J. Machado de Assis, ficção e história. Rio de Janeiro: Paz e Terra, 1986, p.13. Much of his short stories and novels, like Quincas Borba (1891) and Dom Casmurro'' (1899), are placed in Rio.

====Libraries====

The Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/national-library.htm |title=National Library of Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] Located in Cinelândia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the "Count of Barca," including the 125 volume set of prints "Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the "Region of Prata;" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Dom Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of Os Lusíadas by Luis de Camões, published in 1584; two copies of the Mogúncia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bn.br/portal/ |title=Official website – National Library of Rio |publisher=Bn.br |date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
The Portuguese Royal jolie papillon is located at Rua Luís de Camões, in the Centro.

===Music===

The official song of Rio de Janeiro is "Cidade Maravilhosa", which means "marvelous city". The song is considered the "civic anthem" of Rio, and is always the favourite song during Rio's Carnival in February. Rio de Janeiro is a centre of the urban music movement in Brazil.Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–1995)." Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90
Rio was popularised by the hit song "Garota de Ipanema" (The Girl from Ipanema), composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes and recorded by Astrud Gilberto & João Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. It is also the main key song of the bossa nova, a musical genre that was born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is Funk Carioca. While samba music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of electronic music associated with the current US black music scene, including hip hop, modern soul, and house music."Sansone, Livio. "The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio." In Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 135–60. London: Routledge, 2002.
Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 after over 20 years of military authoritarian rule, and the subsequent end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgemlima.blogspot.com/2007/09/um-tapinha-di-ou-no-di-censura-na-msica.html |title=Music in the city |publisher=Georgemlima.blogspot.com |date=February 24, 2004 |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into various forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.Behague, Gerard. "Globalization/Modernization: Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–1995)" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90.

====Carnival====

Carnaval, is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40 days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had Bourbon and Austrian ancestors. Up until the time of the marchinhas, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music was more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous samba school (Escolas de Samba) parades in the sambadrome exhibition center and the popular blocos de carnaval, street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. The most famous ones are:
In 1840, the first Carnaval was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnaval is known as a historic root of Brazilian music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maria-brazil.org/mpb3.htm |title=Brazilian Music: Roots 3 |publisher=Maria-brazil.org |accessdate=May 6, 2009[/tpl]

Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is to high for the low quality of the services.

====Bus====

City buses are moderately priced and cost about R$3 to ride. They come in both non-air conditioned (R$3)[tpl]cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2012/01/passagem-de-onibus-sobe-de-r-250-para-r-275-no-rio.html|title=Passagem de ônibus sobe de R$ 2,50 para R$ 2,75 no Rio |publisher=G1 |date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=May 9, 2012[/tpl] and air conditioned versions (R$3–R$5.40).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/web/smtr/exibeconteudo?article-id=2422761|title=Novas tarifas de ônibus com ar condicionado e da integração ônibus-metrô|publisher=SMTR - Secretaria Municipal de Transportes|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=May 9, 2012[/tpl] The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g303506-s303/Rio-De-Janeiro:Brazil:Public.Transportation.html |title=Bus – Transportation in Rio |publisher=Tripadvisor.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl] Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the "Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)") in order to benefit of this system.
Another type of local bus is called the "Frescão" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned—about [tpl]convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]—more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00–R$12.00.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.realautoonibus.com.br/Site/NossasLinhas-Premium-00,undefined,REAL72219720120509134104-2.html|title=Nossas Linhas - Premium|publisher=Real Auto Ônibus|accessdate=May 9, 2012[/tpl] However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing "Castelo").

====Other====

The most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of Guanabara Bay is Niterói. Many people which live in Niterói, as well its neighbouring municipalities São Gonçalo and Maricá, commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro (XV Square) and Niterói (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several "fast cat" hydrofoil boats.
One of the city neighborhoods is Paquetá Island, which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocotá.
Rio de Janeiro has the oldest operating electric tramway in Brazil and South America,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldon/sets/72157621419913875/ |title=Bonde de Santa Teresa - a set on Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] now mainly used by tourists and less by daily commuters. Santa Teresa Tram or bondinho, has been preserved both as a piece of history and as a quick, fun, cheap way of getting to one of the most quirky parts of the city. The tram station is near Cinelândia and the Municipal Theatre. Trams leave every half an hour between 6:00 am and 11:00 pm. A ticket is just BR$0.60 (US$0.35), one way or return, and people pay as they pass through the barrier to the right of the entrance. The Santa Teresa Tram (known locally as the "bonde") in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro commenced electric operation in 1891, replacing horse-drawn trams and expanding the horse-drawn route. At this time the gauge was altered to [tpl]convert|1100|mm|2|abbr=on[/tpl], which remains the case today. The tram cars which are currently in operation are Brazilian-built, are of the cross-bench open sided design, and are fitted with trolley poles.Santa Tereza Tram הכטן7מריכטד7ג
After a derail occurred in August 28, 2011,G1: Bombeiros confirmam cinco mortos em acidente com bonde no Rio. Retrieved May 09, 2012. which left seven dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system, and will be reopened in 2014, just before the 2014 FIFA World Cup. While it is being improved, two lines costing R$0.60 carry passengers from Santa Teresa to Centro: SE014 and SE006.
In order to improve traffic in the central zone, the prefecture started the project "Porto Maravilha" (Marvelous Port), which foresees a modern tramway system. It will have five lines and will connect the central business district to Santos Dumont Airport, the ferry station at XV Square, the Novo Rio terminal bus station at Santo Cristo, and the future high-speed rail Leopoldina station between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.Porto Maravilha - Projetos Especiais - Veículo Leve sobre Trilhos

===Road transport===

Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice due to the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |title=Driving in Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Rioholiday.com |accessdate=May 6, 2009[/tpl] Due to the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).
In Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbour States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From São Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.

====Bicycles====

The city has [tpl]convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Glória, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. Six km (4 miles) of cycle paths traverse the Tijuca National Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |title=Getting around Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |accessdate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
The Bike Rio began operations in October 2011. This bicycle sharing system is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Banco Itaú. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations located in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.[tpl]cite news|url=http://vejario.abril.com.br/especial/aluguel-bicicleta-rio-645043.shtml Prefeitura lança|title=Bike Rio, novo sistema de aluguel de bicicletas da cidade|language=Portuguese|trans_title=Bike Rio, the city's new bike sharing system|author=Louise Peres|work=Veja Rio|date=2011-10-28|accessdate=2012-11-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/itau-patrocina-programa-de-aluguel-de-bicicletas-no-rio|title=Itaú patrocina programa de aluguel de bicicletas no Rio|language=Portuguese|trans_title=Itau sponsors bike sharing program in Rio|author=Louise Peres|work=Exame|date=2011-10-28|accessdate=2012-11-11[/tpl]

==Human development==

The human development of Rio varies greatly by locality, reflecting the spatial segregation and socioeconomic inequalities in the city. In 2000, there were several Rio neighborhoods with Human Development Index scores higher than the most developed countries in the world.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.pnud.org.br/publicacoes/|title=HDI|publisher=PNUD|location=Rio, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|accessdate=January 9, 2008|year=2000|language=Portuguese[/tpl]

===Social issues===

There are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro.Disparities between rich and poor[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] Although the city clearly ranks among the world's major metropolises, one fifth of its inhabitants live in neighbourhoods known as favelas (slums), where housing is not regulated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iets.org.br/article.php3?id_article=702 |title=Barracos em expansão |publisher=Iets.org.br |accessdate=October 16, 2010[/tpl] In the favelas, 15% of the population are poor, compared to 10% in the general population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI167577-15223,00.html |title=FGV: desigualdade entre favela e asfalto cai no Rio |publisher=Revistaepoca.globo.com |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010[/tpl] There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to housing projects such as Cidade de Deus to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas, bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the "Favela Bairro" program.
