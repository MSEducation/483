Confucius Plaza Apartments is a limited-equity housing cooperative in Chinatown, Manhattan, New York City.  The 44-story coop brown brick tower block complex ([tpl]Convert|433|ft|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) with 762 apartments was constructed in 1975 at a cost of $38,387,000. The building was the first major public-funded housing project built for almost exclusively Chinese Americans.
The complex contains 762 apartments, the Yung Wing Public School, P.S. 124 (K-8), shops, community space and a day-care center. The complex is located north of Chatham Square at the intersection of Bowery and Division Street.
One of the most frequently visited landmarks in Chinatown is the 15-foot bronze statue of Confucius, the Chinese philosopher, in front of the complex. Sculpted by Liu Shih, the statue was presented by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association as a token of appreciation, and to commemorate the U.S. bicentennial. At its base, a Confucian proverb is inscribed aside an American Flag, praising a just government with remarkable leaders of wisdom and ability.[tpl]cite web|author=â€” Lindsay Damast |url=http://nymag.com/listings/attraction/confucius_plaza/ |title=Confucius Plaza - Landmarks - New York Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=WC |url=http://peoplesguidetonyc.blogspot.com/2009/12/confucius-plaza.html |title=A People's Guide to New York City: Confucius Plaza |publisher=Peoplesguidetonyc.blogspot.com |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2014-04-03[/tpl]
