Xpert-Design Software is a software development company based in Stadtbergen, Germany.  Xpert-Design Software develops and distributes Xpert-Timer Enterprise, Pro, Xpert-Timer Basic and Xpert-Timer Mobile.

==Company history==

Xpert-Design Software was found in 1999 by Andreas Spang. The first couple of years the main product of the company was BackupXpress, which sold all over the world. Besides BackupXpress a project time tracking tool named "Project Timer" was developed and distributed as freeware. In 2005 the company decided to rename the product to "Xpert-Timer", add multiple functions and start selling it worldwide. Since then, Xpert-Timer has grown significantly and serves over 2000 customers worldwide. The mobile version for Android was introduced in October 2010 and has been sold over 6000 times worldwide so far. BackupXpress was taken off the market in 2010.

==Software==

Xpert-Timer, available in the version Enterprise, Pro, Basic and Mobile allows to track time on projects or tasks. Xpert-Timer Enterprise, Pro and Xpert-Timer Basic are Windows based, while Xpert-Timer Mobile runs on Android devices. All versions are designed for tracking time on projects and/or tasks. All versions of the software include a To-Do List, the timestamp list and a project history. Xpert-Timer Enterprise is multi user compatible, while Xpert-Timer Basic and Xpert-Timer Pro is only available for single users. This way it allows a whole project team to track time on one and the same project. Multiple reports are included in the system. Timestamps can be grouped by user, project or by date and can be exported to Excel or .csv for further use. Xpert-Timer Enterprise and Xpert-Timer Pro additionally include a billing module to create offers, invoices and reminders for clients. Also, there is a document management, client management and the synchronisation option available in those versions.

===Tracking Billable Time/Billing Rates===

Xpert-Timer tracks time for billable or non-billable projects. Additionally every project can have an own price.

===Expense Tracking===

Reimbursable expenses can be attributed to a particular project.

===Timestamp reports===

Xpert-Timer creates timestamps every time the start or stop button is pushed in the software. Timestamp comments can be added to every timestamp. Reports can be filtered by project, user, date or billing status. A customizable report to match your corporate identity is included.
