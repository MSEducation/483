==Attractions==

The Stann Creek District is also home to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary where South Stann Creek rises. Within the preserve is Victoria Peak, the second highest point in Belize, at [tpl]convert|1120|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level. The ethnic Garifuna village of Hopkins has recently undergone a huge transformation due to the growing tourism industry. The Garifuna are direct descendants of a group of African slaves who escaped two ship-wrecked Spanish slave ships near St. Vincent in 1635. They celebrate a diverse and rich culture that is a blend of African traditions of music, dance and religious ceremonies; Native American farming, hunting, and fishing techniques; and a French and Arawak influenced language.
