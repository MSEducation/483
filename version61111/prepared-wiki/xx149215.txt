==History==

The hall was opened in 1978, and was expanded in 2010 from a capacity of 4,500 to 5,500 people. In March 2011, the hall was closed after inspectors determined that the hockey club was allowed to host spectators on the newly built eastern stand without an official state permit for it. The state inspectors also determined that Jesenice municipality neglected to obtain permit for the new parts built during the last major renovation in 1997.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042430780 |title=Dvorana Podmežakla zaprta zaradi nespametnega odpiranja vzhodne tribune |author=Knez, Primož |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |work=Dnevnik |language=Slovene[/tpl]
