[[Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution]]

The following is a timeline of the drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution.  The drafting of the Constitution began on  May 25, 1787, when  the Constitutional Convention  met for the first time with a quorum at the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, and ended on September 17, 1787, the day the Constitution drafted by the convention's delegates to replace the Articles was adopted and signed.  The ratification process for the Constitution began that day, and ended when the final state,  Rhode Island, ratified it on May 29, 1790, three years later.    In addition to key events during the Constitutional Convention and afterward while the Constitution was before the states for their ratification, important events that occurred during the run-up to the convention and during the nation's transition from government under the Articles of Confederation to government under the Constitution are also included, as is the unique ratification vote of  Vermont.  Thus this timeline begins on March 25, 1785, the date when the Mount Vernon Conference , a meeting of delegates from Virginia and Maryland to discuss interstate commercial issues along their mutual water border, convened, and ends on January 10, 1791, when  Vermont, which at the time was a sovereign state, voted to ratify the Constitution and to apply for admission into the Union.
