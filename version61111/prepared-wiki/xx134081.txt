Ferraria is a genus of 11 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Iridaceae, native to tropical and southern Africa. They are herbaceous corm-bearing plants growing to 30–45 cm tall. Some species have an unpleasant scent similar to rotting meat and are pollinated by flies, while others have a pleasant scent. The genus name is a tribute to 15th-century artist Giovanni Ferrari.[tpl]cite book |author=Manning, John; Goldblatt, Peter |title=The Iris Family: Natural History & Classification |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon|pages=209–211 |year=2008|isbn=0-88192-897-6[/tpl]
