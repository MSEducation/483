Kirk who often calls him "Bones". McCoy and Kirk are good friends, even "brotherly".[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|146[/tpl] The passionate, sometimes cantankerous McCoy frequently argues with Kirk's other confidant, science officer Spock, and occasionally is bigoted toward Spock's Vulcan heritage.[tpl]cite book|title=Star Trek and Sacred Ground|page=58|isbn=978-0-7914-4334-7|publisher=SUNY Press|first1=Jennifer E.|last1=Porter|first2=Darcee L.|last2=McLaren|year=1999[/tpl] McCoy often plays the role of Kirk's conscience, offering a counterpoint to Spock's logic.

This causes mental anguish for McCoy, who in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) helps restore Spock's katra to his reanimated body. McCoy rejoins Kirk's crew aboard the USS Enterprise-A in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986). In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, McCoy (through the intervention of Spock's half-brother Sybok) reveals that he helped his father commit suicide to relieve him of his pain. Shortly after the suicide, a cure was found for his father's disease, and McCoy carried the guilt about it with him for the rest of his life. In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), McCoy and Kirk escape from a Klingon prison world, and the Enterprise crew stops a plot to prevent peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Kelley reprised the role for the "Encounter at Farpoint" pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), insisting upon no more than the minimum Screen Actors Guild payment for his appearance.[tpl]cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003-01-07|last=Nemeck|first=Larry|isbn=978-0-7434-5798-9[/tpl]
In the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode "The Survivor", McCoy mentions he has a daughter. Chekov's friend Irina in the original series episode "The Way to Eden" was originally written as Dr. McCoy's daughter Joanna, but changed before the episode was shot.Joanna precursor to "The Way to Eden"

===Alternate timeline===

In the 2009 Star Trek film, which takes place in an "alternate, parallel" reality,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/05/05/a_fresh_frontier/|title=Star Trek|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-05-06|date=2009-05-05|first=Ty|last=Burr|page=1[/tpl] McCoy and Kirk become friends at Starfleet Academy, which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says "left him nothing but his bones." This line, improvised by Urban,Star Trek DVD commentary explains how McCoy came to be known as Bones. McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the USS Enterprise.

==Development==

Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry had worked with Kelley on previous television pilots,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/cast/bio/69074.html|title=DeForest Kelley profile at Startrek.com|accessdate=2009-01-25[/tpl] and Kelley was Roddenberry's first choice to play the doctor aboard the USS Enterprise.[tpl]cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=June 1997|page=152|isbn=0-671-00974-5[/tpl] However, for the rejected pilot "The Cage" (1964), Roddenberry went with director Robert Butler's choice of John Hoyt to play Dr. Philip Boyce.[tpl]cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=June 1997|page=37|isbn=0-671-00974-5[/tpl] For the second pilot, "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (1966), Roddenberry accepted director James Goldstone's decision to have Paul Fix play Dr. Mark Piper.[tpl]cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=June 1997|page=75|isbn=0-671-00974-5[/tpl] Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship's doctor, he didn't put Kelley's name forward to NBC; the network never "rejected" the actor as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.
Kelley's first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in "The Man Trap" (1966). Despite his character's prominence, Kelley's contract granted him only a "featuring" credit; it was not until the second season that he was given "starring" credit, at the urging of producer Robert Justman.[tpl]cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=June 1997|page=240|isbn=0-671-00974-5[/tpl] Kelley was apprehensive about Star Trek[tpl]'[/tpl]s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was "going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made".[tpl]cite book|title=From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy|first=Terry Lee|last=Rioux|isbn=978-0-7434-5762-0|publisher=Simon & Schuster|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fHqtNdfIdi8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=rioux+kelley&hl=en&ei=-E-FTYfJO4P0tgOY49hP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]rp|146[/tpl] Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original Star Trek series and voiced the character in the animated Star Trek.
Kelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/367110.stm|title=Star Trek's Dr McCoy dies|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-26|date=1999-06-11[/tpl] in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy: a doctor's "matter-of-fact" delivery of news of Kelley's mother's terminal cancer was the "abrasive sand" Kelley used in creating McCoy's demeanor.[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|145[/tpl] Star Trek writer D. C. Fontana said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley's input.[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|156[/tpl]
"Exquisite chemistry" among Kelley, William Shatner, and Leonard Nimoy manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain James T. Kirk and science officer Spock, respectively.[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|154[/tpl] Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, referred to Kelley as her "sassy gentleman friend";[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|154[/tpl] the friendship between the African-American Nichols and Southern Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through Star Trek.[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|154[/tpl]
For the 2009 film Star Trek, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman saw McCoy as an "arbiter" in Kirk and Spock's relationship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/orci-kurtzman-how-star-tr.php|title=Orci & Kurtzman: How Star Trek deals with Kirk, Spock and McCoy|work=Sci Fi Wire|date=2009-03-25|accessdate=2009-05-08[/tpl] While Spock represented "extreme logic, extreme science" and Kirk symbolized "extreme emotion and intuition", McCoy's role as "a very colorful doctor, essentially a very humanistic scientist" represented the "two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together." They chose to reveal McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the "bias" in their friendship and why he would often be a "little dismissive" of Spock. Urban said the script was "very faithful" to the original character, including the "great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility" with which Kelley imbued the character.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_seyret&Itemid=227&task=videodirectlink&id=522|title=Karl Urban|accessdate=2009-01-26|date=2008-01-17|publisher=IESB.net[/tpl] Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy's accent.

==Reception and cultural impact==

McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself and is a foil to Spock. He is Kirk's "friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest".[tpl]cite book|page=84|first=Grace Lee|last=Whitney|authorlink=Grace Lee Whitney|title=The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy|year=1998|isbn=978-1-884956-03-4|publisher=Quill Driver Books|first2=James D.|last2=Denney[/tpl] Spock and McCoy's bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo "we simply didn't realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our Arrowsmith and our Alien".[tpl]cite web | url=http://io9.com/gene-roddenberrys-1968-memo-on-improving-star-treks-c-1267131265 | title=Gene Roddenberry's 1968 memo on improving Star Trek's characters | work=io9 | date=2013-09-07 | accessdate=2013-09-07 | last=Davis|first=Lauren[/tpl] Urban said McCoy has a "sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing", and that "Spock's logic and McCoy's moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one."[tpl]cite web |url=http://scifipulse.net/?p=581|publisher=Sci Fi Pulse|title=Urban On Star Trek & McCoy|accessdate=2009-01-26 |date=2008-07-18[/tpl] Jennifer Porter and Darcee McLaren wrote that McCoy is an "unintentional" example of how "irrational prejudices and fixations, wishful thinking and emotional reasoning, denial and repression, and unresolved neurotic disturbances" compromise "scientific rationality" in Star Trek.[tpl]cite book|title=Star Trek and Sacred Ground|page=51|isbn=978-0-7914-4334-7|publisher=SUNY Press|first1=Jennifer E.|last1=Porter|first2=Darcee L.|last2=McLaren|year=1999[/tpl]

==="He's dead, Jim."===

Twenty times on the original Star Trek, McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, "He's dead", "He's dead, Jim", or something similar. The phrase so became a catchphrase of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone, but disliked repeating such lines[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|166[/tpl] and refused to say it in The Wrath of Khan when Spock is near death. Kelley and James Doohan (Montgomery Scott) 
agreed to swap their lines, so McCoy warns Kirk against opening the engineering doors while Scott says "He's dead already".[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|249[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=94 | title=Install Long and Prosper | work=Computer Gaming World | date=May 1992 | accessdate=2013-11-24 | author=Greenberg, Allen | pages=46[/tpl] The line has entered popular culture as a general metaphor, with uses as diverse as descriptions of an unresponsive electronic circuit,
an example of how to add an audio file to function as an alert sound in a computer system, and an illustrative quote regarding how to know if one's opponent has been destroyed in an action hero game.
USC Literature Professor Henry Jenkins cited Dr. McCoy's "He's dead, Jim" line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities. Google Chrome uses the phrase as an error message when Google Chrome either is terminated with the task manager, or Chrome runs out of memory, and is a common error.[tpl]cite web|title=Google Chrome errors and crashes: "He's Dead, Jim!"|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=1270364|work=Google Chrome Help|publisher=Google Support|accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl]

==="I'm a doctor, not a(n)..."===

Another of McCoy's catchphrases is his "I'm a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)..." statements, delivered by Kelley 11 times[tpl]r|rioux2005[/tpl][tpl]rp|166[/tpl], and twice (by Karl Urban) in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as the "classic moment" when he is confronted with the unusual silicon-based Horta alien in "The Devil in the Dark" (1967), saying, "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."[tpl]cite book|last1=Lass|first1=Martin|first2=Rickie|last2=Hilder|title=Musings of a Rogue Comet: Chiron, Planet of Healing|edition=2nd|year=2002|publisher=Galactic Publications|isbn=0-9715924-2-X|page=212|chapter=The Discovery of Chiron|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=UiYNPFOnLLwC&pg=PA212|accessdate=2009-04-07|quote=In a classic moment (episode: 'The Devil in the Dark'), McCoy, challenged with healing a being that was made more of rock than flesh, spouts out, 'I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!'[/tpl] Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, The Doctor (Robert Picardo) from Star Trek: Voyager, two other Emergency Medical Holograms (one in Star Trek: First Contact (Picardo) and the other in the Voyager episode "Message in a Bottle" (Andy Dick)) and Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley) from Star Trek: Enterprise all use variations of the line, which has also made its way into many other shows such as  Stargate Atlantis,[tpl]cite episode|title=The Brotherhood|episodelink=The Brotherhood (Stargate Atlantis)|series=Stargate: Atlantis|serieslink=Stargate Atlantis|network=Sci Fi Channel|airdate=2005-01-03|season=1|number=14[/tpl] Robot Chicken,[tpl]cite episode|title=The Munnery|episodelink=The Munnery|series=Robot Chicken|serieslink=Robot Chicken|network=Cartoon Network|airdate=2006-09-24|season=2|number=12[/tpl] Terra Nova,[tpl]cite episode|title=Now you see me|number=10|season=1|series=Terra Nova|url=http://thevoiceoftv.com/recaps-and-reviews/terra-nova-review-now-you-see-me|airdate=2011-11-28[/tpl] Family Guy, Once Upon a Time, and Friends. In a parody sketch titled "The Restaurant Enterprise", on an episode of Saturday Night Live, Kirk (guest host William Shatner) directs McCoy (Phil Hartman) to help a man who's choking. McCoy snaps, "Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a ... (suddenly realizes the situation; slightly embarrassed) Oh ... oh, sure." On an episode of In Living Color, one parody sketch lampoons the advanced age of the principal Star Trek actors. McCoy appears as a skeleton in a wheelchair, and quips, "Dammit, Jim! I'm a corpse, not a doctor!" DeForest Kelley himself parodied the phrase for a Trivial Pursuit commercial ("How should I know? I'm an actor, not a doctor").[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/specials/star-trek/1668/im_a_doctor_not_a.html |title=I'm a doctor, not a...

Similarly, in 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness, McCoy (Urban again) tells Spock, "Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!" Another reference to the catchphrase can be found in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective where actor Jim Carrey searches for clues around a dolphin tank, gets told that he must hurry, and says "Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a poolman."
