[[Annulus (mathematics)]]

In mathematics, an annulus (the Latin word for "little ring", with plural annuli) is a ring-shaped object, especially a region bounded by two concentric circles. The adjectival form is annular (as in annular eclipse).
The open annulus is topologically equivalent to both the open cylinder [tpl]math|S1 × (0,1)[/tpl] and the punctured plane.
The area of an annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of radius [tpl]math|R[/tpl] and the smaller one of radius [tpl]math|r[/tpl]:
The area of an annulus can be obtained from the length of the longest interval that can lie completely inside the annulus, 2*d in the accompanying diagram. This can be proven by the Pythagorean theorem; the length of the longest interval that can lie completely inside the annulus will be tangent to the smaller circle and form a right angle with its radius at that point. Therefore d and r are the sides of a right angled triangle with hypotenuse R and the area is given by:
The area can also be obtained via calculus by dividing the annulus up into an infinite number of annuli of infinitesimal width [tpl]math|dρ[/tpl] and area [tpl]math|2πρ dρ[/tpl] and then integrating from ρ = r to ρ = R:
The area of an annulus sector of angle [tpl]math|θ[/tpl], with [tpl]math|θ[/tpl] measured in radians, is given by:

==Complex structure==

In complex analysis an annulus [tpl]math|ann(a; r, R)[/tpl] in the complex plane is an open region defined by:
If [tpl]math|r[/tpl] is [tpl]math|0[/tpl], the region is known as the punctured disk of radius [tpl]math|R[/tpl] around the point [tpl]math|a[/tpl].
As a subset of the complex plane, an annulus can be considered as a Riemann surface. The complex structure of an annulus depends only on the ratio [tpl]math|r/R[/tpl]. Each annulus [tpl]math|ann(a; r, R)[/tpl] can be holomorphically mapped to a standard one centered at the origin and with outer radius [tpl]math|1[/tpl] by the map
The inner radius is then {{math|r/R The Hadamard three-circle theorem is a statement about the maximum value a holomorphic function may take inside an annulus.
