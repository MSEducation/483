The 1991 Miami Hurricanes football team were the co-national champions of the 1991 NCAA Division I-A football season, as determined by the AP Poll.  1991 was a split championship year, though, as the Washington Huskies finished #1 in the Coaches' Poll.  The national championship was the fourth won by the University of Miami in football, all of which had come in the nine years since 1983, leading some to dub the era, "The Decade of Dominance."
