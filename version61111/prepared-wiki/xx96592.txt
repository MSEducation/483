[[Convex combination]]

CATEGORIES: Convex geometry, Mathematical analysis, Convex hulls

In convex geometry, a convex combination is a linear combination of points (which can be vectors, scalars, or more generally points in an affine space) where all coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1.
As a particular example, every convex combination of two points lies on the line segment between the points.
All convex combinations are within the convex hull of the given points. In fact, the collection of all such convex combinations of points in the set constitutes the convex hull of the set.
