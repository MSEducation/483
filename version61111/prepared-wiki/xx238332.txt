==Plot synopsis==

Captain Labesch (Rafael Bertrand) arrives at a remote island, determined to crack down on the island's lawlessness, spurred by the voodoo rites practiced by the evil priest Damballah (Boris Karloff). Labesch starts with local tycoon Carl Van Molder and his study of the island. Van Molder warns not to interfere with the local populace. Annabella (Julissa), van Molder's niece, is a temperance crusader who is visiting and wants her uncle to help fund the International Anti-Saloon League. She falls in love with handsome police lieutenant Andrew Wilhelm (Carlos East), despite his fondness for rum. Meanwhile, beautiful native girls are being transformed into zombies, and a sinister snake dancer named Kalea (Yolanda Montes) leads them to attack and devour any meddling policemen who get too close to their unholy rituals. Annabella in a dream wakes up in a coffin and finds another woman with a snake who looks like her in a second coffin, who pursues and then kisses her. When Annabella is kidnapped and prepared to be the cult's latest human sacrifice, Labesch and Wilhelm have to infiltrate their ranks to save her, and they finally learn the secret identity of the all-powerful Damballah.

==Production==

Isle of the Snake People is one of four low-budget Mexican horror films Karloff made in a package deal with Mexican producer Luis Enrique Vergara, the others being The Incredible Invasion, The Fear Chamber, and House of Evil. With Karloff signed, Vergara obtained financing for the four films from Columbia Pictures, which would then distribute them. Karloff received $100,000 per film. Karloff initially rejected the scripts for all of the films, but agreed to them after they were rewritted by Jack Hill. 
Filming was planned to take place in Mexico, but Karloff's emphysema prevented him from working at that altitude. Karloff's scenes in all four films were directed by Jack Hill at the Dored Studios in Los Angeles in the spring of 1968. Between shots, Karloff rested in a wheelchair. The films were then completed in Mexico at Studios America Mexico. Some additional scenes involving the character van Molder where filmed using a Karloff stand-in named Jerry Petty. Due to the unexpected death of Vergara, the release of the film was held up to determine ownership rights of inheritance under Mexican law. All four films in the package deal were released after Karloff's death in 1969.[tpl]cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Stephen |authorlink= |title=Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster |publisher=Tomohawk Press |year=2011 |location= |page=503 |url= |isbn=978-0-9557-6704-3[/tpl]

==Reception==

The four Azteca Films productions for which Karloff shot his scenes in Los Angeles were released by Columbia Pictures over a two-year period after he had died in 1969.[tpl]cite book |last=Kay |first=Glenn |authorlink= |title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |pages=63-4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aBfGajftevEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-1-55652-770-8[/tpl] They were dismissed, by critics and Karloff fans alike, as undistinguished efforts. The film when released also appeared to be dated and inferior as, between its filming and release another zombie film, Night of the Living Dead (1968), had raised the standards for the genre.
