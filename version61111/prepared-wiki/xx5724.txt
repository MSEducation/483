The Klingon language (tlhIngan Hol, pronounced [tpl]IPA|/ˈt͡ɬɪ.ŋɑn xol/[/tpl]) is the constructed language spoken by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe.
Described in the 1984 book The Klingon Dictionary by Marc Okrand and deliberately designed to sound "alien", it has a number of typologically uncommon features. The language's basic sound, along with a few words, was first devised by actor James Doohan ("Scotty") for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. That film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.
Klingon is sometimes referred to as Klingonese (most notably in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "The Trouble with Tribbles", where it was actually pronounced by a Klingon character as "Klingonee" [tpl]IPA|/klɪŋɡoni/[/tpl]) but, among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in John M. Ford's 1984 Star Trek novel The Final Reflection, and appears in other Star Trek novels by Ford. A shorthand version of Klingonaase, and later with the same term adopted by tlhIngan Hol itself, is called "battle language", or "Clipped Klingon". [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The Klingon Christmas Carol play is the first production that is primarily in Klingon (only the narrator speaks English). The opera 'u' is entirely in Klingon.
A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on Star Trek-Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==External history==

Though mentioned in the original Star Trek series episode "The Trouble With Tribbles", the Klingon language first appeared on-screen in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). According to the actor who spoke the lines, Mark Lenard, James Doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape, and Lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them. How closely Lenard's delivery of the lines matches Doohan's intentions is not known.[tpl]cite book |last1=Okrand |first1=Mark |last2=Adams |first2=Michael |last3=Hendriks-Hermans |first3=Judith |last4=Kroon |first4=Sjaak |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Adams |title=From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=December 1, 2011 |pages=111–134 |chapter=Wild and Whirling Words: The Invention and Use of Klingon |isbn=978-0-192-80709-0[/tpl]
For Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) director Leonard Nimoy and writer-producer Harve Bennett wanted the Klingons to speak a proper language instead of made-up gibberish and so commissioned a full language based on the phrases Doohan had come up from Marc Okrand, who had earlier devised four lines of Vulcan dialogue for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Okrent, Arika. In the Land of Invented Languages. Spiegel & Grau, 2009, pp. 266-267. ISBN 978-0-385-52788-0 Okrand enlarged the lexicon and developed grammar based on the original dozen words Doohan had created. The language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast—for example, in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989) and in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), where translation difficulties served as a plot device.
Two "non-canon" dialects of Klingon are hinted at in the novelization of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, as Saavik speaks in Klingon, to the only Klingon officer aboard Capt. Kruge's starship after his death, as the survivors of the Enterprise's self-destruction transport up from the crumbling Genesis Planet to the Klingon ship.  The surviving officer, Maltz, states that he speaks the Rumaiy dialect, while Saavik is speaking to him in the Kumburan dialect of Klingon, per Maltz' spoken reply to her.[tpl]cite book |title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock |last=McIntyre |first=Vonda |authorlink= |year=1984 |publisher=Pocket Books |location= |isbn=0-671-49500-3 |page=272 |pages= |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |url=[/tpl]
With the advent of the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)—in which one of the main characters, Worf, was a Klingon—and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "A Matter of Honor", several members of a Klingon ship's crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer (even Commander Riker, enjoying the benefits of a universal translator, is unable to understand) until one Klingon orders the others to "speak their humans' language".
A small number of non-Klingon characters were later depicted in Star Trek as having learned to speak Klingon, notably Jean-Luc Picard and Jadzia Dax.
Worf would later reappear among the regular characters in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and B'Elanna Torres, a Klingon-human hybrid, would become a main character on Star Trek: Voyager (1995). 
The use of untranslated Klingon words interspersed with conversation translated into English was commonplace in later seasons of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, when Klingons became a more important part of the series' overall story-arcs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
The pilot episode of the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise, "Broken Bow" (2001) describes the Klingon language as having "eighty polyguttural dialects constructed on an adaptive syntax". However, Klingon as described on television is often not entirely congruous with the Klingon developed by Okrand.

==Language==

Hobbyists around the world have studied the Klingon language. Four Klingon translations of works of world literature have been published: ghIlghameS (Gilgamesh), Hamlet (Hamlet), paghmo' tIn mIS (Much Ado About Nothing) and pIn'a' qan paQDI'norgh (Tao Te Ching). The Shakespearian choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, who said, "You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." In the bonus material on the DVD, screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and actor William Shatner both explain that this was an allusion to the German myth that Shakespeare was in fact German[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl].
The Klingon Language Institute exists to promote the language.[tpl]cite news | url=http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?res=9A0CEFD8163BF934A35753C1A9629C8B63&fta=y | author=Lisa Napoli | title=Online Diary: tlhIngan maH! | date=October 7, 2004 | work=New York Times[/tpl]
CBS Television Studios owns a copyright of the official dictionary and other canonical descriptions of the language. While constructed languages ("conlangs") are viewed as creations with copyright protection,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] natural languages are not protected, excluding dictionaries and/or other works created with them. Mizuki Miyashita and Laura Moll note, "Copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts, and facts can not be copyrighted. However, the formatting, example sentences, and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author, so they are copyrightable."[tpl]cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jar/RIL_9.html |title=NAU.edu |publisher=Jan.ucc.nau.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl] Whether constructed languages can be copyrighted was tested in court in the example of Loglan and its derivative Lojban.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Okrand had studied some Native American and Southeast Asian languages,There's No Klingon Word for Hello, Slate magazine, May 7, 2009. Retrieved 2009-05-08.An attribution to Okrand may be found in the museum displays at the San Juan Bautista, California State Historic Park, which includes a short mention of the local Mutsun native people whom Okrand studied for his thesis. and phonological and grammatical features of these languages "worked their way into Klingon, but for the most part, not by design." Okrand himself has stated that a design principle of the Klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages in general, and English in particular. He therefore avoided patterns that are typologically common and deliberately chose features that occur relatively infrequently in human languages. This includes above all the highly asymmetric consonant inventory and the basic word order.Okrent 2009, pp.270-271
The 2003–2010 version of the puzzle globe logo of Wikipedia, representing its multilingualism, contained a Klingon character. The updated logo removed the character and substituted one from the Ge'ez script.

==Speakers==

A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Arika Okrent guessed in her book "In the Land of Invented Languages" that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers."But what about speakers in the sense of people who can carry on a spontaneous live conversation in Klingon? (...) I would say, oh, twenty or so. Maybe thirty." Arika Okrent. In the Land of Invented Languages. New York (Spiegel & Grau). 2010, p. 273. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on Star Trek–Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for transporter ionizer unit (jolvoy') or bridge (of a ship) (meH) have been known since close to the language's inception, the word for bridge in the sense of a crossing over water (QI) was unknown until August 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kli.org/tlhIngan-Hol/2012/August/msg00112.html |title=tlhIngan-Hol Archive, August 13, 2012 |publisher=Kli.org |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl] Nonetheless, mundane conversations are common among skilled speakers.Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water, Mostly Water LLC, 2004.

==Appearance and use==

The Klingon language was first developed only for the purpose of being used in Star Trek. A daily conversation or a perfect translation of literature are difficult because of the small vocabulary of only 3000 words. Fans enjoy using the language on conventions and for role-playing to give their character a more realistic appearance (also see cosplay). There are Klingon language meetings[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.speakklingon.info |title=tlhIngan Hol yejHaD qep'a' | Information about the 2013 Conference of the Klingon Language Institute |publisher=Speakklingon.info |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qephom.de/e/nextqephom.html |title=Klingon Classes for Everyone |publisher=www.qepHom.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl] and even linguists or students are interested in researching this topic, even writing essays about the language or its users. In the media (music, literature and television) Klingon is also used frequently as a reference to Star Trek.

==Canon==

An important concept to spoken and written Klingon is canonicity. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as the growing number of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible.Klingon as Linguistic Capital, Yens Wahlgren, June 2000.

===Internal history===

Within the fictional universe of Star Trek, Klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure Kahless the Unforgettable, who united the Klingon home-world of Qo'noS under one empire more than 1500 years ago.Marc Okrand, Klingon for the Galactic Traveler, Simon & Schuster, 1997. Many dialects exist, but the standardized dialect of prestige is almost invariably that of the sitting emperor.

==Phonology==

Klingon has been developed with a phonology that, while based on human natural languages, is intended to sound alien to human ears. When initially developed, Paramount Pictures (owners of the Star Trek franchise) wanted the Klingon language to be guttural and harsh and Okrand wanted it to be unusual, so he selected sounds that combined in ways not generally found in other languages. The effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of retroflex and uvular consonants in the language's inventory[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]. Klingon has twenty-one consonants and five vowels. Klingon is normally written in a variant of the Latin alphabet (see below). In this orthography, upper and lower case letters are not interchangeable (uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different from those expected by English speakers). In the discussion below, standard Klingon orthography appears in [tpl]angle bracket|angle brackets[/tpl], and the phonemic transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet is written between /slashes/.

===Consonants===

The inventory of consonants in Klingon is spread over a number of places of articulation. In spite of this, the inventory has many gaps: Klingon has no velar plosives, and only one sibilant fricative. Deliberately, this arrangement is quite bizarre by the standards of human languages. The combination of an aspirated voiceless alveolar plosive [tpl]IPA|/tʰ/[/tpl] and a voiced retroflex plosive [tpl]IPA|/ɖ/[/tpl] is particularly unusual.
There are a few dialectal pronunciation differences:[tpl]cite book |last=Okrand |first=Marc |title=Klingon for the Galactic Traveller |year=1997 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0671009953 |pages=18–24[/tpl]

In the Tak'ev dialect:
In the Morskan dialect

===Vowels===

In contrast to its consonants, Klingon's inventory of vowels is simple, and similar to those of many human languages, such as Spanish. There are five vowels spaced evenly around the vowel space, with two back rounded vowels, and two front, or near-front, unrounded vowels.
The two front vowels, [tpl]angle bracket|e[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|I[/tpl], represent sounds that are found in English, but are more open and lax than a typical English speaker might assume when reading Klingon text written in the Latin alphabet, thus causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent. This enhances the sense that Klingon is a clipped and harsh-sounding language.
Diphthongs can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two semivowels [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl] (represented by [tpl]angle bracket|w[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|y[/tpl], respectively). Thus, the combinations [tpl]angle bracket|ay[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ey[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|Iy[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|oy[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|uy[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|aw[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ew[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|Iw[/tpl] are possible. There are no words in the Klingon language that contain *[tpl]angle bracket|ow[/tpl] or *[tpl]angle bracket|uw[/tpl].

===Syllable structure===

Klingon follows a strict syllable structure. A syllable must start with a consonant (which includes the glottal stop) followed by one vowel. In prefixes and other rare syllables, this is enough. More commonly, this consonant-vowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas: /-w'''' -'''y'''' -'''rgh/. Thus, ta "record", tar "poison" and targh "targ" (a type of animal) are all legal syllable forms, but *tarD and *ar are not. Despite this, one suffix takes the shape vowel+consonant: the endearment suffix -oy.

===Stress===

In verbs, the stressed syllable is usually the verbal stem itself, as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes, except when a suffix ending with [tpl]angle bracket|'[/tpl] is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, in which case the suffix ending in [tpl]angle bracket|'[/tpl] is also stressed. In addition, stress may shift to a suffix that is meant to be emphasized.
In nouns, the final syllable of the stem (the noun itself, excluding any affixes) is stressed. If any syllables ending in [tpl]angle bracket|'[/tpl] are present, the stress shifts to those syllables.
The stress in other words seems to be variable, but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length. There are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.

==Grammar==

Klingon is an agglutinative language, using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words. Some nouns have inherently plural forms, such as jengva' "plate" (vs. ngop "plates"), but most nouns require a suffix to express plurality explicitly. Depending on the type of noun (body part, being capable of using language, or neither) the suffix changes. For beings capable of using language, the suffix is -pu', as in tlhInganpu', meaning "Klingons," or jaghpu', meaning "enemies". For body parts, the plural suffix is -Du', as in mInDu', "eyes". For items that are neither body parts nor capable of speech, the suffix is -mey, such as in Hovmey ("stars"), or targhmey ("targs") for a Klingon animal somewhat resembling a boar. (However, a plural suffix is never obligatory. To say "The stars are beautiful", 'IH Hovmey and 'IH Hov are equally grammatical, although the second can also mean "The star is beautiful".)
The words loD and be', which on their own mean "man" and "woman" respectively, can be used in compound words to describe gender. For example, from puq ("child") this process derives puqloD ("son") and puqbe' ("daughter").
Klingon nouns take suffixes to indicate grammatical number. There are three noun classes, two levels of deixis, and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: jupoypu'na'wI'vaD "for my beloved true friends". A word may carry no more than one suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.
Verbs in Klingon take a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object, whereas suffixes are taken from nine ordered classes, and a special suffix class called rovers. Each of the four known rovers has a unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb. Verbs are marked for aspect, certainty, predisposition and volition, dynamic, causative, mood, negation, and honorific. The Klingon verb has two moods: indicative and imperative.
The most common word order in Klingon is Object Verb Subject, and, in most cases, the word order is the exact reverse of English for an equivalent sentence:
