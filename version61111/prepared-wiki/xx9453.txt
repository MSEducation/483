On September 8, 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave "qualified health claim" status to EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids, stating, "supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."[tpl]cite press release|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration|date=September 8, 2004|url=http://www.fda.gov/SiteIndex/ucm108351.htm|title=FDA announces qualified health claims for omega-3 fatty acids|accessdate=2006-07-10[/tpl] This updated and modified their health risk advice letter of 2001 (see below).

==Dietary sources==

===Daily values===

As macronutrients, fats are not assigned Dietary Reference Intakes. Macronutrients have acceptable intake (AI) levels and acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDRs) instead of RDAs. The AI for omega-3 is 1.6 grams/day for men and 1.1 grams/day for women, while the AMDR is 0.6% to 1.2% of total energy.[tpl]cite book | author = Food and Nutrition Board | publisher = Institute of Medicine of the National Academies | year = 2005 | title = Dietary Reference Intakes For Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 0-309-08537-3 | url = http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/energy_full_report.pdf | pages = 423; 770[/tpl]
A growing body of literature suggests that higher intakes of α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may afford some degree of protection against coronary disease. Because the physiological potency of EPA and DHA is much greater than that of ALA, it is not possible to estimate one AMDR for all omega-3 fatty acids. Approximately 10 percent of the AMDR can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA." There was insufficient evidence as of 2005 to set an upper tolerable limit for omega-3 fatty acids.
Heavy metal poisoning by the body's accumulation of traces of heavy metals, in particular mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium, is a possible risk from consuming fish oil supplements.[tpl]mcn|date=September 2012[/tpl] Also, other contaminants (PCBs, furans, dioxins, and PBDEs) might be found, especially in less-refined fish oil supplements.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] In reality, however, heavy metal toxicity from consuming fish oil supplements is highly unlikely, because heavy metals selectively bind with protein in the fish flesh rather than accumulate in the oil. An independent test in 2005 of 44 fish oils on the US market found all of the products passed safety standards for potential contaminants.[tpl]verify credibility|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The FDA has advised that adults can safely consume a total of 3 grams per day of combined DHA and EPA, with no more than 2 g per day coming from dietary supplements.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bent S, Bertoglio K, Hendren RL |title=Omega-3 fatty acids for autistic spectrum disorder: a systematic review |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=1145–54 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19333748 |pmc=2710498 |doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0724-5 |url=[/tpl]
Throughout their history, the Council for Responsible Nutrition and the World Health Organization have published acceptable standards regarding contaminants in fish oil. The most stringent current standard is the International Fish Oils Standard.International Fish Oils Standard[tpl]primary source-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl] Fish oils that are molecularly distilled under vacuum typically make this highest-grade, and have measurable levels of contaminants (measured parts per billion and parts per trillion).[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
A recent trend has been to fortify food with omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Global food companies have launched omega-3 fatty acid fortified bread, mayonnaise, pizza, yogurt, orange juice, children's pasta, milk, eggs, popcorn, confections, and infant formula.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The American Heart Association has set up dietary recommendations for EPA and DHA due to their cardiovascular benefits: Individuals with no history of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction should consume oily fish or fish oils two times per week; those having been diagnosed with coronary heart disease after infarction should consume 1 g EPA and DHA per day from oily fish or supplements; those wishing to lower blood triglycerides should consume 2–4 g of EPA and DHA per day in the form of supplements.[tpl]update after|2012|9|19[/tpl]

===Fish===

The most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is cold water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much omega-3 as omega-6. Other oily fish, such as tuna, also contain n-3 in somewhat lesser amounts. Consumers of oily fish should be aware of the potential presence of heavy metals and fat-soluble pollutants like PCBs and dioxins, which are known to accumulate up the food chain. After extensive review, researchers from Harvard's School of Public Health in the Journal of the American Medical Association (2006) reported that the benefits of fish intake generally far outweigh the potential risks. Although fish are a dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids, fish do not synthesize them; they obtain them from the algae (microalgae in particular) or plankton in their diets.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Falk-Petersen |year=1998|title=Lipids and fatty acids in ice algae and phytoplankton from the Marginal Ice Zone in the Barents Sea|journal=Polar Biology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=41–47|issn=0722-4060|id=[tpl]INIST|2356641[/tpl]|doi=10.1007/s003000050274|first1=S.|display-authors=1|last2=Sargent|first2=J.

====Fish oil====

Marine and freshwater fish oil vary in content of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Innis |first1=SM |author2=Rioux, FM; Auestad, N; Ackman, RG|title=Marine and freshwater fish oil varying in arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids differ in their effects on organ lipids and fatty acids in growing rats.|journal=The Journal of nutrition|date=September 1995|volume=125|issue=9|pages=2286–93|pmid=7666244[/tpl] They also differ in their effects on organ lipids. Not all forms of fish oil may be equally digestible. Of four studies that compare bioavailability of the glyceryl ester form of fish oil vs. the ethyl ester form, two have concluded the natural glyceryl ester form is better, and the other two studies did not find a significant difference. No studies have shown the ethyl ester form to be superior, although it is cheaper to manufacture.[ref]

===Krill===

Krill oil is a newly[tpl]When|date=May 2012[/tpl] discovered source of omega-3 fatty acids. Various claims are made in support of krill oil as a superior[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] source of omega-3 fatty acids. The effect of krill oil, at a lower dose of EPA + DHA (62.8%), was demonstrated to be similar to that of fish oil.[tpl]Cite journal|author= Ulven SM|title=Metabolic Effects of Krill Oil are Essentially Similar to Those of Fish Oil but at Lower Dose of EPA and DHA, in Healthy Volunteers |journal=Lipids |date=January 2011|volume=46|issue=1|pages=37–46|pmid=21042875|pmc= 3024511|doi= 10.1007/s11745-010-3490-4|last2= Kirkhus|first2= B|last3= Lamglait|first3= A|last4= Basu|first4= S|last5= Elind|first5= E|last6= Haider|first6= T|last7= Berge|first7= K|last8= Vik|first8= H|last9= Pedersen|first9= JI |displayauthors=9[/tpl]

Flaxseed (or linseed) (Linum usitatissimum) and its oil are perhaps the most widely available botanical source of the omega-3 fatty acid ALA. Flaxseed oil consists of approximately 55% ALA, which makes it six times richer than most fish oils in omega-3 fatty acids.[tpl]cite book|author=Thomas Bartram|title=Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine: The Definitive Guide to the Herbal Treatments of Diseases|date=September 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-1-56924-550-7 | pages = 271[/tpl] A portion of this is converted by the body to EPA and DHA, though the actual converted percentage may differ between men and women.[tpl]cite pmid | 22089435[/tpl]

===Eggs===

Eggs produced by hens fed a diet of greens and insects contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than those produced by chickens fed corn or soybeans. In addition to feeding chickens insects and greens, fish oils may be added to their diets to increase the omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in eggs.[ref]

The addition of green algae or seaweed to the diets boosts the content of DHA and EPA content, which are the forms of omega-3 approved by the FDA for medical claims. A common consumer complaint is "Omega-3 eggs can sometimes have a fishy taste if the hens are fed marine oils."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/03/egg-taste-test-says-no-di_n_599286.html |title=Washington Post's Egg Taste Test Says Homegrown And Factory Eggs Taste The Same POLL |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2010-06-03|accessdate=2011-01-03 |first=Colin |last=Sterling[/tpl]

===Meat===

Omega 3 fatty acids are formed in the chloroplasts of green leaves and algae. While seaweeds and algae are the source of omega 3 fatty acids present in fish, grass is the source of omega 3 fatty acids present in grass fed animals.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1038/187511b0 | title = Fatty Acid Composition of the Lipids of Pasture Grasses | year = 1960 | last1 = Garton | first1 = G. A. | journal = Nature | volume = 187 | issue = 4736 | pages = 511[/tpl] When cattle are taken off omega 3 fatty acid rich grass and shipped to a feedlot to be fattened on omega 3 fatty acid deficient grain, they begin losing their store of this beneficial fat. Each day that an animal spends in the feedlot, the amount of omega 3 fatty acids in its meat is diminished.[tpl]cite journal | author = Duckett, S. K., D. G.

The omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio of grass-fed beef is about 2:1, making it a more useful source of omega-3 than grain-fed beef, which usually has a ratio of 4:1.
In a 2009 joint study by the USDA and researchers at Clemson University in South Carolina, grass-fed beef was compared with grain-finished beef. The researchers found that grass-finished beef is higher in moisture content, 42.5% lower total lipid content, 54% lower in total fatty acids, 54% higher in beta-carotene, 288% higher in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), higher in the B-vitamins thiamin and riboflavin, higher in the minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium, 193% higher in total omega-3s, 117% higher in CLA (cis-9 trans-11, which is a potential cancer fighter), 90% higher in vaccenic acid (which can be transformed into CLA), lower in the saturated fats linked with heart disease, and has a healthier ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (1.65 vs 4.84). Protein and cholesterol content were equal.[tpl]cite journal | author = S.K.

In most countries, commercially available lamb is typically grass-fed, and thus higher in omega-3 than other grain-fed or grain-finished meat sources. In the United States, lamb is often finished (i.e., fattened before slaughter) with grain, resulting in lower omega-3.
The omega-3 content of chicken meat may be enhanced by increasing the animals' dietary intake of grains high in omega-3, such as flax, chia, and canola.[tpl]cite journal | author = Azcona, J.O., Schang, M.J., Garcia, P.T., Gallinger, C., R.

Kangaroo meat is also a source of omega-3, with fillet and steak containing 74 mg per 100 g of raw meat.

===Mammalian brains and eyes===

The brains and eyes of mammals are extremely rich in DHA as well as other omega-3 fatty acids.[tpl]cite web|title=DHA in Brain and Retina Structure|url=http://www.dha-in-mind.com/Portals/0/PDF%20Files/DHA_inbrain_and_retinastructure.pdf[/tpl] DHA is a major structural component of the mammalian brain, and is in fact the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in the brain.[tpl]cite web|title=Nutrition for the Brain|url=http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ftp/articles/caudatecomm.pdf[/tpl]
