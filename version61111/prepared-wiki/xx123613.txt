Aylestone Road is a cricket stadium in Leicester, England. 
It was for many years the home to Leicestershire County Cricket Club. It was first used in 1901 after it was decided that Grace Road was too far from the centre of the city. It hosted 401 first-class cricket games during its time; 398 of them were held before the Second World War. 
The ground was damaged during the war and was also partially used for industrial development, so the county side returned to Grace Road from 1946. Nevertheless, Leicestershire did play two Championship matches at Aylestone Road in 1957 and a final game in 1962 against Cambridge University. 
The ground is still used for cricket. Its playing area is greatly reduced, but the pavilion still stands. It is now used by local men's and youth cricketers' teams. The ground also has the names 'Greyfriars Sports and Social Club' and 'The Leicester Electricity Sports'. It is on a uniquely named road - Raw Dykes Road, referring to the remains of a Roman aqueduct in south Leicester.http://www.electricitysports.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=27.
