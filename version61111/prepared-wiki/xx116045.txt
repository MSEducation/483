In mathematics, a Heegner point is a point on a modular curve that is the image of a quadratic imaginary point of the upper half-plane. They were defined by Bryan Birch and named after Kurt Heegner, who used similar ideas to prove Gauss's conjecture on imaginary quadratic fields of class number one.
The Gross–Zagier theorem [tpl]harv|Gross|Zagier|1986[/tpl] describes the height of  Heegner points in terms of a derivative of the L-function of the elliptic curve at the point s = 1. In particular if the elliptic curve has (analytic) rank 1, then the Heegner points can be used to construct a rational point on the curve of infinite order (so the Mordell–Weil group has rank at least 1). More generally, [tpl]harvtxt|Gross|Kohnen|Zagier|1987[/tpl] showed that Heegner points could be used to construct rational points on the curve for each positive integer n, and the heights of these points were the coefficients of a modular form of weight 3/2. 
Kolyvagin later used Heegner points to construct Euler systems, and used this to prove much of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for rank 1 elliptic curves. Shouwu Zhang generalized the Gross–Zagier theorem from elliptic curves to the case of modular abelian varieties. Brown proved the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for most rank 1 elliptic curves over global fields of positive characteristic. [tpl]harv|Brown|1994[/tpl]
Heegner points can be used to compute very large rationals points on rank 1 elliptic curves (see [tpl]harv|Watkins|2006[/tpl] for a survey) that could not be found by naive methods. Implementation of the algorithm is available in Magma and PARI/GP
