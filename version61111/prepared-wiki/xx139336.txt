Terza Categoria is the name of the lowest level of "amateur" football in Italy.  It is considered to be the 10th and lowest level in the Italian football league system. Each individual league winner within the Terza Categoria level progresses to their closest regional league in the Seconda Categoria level.  Unlike all the levels above the Terza Categoria, there is no relegation.  
This level of Italian football is completely amateur and is run on a provincial level from the Local and Provincial Committees. It is also the only Italian football division where head coaches are not requested to own any license released by the federation.
In theory, this is the final league in Italy from which a team can go all the way and become Serie A champions.

==Birth of Terza Categoria==

Because of the birth of the "Amateur League" (Italian = Lega Nazionale Dilettanti) in 1959, the Second Division (in Italian = Seconda Divisione) was converted into the Third Category (in Italian = Terza Categoria).
