Hugo Miguel Pereira de Almeida (born 23 May 1984) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Beşiktaş J.K. in the Süper Lig, as a centre forward.
After failing to establish himself at F.C. Porto, being loaned several times during his contract, he made a name for himself in Germany with Werder Bremen, where he would remain for four seasons, reaching one UEFA Cup final and scoring more than 50 official goals. 
Making his debut for the Portuguese national team in 2004, aged 20, Almeida appeared at the 2010 World Cup and two European Championships.

==Club career==

===Portugal===

Born in Figueira da Foz, Almeida started playing football for hometown club Associação Naval 1º de Maio, before being signed by F.C. Porto. He made his first division debut in a 2–0 home win over S.L. Benfica on 21 September 2003, playing three minutes; however, unable to settle at first, he had loan spells with União de Leiria (with which he had already played in the previous season, also on loan) and Boavista FC.
Almeida returned to Porto for the 2005–06 campaign, having a relatively important role in a side that was crowned national champions. During that season's UEFA Champions League he scored a spectacular goal from a 35-metre free-kick against Inter Milan at the San Siro, albeit in a 1–2 loss.

===Werder Bremen===

Almeida served another loan stint in the 2006–07 season, with a solid first year at the Bundesliga's SV Werder Bremen,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=436275.html|title=Almeida made for Bremen|publisher=UEFA.com|date=12 July 2006|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] where he rejoined former Porto teammate Diego. He totalled ten goals in 41 appearances (in all competitions), including one in a 1–2 home loss against RCD Espanyol in the campaign's UEFA Cup semi-finals, his shot floating over the goalkeeper and into the net in an eventual 2–4 aggregate defeat;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=304598|title=Sevilha e Espanyol na final|trans_title=Sevilha and Espanyol in the final|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] after seeing his chances at Porto definitely cut down with the arrival of strikers Edgar and Ernesto Farías in August 2007, he decided to accept Bremen's offer for a permanent switch, penning a four-year deal worth €4 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=540858.html|title=Almeida earns Bremen deal|publisher=UEFA.com|date=21 May 2007|accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl] 
With the departure of Miroslav Klose, who signed for FC Bayern Munich,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=555637.html|title=Klose heeds Bayern call at last|publisher=UEFA.com|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] Almeida's chances of first-team action improved dramatically, and he started the 2007–08 season in scoring fashion, netting seven times in his first 12 league games, including two goals in a 4–1 win against defending champions VfB Stuttgart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/224796/report.html?soccernet=true&cc=5739|title=Werder Bremen 4–1 VfB Stuttgart|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=22 September 2007|accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl] He would finish the season with 16 goals in all competitions – 11 in the league, as his club finished second behind Bayern – only surpassed in the team by Diego's 17.
In 2008–09, another solid season: Almeida scored nine goals in the league, adding four in just five matches for the eventual cup winners – his first Bremen honour – namely a hat-trick against amateurs Eintracht Nordhorn, in a 9–3 away success.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=352952|title=Hugo Almeida marca 3 golos em massacre do Bremen|trans_title=Hugo Almeida scores 3 goals in Bremen's massacre|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=9 August 2009|accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] In the Champions League, he netted two more, being named the "Fans' Man of the Match" in the 2–2 away draw against Anorthosis Famagusta FC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2009/round=15276/match=302756/index.html|title=Almeida brings Anorthosis back to earth|publisher=UEFA.com|date=26 November 2008|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] As Werder Bremen was "demoted" to the UEFA Cup, he contributed with one goal in eight games as the team went all the way to the final but, after receiving a yellow card in the 3–2 win at Hamburger SV in the semifinals (3–3 aggregate win), he missed the decisive match against FC Shakhtar Donetsk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/soccer/05/07/uefa.roundup.ap/index.html|title=Bremen, Shakhtar advance to UEFA Cup final|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=28 October 2010[/tpl]
Alternating starts with appearances from the bench, Almeida once again scored in double digits in the 2009–10 season, netting seven goals in the domestic league for a total of 11, as Bremen finished third and qualified to the Champions League play-off round, with the player assisting Peruvian Claudio Pizarro in the third goal of the clash against U.C. Sampdoria (3–1 home win in the first leg, eventual 3–2 aggregate win).
Almeida started the 2010–11 campaign netting six times in the first ten league games. On 28 November 2010 he took his total to nine, after scoring three in a home win against FC St. Pauli (3–0) – in the dying minutes of the fixture, he was sent off after elbowing an opponent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/296955/report.html?soccernet=true&cc=5739|title=Werder Bremen 3–0 St Pauli|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl]

===Beşiktaş===

On Christmas Eve 2010, after scoring 11 goals in 21 official games for Bremen during the season, Almeida joined Beşiktaş J.K. in the Süper Lig, after agreeing to a three-and-a-half-year contract for €2 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11888_6610738,00.html|title=Besiktas make Almeida swoop|publisher=Sky Sports|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bjk.com.tr/tr/haberler.php?h_no=19252|title=Hugo Almeida Beşiktaş’ta|trans_title=Hugo Almeida a Beşiktaş player|publisher=Beşiktaş JK|language=Turkish|date=24 December 2010|accessdate=24 December 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vFyBcBTL|archivedate=26 December 2010|deadurl=no[/tpl] On 11 May 2011, he converted his penalty in the shootout as the Istanbul team won the Turkish Cup against İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor (4–3, 2–2 after extra time).

==International career==

Almeida played at every level in international competitions, from the under-15 to the main Portuguese national team. He made his full debut in a friendly match against England on 18 February 2004, in a 1–1 tie,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=257224.html|title=Scolari gives youth a chance|publisher=UEFA.com|date=12 November 2004|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] and was also part of the Portuguese team that won the 2003 Toulon Tournament, also appearing at the 2004 and 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship finals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=416443.html|title=Pride of Porto and Portugal|publisher=UEFA.com|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
Almeida was called for Portugal's final three UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, starting against Azerbaijan and scoring his first international goal. He also netted in the follow-up, a 1–0 win over Armenia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro2012/history/season=2008/round=2241/match=83800/report=rp.html|title=Almeida takes Portugal to the brink|publisher=UEFA.com|date=17 November 2007|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] and these goals eventually proved vital, as the nation clinched a tournament spot.
In Carlos Queiroz's second stint as national side coach, Almeida scored in a 4–0 away win against Malta on 6 September 2008, in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. His importance diminished in late 2009, after the naturalization of Sporting Clube de Portugal's Liédson.
Almeida was picked for the finals in South Africa. After the first match, a 0–0 against Côte d'Ivoire, he replaced Liédson in the starting XI for the following match, but both players found the net in the 7–0 routing of North Korea on 21 June 2010, in Cape Town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/sports/soccer/22portugalgame.html|title=Portugal pours it on in second half|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl]
Almeida was selected by new manager Paulo Bento for his Euro 2012 squad, initially as third-choice after Hélder Postiga and Nélson Oliveira. After the former injured himself in the first half of the quarterfinals against Czech Republic, he replaced him,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15173/match=2003343/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Ronaldo heads Portugal into last four|publisher=UEFA.com|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] going on to start in the penalty shootout loss against Spain (0–0 after 120 minutes).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15174/match=2003378/postmatch/report/index.html#spain+survive+test+nerve+reach+final|title=Spain survive test of nerve to reach final|publisher=UEFA.com|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl]
