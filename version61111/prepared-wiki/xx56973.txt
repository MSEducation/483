In 1985, Tipper Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) with Susan Baker, wife of then United States Secretary of the Treasury James Baker, because Tipper heard her then 11-year-old daughter playing "Darling Nikki" by Prince.[tpl]cite web|title=Tipper vs. Music|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/01/02/tipper-vs-music/|work=Uncle John's Bathroom Reader Plunges into Music.|publisher=The Bathroom Reader Institute|accessdate=2 June 2012|author=Miss Cellania|date=2 January 2012[/tpl] According to an article by NPR, Gore went "before Congress to urge warning labels for records marketed to children."[tpl]cite news |url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4279560|title = Tipper Gore and Family Values|accessdate = 2007-09-12|last = Siegel|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Siegel|date = 2005-01-11|publisher = National Public Radio[/tpl] Gore explained that her purpose wasn't to put a "gag" on music but, to keep it safe for younger listeners.

In response, NPR further stated that according to Gore, she "wasn't out to censor the objectionable material" and quoted her as stating that she is "a strong believer in the First Amendment" who is calling for greater "consumer information in the marketplace."
Gore was actively involved in her husband's presidential campaign in 2000, making numerous campaign stops nationwide such as at Chicago's Taste of Polonia over Labor Day Weekend where she appeared along with Hadassah Lieberman.Taste of PoloniaCopernicus Foundation page on the festival
