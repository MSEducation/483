[[Seyfert's Sextet]]

CATEGORIES: Hickson Compact Groups, UGC objects, Serpens (constellation)

Seyfert's Sextet is a group of galaxies about 190 million light-years awayhttp://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2002/22/image/a/ in the constellation Serpens. The group appears to contain six members, but one of the galaxies is a background object and another "galaxy" is actually a separated part of one of the other galaxies. The gravitational interaction among these galaxies should continue for hundreds of millions of years. Ultimately, the galaxies will merge to form a single giant elliptical galaxy.

==Discovery==

The group was discovered by Carl Keenan Seyfert using photographic plates made at the Barnard Observatory of Vanderbilt University.  When these results were first published in 1951, this group was the most compact group ever identified.[ref]
