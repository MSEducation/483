The Greco-Roman name of Pharbaetus comes from the Egyptian p 'the' + Hor abot, a popular name for Hor-mer (Horus of two eyes). This name is reproduced under the form Karbeuthos in George of Cyprus."Descriptio orbis romani", ed. Gelzer, 706.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The original diocese was a suffragan of Leontopolis, in Augustamnica Secunda, Egypt. 
There is a record of Bishop Arbetion at Nicæa in 325,Gelzer, "Patrum nicænorum nomina", LX. and Bishop Theodorus in 1086,Renaudot, "Historia patriarcharum alexandrinorum", 458. but it is possible that the latter was bishop of another Pharbætus situated further to the west, and which according to Vansleb was equally a Coptic see. John of NikiuChronicle, CV. relates that under the Emperor Phocas (602-10) the clerics of the province killed the Greek governor Theophilus. 
It remains a Roman Catholic titular see under the name Pharbaetus.
