==Programming and Guests==

The Denver Comic Con executes one of the largest programming schedules of any major genre convention, with over 250 distinct events in 2012 and almost 300 in 2013. The convention includes celebrity panels, seminars with professional creators, actors and artists, workshops with comic book professionals, and the DCC's Reel Heroes Independent Film Series.  DCC's programming and guest line-ups are unique among conventions in that they actively promote the convention's twin missions of Community and Diversity. Among the distinct tracks of programming, for instance, the convention focused on comics and media featuring or produced by Colorado-area comics creators, women, minorities and the GLBT Community.

Like most comic book conventions, Denver Comic Con also features a large floorspace for exhibitors. Elements of the Con floor in Denver include celebrity autographs, a large artists’ alley, comic book dealers and collectibles merchants, as well as fan-based organizations like the 501st Legion. 
During the 2012 Denver Comic Con, a special message by Stan Lee was broadcast to the Con floor, announcing his status as Guest of Honor for the 2013 Denver Comic Con.[tpl]cite news|title=Stan Lee To Make Rare Colorado Appearance At Denver Comic Con |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/stan-lee-denver-comic-con-colorado_n_3103269.html|publisher=Huffington Post | date=April 17, 2013[/tpl] It was subsequently reported that Lee was forced to cancel his appearance due to a scheduling conflict with his cameo appearance in the Marvel movie The Amazing Spider-Man.
