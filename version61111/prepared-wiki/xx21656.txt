The land enclosed by the present state borders was joined to the United States of America gradually. Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory.[tpl]cite web | title = Alabama History Timeline, 1701-1800 | publisher = Alabama Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.archives.state.al.us/timeline/al1702.html | accessdate = 2009-05-18[/tpl] The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. In 1814, the Treaty of Fort Jackson opened the territory to American settlers, which in turn led to a more rapid rate of county creation. Alabama was admitted to the Union as the 22nd state in 1819.[tpl]cite web | title = Alabama History Timeline, 1801-1860 | publisher = Alabama Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.archives.state.al.us/timeline/al1801.html | accessdate = 2009-05-18[/tpl] The Alabama state legislature formed additional counties from former Indian lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama.[tpl]cite web |title=Alabama Counties: Cherokee |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/counties/cherokee.html |accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl] In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties.

The Alabama Department of Revenue's Motor Vehicle Division issues standard automobile license plates that bear a one- or two-digit number identifying the county in which the vehicle is registered. This number is given in the fourth column in the table below. The first three prefixes are reserved for the state's historically most populous counties, and thereafter proceed alphabetically. Individual license plate numbers are assigned sequentially in each licensing office. The numbers are in the format XA1111A or XXA111A, depending on whether the prefix is one or two digits.  Overflow registrations are accommodated by substituting a letter for one of the registration numbers, such that XXZ999Z is followed by XXA0A0A.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.15q.net/al.html |title=Alabama License Plates, 1969-present |accessdate=2007-08-08 |author=Nicholson, David |publisher=License Plates of North America, 1969–present[/tpl] Outdated Info for current plates (2014)
