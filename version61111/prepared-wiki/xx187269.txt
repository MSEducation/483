Alfred Schreiber (11 November 1923 – 26 November 1944), nicknamed "Bubi", was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace. He is noted for claiming the first aerial victory by a jet fighter in aviation history. He was born on 11 November 1923 in Keplachowitz.
On 26 July 1944, Leutnant Schreiber, a former Zerstörergeschwader 26 pilot, intercepted and attacked a Mosquito PR XVI, a photo-reconnaissance aircraft from No. 540 Squadron RAF, while flying Messerschmitt Me 262 A-1a W.Nr. 130 017. It is often referred to as the first aerial victory by a jet fighter in aviation history.Radinger & Schick 1993, p. 51. Although damaged, the Mosquito, did in fact, manage to return to an Allied held airfield in Italy and the aircraft was lost in the crash landing.Morgan & Weal 1998, p. 16–17. Schreiber would be credited with a further four aerial victories before being killed on 26 November 1944, making him one of the first jet aces in history.For a list of Luftwaffe jet aces, see List of German World War II jet aces. Schreiber was killed in a crash landing at Lechfeld flying the same Me 262 A-1a WNr. 130 017. His wheels caught the lip of a slit trench, causing his Me 262 to cartwheel.Morgan & Weal 1998, p. 92.
