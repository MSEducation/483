==Service in Revolution==

At the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Lippitt was chosen Lieutenant Colonel of the Rhode Island regiment and of the minutemen, which defended Prudence Island from British warships. In 1776, his regiment joined the Continental Army on George Washington's orders and went to Harlem Heights, New York. Lippitt commanded a regiment at the Battle of Princeton, Battle of White Plains and Battle of Trenton. He was eventually brevetted a brigadier general of the Continental Army by General Washington for his actions on the battlefield. He spent the winter at Morristown and returned to Rhode Island in the spring when the regiment's tour of duty expired. Upon returning to Rhode Island, Lippitt was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of Rhode Island militia in 1780, and commanded a brigade when the French troops occupied Newport. He served as a general until 1783.James N. Arnold, The Narragansett Historical Register (Heritage Books, 1998), pg. 111-113 http://books.google.com/books?id=CuuicaMM3KEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s

==After the Revolution==

After the Revolution Christopher Lippitt returned to farming for a period and was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly and was appointed justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. In the 1780s, Lippitt was dismissed from political office by voters for supporting adoption of the U.S. Constitution which was unpopular in Rhode Island at the time.Lineage book - National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Volume 4 (Daughters of the American Revolution, 1897), pg. 11  http://books.google.com/books?id=LWYZAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s  
Christopher Lippitt was an active Christian and was a member of the local Methodist congregation. Lippit was raised by his mother as an Episcopalian. He was introduced to the Methodists by his brother Charles, while serving in New York during the Revolutionary War. In 1791 Christopher Lippitt invited Jesse Lee, a prominent Methodist evangelist, to preach and teach a class at his house. Lippit's wife and daughter became Methodists at this time. In 1800 Lippitt built a small meeting house on his farm to serve as a Methodist chapel.A history of the Episcopal Church in Narragansett, Rhode Island: including a history of other Episcopal churches in the state, Volume 2 (DB Updike, 1907)pg. 392 http://books.google.com/books?id=wczOQRy1aB4C&source=gbs_navlinks_s Prior to this he had offered his home for use by itinerant Methodist preachers.
