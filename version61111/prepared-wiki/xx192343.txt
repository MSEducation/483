==History==

Greg Deering began learning woodworking from his father at the age of two by watching him build model airplanes.
At the age of 12, he purchased his first banjo by investing a months pay from his paper route into a used banjo. He learned to play Kingston Trio songs on his banjo with his best friend Tom playing guitar.
Greg Deering made his first banjo as an industrial arts major at San Diego State College. In 1970, at 19 years of age he joined other college students at the American Dream Co-Op and began doing instrument repairs and building banjos. This co-op would become the birth place of Taylor Guitars and Deering Banjos. Greg and Janet started the Deering Banjo Company in 1975 as a family business. Their daughter, Jamie Deering works with them managing artist relations.
The lower priced and simplified Goodtime Series was introduced in 1996 to provide quality banjos for travel and learning. Named "Goodtime" because that was the purpose, a durable light weight banjo that is affordable and can be taken anywhere for having a good time. 
In 2001 the company relocated from Lemon Grove to a new 18,000 sq.ft. factory in Spring Valley, California. They have produced more than 80,000 banjos since their beginning in 1975. The Deerings and their 38 employees have a combined 200 years of banjo making experience.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deeringbanjos.com/about-us |title=About the Deering Banjo Company |accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl]
