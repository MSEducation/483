Lorraine Ming "Lorrie" Fair (born August 5, 1978) was a member of the World Cup Champion United States national soccer team. Over the span of ten years, she was a part of one World Cup Team and three Olympic teams, and retired from international play in 2005.
Her twin sister, Veronica (Ronnie) Ching Fair, (now Veronica Fair Sullins) was also a member of the national team, and when Ronnie was called in to participate in a game against England on May 9, 1997 at San Jose, California, it became the first time a pair of sisters played together in the Women's National Team.

==Early career==

Lorrie and Ronnie both participated on Los Altos High School's female soccer team in Los Altos, California, where they grew up. They were born at Stanford Hospital, but moved to New York for three years before returning to the Bay Area in 1982. While Ronnie chose Stanford to go to college, Lorrie decided on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill instead, but not before being a two time NSCAA all-American and Parade magazine all-American. At UNC, she was picked as one of Soccer America's freshmen of the year, and she helped lead UNC to the NCAA championship in 1996, 1997, and 1999.[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |title=2.

==National team career==

She joined the Under 20 national team in 1994, playing, among other events, in the Nordic Cup. In 1995, she was a member of the West Team at the US Olympic Festival, and she was invited to train with the National team. At 17 and a senior in high school, she was named an alternate for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games team that won the Gold. Fair rejected the chance to travel as an alternate because she was upset at being cut from national coach Tony DiCicco's main 16 player squad.[tpl]Citation |last=Caparaz |first=Dean |title=U.S. Women: Wilson survives final cut |url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/16036/us-women-wilson-survives-final-cut.html|accessdate=January 4, 2014 |publisher= Soccer America|date=July 3, 1996[/tpl]
Fair had made her senior international debut against Norway in February 1996.

After sitting out the 1996 Olympic games, she earned a more permanent spot on the team and in 1999, she was the youngest member of the team that won the that year's FIFA Women's World Cup. She played every minute of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, taking home a silver medal after an overtime loss to Norway in the championship game. In her last world event, she was an alternate on the Gold Medal winning Olympic team in 2004 and then retired in 2005 with 120 international appearances.
