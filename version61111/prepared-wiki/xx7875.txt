In Christianity, a moveable feast or movable feast is an observance in a liturgical calendar that occurs on different dates in different years. The most important set of moveable feasts are a fixed number of days before or after Easter Sunday, which varies by over 40 days. In Eastern Christianity, these moveable feasts form what is called the Paschal cycle. 
Most other feast days, such as those of particular saints, are fixed feasts, held on the same date every year. However, some observances are always held on the same day of the week, and thus occur on a range of days without depending on the date of Easter. For example, the start of Advent is the Sunday nearest November 30. In addition, the observance of some fixed feasts may move a few days in a particular year to not clash with that year's date for a more important moveable feast.
