'Dahlia'' 'Bishop of Llandaff is a branching, tuberous tender perennial cultivar with dark eggplant-colored, almost black, foliage.  This produces a stunning contrast with its scarlet flowers.  The plant was first bred by Fred Tresedar, a Cardiff nurseryman.[tpl]cite web|last=Bourne|first=Val|title=My dahlias are brightening up September|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/10336336/My-dahlias-are-brightening-up-September.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl] It was selected by and named to honour Pritchard Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff, in 1924 and won the RHS Award of Garden Merit in 1928.  The plant is about 1 m tall and flowers from June until September. As with all dahlias, frost blackens its foliage, and its tubers need to be overwintered in a dry, frost-free place.
A seed strain has been produced from this plant called 'Bishops Children', they retain the dark foliage color but produce a mix of flower colors and flower shapes from single to semi-double flowers in different sizes.
