Stuart Kellett (born 12 August 1981) is an English darts player for the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).

==Career==

Kellett reached the last 16 of the 2007 Winmau World Masters, having beaten Andy Fordham among others on the way to the televised stages. He lost 1-3 in sets to the then BDO world champion Martin Adams.
He also qualified for the 2008 Zuiderduin Masters, losing both of his group games to Mareno Michels and Darryl Fitton.
In 2010, Kellett won both the Scottish Open and the Antwerp Open. His good run of form helped him to qualify for the 2010 Winmau World Masters as the second seed. He knocked out Tony West in the last 16, before defeating Ted Hankey and Martin Phillips (both in sudden-death legs) to reach the final. He lost 3-7 to Adams, who won his third consecutive World Masters title.Adams celebrates Masters treble BBC Sport
Kellett also qualified for the 2011 BDO World Darts Championship, again as the second seed. He defeated two-time semi-finalist and pub team-mate Darryl Fitton 3-0 in the first round, losing just one leg along the way. Bookmakers slashed his odds of winning the championship from 16/1 to 9/2 after this performance, but he was unable to produce the same standard against Jan Dekker in the second round and lost 4-1. During this tournament commentators and pundits began affectionately referring to Kellett as the 'cocky craftsman' (in a nod to Eric Bristow), due to his confidence on-stage in comparison to his otherwise humble nature off it.
Kellett's form took a dip after his loss to Dekker, as he dropped out of the world's top 16 and failed to qualify for the 2011 Masters or the 2012 World Championship.
In January 2012, Kellett successfully earned a Professional Darts Corporation tour card on day two of the PDC's Pro Tour 'Q School' qualifying tournament. In June, he qualified for the European Tour Event 3 after defeating Nigel Heydon and William O'Connor in the UK qualifier.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/page/NewsdeskDetail/0,,10180~2813201,00.html | title=European Tour 3 UK Qualifier  | publisher=PDC | accessdate=24 June 2012[/tpl] Kellett played Mervyn King in the first round in Düsseldorf and lost 3–6.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/page/NewsdeskDetail/0,,10180~2833117,00.html | title=European Darts Open Day One   | publisher=PDC | accessdate=6 July 2012[/tpl] He also reached the fourth European Tour Event and beat Colin Lloyd 6–4 in the first round in Stuttgart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/page/NewsdeskDetail/0,,10180~2912880,00.html | title=German Darts Masters - Day One | publisher=PDC | accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl] Kellett faced Vincent van der Voort in the second round and lost 5–6.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/page/NewsdeskDetail/0,,10180~2913350,00.html | title=German Darts Masters - Day Two | publisher=PDC | accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] Kellett won the PDC World Championship qualifier in November, beating John Bowles 5–1 in the final, seeing off a total of seven players during the event to reach the World Championship for the first time.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/12bznuiybd7fh15vfpj0rxovqx/title/world-championship-pdpa-qualifier | title=World Championship PDPA Qualifier | publisher=PDC | accessdate=26 November 2012[/tpl] He lost to van der Voort in the first round, missing a total of 21 darts at a double,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/118l9m5pe8k9c1nz8yeoc1ogq7/title/ladbrokes-wdc-day-seven | title=Ladbrokes WDC Day Seven | publisher=PDC | accessdate=20 December 2012[/tpl] and was ranked world number 66 after the event.[tpl]cite web|title=Order of Merit on 1 January 2013|url=http://www.pdc.tv/pdc-order-of-merit|work=PDC|accessdate=9 February 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/oX2c6|archivedate=9 February 2013[/tpl]
