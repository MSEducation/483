New Zealand consists of a large number of islands. 
The two main islands, which are much larger than the rest and where most of the population lives, are the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu. The latter is often referred to as the "mainland", especially by its residents, it being somewhat larger but having a lower population, although in general practice, the mainland refers to both North Island and South Island as opposed to the smaller offshore islands. Stewart Island/Rakiura is by far the biggest of the smaller islands, although Waiheke Island has the largest population of the smaller islands.
The following is a list of some of the islands of New Zealand:
