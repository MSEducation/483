===European Campaign===

Celtic went into third qualifying stage of the Champions League but failed to beat Basel. They then dropped down into the UEFA Cup where they beat teams including Blackburn Rovers, Stuttgart and Liverpool to reach the final where they lost 2–3 after extra time to Porto.

===Domestic Cups===

Celtic reached the final of the Scottish League Cup, but a late penalty miss by John Hartson meant the trophy went to Rangers. As the amount of games to be played took its toll, an inexperienced Celtic side lost to Inverness CT in the Scottish Cup.
