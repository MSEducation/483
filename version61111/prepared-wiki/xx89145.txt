Beach Boys Concert is a live album by the Beach Boys, released in 1964. It is their seventh album in all, and their third alone in the same year. What is perhaps most notable about the album is that it provided the Beach Boys with their first number one album in the US, remaining at the top for four weeks during a sixty-two week chart stay and becoming another gold seller.
Beach Boys Concert proves to be a timely release because leader and producer Brian Wilson was about to vacate his position in the live group, and would only perform sporadically with them over the course of the next three decades. It is also the only live document of the second line up of the Beach Boys in officially released LP form. It was recorded live at the Memorial Auditorium in Sacramento, CA.
The album includes several songs that The Beach Boys regularly performed live but had not previously included on an album, such as "Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow", "The Wanderer" and "Monster Mash". "The Little Old Lady from Pasadena" was actually a Jan & Dean hit.  Alongside those were a sampling of their favorites, such as "Hawaii", "In My Room", "Fun, Fun, Fun", and "I Get Around".
Studio doctoring on Beach Boys Concert is very evident, from the overdubbed vocals, and the fact that the concert also featured recordings from December 1963 (also where announcer Fred Vail's introduction comes from). Most obviously, Brian Wilson used the original music tracks for both "Fun, Fun, Fun" (which was sped up) and "I Get Around", both of which had elements removed to make them appear as though they were new performances.
Despite the shady circumstances surrounding its post-production, Beach Boys Concert is still an edgy live document and a missing link in their early discography, which captured The Beach Boys in a context that was about to change forever.
A truncated version was released on Pickwick Records as Wow! Great Concert! Beach Boys Concert (Capitol (S)TAO 2198) was paired on CD with Live in London, with bonus tracks from both periods. Bonus Tracks include "Don't Worry Baby (Live 1964)" (2:56) and "Heroes And Villains (Live 1968)" (3:47).
