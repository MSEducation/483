Liberia [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Liberia.ogg|l|aɪ|ˈ|b|ɪər|i|ə[/tpl], officially the Republic of Liberia, is a country in West Africa bordered by Sierra Leone to its west, Guinea to its north and Ivory Coast to its east. It covers an area of [tpl]convert|111369|km2|sqmi|abbr=out[/tpl] and is home to about 4 million people. English is the official language and over thirty indigenous languages are also spoken within the country. Its coastline is composed mostly of mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest.
Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as Americo-Liberians)  established a new country with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In 1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political, social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.
The country began to modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman. Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the country's economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the population continue to live below the international poverty line.

==History==

The Pepper Coast has been inhabited at least as far back as the 12th century and perhaps earlier. Mende-speaking people expanded westward from the Sudan, forcing many smaller ethnic groups southward towards the Atlantic ocean. The Dei, Bassa, Kru, Gola and Kissi were some of the earliest recorded arrivals.Runn-Marcos, K. T. Kolleholon, B. Ngovo, p. 5 This influx was compounded by the decline of the Western Sudanic Mali Empire in 1375 and later in 1591 with the Songhai Empire. Additionally, inland regions underwent desertification, and inhabitants were pressured to move to the wetter coast. These new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton spinning, cloth weaving, iron smelting, rice and sorghum cultivation, and social and political institutions from the Mali and Songhai Empires.Runn-Marcos, K. T. Kolleholon, B. Ngovo, p. 6 Shortly after the Manes conquered the region, the Vai people of the former Mali Empire immigrated into the Grand Cape Mount region. The ethnic Kru opposed the influx of Vai, forming an alliance with the Manes to stop further influx of Vai.citation needed
People along the coast built canoes and traded with other West Africans from Cap-Vert to the Gold Coast. Between 1461 and late 17th century, Portuguese, Dutch and British traders had contacts and trading posts in the region. The Portuguese named the area Costa da Pimenta ("Pepper Coast") but it later came to be known as the Grain Coast, due to the abundance of grains of melegueta pepper. European traders would barter various commodities and goods with local people. When the Kru began trading with Europeans, they initially traded in commodities, but later they actively participated in the African slave trade.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In 1820, the American Colonization Society (ACS) began sending African Americans volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. The American Colonisation Society is now widely regarded [tpl]by whom?|date=March 2014[/tpl] as being a failure in this effort - only an estimated 528 free African Americans were convinced to move to Liberia.[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl] These free African Americans came to identify themselves as Americo-Liberian, developing a cultural tradition infused with American notions of racial supremacy, and political republicanism.[tpl]cite web |last=Wegmann|first=Andrew N|title=Christian Community and the Development of an Americo-Liberian Identity, 1824-1878|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06092010-200522/|publisher=Louisiana State University[/tpl] The ACS, a private organization supported by prominent American politicians such as Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and James Monroe, believed repatriation was preferable to emancipation of slaves.Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997).

ISBN 0-8223-1992-6 Similar organizations established colonies in Mississippi-in-Africa and the Republic of Maryland, which were later annexed by Liberia. On July 26, 1847, the settlers issued a Declaration of Independence and promulgated a constitution, which, based on the political principles denoted in the United States Constitution, created the independent Republic of Liberia.[tpl]cite book |last1=Johnston |first1=Harry Hamilton |last2=Stapf |first2=Otto |title=Liberia, Volume I |publisher=Hutchinson & Co, |year=1906 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XTYbAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|isbn=1-143-31505-7[/tpl]Adekeye Adebajo (2002) Liberia's Civil War: Nigeria, ECOMOG, and Regional Security in West Africa, International Peace Academy, p. 21, ISBN 1588260526.
The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the Americo-Liberians. The 1865 Ports of Entry Act prohibited foreign commerce with the inland tribes. In 1877, the Americo-Liberian True Whig Party was the most powerful political power in the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/liberia_1_truewhigascend.htm |title=The True Whig Ascendancy |work=Global Security |accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl] Competition for office was usually contained within the party, whose nomination virtually ensured election.

In the mid-20th century, Liberia gradually began to modernize with American assistance. Both the Freeport of Monrovia and Roberts International Airport were built by U.S. personnel through the Lend-Lease program during World War II.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Marinelli |first1=Lawrence |year=1964 |title=Liberia's Open Door Policy |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=91–98[/tpl] President William Tubman encouraged foreign investment in the country, resulting in the second-highest rate of economic growth in the world during the 1950s. Liberia also began to take a more active role in international affairs. It was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and became a vocal critic of the South African apartheid regime.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899287,00.html |title=Africa: A Vote on Apartheid |work=Time |date=July 29, 1966 |accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl] Liberia also served as a proponent both of African independence from the European colonial powers and of Pan-Africanism, helping to found the Organisation of African Unity.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Adogamh |first1=Paul G. |year=July 2008 |title=Pan-Africanism Revisited: Vision and Reality of African Unity and Development |journal=African Review of Integration |volume=2 |issue=2 |url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/ua/Newsletter/EA/Vol2%20No2/Adogamhe.pdf |accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl]
On April 12, 1980, a military coup led by Master Sergeant Samuel Doe of the Krahn ethnic group overthrew and killed President William R. Tolbert, Jr.. Doe and the other plotters later executed a majority of Tolbert's cabinet and other Americo-Liberian government officials and True Whig Party members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/liberia/essays/uspolicy/ |title=Global Connections: Liberia |publisher=PBS |year=2002 |accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl] The coup leaders formed the People's Redemption Council (PRC) to govern the country. A strategic Cold War ally, Doe received significant financial backing from the United States while critics condemned the PRC for corruption and political repression. After the country adopted a new constitution in 1985, Doe was elected president in subsequent elections that were internationally condemned as fraudulent.  On November 12, 1985, a failed counter-coup was launched by Thomas Quiwonkpa, whose soldiers briefly occupied the national radio station.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050633,00.html |title=World Notes |work=Time |date=November 25, 1985 |accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl] Government repression intensified in response, as Doe's troops executed members of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups in Nimba County.
The National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a rebel group led by Charles Taylor, launched an insurrection in December 1989 against Doe's government with the backing of neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire, triggering the First Liberian Civil War.[tpl]cite book |last=Ellis |first=Stephen |title=The Mask of Anarchy Updated Edition: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |page=75 |isbn=0-8147-2238-5[/tpl] By September 1990, Doe's forces controlled only a small area just outside the capital, and Doe was captured and executed that month by rebel forces.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1043500.stm |title=Liberia country profile |newspaper=BBC News |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011[/tpl] The rebels soon split into various factions fighting one another, and the Economic Community Monitoring Group under the Economic Community of West African States organized a military task force to intervene in the crisis. From 1989 to 1996 one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars ensued, claiming the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and displacing a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995 leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.
Under Taylor's leadership, Liberia became internationally known as a pariah state due to the use of blood diamonds and illegal timber exports to fund the Revolutionary United Front in the Sierra Leone Civil War.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2961390.stm |title=Arrest warrant for Liberian leader |work=BBC News |date=June 4, 2003 |accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl] The Second Liberian Civil War began in 1999 when Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, a rebel group based in the northwest of the country, launched an armed insurrection against Taylor.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/liberia/ |title=Indepth: Liberia, Land of the free |newspaper=CBC News |date=March 29, 2006 |date=July 23, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] In March 2003, a second rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia, began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast.

==Geography==

Liberia is situated in West Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean to the country's southwest. It lies between latitudes 4° and 9°N, and longitudes 7° and 12°W.
The landscape is characterized by mostly flat to rolling coastal plains that contain mangroves and swamps, which rise to a rolling plateau and low mountains in the northeast.[tpl]cite book|last=Bateman|first=Graham|coauthors=Victoria Egan, Fiona Gold, and Philip Gardner|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=New York|year=2000|page=161|isbn=1-56619-291-9[/tpl] Tropical rainforests cover the hills, while elephant grass and semi-deciduous forests make up the dominant vegetation in the northern sections. The equatorial climate is hot year-round with heavy rainfall from May to October with a short interlude in mid-July to August. During the winter months of November to March, dry dust-laden harmattan winds blow inland, causing many problems for residents.
Liberia's watershed tends to move in a southwestern pattern towards the sea as new rains move down the forested plateau off the inland mountain range of Guinée Forestière, in Guinea. Cape Mount near the border with Sierra Leone receives the most precipitation in the nation. The country's main northwestern boundary is traversed by the Mano River while its southeast limits are bounded by the Cavalla River. Liberia's three largest rivers are St. Paul exiting near Monrovia, the river St. John at Buchanan and the Cestos River, all of which flow into the Atlantic. The Cavalla is the longest river in the nation at [tpl]convert|515|km|mi|disp=flip[/tpl].
The highest point wholly within Liberia is Mount Wuteve at [tpl]convert|1440|m|ft|0|disp=flip[/tpl] above sea level in the northwestern Liberia range of the West Africa Mountains and the Guinea Highlands. However, Mount Nimba near Yekepa, is higher at [tpl]convert|1752|m|ft|0|disp=flip[/tpl] above sea level but is not wholly within Liberia as Nimba shares a border with Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and is their tallest mountain as well.Financial Time's World Desk Reference (2004) Dorling Kindersley Publishing. p 368

===Counties and districts===

Liberia is divided into fifteen counties, which, in turn, are subdivided into districts and further subdivided into clans. The oldest counties are Grand Bassa and Montserrado, both founded in 1839 prior to Liberian independence. Gbarpolu is the newest county, created in 2001. Nimba is the largest of the counties in size at [tpl]convert|11551|km2|disp=flip[/tpl], while Montserrado is the smallest at [tpl]convert|1909|km2|disp=flip[/tpl]. Montserrado is also the most populous county with 1,144,806 residents as of the 2008 census.
The fifteen counties are administered by superintendents appointed by the president. The Constitution calls for the election of various chiefs at the county and local level, but these elections have not taken place since 1985 due to war and financial constraints.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7187906.stm |title=Liberia cannot afford local polls |newspaper=BBC News |date=January 14, 2008[/tpl]

==Politics==

The government of Liberia, modeled on the government of the United States, is a unitary constitutional republic and representative democracy as established by the Constitution. The government has three co-equal branches of government: the executive, headed by the president; the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Legislature of Liberia; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and several lower courts.
The president serves as head of government, head of state and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/li.html |title=Liberia  |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] Among the other duties of the president are to sign or veto legislative bills, grant pardons, and appoint Cabinet members, judges and other public officials. Together with the vice president, the president is elected to a six-year term by majority vote in a two-round system and can serve up to two terms in office.
The Legislature is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House, led by a speaker, has 73 members apportioned among the 15 counties on the basis of the national census, with each county receiving a minimum of two members. Each House member represents an electoral district within a county as drawn by the National Elections Commission and is elected by a plurality of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term. The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators. Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected at-large by a plurality of the popular vote. The vice president serves as the President of the Senate, with a President pro tempore serving in his absence.
Liberia's highest judicial authority is the Supreme Court, made up of five members and headed by the Chief Justice of Liberia. Members are nominated to the court by the president and are confirmed by the Senate, serving until the age of 70. The judiciary is further divided into circuit and speciality courts, magistrate courts and justices of the peace.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6618.htm |title=Background Note: Liberia |work=Bureau of African Affairs |publisher=United States Department of State |date=March 8, 2011[/tpl] The judicial system is a blend of common law, based on Anglo-American law, and customary law. An informal system of traditional courts still exists within the rural areas of the country, with trial by ordeal remaining common despite being officially outlawed.
Between 1877 and 1980, the government was dominated by the True Whig Party. Today, over 20 political parties are registered in the country, based largely around personalities and ethnic groups. Most parties suffer from poor organizational capacity. The 2005 elections marked the first time that the president's party did not gain a majority of seats in the Legislature.
Liberia scored a 3.3 on a scale from 10 (highly clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index. This gave it a ranking 87th of 178 countries worldwide and 11th of 47 in Sub-Saharan Africa.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010 |title=2010 Corruption Perceptions Index |work=Transparency International |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl] This score represented a significant improvement since 2007, when the country scored 2.1 and ranked 150th of 180 countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2007 |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2007 |work=Transparency International |year=2007 |accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl] When seeking attention of a selection of service providers, 89% of Liberians had to pay a bribe, the highest national percentage in the world according to the organization's 2010 Global Corruption Barometer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/gcb/2010/results |title=Global Corruption Barometer 2010 |work=Transparency International |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl]

===Military===

The Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) are the armed forces of the Republic of Liberia. Founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, the military was retitled in 1956. For virtually all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of the armed forces in the developing world.

===Foreign relations with United Kingdom===

The foreign relations of Liberia are handled by various governmental ministries. The UK was amongst the first to recognise the new republic. After the visit to the UK in 1848 of President Roberts, Queen Victoria put the Royal Navy ship HMS Amazon at the disposal of him and his family, for his return journey to Liberia.The Times. Monday, Dec 25, 1848; pg. 8; Issue 20055
In 1961, Queen Elizabeth II made a state visit to Liberia, arriving at Monrovia on the HMY Britannia.The Times Oct 06, 1961; pg. 14, Nov 21, 1961; pg. 8; Issue 55244.

==Economy and infrastructure==

The Central Bank of Liberia is responsible for printing and maintaining the Liberian dollar, which is the primary form of currency in Liberia.
Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries, with a formal employment rate of only 15%. GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US$496, when it was comparable to Egypt's (at the time).[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/countries/LR-EG?display=graph |title=GDP per capita (current US$) |Data |Graph |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] In 2011, the country's nominal GDP was US$1.154 billion, while nominal GDP per capita stood at US$297, the third-lowest in the world. Historically, the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore, rubber and timber.
Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup.[tpl]cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201106140356.html|title=The Challenges of Post-War Reconstruction - the Liberian Experience|work=Government of Liberia|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=June 13, 2011[/tpl] This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989;  GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history. Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=41&pr.y=12&sy=2000&ey=2016&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=668&s=NGDP_RPCH%2CPCPIPCH&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects: Liberia|work=International Monetary Fund|date=June 20, 2011[/tpl] The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10373.pdf|title=IMF Country Report No. 10/37|work=International Monetary Fund|year=2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/africa/news-entry/liberian-president-government-and-people-are-partners-in-progress/|title=Liberian President: Government and People are Partners in Progress|work=Africa Governance Initiative|date=January 27, 2011[/tpl] Current impediments to growth include a small domestic market, lack of adequate infrastructure, high transportation costs, poor trade links with neighboring countries and the high dollarization of the economy. Liberia used the United States dollar as its currency from 1943 until 1982 and continues to use the U.S. dollar alongside the Liberian dollar.[tpl]cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:rjgZxrEkytAJ:www.countrycompass.com/_docs/assessments/Liberia_Economic_Recovery_Assessment.pdf+Liberian+dollar+1982&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgB5jM-McEY_lEOfi7dtjUAbUY3FHNMS-1b7c1mewxokLnC7PucnxlcZgbC4H60-44s9Kyw4SlVD0s8pI0lznK8MH_FSOPkOAEW8OgbhuDeI2kiEZ81wf4E0kNLQHndpFSE3jFO&sig=AHIEtbRULHwk2ifRoYIE__U6MRXyGwsreQ|title=Liberia Economic Recovery Assessment|work=USAID|date=July 2008[/tpl] Following a decrease in inflation beginning in 2003, inflation spiked in 2008 as a result of worldwide food and energy crises,[tpl]cite web |url=http://mof.gov.lr/doc/Published%20Fiscal%20Outturns.pdf|title=Quarter Three Fiscal Outturn, Fiscal Year 2010/11|work=Ministry of Finance|date=May 2011[/tpl]  reaching 17.5% before declining to 7.4% in 2009.
