Chrysler Group LLC [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|s|l|ər[/tpl] is an American automobile manufacturer headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Italian multinational automaker Fiat S.p.A.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140121/OEM/140129980/fiat-completes-chrysler-acquisition-in-4-35-billion-deal#axzz2r8024er1 |title=Fiat completes Chrysler acquisition in $4.35 billion deal |publisher=Autonews.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] Chrysler was one of the "Big Three" American automobile manufacturers. It sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship Chrysler brand, as well as the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram brands; it also manufactures vehicles sold under the Fiat brand in North America. Other major divisions of Chrysler include Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division. In 2011, Chrysler Group (not including Fiat) was the twelfth biggest automaker in the world by production.[tpl]cite web|url= http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking.pdf |title=World motor vehicle production OICA correspondants survey without double counts world ranking of manufacturers year 2011[/tpl]
The Chrysler Corporation was founded by Walter Chrysler in 1925,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/|title=Chrysler Reviews and History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008[/tpl] out of what remained of the Maxwell Motor Company. Chrysler greatly expanded in 1928, when it acquired the Fargo truck company and the Dodge Brothers Company and began selling vehicles under those brands; that same year it also established the Plymouth and DeSoto automobile brands. In the 1970s, a number of factors including the 1973 oil crisis impacted Chrysler's sales, and by the late 1970s, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy. Lee Iacocca was brought in as CEO and is credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.
In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz AG to form DaimlerChrysler; the merger proved contentious with investors and Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007. Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was hit hard by the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler had repaid what it borrowed from the U.S. government five years early. January 1, 2014, Fiat announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat.

==History==

The Chrysler company was founded by Walter Chrysler (1875–1940) on June 6, 1925,[tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Mike |last2=Tell |first2=David |title=The Technology Century: 100 years of The Engineering Society 1895–1995 | publisher=Engineering Society of Detroit |year=1995 |page=53 |isbn=978-1-56378-022-6[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last=Lockwood |first=Cliff |url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html | title=Early Chrysler Corporate History: 1903–1928 |date=October 18, 1968 |publisher=Chrysler Club pages |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 30, 2012[/tpl] when the Maxwell Motor Company (est. 1904) was re-organized into the Chrysler Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html |title=A Brief Look at Walter P.

Walter Chrysler arrived at the ailing Maxwell-Chalmers company in the early 1920s. He was hired to overhaul the company's troubled operations (after a similar rescue job at the Willys-Overland car company).[tpl]cite book|editor-last=Kimes |editor-first=Beverly R. |editor2-last=Clark, Jr. | editor2-first=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942 |year=1996 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=978-0-87341-428-9 |page=292[/tpl] In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended.Kimes, p. 257.
In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The Chrysler was a 6-cylinder automobile, designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, but at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable to a prototype which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure).Kimes, pp. 292, 1498. The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time.[tpl]cite web|last=Zatz |first=David |title=Chrysler Technological Innovations |url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/technology.html |accessdate=April 30, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Yost|first=Mark|title=A Nation of Drivers|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577187152424740014.html |date=January 31, 2012 |page=D5 |accessdate=April 30, 2012[/tpl] Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed, and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.
Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.
Following the introduction of the Chrysler, the Maxwell brand was dropped after the 1925 model year. The new, lower-priced four-cylinder Chryslers introduced for the 1926 year were badge-engineered Maxwells.Kimes, pp. 292–293, 901 The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation cars helped to push the company to the second-place position in U.S. sales by 1936, a position it would last hold in 1949.
In 1928, the Chrysler Corporation began dividing its vehicle offerings by price class and function. The Plymouth brand was introduced at the low-priced end of the market (created essentially by once again reworking and rebadging Chrysler's four-cylinder model).Kimes, pp. 296, 1156. At the same time, the DeSoto brand was introduced in the medium-price field. Also in 1928, Chrysler bought the Dodge Brothers[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timelessrides.com/wiki/dodge |title=Dodge Car History, Car Data, Information, Pictures |publisher=Timeless Rides |accessdate=April 30, 2012[/tpl] automobile and truck company and continued the successful Dodge line of automobiles and Fargo range of trucks. By the mid-1930s, the DeSoto and Dodge divisions would trade places in the corporate hierarchy.
The Imperial name had been used since 1926, but was never a separate make, just the top-of-the-line Chrysler. In 1955, the company decided to spin it off as its own make and division to better compete with its rivals, Lincoln and Cadillac.
On April 28, 1955, Chrysler and Philco had announced the development and production of the World’s First All-Transistor car radio.[tpl]cite news|title=Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 28, 1955 |page=1[/tpl] The all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, was developed and produced by Chrysler and Philco, and was an $150.00 "option" on the 1956 Imperial car models. Philco was the company, who had manufactured the all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, starting in the fall of 1955 at its Sandusky Ohio plant, for the Chrysler corporation.[tpl]cite web|last=Hirsh |first=Rick |url= http://www.allpar.com/stereo/Philco/index.html |title=Philco's All-Transistor Mopar Car Radio |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_mopar_914_hr_ch_c_5690hr.html |title=Mopar 914-HR Ch= C-5690HR Car Radio Philco, Philadelphia |language=German |publisher=Radiomuseum.org |accessdate=January 2, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.chryslergroupllc.com/company/Heritage/Pages/Chrysler-Heritage-1950.aspx |title=Chrysler Heritage 1950-1959 |publisher=Chrysler Group LLC |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl]
On September 28, 1957, Chrysler had announced the first production electronic fuel injection (EFI), as an option on some of its new 1958 car models (Chrysler 300D, Dodge D500, DeSoto Adventurer, Plymouth Fury). The first attempt to use this system was by American Motors on the 1957 Rambler Rebel.[tpl]cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |date=March 1957 |volume=170|issue=3 |pages=88–93 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1957+Rambler+fuel+injection |accessdate=June 24, 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |title=Rambler Measures Up |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl] Bendix Corporation's Electrojector used a transistor computer brain modulator box, but teething problems on pre-production cars meant very few cars were made.[tpl]cite book|last=Aird |first=Forbes |title=Bosch fuel injection systems |publisher=HP Trade|year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-1-55788-365-0 [/tpl] The EFI system in the Rambler ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures and AMC decided not to use this EFI system, on its 1957 Rambler Rebel production cars that were sold to the public. Chrysler also used the Bendix "Electrojector" fuel injection system and only around 35 vehicles were built with this option, on its 1958 production built car models.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=September 29, 1957 |page=A9 |title=New Chrysler Fuel System Is Introduced [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/desoto/electrojector.html |publisher=Allpar.com |title=1958 DeSoto Electrojector - World’s First Electronic Fuel Injection? |accessdate=June 24, 2013 [/tpl]
Imperial would see new body styles introduced every two to three years, all with V8 engines and automatic transmissions, as well as technologies that would filter down to Chrysler corporation's other models. Imperial was folded back into the Chrysler brand in 1973.
The Valiant was also introduced for 1960 as a distinct brand. In the U.S. market, Valiant was made a model in the Plymouth line for 1961 and the DeSoto make was discontinued during 1961. With those exceptions per applicable year and market, Chrysler's range from lowest to highest price from the 1940s through the 1970s was Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial.[tpl]cite web |title=Chrysler Brands, Subsidiaries, and Related Companies |publisher=Allpar |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/auto |accessdate=April 28, 2012[/tpl]
In 1985, Chrysler entered an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC) to produce Chrysler M platform rear-drive, as well as Dodge Omnis  front wheel drive cars, in AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin plant. In 1987, Chrysler acquired the 47% ownership of AMC that was held by Renault. The remaining outstanding shares of AMC were purchased on the NYSE by August 5, 1987, making the deal valued somewhere between US$1.7 billion and $2 billion depending on how costs were counted.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=dR3wmKlfnrMC&pg=PA117&dq=Chrysler+purchase+of+AMC+billion |page=117 |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012[/tpl]  Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca wanted the Jeep brand, particularly the Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ) that was under development, the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in Bramalea, Ontario, as well as AMC's engineering and management talent that became critical for Chrysler's future success.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html |title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?' |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=June 1, 1998 |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] Chrysler established the Jeep/Eagle division as a "specialty" arm to market products distinctly different from the K-car-based products with the Eagle cars targeting import buyers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/eagle.html |last=Minick |first=Dan |title=A Brief History of Eagle |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] Former AMC dealers sold Jeep vehicles and various new Eagle models, as well as Chrysler products, strengthening the automaker's retail distribution system.
In 1998, Chrysler and its subsidiaries entered into a partnership dubbed a "merger of equals" with German-based Daimler-Benz AG, creating the combined entity DaimlerChrysler AG.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/history/|title=Chrysler History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008[/tpl] To the surprise of many stockholders, Daimler subsequently acquired Chrysler in a stock swap,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/company-news-daimler-benz-and-chrysler-revise-ratio-for-stock-swap.html |title=Company News; Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Revise Ratio for Stock Swap |date=June 9, 1998 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=March 6, 2014[/tpl] before the  retirement of Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton. His lack of planning for Chrysler in the 1990s, to become their own global automotive company, is widely accepted as the reason why the merger was needed. Under DaimlerChrysler, the company was named DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC, with its U.S. operations generally called "DCX". The Eagle brand was retired shortly after Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz in 1998[tpl]cite news|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-09-30/business/9709300310_1_eagle-sales-chrysler-corp-chrysler-and-jeep-vehicles |title=Chrysler Discontinues Eagle Brand |first=Jacqueline |last=Fitzgerald |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |date=30 September 1997 |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] Jeep became a stand-alone division, and efforts were made to merge the Chrysler and Jeep brands as one sales unit.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown |first=Harold |title=Franchise Dilemmas for Automobile Dealers |journal=Oklahoma City University Law Review |year=1995 |volume=20[/tpl] In 2001, the Plymouth brand was also discontinued.
On May 14, 2007, DaimlerChrysler announced the sale of 80.1% of Chrysler Group to American private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., thereafter known as Chrysler LLC, although Daimler (renamed as Daimler AG) continued to hold a 19.9% stake."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Cerberus Takes Majority Interest in Chrysler Group and Related Financial Services Business for EUR 5.5 Billion ($7.4 billion)|publisher=DaimlerChrysler[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] The economic collapse of 2007 - 2009 pushed an already fragile company to the brink.

The sale of substantially all of Chrysler's assets to "New Chrysler", organized as Chrysler Group LLC was completed on June 10, 2009. The federal government provided support for the deal with US$8 billion in financing at near 21%. Under Sergio Marchionne, "World Class Manufacturing" or WCM, a system of complete and thorough manufacturing quality, was introduced and several products re-launched with quality and luxury. The 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee very soon became the most awarded SUV - Ever. The Ram, Jeep, Dodge, SRT and Chrysler divisions were separated to focus on their own identity and brand. 11 major refreshes occurred in 21 months. The Cruiser, Nitro, Patriot and Avenger (created during DCX) were dropped. The Italian and American headquarters seemed to work well together. Where every change with the German company failed, these massive changes with the Italians worked. On May 24, 2011, Chrysler repaid its $7.6 billion loans to the United States and Canadian governments.[tpl]cite web|url= http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2194/0001193125-11-148779.pdf |title=Chrysler, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 24, 2011 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 25, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/05/24/chrysler-repays-the-rest-of-its-federal-loans-are-suvs-to-tha/|title=Breaking: Chrysler repays the rest of its federal loans... are SUVs to thank?|accessdate=May 24, 2011|work=autoblog.com[/tpl] Being a full 5 years early, this is the only "bailout" that earned the US Taxpayer a profit.

The Chrysler 300 was badged Lancia, and with its leather appointments, all-wheel drive (AWD), 8 speed transmission, and 8.4 " touch screen controls all standard features, Lancia instantly became Fiat's high end vehicle, fitting in just below its Maseratti and Ferrari. The Dodge Caravan was absorbed into Chrysler to become the performance portion of the coveted minivan line up, while Chrysler focused again on quality and luxury with their Town and Country.
On January 1, 2014, Fiat announced it would be acquiring the remaining shares of Chrysler owned by the VEBA worth $3.65 billion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10546248/Fiat-to-take-total-control-of-Chrysler-in-3.65bn-deal.html |title=Fiat to take total control of Chrysler in $3.65bn deal |publisher=The Telegraph |date=January 1, 2014 |accessdate=January 1, 2014 |location=London[/tpl] The deal was completed on January 21, 2014.

Chrysler claimed it had notified defendant of its pending trademark application February 14, but the defendant argued Chrysler had not secured a trademark for the "Imported From Detroit" phrase. On June 18, 2011, U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow ruled that Chrysler's request didn't show that it would suffer irreparable harm or that it had a strong likelihood of winning its case. Therefore Pure Detroit's owner, Detroit retailer Moda Group LLC, can continue selling its "Imported from Detroit" products. Tarnow also noted that Chrysler doesn't have a trademark on "Imported from Detroit" and rejected the automaker's argument that trademark law isn't applicable to the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110629/CARNEWS/110629852/0/videonewsarchive |title=Chrysler loses 'Imported from Detroit' lawsuit |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Zach|last=Bowman|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/29/chrysler-legal-bid-to-halt-imported-from-detroit-merchandise-s/ |title=Chrysler legal bid to halt 'Imported From Detroit' merchandise sales falls short |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2012[/tpl] In March 2012, Chrysler Group LLC and Pure Detroit agreed to a March 27 mediation to try to settle the lawsuit over the clothing company's use of "Imported from Detroit" slogan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120319/AUTO0101/203190378/1148/auto01/Chrysler-Pure-Detroit-agree-mediation-settle-Imported-from-Detroit-suit |title=Chrysler, Pure Detroit agree to mediation to settle 'Imported from Detroit' suit |work=The Detroit News|date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=May 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] Pure Detroit stated that Chrysler has made false claims about the origins of three vehicles - Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Town & Country - none of which are built in Detroit.

Again in 2012, Chrysler advertised during the Super Bowl. Its two-minute February 5, 2012 Super Bowl XLVI advertisement was titled "Half Time in America". The ad drew criticism from several leading U.S. conservatives, who suggested that its messaging implied that President Barack Obama deserved a second term and, as such, was political payback for Obama's support for the federal bailout of the company.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_eastwood-ad-politics_1_chrysler-ad-halftime-show-america-auto-industry?_s=PM:POLITICS |first=Bryan |last=Monroe |publisher=CNN|title=Were politics buried inside Eastwood's 'Halftime' commercial? |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl] Asked about the criticism in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft, Sergio Marchionne responded "just to rectify the record I paid back the loans at 19.7% Interest.

==Electric and hybrid vehicles==

The first electric vehicle produced by Chrysler was the 1992 Dodge EPIC concept minivan. In 1993, Chrysler began to sell a limited-production electric minivan called the TEVan; however only 56 were produced. In 1997, a second generation, called the EPIC, was released. It was discontinued after 1999.
Chrysler owned the Global Electric Motorcars company, building low-speed neighborhood electric vehicles, but sold GEM to Polaris Industries in 2011.
Chrysler intended to pursue new drive concepts through ENVI, an in-house organization formed to focus on electric-drive vehicles and related technologies which was established in September 2007. In August 2009, Chrysler took US$70 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a test fleet of 220 hybrid pickup trucks and minivans. ENVI was disbanded by November 2009.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/07/us-chrysler-ev-idUSTRE5A605N20091107?sp=true |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |date=November 6, 2009 |first=Kevin |last=Krolicki |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl]

===Radar antennas===

When the Radiation Laboratory at MIT was established in 1941 to develop microwave radars, one of the first projects resulted in the SCR-584, the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a parabolic antenna six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down).
One of Chrysler’s most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army’s Signal Corps Laboratories turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler’s research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.[tpl]cite book |last=Stout |last=Wesley W. |title=The Great Detective |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946[/tpl][tpl]citation |last=Colton |first=Roger B. |title=Radar in the United States Army |publisher=Proceedings of the I.R.E. |volume=33 |pages=740–753 |year=1947 |url=http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&dirname=Radar |accessdate=April 28, 2012[/tpl]

===Missiles===

In April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at Redstone Arsenal, adjacent to Huntsville, Alabama. To form OGMC, over 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss, Texas. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by Wernher von Braun; this group had been brought to America under Project Paperclip. OGMC designed the Army's first short-range ballistic missile, the PGM-11 Redstone, based on the WWII German V-2 missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in Warren, Michigan. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live nuclear weapon, first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.Bullard, John W.; “History Of The Redstone Missile System,” Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command
Working together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the PGM-19 Jupiter, a medium-range ballistic missile. In May 1959, a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a nose cone; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with nuclear warheads, they were first deployed in Italy and Turkey during the early 1960s.[tpl]cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter |publisher=National Museum of the U.S. Air Force |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534 |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl]

===Space boosters===

In July 1959, NASA chose the Redstone missile as the basis for the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle to be used for suborbital test flights of the Project Mercury spacecraft. Three unmanned MRLV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MRLV successfully launched the chimpanzee Ham, and astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961, respectively.
America's more ambitious manned space travel plans included the design of the Saturn series of heavy-lift launch vehicles by a team headed by Wernher von Braun. Chrysler's Huntsville operation, then designated the Space Division, became Marshall Space Flight Center’s prime contractor for the first stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB versions. The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and Jupiter fuel tanks, and Chrysler built it for the Apollo program in the Michoud Assembly Facility in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world. Between October 1961 and July 1975, NASA used ten Saturn Is and nine Saturn IBs for suborbital and orbital flights, all of which were successful;Bilstein, Roger E.; Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles.
