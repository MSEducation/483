Paul Peuerl (also Bäurl, Beuerlin, Bäwerl, Agricola, Peyerl; 13 June 1570 (baptised), Stuttgart – after 1625) was a German organist, organ builder, renovator and repairer, and composer of instrumental music.
From November 1601 he was organist in Horn and from late 1609 in Steyr. He built organs in Steyr, Horn, Enns, and Wilhering. Peuerl wrote the earliest published trio sonatas outside of Italy. His work on the suite form was for his time significant and influential. In 1625 he fled Steyr for religious reasons; his fate afterwards is unknown.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Wesseley |first=Othmar |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Grove Music Online |title=Peuerl, Paul |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/21512 |accessdate=2012-06-30 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= [/tpl] (Requires account)
