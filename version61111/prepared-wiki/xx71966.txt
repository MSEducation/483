</ref> The music for ''Aradhana'' was composed by [[S. D. Burman]], and he had used Rafi as the male playback voice for the first two recorded duets, "Baaghon Mein Bahaar Hai" and "Gunguna Rahen Hain Bhanwre".<ref name="how_fair_raju2"/> After these two recordings, S. D. Burman fell ill and his son and assistant, [[R.D. Burman]], took over the recordings. R. D. Burman got [[Kishore Kumar]] to sing the solos "Roop Tera Mastana" and "Mere Sapnon Ki Rani".
During 1971-1973, Rafi's musical output decreased; however, he did sing several songs.[ref]
