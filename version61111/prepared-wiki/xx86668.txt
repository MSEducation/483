The Mask of Zorro is a 1998 American swashbuckler film based on the Zorro character created by Johnston McCulley. It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. In the story, the original Zorro (Hopkins) escapes from prison to find his long-lost daughter (Zeta-Jones) and avenge the death of his wife against the corrupt governor (Wilson). He is aided by his successor (Banderas), who also pursues his own vendetta.
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment had developed the film for TriStar Pictures with directors Mikael Salomon and Robert Rodriguez before Campbell signed on in 1996. Salomon cast Sean Connery as Don Diego de la Vega, while Rodriguez brought Banderas in the lead role. Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins, and The Mask of Zorro began filming in January 1997 at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico. The film was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 with both financial and critical success. The Legend of Zorro, a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta-Jones, and directed by Campbell, was released in 2005, but failed to receive the overall positive reception of its predecessor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270309/1023|title=The Legend of Zorro|author=Roger Ebert|date=October 28, 2005|work=rogerebert.com[/tpl]

==Plot==

In 1821, Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) a Spanish nobleman, fights against Spain in the Mexican War of Independence as Zorro, a mysterious avenger who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of Las Californias. Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson), the cruel governor of the region, learns de la Vega's identity. Arresting de la Vega in his home, his beloved wife Esperanza (Julieta Rosen) is accidentally killed by one of Montero's soldiers. Montero kills the soldier for murdering Esperanza, imprisons de la Vega, and takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own and leaves for Spain. Twenty years later, Montero returns from exile in Spain with Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has grown into a beautiful woman, by his side. He is planning to turn California into an independent republic. However, his reappearance also awakens a long-dormant de la Vega, who has spent two decades living in anonymity during his imprisonment. He escapes from prison, and as he plans his revenge on Montero, de la Vega encounters a thief, Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), who, along with his brother, greatly admired Zorro as a child and even had a small hand in the hero's last great exploit. 
After a brief period of deliberation, de la Vega decides to take Alejandro as his protégé. Inspired by the wish for revenge upon Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher), his brother's killer and Montero's right hand man, he endures the tough training regimen brilliantly. After Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling Toronado, Zorro's long deceased horse, and leaves Zorro's mark at the scene, de la Vega scolds him claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief or adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust and pose as Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, a visiting nobleman, with de la Vega posing as his servant, Bernardo. Both attend a party at Montero's hacienda, where he gains Elena's admiration and titillation and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting. There, Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States. Alejandro and the Dons are taken to a secret gold mine known as "El Dorado", where peasants and criminals are used for slave labor. 
The plan is to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna's own land. Meanwhile, de la Vega uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena: still posing as Bernardo, he learns that Montero raised her telling her that her mother died in childbirth. De la Vega sends Alejandro, as Zorro, to steal the map leading to the gold mine: he duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When Alejandro escapes, Elena attempts to retrieve Montero's map. She fights him with a sword, but he uses his sword to strip off her clothing and seduces her, leading to a passionate kiss before he flees. Terrified of Santa Anna's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold, Montero decides to destroy the mine, along with all its workers, to better hide all evidence. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that he can reclaim Elena: he corners Montero at his hacienda and reveals his identity, but is captured. 
As he is taken away, Elena, inspired by a chance encounter at the market with a woman who had been her nanny, asks Montero the name of the flower that her mother had hung about her crib: when it is de la Vega who tells Elena that it is the Romneya, she realizes he is her father. She releases de la Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine, which Zorro has begun to infiltrate. De la Vega stops Montero from shooting Zorro and the two duel. Meanwhile Zorro is confronted by Love and they duel. In the end, Alejandro avenges his brother by impaling Love with his own sword, and de la Vega sends Montero to his death by dragging him off a cliff behind a gold laden cart which crushes Love. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off, where they attend to the mortally wounded de la Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro before dying, passing the mantle of Zorro to him, and gives his blessings for Alejandro's and Elena's prospective marriage. They re-build the de la Vega hacienda and have a son named Joaquin, honoring Alejandro's brother.

===Music===

The soundtrack, released by Sony Classical Records and Epic Soundtrax, was commercially successful and propelled by the rising profile of Latin heartthrob Marc Anthony and Tina Arena. Their duet, "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You", plays in the closing credits of the film and was released as a single in Europe.[tpl]cite news | first= Adam |last= Sandler | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117478996 | title =Beastie Boys still 'Nasty'| date = 1998-07-30 | work = Variety | accessdate = 2010-10-24[/tpl] The song went #3 on the French singles and #4 on the Dutch singles charts.[tpl]cite web | title = "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You" (in French)| work=Lescharts.com | url = http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Tina+Arena+%26+Marc+Anthony&titel=I+Want+To+Spend+My+Lifetime+Loving+You&cat=s | accessdate = 2010-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.top40.nl/pdf/Top%20100/top%20100%20-%201999.pdf | title = Dutch Charts - End Of Year Charts - Top 100 Singles 1999 (written in Dutch) | work = Nederlandse Top 40 | accessdate = 2010-10-26[/tpl]

====Track listing====

===Sequel===

Both Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones reprised their roles in the 2005 sequel The Legend of Zorro.

==Historical references==

The Mask of Zorro and its sequel The Legend of Zorro incorporate certain historical events and persons into their narratives. Antonio Banderas' Alejandro is a fictional brother of Joaquin Murrieta, a real Mexican outlaw who was killed by the California State Rangers led by Harry Love (portrayed in the film as Texas Army Captain "Harrison Love") in 1853. The confrontation in the film takes place more than a decade earlier, in 1841. Murrieta's right hand man Three-Fingered Jack was also defeated by Love as in the film; however, the real person was a Mexican named Manuel Garcia rather than an Anglo-American.[tpl]cite web | last = Valdez| first = Luis| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Face of Zorro  | work = | publisher = Salon.com | date =  July 1998| url = http://www.salon.com/life/feature/1998/07/cov_22featurea3.html | doi = | accessdate = 2010-10-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  As he did in the movie, the actual Harry Love preserved both Murrieta's head and Jack's hand in large, alcohol-filled glass jars.  The opening sequence is set during the aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence, then most of the film plot is set in the earlier years prior to the Mexican–American War. Plus, an original ending on the DVD includes an appearance by Antonio López de Santa Anna, who is only mentioned in the finished film.

Richard Schickel of Time magazine praised Zorro as a summer blockbuster that pays tribute to the Classical Hollywood cinema swashbuckler films. "The action in this movie, most of which takes the form of spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," Schickel continued, "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature."[tpl]cite news | authorlink = Richard Schickel|first=Richard|last= Schickel | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988757,00.html | title = Cinema: The Mark of Excitement | work = Time | date = 1998-07-20 | accessdate = 2010-10-25[/tpl] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, rather than the other way around."[tpl]cite news | authorlink = Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last= Ebert | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980717/REVIEWS/807170302/1023 | title = The Mask of Zorro | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 1998-07-17 | accessdate = 2010-10-25[/tpl] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro "probably the best Zorro movie ever made."[tpl]cite news | authorlink = Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last= Ebert  | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270309/1023| title = The Legend of Zorro | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2005-10-28 | accessdate = 2010-10-25[/tpl]
Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found the that the actor's "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent."[tpl]cite news | authorlink = Mick LaSalle|first=Mick |last=LaSalle  | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/07/17/DD92928.DTL| title = Zzzzzz-orro: Entertaining swashbuckler a cut below exciting | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date = 1998-07-17 | accessdate = 2010-10-25[/tpl] Todd McCarthy of Variety found the film's length to be "somewhat overlong" and lacking "the snap and concision that would have put it over the top as a bang-up entertainment, but it's closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than anything that's come out of Hollywood in quite some time."[tpl]cite news | first= Todd |last=McCarthy | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117477650.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | title = The Mask of Zorro | work = Variety | date = 1998-06-25 | accessdate = 2010-10-25[/tpl]
In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film's entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences.[tpl]cite web | authorlink = Peter Travers |first=Peter|last=Travers | title = The Mask of Zorro  | work =Rolling Stone | date = 1998-07-17| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/_/id/5949275 | accessdate =2010-10-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051031062448/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/_/id/5949275 |archivedate=2005-10-31[/tpl] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. "While The Mask of Zorro isn't on the same level, it's not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders," Berardinelli continued, "there's still plenty of action, tumult, and derring-do." He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, and that it would depend on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones.[tpl]cite web | authorlink = James Berardinelli|first=James|last=Berardinelli | title = The Mask of Zorro  | work =Reel Views | date = 2000-01-01| url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1232 | accessdate =2010-10-26[/tpl]

==Lawsuit==

On January 24, 2001, Sony Pictures Entertainment filed a lawsuit in United States District Court, Central District of California, Western Division, against Fireworks Entertainment Group, the producers of the syndicated television series Queen of Swords. Sony alleged copyright infringement and other claims, saying the series "copied protectable elements from the 'Zorro' character and 'Zorro' related works". On April 5, 2001, U.S. District Judge Collins, denied Sony's motion for a preliminary injunction, noting, among other points, "that since the copyrights in Johnson McCulley's 1919 short story The Curse of Capistrano and 1920 movie The Mark of Zorro lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain." As to specific elements of The Mask of Zorro, the judge found that any similarities between the film and the TV series' secondary characters and plot elements were insufficient to warrant an injunction."Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Enter."
