Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory, which is used in artifacts and jewellery, and formerly in other items such as piano keys.  Consequently, many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered.  The ivory trade has been severely restricted by the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
