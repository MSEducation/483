===Coasts===

The Eastern Coastal Plain is a wide stretch of land lying between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. It stretches from Tamil Nadu in the south to West Bengal in the east. The Mahanadi, Godavari, Kaveri, and Krishna rivers drain these plains. The temperature in the coastal regions often exceeds [tpl]convert|30|°C|°F[/tpl], and is coupled with high levels of humidity. The region receives both the northeast monsoon and southwest monsoon rains. The southwest monsoon splits into two branches, the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The Bay of Bengal branch moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea branch moves northwards and discharges much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Annual rainfall in this region averages between [tpl]convert|1000|and|3000|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. The width of the plains varies between [tpl]convert|100|and|130|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=The Eastern Coastal Plain|url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/eco/ecp.htm|publisher=Rainwaterharvesting.org|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] The plains are divided into six regions—the Mahanadi delta, the southern Andhra Pradesh plain, the Krishna-Godavari deltas, the Kanyakumari coast, the Coromandel Coast, and sandy coastal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The Western Coastal Plain is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, ranging from [tpl]convert|50|to|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in width. It extends from Gujarat in the north and extends through Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala. Numerous rivers and backwaters inundate the region. Mostly originating in the Western Ghats, the rivers are fast-flowing, usually perennial, and empty into estuaries. Major rivers flowing into the sea are the Tapi, Narmada, Mandovi and Zuari. Vegetation is mostly deciduous, but the Malabar Coast moist forests constitute a unique ecoregion. The Western Coastal Plain can be divided into two parts, the Konkan and the Malabar Coast.

==Islands==

The Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are India's two major island formations and are classified as union territories. The Lakshadweep Islands lie [tpl]convert|200|to|300|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] off the coast of Kerala in the Arabian sea with an area of [tpl]convert|32|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. They consist of twelve atolls, three reefs, and five submerged banks, with a total of about 35 islands and islets.
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located between 6° and 14° north latitude and 92° and 94° east longitude.[tpl]cite web|title=National Portal of India: Know India: State of UTs|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_andaman.php|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] They consist of 572 isles, lying in the Bay of Bengal near the Burmese coast. They are located [tpl]convert|1255|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Kolkata (Calcutta) and [tpl]convert|193|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Cape Negrais in Burma. The territory consists of two island groups, the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands. The Andaman Islands consists of 204 small islands across a total length of [tpl]convert|352|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. India's only active volcano, Barren Island is situated here. It last erupted in May 2005. The Narcondum is a dormant volcano and there is a mud volcano at Baratang. Indira Point, India's southernmost land point, is situated in the Nicobar islands at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E, and lies just [tpl]convert|189|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Indonesian island of Sumatra, to the southeast. The highest point is Mount Thullier at [tpl]convert|642|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
Other significant islands in India include Diu daman, a former Portuguese enclave; Majuli, a river island of the Brahmaputra; Elephanta in Bombay Harbour; and Sriharikota, a barrier island in Andhra Pradesh. Salsette Island is India's most populous island on which the city of Mumbai (Bombay) is located. Forty-two islands in the Gulf of Kutch constitute the Marine National Park.

==Water bodies==

India has around 14,500 km of inland navigable waterways.[tpl]cite web|title=Introduction to Inland Water Transport|url=http://iwai.gov.in/introduction.htm|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] There are twelve rivers which are classified as major rivers, with the total catchment area exceeding [tpl]convert|2528000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. All major rivers of India originate from one of the three main watersheds:
The Himalayan river networks are snow-fed and have a perennial supply throughout the year. The other two river systems are dependent on the monsoons and shrink into rivulets during the dry season. The Himalayan rivers that flow westward into Pakistan are the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej.
The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghana system has the largest catchment area of about [tpl]convert|1,600,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|last=Elhance|first=Arun P.|title=Hydropolitics in the Third World: conflict and cooperation in international river basins|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB0ZSZjTECsC&pg=PA156|accessdate=24 April 2011|year=1999|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-878379-91-7|pages=156–158[/tpl] The Ganges Basin alone has a catchment of about [tpl]convert|1100000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Ganges originates from the Gangotri Glacier in Uttarakhand. It flows southeast, draining into the Bay of Bengal. The Yamuna and Gomti rivers also arise in the western Himalayas and join the Ganges in the plains. The Brahmaputra originates in Tibet, China, where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River (or "Tsangpo"). It enters India in the far-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, then flows west through Assam. The Brahmaputra merges with the Ganges in Bangladesh, where it is known as the Jamuna River.Brahmaputra River, Encyclopædia Britannica
The Chambal, another tributary of the Ganges, via the Yamuna, originates from the Vindhya-Satpura watershed. The river flows eastward. Westward-flowing rivers from this watershed are the Narmada and Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea in Gujarat. The river network that flows from east to west constitutes 10% of the total outflow.[tpl]clarify|date=May 2011|reason=10% of the what total outflow? paragraph also a bit confusing—easy to read it as saying the Narmada and Tapti are tributaries of the Chambal.[/tpl]
The Western Ghats are the source of all Deccan rivers, which include the Mahanadi River through the Mahanadi River Delta, Godavari River, Krishna River and Kaveri River, all draining into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers constitute 20% of India's total outflow.[tpl]cite book | title = Manorama Yearbook 2006 (India - The Country)| pages =518[/tpl]
The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, such floods have killed thousands of people and tend to cause displacements of people in such areas.
Major gulfs include the Gulf of Cambay, Gulf of Kutch, and the Gulf of Mannar. Straits include the Palk Strait, which separates India from Sri Lanka; the Ten Degree Channel, which separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands; and the Eight Degree Channel, which separates the Laccadive and Amindivi Islands from the Minicoy Island to the south. Important capes include the Kanyakumari (formerly called Cape Comorin), the southern tip of mainland India; Indira Point, the southernmost point in India (on Great Nicobar Island); Rama's Bridge, and Point Calimere. The Arabian Sea lies to the west of India, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean lie to the east and south, respectively. Smaller seas include the Laccadive Sea and the Andaman Sea. There are four coral reefs in India, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Gulf of Mannar, Lakshadweep, and the Gulf of Kutch. Important lakes include Sambhar Lake, the country's largest saltwater lake in Rajasthan, Vembanad Lake in Kerala, Kolleru Lake in Andhra Pradesh, Loktak Lake in Manipur, Dal Lake in Kashmir, Chilka Lake(lagoon lake) in Orrisa, and Sasthamkotta Lake in Kerala.

==Wetlands==

India's wetland ecosystem is widely distributed from the cold and arid located in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, and those with the wet and humid climate of peninsular India. Most of the wetlands are directly or indirectly linked to river networks. The Indian government has identified a total of 71 wetlands for conservation and are part of sanctuaries and national parks.[tpl]cite book |title=India Yearbook 2007 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Govt. Of India |isbn=81-230-1423-6 |pages=Pg. 306 |author=compiled and edited by Research, Reference and Training Division. |year=2007 [/tpl] Mangrove forests are present all along the Indian coastline in sheltered estuaries, creeks, backwaters, salt marshes and mudflats. The mangrove area covers a total of [tpl]convert|4461|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]cite book|title=India Yearbook 2007 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Govt. Of India |isbn=81-230-1423-6 |pages=Pg. 309 |author=compiled and edited by Research, Reference and Training Division. |year=2007[/tpl] which comprises 7% of the world's total mangrove cover. Prominent mangrove covers are located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Sundarbans delta, the Gulf of Kutch and the deltas of the Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna rivers. Parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala also have large mangrove covers.[tpl]cite book | title = Manorama Yearbook 2006 (India - Environment)|pages =580[/tpl]
The Sundarbans delta is home to the largest mangrove forest in the world. It lies at the mouth of the Ganges and spreads across areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but is identified separately as the Sundarbans (Bangladesh) and the Sundarbans National Park (India). The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The area is known for its diverse fauna, being home to a large variety of species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. Its most famous inhabitant is the Bengal tiger. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The Rann of Kutch is a marshy region located in northwestern Gujarat and the bordering Sindh province of Pakistan. It occupies a total area of [tpl]convert|27900|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]NatGeo ecoregion|name=Rann of Kutch|id=im0901|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] The region was originally a part of the Arabian Sea. Geologic forces such as earthquakes resulted in the damming up of the region, turning it into a large saltwater lagoon. This area gradually filled with silt thus turning it into a seasonal salt marsh. During the monsoons, the area turns into a shallow marsh, often flooding to knee-depth. After the monsoons, the region turns dry and becomes parched.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen system, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. The nation has four seasons: winter (January–February), summer (March–May), a monsoon (rainy) season (June–September) and a post-monsoon period (October–December).
The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid katabatic winds flowing down from Central Asia. Thus, North India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot. Although the Tropic of Cancer—the boundary between the tropics and subtropics—passes through the middle of India, the whole country is considered to be tropical.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Summer lasts between March and June in most parts of India. Temperatures can exceed [tpl]convert|40|°C|°F[/tpl] during the day. The coastal regions exceed [tpl]convert|30|°C|°F[/tpl] coupled with high levels of humidity. In the Thar desert area temperatures can exceed [tpl]convert|45|°C|°F[/tpl]. The rain-bearing monsoon clouds are attracted to the low-pressure system created by the Thar Desert. The southwest monsoon splits into two arms, the Bay of Bengal arm and the Arabian Sea arm. The Bay of Bengal arm moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea arm moves northwards and deposits much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Winters in peninsula India see mild to warm days and cool nights. Further north the temperature is cooler. Temperatures in some parts of the Indian plains sometimes fall below freezing. Most of northern India is plagued by fog during this season. The highest temperature recorded in India was [tpl]convert|50.6|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] in Alwar, Rajasthan. The lowest was [tpl]convert|-45|°C|°F[/tpl] in Kashmir.

==Geology==

India's geological features are classified based on their era of formation. The Precambrian formations of Cudappah and Vindhyan systems are spread out over the eastern and southern states. A small part of this period is spread over western and central India. The Paleozoic formations from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian system are found in the Western Himalaya region in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The Mesozoic Deccan Traps formation is seen over most of the northern Deccan; they are believed to be the result of sub-aerial volcanic activity. The Trap soil is black in colour and conducive to agriculture. The Carboniferous system, Permian System and Triassic systems are seen in the western Himalayas. The Jurassic system is seen in the western Himalayas and Rajasthan.
Tertiary imprints are seen in parts of Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and along the Himalayan belt. The Cretaceous system is seen in central India in the Vindhyas and part of the Indo-Gangetic plains. The Gondowana system is seen in the Narmada River area in the Vindhyas and Satpuras. The Eocene system is seen in the western Himalayas and Assam. Oligocene formations are seen in Kutch and Assam. The Pleistocene system is found over central India. The Andaman and Nicobar Island are thought to have been formed in this era by volcanoes.[tpl]cite book | title = Manorama Yearbook 2006 (India - Geology) |pages =521[/tpl] The Himalayas were formed by the convergence and deformation of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian Plates. Their continued convergence raises the height of the Himalayas by 1 cm each year.
Soils in India can be classified into 8 categories: alluvial, black, red, laterite, forest, arid & desert, saline & alkaline and peaty & organic soils.[tpl]cite web | title=India Agronet - Soil Management|url=http://www.indiaagronet.com/indiaagronet/soil_management/Soil_mgmt.htm|publisher=Indiagronet.com|accessdate=18 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Food and Agriculture Organization website|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0257e/A0257E02.htm|accessdate=2 August 2007[/tpl] Alluvial soil constitute the largest soil group in India, constituting 80% of the total land surface. It is derived from the deposition of silt carried by rivers and are found in the Great Northern plains from Punjab to the Assam valley. Alluvial soil are generally fertile but they lack nitrogen and tend to be phosphoric.
Black soil are well developed in the Deccan lava region of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh.[tpl]cite web | title=Krishi World website|url=http://www.krishiworld.com/html/soils10.html|publisher=Krishiworld.com|accessdate=18 July 2007[/tpl] These contain high percentage of clay and are moisture retentive. Red soil are found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka plateau, Andhra plateau, Chota Nagpur plateau and the Aravallis. These are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and humus. Laterite soils are formed in tropical regions with heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall results in leaching out all soluble material of top layer of soil. These are generally found in Western ghats, Eastern ghats and hilly areas of northeastern states that receive heavy rainfall. Forest soils occur on the slopes of mountains and hills in Himalayas, Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats. These generally consist of large amounts of dead leaves and other organic matter called humus.

==Natural resources==

India's total renewable water resources are estimated at 1,907.8 km3/year.[tpl]cite web|title=Water profile of India|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Water_profile_of_India#Water_Resources|publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=20 November 2008[/tpl] Its annual supply of usable and replenshable groundwater amounts to 350 billion cubic metres.[tpl]cite journal|title=India's Underground Water Resources|author=J.K.

About 44 million tonnes of cargo is moved annually through the country's major rivers and waterways. Groundwater supplies 40% of water in India's irrigation canals. 56% of the land is arable and used for agriculture. Black soils are moisture-retentive and are preferred for dry farming and growing cotton, linseed, etc. Forest soils are used for tea and coffee plantations. Red soil have a wide diffusion of iron content.
Most of India's estimated [tpl]convert|5.4|Goilbbl|m3[/tpl] in oil reserves are located in the Mumbai High, upper Assam, Cambay, the Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery basins.[tpl]cite web|title=Energy profile of India|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_India|publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=20 November 2008[/tpl] India possesses about seventeen trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Orissa. Uranium is mined in Andhra Pradesh. India has 400 medium-to-high enthalpy thermal springs for producing geothermal energy in seven "provinces" — the Himalayas, Sohana, Cambay, the Narmada-Tapti delta, the Godavari delta and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (specifically the volcanic Barren Island.)[tpl]cite web|title=Geothermal Energy Resources of India|url=http://www.geos.iitb.ac.in/geothermalindia/pubs/IBC/IBCTALKweb.htm|author=D.

==Antipodes==

The only land area antipodal to India is Easter Island, which is antipodal to the western corner of Rajasthan. The triangular island closely reflects the triangle between the cities of Mokal, Kuchchri, and Habur. Habur corresponds to Hanga Roa, and Mokal to the eastern cape.
