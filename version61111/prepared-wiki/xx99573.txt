Dukes Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock and Wapping Dock to the east. The Albert Dock is located immediately north, although not directly accessible by water. 
Opening in 1773, Dukes Dock was built privately as a Liverpool based facility for traffic using the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html#geo|title=Trading Places: A History of Liverpool Docks|publisher=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=24 March 2008[/tpl]
