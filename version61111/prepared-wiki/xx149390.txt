The Generalized Maxwell model also known as the Maxwell–Wiechert model (after James Clerk Maxwell and E WiechertWiechert, E (1889); "Ueber elastische Nachwirkung", Dissertation, Königsberg University, GermanyWiechert, E (1893); "Gesetze der elastischen Nachwirkung für constante Temperatur", Annalen der Physik, 286, 335–348, 546–570) is the most general form of the linear model for viscoelasticity. In this model several Maxwell elements are assembled in parallel. It takes into account that the relaxation which does not occur at a single time, but in a set of times.  Due to molecular segments of different lengths with shorter ones contributing less than longer ones, there is a varying time distribution.  The Wiechert model shows this by having as many spring–dashpot Maxwell elements as are necessary to accurately represent the distribution.  The figure on the right shows the generalised Wiechert model.Roylance, David (2001); "Engineering Viscoelasticity", 14-15Tschoegl, Nicholas W.

==General model form==

===Solids===

The general form for the model for solids is given by:

This may be more easily understood by showing the model in a slightly more expanded form:

====Example: standard linear solid model====

===Liquids===

The general form for the model for liquids is given by:

This may be more easily understood by showing the model in a slightly more expanded form:

====Example: three parameter fluid====

The analogous model to the standard linear solid model is the three parameter fluid, also known as the Jeffrey model:
