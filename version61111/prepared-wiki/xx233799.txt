[[List of culinary knife cuts]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking techniques

There are a number of regular knife cuts that are basic to chef skills.  Each produces a standardized piece of food, allowing a chef to translate words into cuisine.
The two basic shapes for these cuts are the strip and the cube.  Strips are generally cut to 2½-3 inches, and are defined by width, from thickest to thinnest as "batonnet", "allumette", "julienne", and "fine julienne".  The cube shapes, in order from largest to smallest, are the large, medium, and small dice, the brunoise, and the fine brunoise.About.com, Photo Gallery of Basic Culinary Arts Knife Cuts.

===Batonnet===

Translated literally from French, batonnet means "little stick".
The batonnet measures approximately 1/4"x 1/4"x 2 . It is also the starting point for the small dice.

===Allumette===

Sometimes also called the "matchstick cut" (which is the translation of "allumette" from French) the allumette measures approximately (1/16 inch × 1/16 inch × 2 & 1/2 inches).
