Muntinlupa was once notoriously known as the location of the national insular penitentiary, the New Bilibid Prison, where the country's most dangerous criminals were incarcerated.  Consequently, Muntinlupa or "Munti" became synonymous with the national penitentiary although it has largely shaken-off this negative image to become one of the most progressive cities in the country.
Muntinlupa is also home to some of the best commercial establishments in the metropolis and is the location of Ayala Alabang Village, one of the country's biggest and most expensive residential communities, where many of the wealthy and famous live.
Muntinlupa is also the first city in the Philippines to ban the use of plastic bags and Styrofoam for packaging.[tpl]cite web|title=First to ban plastics in NCR, Muntinlupa City takes campaign further|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/217655/first-to-ban-plastics-in-ncr-muntinlupa-city-takes-campaign-further|publisher=InquirerNews|accessdate=19 Dec 2012[/tpl]

==Economy==

Barangay Alabang, part of the second district of Muntinlupa, has undergone tremendous growth mainly due to a development boom in the late 1990s. The development of two large scale commercial real estate projects namely; the Filinvest Corporate City and Ayala Land's Madrigal Business Park, changed the landscape of Muntinlupa City from what was once vast fields of cow pasture in the late 1980s, into a supercity that houses new residential, business, industrial and commercial establishments.  It was a transformation reminiscent of Makati City's development boom some 30 years prior.
Some of the country's premier shopping centers, including the Alabang Town Center and the Festival Supermall, the towering Insular Life Towers, the Asian Hospital and Medical Center, and the Northgate Business District, which specializes in hosting information and technology industries, are important places of interest and landmarks of the city. Nightlife is still relatively staid compared to those of its neighbors, and younger residents often flock to other cities in Metro Manila, particularly Makati, Taguig, or Manila, during the weekend to enjoy the night out.
This city has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" and the "Most Improved City" in the Philippines.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
