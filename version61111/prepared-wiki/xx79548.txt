The [tpl]Nihongo|Nagano Shinkansen|長野新幹線[/tpl] is a Shinkansen high-speed rail line operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) between Takasaki and Nagano in Japan. It opened on 1 October 1997, connecting Tokyo and Nagano in time for the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano. The Nagano Shinkansen forms the first section of the planned Hokuriku Shinkansen line currently under construction to Kanazawa, Tsuruga and eventually Osaka.

==Services==

The Asama trains, named for Mount Asama, an active volcano alongside the line, currently connect Tokyo and Nagano in a minimum of 79 minutes, at a maximum speed of [tpl]Convert|260|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5[/tpl] from Takasaki to Nagano.[tpl]cite journal| title = 300km/hのトップランナー|trans_title= 300 km/h Top Runners| journal = Japan Railfan Magazine | volume = 52| issue = 612| page = p.14| publisher = Koyusha Co., Ltd.| location = Japan | date = April 2012[/tpl] These services are run by JR East E2 series and E7 series trainsets. There are approximately two services an hour; stopping patterns are varied, with only a few services stopping at all stations. The trains run along the Joetsu and Tohoku Shinkansen lines from Tokyo to Takasaki.
The Nagano Shinkansen services replaced the conventional Shinetsu Main Line limited express services, also named Asama, which previously took 2 hours 50 minutes from Tokyo (Ueno Station) to Nagano. Following the opening of the Shinkansen, part of the conventional line was abandoned between Yokokawa and Karuizawa. This section included the steeply-graded Usui Pass which required the use of bank engines on all trains.
A new island platform serving two tracks was constructed at Tokyo Station to coincide with the Nagano services; this doubled the number of JR East Shinkansen tracks to four, serving the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines as well.
