George Ellis Pugh descended from Ellis Pugh, Sr. (1656–1718), an early Welsh immigrant to Pennsylvania.  Ellis was a Quaker minister who, with his wife Sinah, emigrated to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution in 1686.  George's branch of this line migrated from Philadelphia to Prince George, Virginia, Bush River, South Carolina and Cincinnati, Ohio. George was the son of Lot and Rachel (Anthony) Pugh, who were married in Hamilton County, Ohio, on July 7, 1814.  George had three brothers and a sister.  
Pugh married Theresa Chalfant in 1840 and had three children, Robert Chalfont, Nina Theresa and Thomas.  He became a Roman Catholic in 1855.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=George Ellis Pugh[/tpl]
