More than half a dozen low-cost carriers entered the Indian market in 2004-05. Major new entrants included Air Deccan, Air Sahara, Kingfisher Airlines, SpiceJet, GoAir, Paramount Airways and IndiGo.  But Indian aviation industry struggled due to economic slowdown, rising fuel and operation costs. This led to consolidation, buy outs and discontinuations in the Indian airline industry.  In 2007, Air Sahara and Air Deccan were acquired by Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines respectively. Paramount Airways ceased operations in 2010 and Kingfisher Airlines shut down in 2012. Etihad Airways agreed to acquire 24% stake in Jet in 2013. AirAsia India is a proposed low cost carrier scheduled to operate as a joint venture between Air Asia and Tata Sons. As of 2012-13, IndiGo is the only Indian carrier generating profits.
