==History==

===Formation and early years (1993–1994)===

Duke Erikson and Butch Vig had been in numerous bands, including Spooner and Fire Town (with Steve Marker as a sound engineer). In 1983, Vig and Marker founded Smart Studios in Madison and Vig's production work brought him to the attention of Sub Pop. Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig and Marker's career as producers gained strength."Welcome to Spooner Town", by Andy Davis, Record Collector, issue No. 209, January 1997 In 1994, as Vig become "kind of burned out on doing really long records," he got together with Erikson and Marker, and they started doing remixes for acts such as U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and House of Pain. The remixes featured different instrumentation, and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. This experience inspired the three men to form a band, where they "wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html|title=BUTCH VIG: Nevermind The Garbage|work=Sound on Sound|date=March 1997|author=Buskin, Richard|accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] An early comment that their work sounded "like garbage" inspired the band's name.
Initial sessions with Vig on vocals, along with the members' past work with all-male groups, led to the band's desire for a woman on lead.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml | title=Garbage Interview |date=11/01/1994 | journal=Volume|issue=12| accessdate=2008-02-24[/tpl] Marker declared that their desire for a female vocalist was one "who didn't have a high, chirpy, girly quality to her voice", similar to Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde, and Vig added that they wanted someone that could sing in an understated way in contrast to "these alterna-rock singers that have a tendency to scream".[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-17/entertainment/ca-15158_1_pop-music|title= POP MUSIC : Beyond the Pail : How to turn Garbage into gold|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 17, 1995|first=Elysa|last=Gardner |accessdate=2012-01-19[/tpl]  Marker was watching 120 Minutes when he saw the music video for Angelfish's "Suffocate Me". He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager Shannon O'Shea tracked down the band's singer, Shirley Manson. When Manson was contacted, she did not know who Vig was and was urged to check the credits on Nevermind, the popular Nirvana album which Vig produced.
On April 8, 1994, Manson met Erikson, Marker, and Vig for the first time in London. Later that evening Vig was informed of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide. Garbage was put on hold until Angelfish was finished touring North America in support of Live."Thanks For Your, Uhh Support, Absolute Garbage DVD. Retrieved 2008-02-24 Erikson, Marker, and Vig attended the Metro Chicago date, and Manson was invited to Madison to audition for the band. The audition did not go well, but Manson socialized with the men while there and they found they had a similar taste in music. Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour. Manson called O'Shea and asked to audition again feeling that "it would work out".
Manson described her first session with the band as "a disaster", as she had no experience as a session musician, and she and the band were "two parties totally uncomfortable with the situation", but the "mutual disdain" from that meeting managed to pull the band together. The first songs were skeletal versions of the songs "Stupid Girl", "Queer" and "Vow", which led to some ad-libbed lyrics by Manson.[tpl]cite book|last=Borzillo|first=Carrie|title=Garbage's Serendipitous Success; Popularity Falls into Place for Almo Act|date=1996-03-23|publisher=Billboard|location=Los Angeles|pages=9, 97|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA97&dq=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]"Making Music June 1, 1996 issue".

===Version 2.0 (1997–2000)===

Garbage relocated to Friday Harbor, Washington on March 1, 1997 to write songs for their second album. Returning to Smart Studios a short while later, the band found themselves under intense pressure to repeat the success of Garbage.

Garbage regrouped on April 10, 2001. The group began work on their third record, and put aside plans for a B-sides album due to the sale of Almo Sounds to the UMG. Manson ran an online blog throughout the recording of the album named Beautiful Garbage. During the recording of the album, Garbage invoked a provision of its contract to leave Almo, and sued UMG when it refused to terminate the contract. UMG threatened to use Manson's 1993 solo contract to tie Garbage to the label.Garbage Sue Universal, Rolling Stone The suit was settled on July 29, 2001, and Garbage moved to Interscope.
