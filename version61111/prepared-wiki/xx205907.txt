John Charles Bottarini (born September 14, 1908 in Crockett, California) was a right-handed catcher for the Chicago Cubs during the 1937 season. He did not see much playing time as the Cubs were anchored behind the plate by future Hall of Famer Gabby Hartnett. Bottarini appeared in 26 games for the Cubs that season and put up decent offensive numbers, hitting .275 in 40 at-bats with three doubles, a home run and 7 RBI. He made 19 appearances in the fieldâ€”18 at catcher and one in the outfield.
After the 1937 season, Bottarini was sold to Memphis of the minor league Southern Association. He would never play in the major leagues again.
Bottarini died by drowning after a boating accident on October 8, 1976 in Jemez Springs, New Mexico.
