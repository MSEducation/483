Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.[tpl]cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14[/tpl]

On special occasions, such as Easter, Christmas, Mother's Day etc., breakfast is usually the same, but with a wider range of choices (i.e. premium cheeses, special ham, hot buns, croissants etc.).
A 2012 opinion poll concluded that the Dutch believe that breakfast should be a more important meal that it is and that more time should be spent on it; almost three quarters of those polled ate their sandwiches in less than fifteen minutes, and blame for an all-too quick breakfast was placed on "fast" breakfast products. A perfect "weekend breakfast" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg. The poll also concluded that men are more likely than women to have breakfast with their partner.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/lifestyle/2934751/nederland-wil-ontbijt-terug-kaart.html|title=Nederland wil ontbijt terug op de kaart|date=16 October 2012|publisher=Nu.nl|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 November 2013[/tpl]

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

In the United Kingdom, the classic breakfast has been the "full breakfast", which involves fried egg, scrambled egg or poached egg with bacon and sausages, usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, fried bread, black and/or white pudding and toast. However in present times this is more often reserved for weekends, holidays, or eaten away from home in cafes, or previously in so-called 'greasy spoon' venues, due to the time required to prepare all the ingredients. The "full Scottish breakfast" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, square sausage, fried dumpling, potato scone, tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links and fried bread. Another traditional British breakfast consists of porridge. Before the arrival of American-style breakfast cereals, dried bread soaked in hot milk or tea and porridge (boiled oats) was the common daily breakfast, while leftover vegetables (namely cabbage) and potatoes that hadn't been eaten the night before were often served re-fried; which became 'bubble-and-squeak'.Caroline Conran, Traditional Cooking (British Cookery)1978 IBSN 0233 97053 3 Traditionally, breakfast would be served with a small amount of fruit, such as a slice of orange, believed to prevent the onset of scurvy.Dr E.

===New Zealand===

Breakfast in New Zealand is very similar to the Australian breakfast. The range of processed breakfast cereals is vast and children are more likely to eat those that contain added sugar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ana.org.nz/documents/BreakfastReportPressRelease.pdf |title=Report Shows Eating Breakfast Helps Children's Adademic Performance |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-06-29[/tpl] New Zealanders, particularly in winter, are likely to eat a hot oat cereal called "porridge". Porridge is typically served with milk,sugar, fruit and/or yogurt. Sliced bread which has been toasted and topped with preserves or spreads is a common alternative breakfast. Eating breakfast at a restaurant was unheard of until the 1990s, however cafes which serve breakfast until midday or all day are now common.[tpl]cite book|title=New Zealand|year=2002|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1-74059-196-8|page=79[/tpl] The Big Breakfast is the main item at cafes, which is similar to the British cooked breakfast, except that it seldom includes black pudding. Other common menu items are: eggs done how you like, eggs benedict, beans on toast, pancakes, cereal and yogurt, and smoothies. Breakfast nearly always includes coffee, tea or both, with children drinking milk either on their cereal, in a glass or hot milo. Recent concern has been raised about the cost of milk and some families being unable to afford it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10773332 |title=Fonterra takes fresh look at school milk - National - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= 15 December 2011|accessdate=2012-03-28[/tpl]
