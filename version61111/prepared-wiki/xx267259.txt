The Boucicaut Master or Master of the Hours for Marshal Boucicaut was an anonymous French or Flemish miniaturist and illuminator active between 1400 and 1430 in Paris. He worked in the International Gothic style.
He is named after his illustrated book of hours for Jean II Le Meingre Boucicaut), Marshal of France, which was created between 1410 and 1415. This Book of Hours is now in the Musée Jacquemart-André in Paris.
The Master of Boucicaut was a contemporary of the Limbourg brothers and with them belonged to the most important and influential illuminators of manuscripts from the period in Northern Europe. He was probably the head of a productive workshop or studio in which artists fulfilled commissions for the court, the aristocracy and wealthy citizens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1136 |title=Boucicaut Master |publisher=J.
