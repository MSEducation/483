Fort Knox is a United States Army post in Kentucky south of Louisville and north of Elizabethtown. The 109,000 acre (170 mi.sq, 441 km.sq) base covers parts of Bullitt, Hardin, and Meade counties. It currently holds the Army human resources Center of Excellence to include the Army Human Resources Command, United States Army Cadet Command and the United States Army Accessions Command.
For 60 years, Fort Knox was the home of the U.S. Army Armor Center and the U.S. Army Armor School (now relocated to Fort Benning, Georgia as a result of BRAC action), and was used by both the Army and the Marine Corps to train crews on the M1 Abrams main battle tank. The history of the U.S. Army's Cavalry and Armored forces, and of General George S. Patton's career, can be found at the General George Patton MuseumPatton Museum of Cavalry and Armor on the grounds of Fort Knox. Parts of the base in Hardin and Meade counties form a census-designated place (CDP), which had a population of 12,377 at the 2000 census and 10,124 at the 2010 census.

==Bullion Depository==

The United States Department of the Treasury has maintained the Bullion Depository on the post since 1937.
This facility is operated solely by the Treasury Department.

==Patton Museum==

The George S. Patton Museum and Center of Leadership at Fort Knox includes an exhibit highlighting leadership issues that arose from the attacks of September 11, 2001, which includes two firetrucks. One of them, designated Foam 161, was partially charred and melted in the attack upon the Pentagon. Fort Knox is also the location of the United States Army's Human Resources Command's Timothy Maude Center of Excellence, which was named in honor of Timothy Maude, the highest-ranking member of the U.S. military to die in the attacks of September 11, 2001.Barrouquere, Brett (September 11, 2013).

In 2012, the U.S. Army Armor School was relocated to "The Maneuver Center of Excellence" at FT Benning, GA.  As FT Knox is no longer "The Home of Armor", the Patton Museum has also been relocated to FT Benning.  The Museum building, built with funds from donations raised in the early 1970s, has been gutted and now stands empty.

==History==

===Fortification===

Fortifications were constructed near the site in 1861, during the Civil War when Fort Duffield was constructed. Fort Duffield was located on what was known as Muldraugh Hill on a strategic point overlooking the confluence of the Salt and Ohio Rivers and the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike. The area was contested by both Union and Confederate forces. Bands of organized guerrillas frequently raided the area during the war.

===Post war===

After the war, the area now occupied by the Army was home to various small communities. In October 1903, military maneuvers for the Regular Army and the National Guards of several states were held at West Point, Kentucky and the surrounding area.New York Times 17 July 1903 pg 5  In April 1918, field artillery units from Camp Zachary Taylor arrived at West Point for training. [tpl]convert|20000|acre[/tpl] near the village of Stithton were leased to the government and construction for a permanent training center was started in July 1918.

===New camp===

The new camp was named after Henry Knox, the Continental Army's chief of artillery during the Revolutionary War and the country's first Secretary of War. The camp was extended by the purchase of a further [tpl]convert|40000|acre|ha[/tpl] in June 1918 and construction properly began in July 1918. The building program was reduced following the end of the war and reduced further following cuts to the army in 1921 after the National Defense Act of 1920. The camp was greatly reduced and became a semi-permanent training center for the 5th Corps Area for Reserve Officer training, the National Guard, and Citizen's Military Training Camps (CMTC). For a short while, from 1925 to 1928, the area was designated as "Camp Henry Knox National Forest."The Courier-Journal 15 April 1928 end

===Air Corps use===

The post contains an airfield, called Godman Army Airfield, that was used by the United States Army Air Corps, and its successor, the United States Army Air Forces as a training base during World War II. It was used by the Kentucky Air National Guard for several years after the war until they relocated to Standiford Field in Louisville. The airfield is still in use by the United States Army Aviation Branch.

===Mechanized military unit occupation===

In 1931 a small force of the mechanized cavalry was assigned to Camp Knox to use it as a training site. The camp was turned into a permanent garrison in January 1932 and renamed Fort Knox. The 1st Cavalry Regiment arrived later in the month to become the 1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized).
In 1936 the 1st was joined by the 13th to become the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized). The site quickly became the center for mechanization tactics and doctrine. The success of the German mechanized units at the start of World War II was a major impetus to operations at the fort. A new Armored Force was established in July 1940 with its headquarters at Fort Knox with the 7th Cavalry Brigade becoming the 1st Armored Division. The Armored Force School and the Armored Force Replacement Center were also sited at Fort Knox in October 1940, and their successors remained there until 2010, when the Armor School moved to Fort Benning, Georgia. The site was expanded to cope with its new role. By 1943, there were 3,820 buildings on [tpl]convert|106861|acre[/tpl]. A third of the base has been torn down within the last ten years,[tpl]When|date=June 2009[/tpl] with another third slated by 2010.

===1993 shooting===

On October 11, 1993, Arthur Hill went on a shooting rampage, killing three and wounding two before attempting suicide, shooting and severely wounding himself. The shooting occurred at Fort Knox's Training Support Center. Prior to the incident, Hill's coworkers claimed they were afraid of a mentally unstable person who was at work. Arthur Hill died on October 21 of his self-inflicted wound.Gunman in Fort Knox Shooting DiesWorker at Fort Knox Kills 3, Then Shoots Himself - New York Times3 Killed, 2 Hurt in Army Base Shooting Spree - Los Angeles Times

The victim was an employee of the United States Army Human Resources Command and was transported to the Ireland Army Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

==Human Resource Command (HRC)==

The Army Human Resource Command Center re-located to Fort Knox from the Washington D.C./Virginia area beginning in 2009. New facilities are under construction throughout Fort Knox, such as the new Army Human Resource Center, the largest construction project in the history of Fort Knox.

Fort Knox is one of only three Army posts (the others being Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Fort Sam Houston, Texas) that still have a high school located on-post.
