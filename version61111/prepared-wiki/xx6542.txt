Louchébem or loucherbem is Parisian and Lyonnaise butchers' (French boucher) slang, similar to Pig Latin and Verlan. It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s. Each word is transformed by moving the first consonant to the end; and suffixes such as -ème, -ji, -oc, -muche are added at the end; the letter "L" is placed at the beginning of the new word. Note that spelling often becomes phoneticised.

==Louchébem today==

Even today, Louchébem is still well-known and used among those working at point-of-sale in the meat retail industry.  Some words have even leaked into common, everyday use by the masses; an example is the word loufoque, meaning unsound of mind.
In 1937 E.C. Bentley used the language as a plot point in his short story, 'The Old-Fashioned Apache'.

==Examples==

Here are a few example Louchébem words.
There is another French argot called largonji, which differs from louchébem only in the suffix that is added (-i instead of -em); the term is derived from jargon.[ref]
