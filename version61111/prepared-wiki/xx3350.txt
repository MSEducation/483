According to the traditional Islamic view, the Qur'an (Koran) began with  revelations to Muhammad (when he was 40 years old) in 610. The history of the Qur'an began when its verses were revealed to the Sahabah during Muhammad's life. The rise of Islam began around the time Muslims took flight in the Hijra, moving to  Medina. With Islam,  blood feuds among the Arabs lessened. Compensation was paid in money rather than blood and only the culprit was executed.
In 628, the Makkah tribe of Quraish and the Muslim community in Medina signed a truce called the Treaty of Hudaybiyya beginning a ten-year period of peace. War returned when the Quraish and their allies, the tribe of 'Bakr', attacked the tribe of 'Khuza'ah', who were Muslim allies. In 630, Muslims conquered Mecca. Muhammad died in June 632. The Battle of Yamama was fought in December of the same year, between the forces of the first caliph Abu Bakr and Musailima.

==City-states and Imperial period==

After Muhammad died, a series of Caliphs governed the Islamic state: Abu Bakr (632-634), Umar ibn al-Khattab (Umar І, 634-644), Uthman ibn Affan, (644-656), and Ali ibn Abi Talib (656-661).  These leaders are known as the "Rashidun" or "rightly guided" Caliphs in Sunni Islam. They oversaw the initial phase of the Muslim conquests, advancing through Persia, Egypt, the Middle East and North Africa.
Umar improved the administration and built cities like Basra and canal and irrigation networks. To be close to the poor, Umar lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening. After consulting with the poor, Umar established the first welfare state Bayt al-mal.Umar bin Al Khattab - The Second Caliph of Islam by Abdul Basit Ahmad Page 43 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kWp8aeuqKaYC&pg=PT44&dq=umar+walked+the+streets+every+evening&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1bMkUYDjBJTB0gXczYCYDw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAgMen Around the Messenger by Khālid Muḥammad Khālid, Muhammad Khali Khalid Page 20 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T-uN7tDGSZMC&pg=PA20&dq=umar+lived+in+a+mud+hut&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c7UkUeSJFcjL0QWZ84CQDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=umar%20lived%20in%20a%20mud%20hut&f=falseThe Living Thoughts of the Prophet Muhammad by Maulana Muhammad Ali Page http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RQxYnAykK6sC&pg=PT132&dq=umar+lived+in+a+mud+hut&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c7UkUeSJFcjL0QWZ84CQDw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ The Bayt al-mal or the welfare state was for the Muslim and non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-mal ran for hundreds of years under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century and continued through the Umayyad period and well into the Abbasid era. Umar also introduced child benefit for the children and pensions for the elderly.Administrative Development: An Islamic Perspective by Muhammad Al-Buraey Page 254 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HJE9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA254&dq=umar+welfare+state&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F60kUfj6MtGN0wW4y4GQDw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=umar%20welfare%20state&f=falseThe challenge of Islamic renaissance by Syed Abdul QuddusAdministrative Development: An Islamic Perspective by Muhammad Al-Buraey Page 252 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lT8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA252&dq=umar+Bayt+al-mal&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HrEkUYfnOYSk0AWlqYCYDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=umar%20Bayt%20al-mal&f=falseOttoman History: Misperceptions and Truths by Said Öztürk Page 539 The expansion of the state, was partially terminated between 638–639 during the years of great famine and plague in Arabia and Levant respectively. During Umars reign, within 10 years Levant, Egypt, Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Fezzan, Eastern Anatolia, almost the whole of Sassanid Persian Empire including Bactria, Persia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Caucasus and Makran were incorporated into Islamic State. When Umar was assassinated in 644, the election of Uthman as successor was met with increasing opposition. The Qur'an was standardized during this time.
Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.[tpl]Harvtxt|Esposito|2010|p=38[/tpl]Hofmann (2007), p.86 As new areas joining the Islamic state, they also benefited from free trade, while trading with other areas in the Islamic state, so as to encourage commerce, in Islam trade is not taxed, wealth is taxed.Islam: An Illustrated History by Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville, Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay Page 40 The Muslims paid Zakat on their wealth to the poor. Since the Constitution of Medina, was drafted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad the Jews and the Christians continued to use their own laws in the Islamic State and had their own judges.R. B.

To assist in the quick expansion of the state, the Byzantine and the Persian tax collection systems were maintained and the people paid a poll tax lower than the one imposed under the Byzantines and the Persians.
In 639, Muawiyah I was appointed as the governor of Syria after the previous governor Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah died in a plague along with 25,000 other people.The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate by Wilferd Madelung Page 61 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=death+of+muhammad+and+the+beginning+of+islam&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0JX-UMysC62Y0QWOsICIDQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=death%20of%20muhammad%20and%20the%20beginning%20of%20islam&f=false[tpl]Harvtxt|Rahman|1999|p=40[/tpl] To stop the Byzantine harassment from the sea during the Arab–Byzantine wars, in 649 Muawiyah I set up a navy; manned by Monophysitise Christians, Copts and Jacobite Syrian Christians sailors and Muslim troops. This resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine navy at the Battle of the Masts in 655, opening up the Mediterranean.European Naval and Maritime History, 300-1500 by Archibald Ross Lewis, Timothy J.

When Umar was assassinated in 644, Uthman ibn Affan became the next caliph. As it is well known that Arabic language is written without vowels, and when Qur'an reached the non-Arabic speakers, people began having different dielects and phonics which was changing the exact meaning of verses in the Qur'an. This was brought to the notice of Uthman ibn Affan. Begun in the time of Uthman ibn Affan, the compilation of the Qur'an was finished sometime between 650 and 656, Uthman sent copies to the different centers of the expanding Islamic empire. From then on, thousands of Muslim scribes began copying the Qur'an.Schimmel, Annemarie; Barbar Rivolta (Summer, 1992). "Islamic Calligraphy".

But after Muhammad's passing the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Following the Roman–Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area.Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War by Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi Page 32 Previously, the second caliph, Umar, was very firm on the governors and his spies kept an eye on the governors. If he felt that a governor or a commander was becoming attracted to wealth or did not meet the required administrative standards, he had him removed from his position.Arab Socialism.

Early Muslim armies stayed in encampments away from cities because Umar feared that they may get attracted to wealth and luxury. In the process, they may get away from the worship of God and become attracted to wealth and start accumulating wealth and establishing dynasties.Arab Socialism.

But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for one's hope." Qur'an 18:46 http://quran.com/18 "O you who have believed, let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of Allah . And whoever does that - then those are the losers." Qur'an 63:9 http://quran.com/63 Staying in these encampments away from the cities also ensured that there was no stress on the population and also that the populations remained autonomous and kept their own judges and representatives. Some of these encampments later grew into cities themselves, like Basra and Kufa in Iraq and Fustat in Egypt.[tpl]Harvtxt|Rahman|1999|p=37[/tpl] Some cities also had agreements with the Muslims, such as during the Siege of Jerusalem in 637 CE.
As Uthman ibn Affan became very old, Marwan I a relative of Muawiyah I slipped into the vacuum and became his secretary and slowly assumed more control and relaxed some of these restrictions. Marwan I had previously been excluded from positions of responsibility. In 656, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr the son of Abu Bakr and the adopted son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and the great grandfather of Ja'far al-Sadiq showed some Egyptians, the house of Uthman ibn Affan. Later the Egyptians ended up killing Uthman ibn al-Affan.[tpl]Harvtxt|Rahman|1999|p=53[/tpl] Ali then assumed the position of caliph and moved the capital to Kufa in Iraq. Muawiyah I the governor of Syria, a relative of Uthman ibn al-Affan and Marwan I wanted the culprits arrested. Marwan I manipulated every one and created conflict. This later resulted in the first civil war (the "First Fitna"), Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. Six months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Hasan ibn Ali, highly regarded for his wisdom and as a peacemaker, the fifth Rightly Guided Caliphs for the Sunnis [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] and the Second Imam for the Shias and the grandson of Muhammad, made a peace treaty with Muawiyah I. In the Hasan–Muawiya treaty, Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he be just to the people and keep them safe and secure and after his death he does not establish a dynasty.The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate by Wilferd Madelung Page 232 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=hasan+ibn+ali+and+muawiya+peace+treaty&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jdsXUfCqLeOx0QXypYDIDg&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q&f=falseSahih Al Bukhari Volume 3, Book 49 (Peacemaking), Number 867  This brought to an end the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs for the Sunnis and Hasan ibn Ali was also the last Imam for the Shias to be a Caliph. Following this, Muawiyah broke the conditions of the agreement and began the Umayyad dynasty, with its capital in Damascus.[tpl]Harvtxt|Holt|1977a|pp=67–72[/tpl] After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflict over succession broke out again in a civil war known as the "Second Fitna". After making every one else fight,Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 352 the Umayyad dynasty later fell into the hands of Marwan I who was also an Umayyad. The Umayyads conquered the Maghrib, the Iberian Peninsula, Narbonnese Gaul and Sindh.Donald Puchala, ‘’Theory and History in International Relations,’’ page 137. Routledge, 2003.

Page 28 In 663, a new Kharijite revolt resulted in the death of their chief. In 664, Muawiyah and Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan reached an agreement: the Caliph recognised Ziyad as a brother and appointed him governor at Basra. Ziyad took the name ibn Abi Sufyan. Muawiyah arranged for his son Yazid I to be appointed caliph on his death, which came in 680. Husayn ibn Ali, by then Muhammad's only living grandson, refused to swear allegiance to Yazid. He was killed in the Battle of Karbala the same year, an event still mourned by Muslims on the Day of Ashura. Unrest continued in the Second Fitna, but Muslim rule was extended under Muawiyah to Rhodes, Crete, Kabul, Bukhara, and Samarkand, and expanded in North Africa. In 664, Arab armies conquered Kabul,Roberts, J: History of the World. Penguin, 1994. and in 665 pushed into the Maghreb.Dermenghem, E. (1958). Muhammad and the Islamic tradition.
