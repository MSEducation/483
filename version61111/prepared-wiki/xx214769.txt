The Kenneth S.

In response to a U.S. mandate on the industrial sector to contribute more directly to improving public health in emerging nations, the DVDC espoused to pay particular attention to the health problems affecting populations in the developing world, and it sought to promote working the fields of parasitology and tropical medicine. The Kenneth Warren Prize is awarded every year by the Cochrane Organization to a scientist who publishes a Cochrane Review about a health issue in developing countries. http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/awards-scholarships-funding-initiatives/annual-prizes-and-awards/kenneth-warren-prize.
Although the federal impetus waned with subsequent presidential administrations and corporate sponsorship virtually disappeared, the organization’s membership maintained its objectives throughout the years to establish facilities to further its research goals.  Its mission is to facilitate the discovery and development of new therapeutics to alleviate the health problems of the world’s poorest people.  
In 2001, state-of-the-art facilities were established at the Kitchawan Preserve, a [tpl]convert|15|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] campus located in Westchester County, New York.  The facilities were named to commemorate the lifelong work of one of the founders of the DVDC.  Kenneth S.
