Bartholomaeus Schwartz (latinised to Bartholomaeus Nigrinus) (1595–1646) was pastor of the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Danzig (Gdańsk), Royal Prussia (now Poland). 
He might be related to Wilhelm Nigrinus (1588, in Kaaden - 1638, in Wittenberg) (de), a German philosopher.
The famous poet Martin Opitz, a friend, lodged at pastor Nigrinus' place, while visiting Danzig. Both Opitz and Nigrinus sent recommendation letters along with a Robert Fludd. Fludd was connected to the Rosicrucian movement and the Danzig edition of the Rosicrucian Manifestos was printed by the Danzig printer Andreas Hünefeld (Huenefeldt or Hunsfeldus) (1609-1652). 
Comenius of Bohemia and Nigrinus had worked in nearby Elbing (Elbląg) on a Bohemian Pansophy. After the poet Opitz died, pastor Nigrinus with two of his associates edited the Opitz poems published by Huenefeld.
