The ELO EP was the final 1978 release from Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was a seven-inch EP played at 33 revolutions per minute and it was released in the UK and Ireland only to promote the three-LP box set Three Light Years. "Can't Get It Out of My Head" was the lead-off track and had originally appeared on the band's fourth album Eldorado.  It thus finally became a hit in their homeland, nearly four years after it had charted in the US.  The other three tracks had already been UK hit singles
