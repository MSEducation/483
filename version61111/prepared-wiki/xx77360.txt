The Church Brew Works is a brewpub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, set in the confines of a restored Roman Catholic church (formerly St. John the Baptist Church).
The brewpub is located at 3525 Liberty Avenue in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The church building was originally built in 1902, and had been used as a church until 1993.Church Brew Works History, http://www.churchbrew.com/ Its doors opened as The Church Brew Works on August 1, 1996, after the building underwent extensive renovation, necessitated by years of lying dormant after being officially deconsecrated by the Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1993.
In 2012, Pittsburgh Magazine named it one of the best breweries in Pittsburgh.[tpl]cite news | title =The 'Burgh Beer Bible | newspaper =Pittsburgh Magazine| date =October 2012 | url =http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/October-2012/Best-Bars-in-Pittsburgh-2012/| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BcSZhu8p | archivedate=2012-10-22 | accessdate =2012-10-22 [/tpl]
