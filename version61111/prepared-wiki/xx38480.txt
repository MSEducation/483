Lower Austria (German: [tpl]Audio|De-at-Niederösterreich.ogg|Niederösterreich[/tpl]) is the northeasternmost state of the nine states in Austria. The capital of Lower Austria since 1986 is Sankt Pölten, the most recently designated capital town in Austria. The capital of Lower Austria had formerly been Vienna, even though Vienna is not officially part of Lower Austria. With a land area of 19,186 km² and a population of  1.612 million people, it is the largest state in Austria, and in terms of population second only to the federal state of Vienna.

==Geography==

Situated east of Upper Austria, Lower Austria derives its name from its downriver location on the Danube River, which flows from west to east. 
Lower Austria has an international border, 414 km long, with the Czech Republic (mainly South Moravia) and Slovakia. The state has the second longest external border of all Austrian states.
It borders on other Austrian states of Upper Austria, Styria and Burgenland. The state surrounds Vienna.
Lower Austria is divided into four regions, known as Viertel (quarters): 
These regions have different geographical structures. Whilst the Mostviertel is dominated by the foothills of the  Limestone Alps with mountains up to [tpl]Höhe|2000|AT|link=true[/tpl] high, most of the Waldviertel is a granite plateau. The hilly Weinviertel lies to the northeast, descends to the plains of Marchfeld in the east of the state, and is separated by the Danube from the Vienna Basin to the south, which in turn is separated from the Vienna Woods by a line of thermal springs (the Thermenlinie) running north to south.

Almost all of Lower Austria is drained by the Danube. The only river that flows into the North Sea via the Moldau and the Elbe is the Lainsitz in northern Waldviertel.
