Nathan Handwerker (June 14, 1890, Kraków, Poland – March 24, 1974 aged 83) was a Polish-Jewish-American entrepreneur known for creating the Nathan's Famous brand of hot dogs.

==Biography==

Handwerker, a Polish Jew, immigrated to the United States in 1912. In addition to working as a delivery boy, he found work slicing rolls of bread at Feltman's German Gardens, a restaurant in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York. The restaurant sold franks (hot dogs) for ten cents a piece at the time.
In 1916, two of Handwerker's co-workers, future actors Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante, who worked as singing waiters at Feltman's, challenged Handwerker to start his own hot dog stand selling franks for just five cents a piece. That same year, with $300, Handwerker and his new wife, Ida Handwerker, opened a small hot dog stand with a two-foot grill on the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island. They spiced their hot dogs with Ida's secret recipe and sold them for only a nickel.
Handwerker decided to call his hot dog stand Nathan's Famous in 1921 after hearing the song, "Nathan, Nathan Why You Waitin?" by Sophie Tucker playing from a nearby restaurant.
The food stand developed into the fast food chain Nathan's Famous, spearhead by his son, Murray Handwerker.
