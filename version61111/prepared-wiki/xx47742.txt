The NeoStead 2000 (NS2000) is a combat shotgun developed by Truvelo Armoury of South Africa.http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/sh08-e.htm
The NS2000 has been used in trial runs for a few years by special forces like the British SAS[tpl]citationneeded|date=October 2011[/tpl] and there are hopes at NeoStead that larger weapons manufacturers will licence the production rights.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Production of the shotgun began in 2001 and the first models were made available in October of that year. It is notable due to its unusual forward pump action.

==Design and production==

The NS2000 is a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun weighing just over 3Â kg, designed primarily for security and civil disturbance situations.
The firearm includes a 570-milimetre barrel despite the overall weapon length of just [tpl]convert|690|mm|in[/tpl]. The short length makes the weapon easier to handle in close-quarters situations; however, unlike most firearms of this type, it can still remain accurate at relatively long ranges. The long barrel length is achieved by using a bullpup configuration, with a rear-fed tubular magazine.
Another aspect of the NS2000 is its dual six-round magazines. The selector switch can be set to left, right, or alternating.  In riot conditions, for example, less-lethal flexible baton rounds can be used with standard rounds in reserve.
A possible production variant of the NS2000 has an 460-milimetre barrel in a weapon with an overall length of [tpl]convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. The shorter length reduced the magazine capacity to 5+5 rounds and makes the weapon easier to import or licence in some countries.
Its pump mechanism operates in a forward-back motion due to its moving-barrel mechanism, instead of the traditional moving-action. This method of operation is quite rare.
The NS2000 has been available for civilian purchase since 2003, with the majority of sales in Europe.
