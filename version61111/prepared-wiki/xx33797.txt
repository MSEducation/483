==Early life==

Retrieved 30 August 2007 Because her father was in the armed forces, Saunders moved to different schools many times. She was educated from the age of five to 18 in boarding schools and then at St Paul's Girls' School[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl], an independent school in west London. After school, she worked for a year in Italy as an au pair.Editors at Teletronic. Dawn French — teletronic.co.uk. Retrieved 4 October 2007.[tpl]dl|date=February 2014[/tpl]
She later received a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London on a drama teachers' course in 1977, where she met her future comedy partner, Dawn French.William Langley. We know how to use our mighty weight and the power of a full and voluptuous body — telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 6 December 2007. Both came from RAF backgrounds. They had grown up on the same base, even having had the same best friend, without ever meeting. The comic duo originally did not get on well, and as far as Saunders was concerned, French was a "cocky little upstart". The distrust was mutual: French considered Saunders snooty and uptight. French actually wanted to become a drama teacher, whereas Saunders loathed the idea and had not fully understood what the course was about; thus, she disliked French for being enthusiastic and confident about the course. Saunders was shocked to find that she was actually taking courses to become a teacher, as her mother had filled out the application form. Her mother, however, was saddened when Saunders chose not to apply for an Oxbridge university education.
After the initial friction, while at college Saunders and French shared a flat together. French has remarked on Saunders's messy habits when sharing the house, stating, "When we lived together in Chalk Farm she had a room at the top of the house. We got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the worst is that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there." The two performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing tampons in their ears, as "cringeworthy." The manager of the club where they performed recalled, "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all."

==Career==

===Early career===

Saunders and French would eventually come to public attention as members of the informal comedy collective the Comic Strip, part of the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s. They answered a 1980 advert in The Stage newspaper looking for female comedians to perform at the Comic Strip, which until that point, only had male performers. When they walked into the audition they were immediately told "You're booked. When can you start?".
Both Saunders and French became continuing members of the Comic Strip, which included Peter Richardson, Rik Mayall and Robbie Coltrane, as well as Saunders' future husband Adrian Edmondson. The group performed at the Boulevard Theatre, above Soho's Raymond Revuebar, and gained a cult following, with visiting audience members including Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Robin Williams, who once joined in the performance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56997 |title=Home Cinema @ The Digital Fix - The Comic Strip Presents - The Complete Collection in July |publisher=Dvdtimes.co.uk |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl] By the time French and Saunders became members of the Comic Strip, French was already working as a drama teacher, whilst Saunders was on the dole and spending a lot of her time sleeping in bed after the dole office closed for the day.
