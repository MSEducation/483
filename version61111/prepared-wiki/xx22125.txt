The classical mathematical puzzle known as water, gas, and electricity; the three utilities problem; or sometimes as the three cottages problem can be stated as follows:
The problem is an abstract mathematical puzzle which imposes constraints that would not exist in a practical engineering situation.

==History==

Henry Dudeney states that the problem is "as old as the hills...much older than electric lighting, or even gas";[tpl]cite book|  last=Dudeney| first=Henry|title=Amusements in mathematics| publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=1917[/tpl]   a review of the problem's history is given by Kullman who states that most published references to the problem characterize it as "very ancient".[tpl]cite journal| last=Kullman| first=David|  title=The Utilities Problem| journal=Mathematics Magazine| year=1979| volume=52| number=5| pages=299â€“302| jstor=2689782| postscript=.[/tpl]

==Solution==

The answer to the strict puzzle posed above is no; It is impossible to connect the three cottages with the three different utilities without at least one of the connections crossing another. More generalised questions may have different answers.Gas Water Electric Puzzle from puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk
The problem is part of the mathematical field of topological graph theory which studies the embedding of graphs on surfaces. In more formal graph-theoretic terms, the problem asks whether the complete bipartite graph K3,3 is planar. This graph is often referred to as the utility graph in reference to the problem;Utility Graph from mathworld.wolfram.com it has also been called the Thomsen graph.[ref]
