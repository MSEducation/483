==World War I combat service==

Flying Bristol F.2 Fighter No. C792, he and his gunner Cyril Gladmanhttp://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/coler.php Retrieved 9 January 2010. attacked a formation of 14 German fighters on 9 May 1918.[tpl]cite book |title=In clouds of glory: American airmen who flew with the British during the Great War |page= 70 [/tpl] They drove three German Pfalz D.III fighters down out of control on this single combat sortie.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/coler.php Retrieved 9 January 2010.
On 13 August 1918, Coler and Gladman destroyed three Fokker D.VIIs and drove down two others out of control within a few minutes; Seeley won the DFC for this mission.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/coler.php Retrieved 9 January 2010. The action began when Coler dived on 20 Fokker D.VIIs, setting one with a red nose and yellow fuselage on fire from a range of ten yards. He sent another spinning down out of control before his Vickers machine guns jammed. While he was clearing the jam, Gladman knocked a Fokker down out of control. As Coler cleared his guns' stoppage, a Fokker crossed before him 50 yards out; Coler fired 60 rounds into it and set it afire. Gladman then was shot in the right shoulder while changing ammunition drums. Nothing daunted, he shot it down left-handed, sending it down in flames.[tpl]cite book |title=In clouds of glory: American airmen who flew with the British during the Great War |page= 72 [/tpl]
The following day, Coler and Gladman  were forced to land behind British lines, the gunner being severely wounded. Their conqueror seems to have been Otto Könnecke.[tpl]cite book |title= Bristol F2 Fighter Aces of World War I page = 25 - 26 [/tpl]

Bruno Loerzer scored his 40th victory by puncturing the fuel tank and cutting the aileron controls on Coler's Bristol and driving it into a crash-landing near Beugny.

Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC)
Lieut. (A./Capt.) Eugene Seeley Coler. (FRANCE)
Bold in attack and skilful in manoeuvre, this officer never hesitates to engage the enemy regardless of disparity in numbers. On 13 August when on escort duty, he dived on a formation of twenty enemy aeroplanes. In the engagement that ensued he himself destroyed three and his observer two making a total of five machines destroyed in the fight; a fine performance, reflecting great credit on the officers concerned.Supplement to the London Gazette, 3 December 1918 (31046/14320)
