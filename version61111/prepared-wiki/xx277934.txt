==Plot==

After her childhood friend Alexis (Felisha Cooper) dies while performing a cheerleading move, the rebellious Maddy (Caitlin Stasey) is horrified when Alexis's football-playing boyfriend Terry (Tom Williamson) begins immediately dating cheerleader Tracy (Brooke Butler). As a result Maddy decides that she will join the cheerleading team, as they must now find a replacement for Alexis, with the intent to seek revenge against Terry and Tracy. She accomplishes this by making the two doubt each other's fidelity, while also seducing Tracy herself. Things take a deadly turn when a car crash results in the death of several cheerleaders, which Maddy's ex-girlfriend Leena (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) uses to her advantage by raising the dead cheerleaders in a Pagan ritual. The cheerleaders find themselves with a new hunger for human flesh, preferably from the football players responsible for their car crash.
