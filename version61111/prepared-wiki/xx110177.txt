Junshan Yinzhen ([tpl]Zh|s=君山银针|t=君山銀針|p=jūn shān yín zhēn, lit. "Silver Needle(s) of the Gentleman Mountain"[/tpl]) is a Yellow tea from Junshan Island of the Hunan Province in China. It is one of the ten Chinese Famous Teas. Although the same kind of tea trees are also planted around Dongting Lake, where Junshan Island is located, those teas should not be called Junshan Yinzhen. The tea resembles the White tea Yinzhen known as Bai Hao Yinzhen. Junshan Yinzhen, allegedly the preferred tea of Chairman Mao Zedong, is a rare tea sometimes sold as White tea.
