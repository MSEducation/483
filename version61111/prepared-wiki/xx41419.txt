Liverpool John Lennon Airport [tpl]airport codes|LPL|EGGP[/tpl] is an international airport serving the North West of England. Formerly known as Speke Airport, RAF Speke, and Liverpool Airport the airport is within the City of Liverpool on the estuary of the River Mersey some [tpl]convert|6.5|NM|lk=in[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher = NATS (Services) Limited | url = http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=91&Itemid=140.html | title = Liverpool - EGGP | accessdate = 2009-01-01[/tpl] southeast of the city centre. The airport is named after Liverpudlian musician John Lennon of The Beatles. It has some domestic services and scheduled flights to locations across Europe.
Between 1997 and 2007 it was one of Europe's fastest growing airports, increasing annual passenger numbers from 689,468 in 1997 to 5.47 million in 2007. Passenger numbers have since fallen and around 4.2 million passengers passed through the airport in 2013, making it the 12th busiest airport in the United Kingdom. It has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P735) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flying instruction.

==History==

Built in part of the grounds of Speke Hall, Liverpool (Speke) Airport, as the airport was originally known, started scheduled flights in 1930 with a service by Imperial Airways via Barton Aerodrome near Eccles, Manchester and Castle Bromwich Aerodrome Birmingham to Croydon Airport near London. The airport was officially opened in mid-1933. By the late 1930s, air traffic from Liverpool was beginning to take off with increasing demand for Irish Sea crossings, and a distinctive passenger terminal, control tower and two large aircraft hangars were built.
During World War II, the airport was taken over by the Royal Air Force and known as RAF Speke. Rootes built many bombers in a "shadow factory" here, including Bristol Blenheims and 1,070 Handley Page Halifaxes. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation assembled many types, including Hudsons and Mustangs, that had been shipped from the United States to Liverpool Docks. The airport was also home to the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit.
On 8 October 1940 (one day before John Lennon's birth), Speke was witness to what is thought to be the fastest air-to-air combat "kill" in the Battle of Britain and possibly of all time. Flight Lieutenant Denys Gillam took off in his Hawker Hurricane from Speke to be confronted by a Junkers 88 passing across him. He shot the Junkers down while his undercarriage was still retracting, and, along with Alois Vašátko and Josef Stehlík, all of 312 Squadron, was credited with the kill. The moment has been caught in a painting by Robert Taylor called "Fastest Victory".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.south-lancs-aviation.bravepages.com/ju88.htm | title = Shooting down of a Ju88 by No 312 Squadron | publisher = RAF Millom Aviation & Military Museum Group | accessdate = 2009-01-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aceshighgallery.co.uk/viewer/206.html | title = Fastest Victory | publisher = aceshighgallery.co.uk | first = Robert | last = Taylor | accessdate = 2008-09-10 [/tpl]
Normal civil airline operations resumed after VE-day and passengers increased from 50,000 in 1945 to 75,000 in 1948, remaining ahead of Manchester Airport. Ownership by the Ministry of Aviation proved to be a drag on the airport's progress thereafter and Manchester gained the lead from 1949, resulting in Liverpool's loss of the only ground-controlled radar approach unit available to North West airports, further hampering operation.
During the post war years Speke Airport hosted an annual Air Display in aid of the Soldiers, Sailors, and Air Force Association, a charity for veterans. The displays were immensely popular and attracted a huge crowd.  On one such occasion on 21 May 1956 sadly tragedy struck with the death of Léon Alfred Nicolas "Léo" Valentin billed as the Birdman when his balsa wood wings struck the opening of the aircraft from which he was exiting and he was hurtled into an uncontrollable spin. He attempted to deploy his emergency parachute but it became entangled and 'roman candled' leaving Leo to fall to his death. The local newspaper headlined the story with "The world has been robbed of a daring personality".  Ironically, a few years earlier Valentin had been attributed with discovering the free-fall stable position still used by sports parachutists today for safe deployment.
The city took over control of the airport on 1 January 1961 and prepared development plans. In 1966, a new [tpl]convert|7500|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] runway was opened by Prince Philip on a new site to the southeast of the existing airfield. It enabled the airport to be open for business around the clock and is in use to this day. Control of the airport transferred to Merseyside County Council from Liverpool Corporation in the mid 1970s and then, ten years later, to the five Merseyside councils following the abolition of Merseyside County Council. A modern passenger terminal adjacent to the new runway opened in 1986 and this was followed by the closure of the original 1930s building.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Liverpool John Lennon Airport | year = 2004 | url = http://www.liverpooljohnlennonairport.com/about_us/index.html?history | title = Liverpool John Lennon Airport History | accessdate = 2005-11-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The original terminal building dating from the late 1930s, famously seen on early television footage with its terraces packed with Beatles fans, was left derelict for over a decade after being replaced in 1986. It was renovated and adapted to become a hotel, opened for business in 2001, preserving its Grade II listed Art Deco style. It was part of the Marriott chain of hotels, but is currently the Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel after a renovation in August 2008.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Friends of Liverpool Airport | year = 2011 | url = http://www.fola.org.uk/current.html| title = Recent History and Current Developments | accessdate = 2011-11-12[/tpl] The former apron of the terminal is also listed and retained in its original condition, although it is no longer connected to the airport or subject to airside access control. It is the home of several aircraft, including BAe Jetstream 41 prototype G-JMAC and Bristol Britannia G-ANCF, preserved by the Speke Aerodrome heritage Group.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The two art-deco-style hangars that flank the terminal and apron have also been converted for new uses: one is now a David Lloyd leisure centre, the other the headquarters of the Shop Direct Group, called Skyways House.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Marriott International Inc | url = http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/LPLMS | title = Liverpool Marriott Hotel South | accessdate = 2005-11-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.jetstream-club.org/ | title = The Jetstream Club | publisher = The Jetstream Club | accessdate = 2008-09-09 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Home shopping jobs go west | work = Manchester Evening News | date = 2005-07-14 | accessdate = 2008-09-09 | first = Patricia | last = Roberts | url = http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/business/s/165/165857_home_shopping_jobs_go_west.html [/tpl]
In 1990 the airport was privatised, with British Aerospace taking a 76% shareholding in the new company. Subsequently the airport has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Peel Holdings Ltd. In 2000, work on a £42.5 million passenger terminal began, tripling its size and passenger capacity, completed in 2002. There have since been further extensions. The airport's strategy is to cater largely for 'low cost' operators, and consequently the layout of the terminal and gates requires passengers to walk unprotected from the weather to and from passenger aircraft. Destinations served are throughout Europe, the 2007 scheduled services to the USA and Canada having been withdrawn.
2002 saw the airport being renamed in honour of John Lennon, a founding member of The Beatles, 22 years after Lennon's death. A [tpl]convert|7|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall bronze statue stands overlooking the check-in hall. Liverpool airport officials were inspired by the layout and name of John Wayne Airport which boasts a 7 ft tall bronze statue of actor John Wayne which stands overlooking the check-in hall. On the roof is painted the airport's motto, a line from Lennon's song "Imagine": "Above us, only sky".Peter Adey, ""Above Us Only Sky": Themes, Simulations, and Liverpool John Lennon Airport," pp. 153-166 in The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self, ed. Scott A. Lukas (Lanham, MD, Lexington Books, 2007), ISBN 0-7391-2142-1 In 2005 the Yellow Submarine, a large-scale work of art, was installed on a traffic island at the entrance to the airport. In 2005 a brand-new apron exclusively for EasyJet was constructed to the east of the terminal with six stands and a pier with six boarding gates.
In late 2006, now-defunct Flyglobespan began daily flights to Tenerife South Airport, the Canary Islands, Spain, and the airport's first long haul flights to John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport near Toronto, Canada, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. A long series of problems with the service led to it being abandoned the next year.
In September 2006 reconstruction started on the main runway and taxiways. This was the first time the runway had been reconstructed (as opposed to resurfaced) since it was opened in 1966. This work was completed in 2007.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Contract Journal | title = Tarmac's John Lennon Airport resurfacing | url = http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/liverpool-john/ | accessdate = 2012-04-20[/tpl] In addition to runway and shoulder work was the upgrade of the 40-year-old airfield group lighting with a new system, intended to upgrade the runway to ILS Category III standards.
In 2007 construction of a multi-level car park and a budget Hampton by Hilton Hotel started. The hotel opened in October 2009.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Business Traveller | year = 2009 | url = http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/hilton-to-open-liverpools-first-on-airport-hotel | title = Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hampton by Hilton Hotel[/tpl] In June 2010 Vancouver Airport Services announced that it reached an agreement with The Peel Group to acquire 65% share in its airports, including Liverpool.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Liverpool Airport | year = 2009 | url = http://www.liverpoolairport.com/press-office/vancouver-airport-services-announces-agreement-to-invest-in-liverpool-john-lennon-airport.html | title = Vancouver Airport Services Announces Agreement to Invest in Liverpool John Lennon Airport[/tpl] Airside improvements include additional retail units and a more advanced security area aiming at reducing waiting times, completed in autumn 2010.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Liverpool Airport | year = 2009 | url = http://www.liverpoolairport.com/press-office/peel-airports-considers-partners-at-liverpool-john-lennon-airport.html | title = Peel Airports considers partners at Liverpool John Lennon Airport[/tpl]
In March 2009, KLM started flying from the airport to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, initially with three flights daily.http://www.liverpoolairport.com/press-office/klm-returns-to-liverpool-after-70-years-and-opens-up-the-world-to-liverpool-passengers.html An extra daily flight started on 10 May 2010.http://www.klm.com/travel/gb_en/about/news_press/travel_news/floatingnews/liverpool_4th_frequency.htm However just over three years after the service began, KLM cancelled it in March 2012 citing the global economic downturn.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-16180054
A master plan is in place to be completed by 2030 which plans for the airport to grow significantly. This includes new terminal buildings and the introduction of permanent long-haul services.Master Plan

==Airport directors==

Captain Harold James Andrews was appointed as the first Airport Manager in July 1932, and he was effectively the first full-time professional co-ordinator for the whole project. Jack Chadwick took over many of the management functions post-war until 1961. That year there was a traffic increase of 42%, attributed to the first airport marketing campaign initiated by the new Airport Director, Wing Commander H.W.G.Andrews.[tpl]cite book|last=Butler|first=Phil|title=Liverpool John Lennon Airport An Illustrated History|year=2008|publisher=Tempus Publishing|isbn=978 0 7524 4511 3|pages=21,74,124[/tpl] In the late 1960s, Brian Trunkfield MBE was a much-respected Assistant Director, and Keith Porter took over as Airport Director in the days when The Beatles were regular passengers.[tpl]cite web|title=Liverpool Parks Police Report - The Airport Constabulary|url=http://www.liverpoolparkspolice.co.uk/PDF/article-liverpool-airport-police.pdf|publisher=FOLA-Friends of Liverpool Airport|accessdate=29 January 2013[/tpl] Chris Preece, a former executive of British Aerospace, was Airport Director during much of the British Aerospace years of ownership, replaced by Rod Rufus and then Rod Hill, who brought in Direct Holidays, part of the MyTravel Group on a commercial deal which was to prove the market for easyJet. Neil Pakey took over as Managing Director in 2002, taking the airport through its major passenger growth years and renaming of it To John Lennon Airport. On selling the airport to Vancouver Airport Services in 2010, the former Operations Director for Vancouver Airport, Craig Richmond, took over, and on 1 March 2013, Matthew Thomas, also from Vancouver Airport Services (by then renamed Vantage Airport Group), was appointed to the role.[tpl]cite news|title=John Lennon Airport Appoint new Chief Executive|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2013/01/08/john-lennon-airport-appoint-new-chief-executive-matthew-thomas-99623-32564687/|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|date=16 January 2013[/tpl]
