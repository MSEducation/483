[[Potatoes for Christmas]]

CATEGORIES: Papa Roach EPs, 1994 EPs

Potatoes for Christmas is the first EP by Californian rock band Papa Roach. The EP is now only available digitally, and was originally released in 1994. Dave Buckner was not featured on the EP, despite being in the band, because he was spending the year in Seattle, so he was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown.

==Re-release==

The album was re-released on April 8, 2003, and is available digitally online and was once available at some FYE stores sold as "used". However, the band did not authorize its re-release. On http://www.amazon.com/, Jacoby Shaddix wrote a review of the EP encouraging fans not to buy the EP because they did not authorize the re-release and do not make money off of the sales of the EP, similar to the release of the greatest hits compilation, ...To Be Loved: The Best of Papa Roach.
