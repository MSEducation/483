[[Neoaves]]

CATEGORIES: Neognathae

Neoaves is a clade that consists of all modern birds (Neornithes or Aves) with the exception of Paleognathae (ratites and kin) and Galloanserae (ducks, chickens and kin). The early diversification of the various neoavian groups occurred very rapidly, and attempts to resolve their relationships with each other have resulted in much controversy.Mayr G.
