George James Phillips Vautin (23 April 1869 â€“ 9 January 1949) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was born at Orielton, Tasmania and died at West Preston, Victoria. 
Vautin was from Tasmania and played at the City Football Club in Hobart.  A rover, he represented his league in 1889 in an away series in Victoria, impressing the Essendon recruiters who signed him up for the 1892 VFA season. The VFL began in 1897 and Vautin was a member of the inaugural premiership side.
He was also a handy cricketer, playing a first-class match for Tasmania in 1889/90 and another for Victoria in 1894/95.
