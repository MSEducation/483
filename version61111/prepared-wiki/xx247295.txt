The Michiganensian made particular note of newcomer Benny Friedman, starting at right halfback: "Michigan's running and passing game was at its best with Friedman, a new man doing the hurling and Captain Steger the receiving.  A long pass from Friedman to Steger put the ball on the two-yard line."1925 Michiganensian, Michigan 21 - Wisconsin 0, page 204.  The New York Times also took note of Friedman's debut, noting that Michigan had found "a new and dazzling gridiron meteor" in his first game as a regular.

A big man, extremely active, he provides the pivotal spot upon which a line-plunging attack may rest.  He carries his charge through so that he is never shoved back upon his runner.  He is never guilty of 'knifing' through.
