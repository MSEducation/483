====Liberal Alternative====

This form of civil union would replace the PACS symbolically. Recognition of marriage is, of course, possible.''"Libertés individuelles

====Libertarianz====

Libertarianz stated in their platform that the party "fully supports the concept of a civil union and would also support allowing marriages between same sex couples, and indeed polygamous marriages or marriages between people who are already related—in all cases as long as all parties are adults and consenting."Libertarianz - Civil Unions The organization ceased to exist in February 2014.

The brochure then went onto explain that libertarians opposed efforts to prohibit private sector discrimination because people have the right to be wrong, and that peaceful persuasion was the better method to deal with prejudice than civil rights legislation.
In the 1990s this organization was joined by the classical liberal-libertarian LGBT rights organization called the Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty.Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty
