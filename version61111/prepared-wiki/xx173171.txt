NSB InterCity Express or ICE is a premium medium distance railway service provided by Norges Statsbaner (NSB) on the routes Lillehammer–Oslo–Skien (along parts of the Dovre Line, the Gardermoen Line and the Vestfold Line) and Oslo–Halden–Göteborg (along the Østfold Line) with hourly headway. NSB operates sixteen Type 70 and six Type 73b electric multiple units on the service.
As of December 2012, the new Stadler FLIRT, known as the NSB Class 74 is the train used on all regular departures on line R10: Lillehammer-Oslo-Skien. However, the Class 70 is still used on line R10 and R20 (Østfold Line) on the extra departures in the morning and afternoon rush hour. 

==History==

The service was introduced in 1992 when 16 brand new Type 70 units were delivered. The new services would offer hourly headway on the involved routes, bypassing many smaller stops that would be served by commuter trains. The extension to Göteborg is only offered thrice each day. In 2000 the service was supplemented with six Type 73b units, and for some years the ICE trains were partially branded as NSB Agenda. In 2012, NSB took delivery of the brand new Class 74 Stadler FLIRT units and the Class 70 on line R10 was gradually replaced. As of December 2012, all regular departures are served by Class 74.
