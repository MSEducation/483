The single topped Airplay charts and remained #1 for three consecutive weeks. Although the single received overwhelming results, it failed to win a Mutizen Song for the group. Nonetheless, the single continued to receive success and debuted as #1 in Thailand's charts on March 21, 2006. "Miracle" was the second song produced by SM Entertainment that topped overseas music charts in Thailand of Channel V after TVXQ's "Rising Sun." The song stayed as #1 for four consecutive weeks.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/2006-03-09/17141011040.html|title=Korea's idol group Super Junior makes debut performance in Thailand|work=Sina|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2007-08-05|language=Chinese[/tpl]

==Music video==

The music video starts off with Super Junior 05 huddling together, crying out random dialogue. They join together, yell out "Miracle," and begin to dance together. The video then shoots into their dance in the studio, to some of the members' random horse playing, to a walk through a sea of fans, and into a traveling bus where they continue to fool around. The video ends with Super Junior performing the song on stage with over one thousand fans watching them.
A majority of the music video was filmed in a studio, where they perform their dance choreography under colorful studio lights. A part of the video was also shot in a traveling bus and in the city, where it showed many Super Junior fans screaming for them.
Similar to the lyrics and music style of the song, the dance choreography for the music video contains light-hearted motions. Arm and leg movements that form heart shapes are used, creating the choreography to be lively and happy. During the dance bridge, some upbeat waving and locking techniques are also used, mainly performed by the group's four lead dancers: Eunhyuk, Donghae, Shindong, and Han Geng.
