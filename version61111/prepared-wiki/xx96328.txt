==Name==

Komenda was first mentioned in written sources in 1147–54 as de sancto Petro (and as hospitale Sancti Petri in 1296, in der pharren von Sand Peter in 1322, and comendator ad S. Petrum in 1446). The name of the village is identical to the Slovene common noun komenda 'commandry', referring to a property and residence owned by the Knights Hospitaller from 1223 to 1872. The noun komenda is borrowed (probably via German Kommende) from Medieval Latin commenda 'entrusted property'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 197. In the 19th century the German name was Commenda.
