Michael Webb (born 3 March 1937) is an English architect. He was a founding member of the 1960s Archigram Group, a collection of six young architects who were determined to shake up what they saw as a stodgy British architectural profession. Using a magazine format, Archigram promoted a radical rethinking of the concept of architecture, using inflatable structures, clothing-like environments, bright colors and cartoon-like drawing techniques that followed contemporary graphic and technological trends.
Webb was born in Henley-on-Thames and studied architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London, taking seventeen years to complete a five-year curriculum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archweb.cooper.edu/faculty/faculty/webb.html|date=2008-11-05|work=Faculty|title=Michael Webb|publisher=Cooper Union School of Architecture[/tpl] Webb moved to the United States in 1965 to teach at Virginia Tech, and has since taught architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia University, Barnard College, Cooper Union, University at Buffalo and Princeton University.
He has also put on many exhibitions in Europe and America. His latest exhibition, Two Journeys, opened in the spending the fall semester learning about them through conversations and their drawings. The Two Journeys exhibition gave Webb an opportunity for the students to learn about him and his work. The exhibit was mounted and read like the pages of a book. It centered around two main themes: a train of thought deriving from the Reyner Banham article A Home is not a House (1965) and a study of linear perspective projection.
