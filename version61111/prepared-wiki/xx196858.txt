Vesperae solennes de Dominica, K. 321, is a sacred work composed in 1779 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is scored for SATB soloists, SATB choir, violin I, violin II, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones colla parte, 2 timpani, and basso continuo (bassoon and organ). 
It was composed in Salzburg at the request of the Archbishop Colloredo for liturgical use in the city's cathedral. The title "de Dominica" signifies its use in Sunday services.[tpl]cite book|title=Mozart|author=Robert Gutnam|year=2011|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=gu-kvXUiVd0C&pg=PT560&lpg=PT560&dq=%22vesperae+solennes%22+sunday|accessdate=21 February 2013[/tpl] 
The setting is divided into six movements, including five psalms and a setting of the Magnificat. A setting of the Minor Doxology (Gloria Patri) concludes all movements, each recapitulating the opening theme. The first three psalms are scored in a vigorous, exuberant manner, contrasting with the strict counterpoint of the a capella Laudate pueri. The Laudate Dominum is set as an extended aria for the soprano soloist, while the Magnificat opens with a majestic, moderate tempo, only to return to the bolder tempo of the first three psalms.[tpl]cite book|title=Mozart: His Character, His Work|author=Alfred Einstein, Arthur Mendel|year=1945|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ep4PXMszMv4C&lpg=PA345&dq=%22vesperae%20solennes%22%20colloredo&pg=PA343#v=onepage&q=vesperae&f=false|accessdate=21 February 2013[/tpl] 
In 1780, Mozart composed another setting of the Vespers, the Vesperae solennes de confessore, which shares many musical similarities with this work.
