Coke Robert Stevenson (March 20, 1888 – June 28, 1975) was the 35th Governor of Texas from 1941 to 1947. He was the only 20th century Texan politician to serve as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, as Lieutenant Governor, and then as governor. In 1966, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark marker number 5118, honoring Stevenson, was placed on the Kimble County Courthouse grounds in Junction, Texas.[tpl]cite web | title=Coke Stevenson Recorded Texas Historic Landmark | publisher=Texas Historical Commission | url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5267005118&site_name=Stevenson,+Coke+R.&class=5000 | accessdate=16 February 2011[/tpl]

==Early life==

He was born near the geographic center of Texas in Mason County to Robert Milton and Virginia Hurley Stevenson. His parents named him for Governor Richard Coke.Robert A. Caro: The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Means of Ascent, p. 146. New York 1991, Vintage. ISBN 978-0-679-73371-3 As a teenager, he went into the business of hauling freight with a six-horse wagon. Stevenson studied law while working as a bank janitor and cashier, and attained admission to the bar in 1913.Robert Dallek, Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960, Volume 1, 1991, page 315

==Early career==

In 1913, Coke Stevenson became president of the First National Bank in Junction, the seat of Kimble County. He was Kimble County Attorney from 1914 to 1918 and Kimble county judge, the chief county administrator with some judicial duties, from 1919 to 1921.

==Public service==

In 1928 he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat, and served there from 1929 until 1939. In 1933, he was elected Speaker of the House; he was re-elected in 1935, becoming the first person in Texas history to serve two consecutive terms as Speaker. After five terms in the House, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1938, serving under Governor W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel.
Stevenson succeeded to the governorship on August 4, 1941, when O'Daniel resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, which he won in a special election. In dramatic contrast to the flamboyant and unpredictable O'Daniel, Stevenson's approach was so conservative and taciturn that his critics accused him of doing nothing. Stevenson was elected to a full term in 1942, winning the Democratic primary with 69% of the vote and being unopposed in the general election. He was elected to a second term in 1944, effectively unopposed.[tpl]cite book|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|year=1985|pages=529, 1087[/tpl] When he left the governorship in January 1947, he was the longest-serving governor in the history of Texas and had presided over a broad and deep economic recovery during the years of World War II.
In 1948, Stevenson filed his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. He led the Democratic primary with 39.7% to 33.7% against U.S. Representative Lyndon B. Johnson of Austin. A third candidate was George Peddy of Houston, originally from Shelby County in East Texas, who had been an Independent write-in candidate for the Senate in 1922 but was defeated by Democratic nominee Earle Bradford Mayfield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpe13|title=George Edwin Bailey Peddy|publisher=tshaonline.org|accessdate=June 18, 2013[/tpl] As the lowest finisher in the primary, Peddy was eliminated from the runoff election.
In the hotly contested runoff between Stevenson and Johnson, Johnson won by only 87 votes out of 988,295 cast - one of the closest results in a senatorial election in U.S. history.[tpl]cite book|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|year=1985|page=1101[/tpl] (As there was only a weak Republican Party in Texas at the time, winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to victory.) Stevenson challenged the result on grounds of voter fraud, a charge widely acknowledged as accurate today on the basis of evidence presented by Johnson biographer Robert Caro, such as the testimony of Luis Salas, the Texas election judge who certified the disputed ballots.[tpl]cite news |title=Books of The Times; The Making of a Senator In the Stealing of an Election |author=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/08/books/books-of-the-times-the-making-of-a-senator-in-the-stealing-of-an-election.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 8, 1990 |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] However, the Democratic State Central Committee sustained Johnson's victory by a 29–28 vote. The tie-breaking vote was cast by publisher Frank W. Mayborn of Temple, who rushed back to Texas from a business trip in Nashville, Tennessee, at the urging of Johnson's campaign manager, John B. Connally. Stevenson was granted an injunction by the federal district court, barring Johnson from the general election ballot. However, Supreme Court Associate Justice Hugo Black, sitting as a circuit justice, ruled that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction, and that the question was for the Central Committee to decide.[tpl]cite news |title=How Johnson Won Election He'd Lost |author=Martin Tolchin |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/11/us/how-johnson-won-election-he-d-lost.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 11, 1990 |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] He ordered the injunction stayed, and his ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court.Harvard Law Review, Vol. 62, No. 2 (Dec., 1948), pp. 311-313
After the loss to Johnson, Stevenson retired to Junction. Disenchanted with the Democratic Party, he supported Republicans for the rest of his life, including John G. Tower for the Senate and Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater for the presidency.
In 1964, he even met at his ranch with the Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Crichton of Dallas. He did not specifically endorse Crichton over John B. Connally, who had worked for Johnson against Stevenson in the disputed 1948 vote, but meeting with Crichton was seen as a sign of Stevenson's support.

On December 24, 1912, Stevenson married Fay Wright. The couple had one son, Coke Stevenson Jr. Fay died on January 3, 1942, and is buried at the Junction Cemetery.[tpl]Find a Grave|27129953|Fay Wright Stevenson[/tpl]

==Historiography==

Stevenson's character became a subject of historical discussion after the publication of Means of Ascent, the second volume of Robert Caro's best-selling biography of Lyndon Johnson, which covers the disputed 1948 election. Caro portrayed Stevenson as an honorable statesman and reluctant office-seeker, in contrast to the venal and intensely ambitious Johnson.[ref]

His editor, Robert Gottlieb, complained Caro idealized Stevenson because of distaste for Johnson.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/robert-caros-big-dig.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha210_20120415&pagewanted=all |title=Robert Caro’s Big Dig |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Charles McGrath[/tpl] Stevenson was a traditional Texas Democratic politician. When a black man was lynched in Texarkana, Texas in 1943, Stevenson did little in response. In private he is alleged to have said, "Well, you know these negroes sometimes do those kinds of things that provoke whites to such action."

In the April 26, 1990 issue of the New York Review of Books, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills criticized Caro's characterization of the former Texas Governor as anti-corrupt and pointed out that Stevenson had also likely forged a significant number of votes in the very same corrupt counties which aided Johnson in 1948 whenever he ran for Governor.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1990/apr/26/monstre-desacre/?pagination=false|title=Monstre Désacré|author=Garry Willis|publisher=New York Review of Books|date=April 26, 1990 issue|accessdate=February 20, 2014[/tpl]  In one Texas Gubernatorial primary, Stevenson obtained 3,310 votes in the notorious Duval County while five of his rivals split the remaining 17 votes that were tallied.  In another such primary, an opponent of Stevenson won a south Texas county by a total of 3000-5 votes and then lost the county to Stevenson by the exact same margin after a dispute with the county boss resulted in a runoff.
Caro answered these criticisms in an essay in the New York Times Book Review of February 2, 1991.[ref]
</ref> This essay also appeared as an afterword to the paperback edition of ''Means of Ascent''. Caro asserted that Stevenson, while very much a man of his day, was also the throwback western original portrayed in Caro's book.
