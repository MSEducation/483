The 1999 Abkhazian constitutional referendum took place on 3 October 1999 at the same time as presidential elections in the then-internationally unrecognised Republic of Abkhazia. The referendum asked the population to vote on the constitution adopted in 1994. Ethnic Georgians who had been expelled from Abkhazia during the conflict of 1992-93 did not participate in the referendum and the referendum was not recognised internationally.[tpl]cite book |title= Secessi√≥n: international law perspectives |last= Kohen |first= Marcelo G. |year= 2006 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-84928-4 |page= 117 |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FUh8W1-TnNcC&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]
