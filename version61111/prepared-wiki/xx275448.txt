Canertinib (CI-1033) is an experimental drug candidate for the treatment of cancer.  It is an irreversible tyrosine-kinase inhibitor with activity against EGFR (IC50 0.8 nM), HER-2 (IC50 19 nM) and ErbB-4 (IC50 7 nM).[tpl]cite journal | pmid =     10753475 | year =     2000 | last1 =     Smaill | first1 =     JB | last2 =     Rewcastle | first2 =     GW | last3 =     Loo | first3 =     JA | last4 =     Greis | first4 =     KD | last5 =     Chan | first5 =     OH | last6 =     Reyner | first6 =     EL | last7 =     Lipka | first7 =     E | last8 =     Showalter | first8 =     HD | last9 =     Vincent | first9 =     PW | last10 =     Elliott | first10 =     William L. | last11 =     Denny | first11 =     William A. | title =     Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 17.

Interactions: 
Canertinib has been reported as a substrate for OATP1B3. Interaction of canertinib with OATP1B3 may alter its hepatic disposition and can lead to transporter mediated drug-drug interactions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Khurana V, Minocha M, Pal D, Mitra AK | title = Role of OATP-1B1 and/or OATP-1B3 in hepatic disposition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. | journal = Drug Metabol Drug Interact. | volume = 0 | issue = 0 | pages = 1–11 |date=March 2014 | pmid = 24643910 | doi = 10.1515/dmdi-2013-0062 [/tpl]
