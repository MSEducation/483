===Other activities===

Robson made a number of product endorsements, including an appearance in Carlsberg's "Best Pub Side" television commercial.  He also acted as a pundit for ITV during the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 European Championship. In 2004, following the death of Brian Clough, Robson briefly stood in for Clough as a columnist at FourFourTwo magazine, and from 2004 onwards wrote a weekly column for The Mail on Sunday.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/columnists/sportcolumnists.html?in_page_id=1951 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061123191444/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/columnists/sportcolumnists.html?in_page_id=1951 |archivedate=23 November 2006 |title=^ "Sir Bobby Robson — The Mail on Sunday |publisher= Daily Mail (UK) |accessdate=17 November 2013 |location=London[/tpl]

===Bobby Robson Foundation===

Robson defeated bowel cancer in 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a tumour in his right lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008 was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy.  After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining years of his life to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1 million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.
In aid of the Foundation, Robson's 1990 World Cup semi-final 4–3 loss after penalties against West Germany, was replayed on 26 July 2009 as the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match at St James' Park, featuring players from the original 1990 World Cup squads and other special guests. Robson was given a guard of honour before the game, which finished 3–2 to the England side.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4513115.Sir_Bobby_Robson_Trophy__Final_Score___England_3_Germany_2/ |title=Sir Bobby Robson Trophy: Final Score — England 3 Germany 2 |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |newspaper=The Northern Echo |first=Mark |last=Tallentire[/tpl]
At the time of Robson's death, the Foundation had raised £1.6 million. Donations totalling £156,000 were received by the Foundation in the 18 days following his death, and on 15 October 2009, it was announced that the Foundation had raised over £2 million, and that at the request of Robson's family, Alan Shearer would take over Robson's role as the Foundation's patron. It passed the £2.5 million mark in September 2010. Three other patrons were added in 2010, Steve Gibson, Mick Mills and Niall Quinn.
