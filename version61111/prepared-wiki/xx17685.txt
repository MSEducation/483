==SFMT==

SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, is a variant of Mersenne Twister, introduced in 2006,SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) designed to be fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD.
Intel SSE2 and PowerPC AltiVec are supported by SFMT. It is also used for games with the Cell BE in the PlayStation 3.PLAYSTATION 3 License

==MTGP==

MTGP is a variant of Mersenne Twister optimised for GPUs published by Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1005.4973|version= v3 |title= Variants of Mersenne Twister Suitable for Graphic Processors|class= cs.MS|year= 2010|accessdate= |author1= Mutsuo Saito |author2= Makoto Matsumoto [/tpl]  The basic linear recurrence operations are extended from MT and parameters are chosen to allow many threads to compute the recursion in parallel, while sharing their state space to reduce memory load.  Sample code http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MTGP/index.html for CUDA includes parameter sets suitable for 256, 512 and 1024 parallel threads per block, and up to 200 blocks generating independent random streams.  The paper claims improved equidistribution over MT and performance on a high specification GPU (Nvidia GTX260 with 192 cores) of 4.7ms for 5x107 random 32-bit integers.
