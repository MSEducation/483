==Publication history==

Launched in April 1995, Sovereign Seven was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dwayne Turner, and was Claremont's first professional regular series work since his departure from Marvel Comics and the X-Men franchise in 1991. It was the first title set in the DC Universe owned by its creator instead of DC Comics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]

==Fictional team history==

The Sovereign Seven were a group of aliens from various planets exiled to Earth, where they battled various villains, most notably Darkseid. The original group consisted of Cascade, Finale, Rampart, Reflex, Indigo, Network and Cruiser; later, Rampart was killed off and then replaced by the DC character Power Girl.
The title met with middling success and was cancelled after 36 issues, in June 1998, after which Claremont returned to Marvel.
The main characters of Sovereign Seven were all gathered by Cascade as a mysterious force known as The Rapture destroyed their home worlds. Each of the Sovereigns were princes/princesses of their people.
For a time, the group operates out of a mysterious coffee house (the "Crossroads Coffee Bar") located where three Northeastern states meet, which is larger on the inside then it is on the outside. Many times portals open inside doorways, to areas unfamiliar or well known to the Sovereigns, who work as employees to earn their keep. The Coffee house is run by supporting characters Violet Smith and Pansy Jones, comic-book counterparts of the musical alter-egos of Emma Bull and Lorraine Garland - The Flash Girls - of whom Claremont is a fan.Review of The Flash Girls' debut CD The Return of Pansy Smith and Violet Jones (SteelDragon Press/Spin Art, 1993).

One of the Coffee shops' portals take two of the Sovereigns' friends (and their cat), on a multiple-reality adventure before they are returned safely home.
Despite the group's metafictional nature, they were seen fighting a squadron of Apokolips soldiers during the Genesis event.
Dangers appear outside the coffee house as well. A demonic entity takes over couples, making them go on violent rampages. Hunters roam through the woods, endangering innocent people. A well-known neighbor discovers a mystical sword in his house.
