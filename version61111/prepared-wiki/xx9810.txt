[[Pacific Ocean]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific Ocean

The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south, bounded by Asia and Australia in the west, and the Americas in the east.
At 165.25 million square kilometres (63.8 million square miles) in area, this largest division of the World Ocean – and, in turn, the hydrosphere – covers about 46% of the Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of the Earth's land area combined.Pacific Ocean".  Britannica Concise. 2006. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.  The equator subdivides it into the North Pacific Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, with two exceptions: the Galápagos and Gilbert Islands, while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within the South Pacific.

The eastern Pacific Ocean was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and discovered the great "southern sea" which he named Mar del Sur. The ocean's current name was coined by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish expedition of the world in 1521, as he encountered favourable winds on reaching the ocean. He therefore called it Mar Pacifico in Portuguese, meaning "peaceful sea".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09526b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ferdinand Magellan |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Important human migrations occurred in the Pacific in prehistoric times. About 3000BC speakers of the Austronesian languages, probably on the island of Taiwan, mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves, or their languages, south to the Philippines and Indonesia and east to the islands of Micronesia and Melanesia. The greatest migrations took place through the Polynesians, from the Asian edge of the ocean to Tahiti, Hawaii, New Zealand, Easter Island and possibly even America.[tpl]cite book|last=Stanley|first=David|title=South Pacific|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDGapfBX-CAC&pg=PA19|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=David Stanley|isbn=978-1-56691-411-6|page=19[/tpl]
Long-distance trade developed all along the coast from Mozambique to Japan. Trade, and therefore knowledge, extended to the Indonesian Islands but apparently not Australia. By at least 878 when there was a significant Islamic settlement in Canton much of this trade was controlled by Arabs or Muslims. In 219BC Xu Fu sailed out into the Pacific searching for the elixir of immortality. From 1404–33 Zheng He led expeditions into the Indian Ocean.
The Martin Waldseemüller map of 1507 was the first to show the Americas separating two distinct oceans.
The direct contact of the European fleets with western edges of the Pacific began with the Portuguese expeditions of António de Abreu and Francisco Serrão to the Maluku Islands in 1512,Hannard (1991), page 7[tpl]cite book|last=Milton|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Milton|title=Nathaniel's Nutmeg|publisher=Sceptre|year=1999|location=London|pages=5, 7|isbn=978-0-340-69676-7[/tpl] and with Jorge Álvares expedition to southern China in 1513,Porter, Jonathan.  1996 (1996).

Later, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailed the Pacific on a Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522. Magellan called the ocean Pacífico (or "Pacific" "peaceful") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off Cape Horn, he was surprised at how calm the waters became. Although Magellan himself died in the Philippines in 1521, Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition back to Spain across the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope, completing the first world circumnavigation in 1522."Life in the sea: Pacific Ocean", Oceanário de Lisboa.

The Manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries linking Manila and Acapulco, in one of the longest trade routes in history. Spanish expeditions also discovered Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the South Pacific.
Later, in the quest for Terra Australis (i.e., "the great Southern Land"), Spanish explorers in the 17th century discovered the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos, and sailed the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator Luís Vaz de Torres. Dutch explorers, sailing around southern Africa, also engaged in discovery and trade; Abel Janszoon Tasman discovered Tasmania and New Zealand in 1642.[tpl]cite book|title=Primary Australian History: Book F B6 Ages 10-11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_i98Pu5dDhkC&pg=PA6|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2008|publisher=R.I.C.

Spain also sent expeditions to the Pacific Northwest reaching Vancouver Island in southern Canada, and Alaska. The French explored and settled Polynesia, and the British made three voyages with James Cook to the South Pacific and Australia, Hawaii, and the North American Pacific Northwest. In 1768, Pierre-Antoine Véron, a young astronomer accompanying Louis Antoine de Bougainville on his voyage of exploration, established the width of the Pacific with precision for the first time in history.[tpl]cite book|last=Williams|first=Glyndwr|title=Captain Cook: Explorations And Reassessments|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VqDHGru-zcIC&pg=PA143|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-100-6|page=143[/tpl] One of the earliest voyages of scientific exploration was organized by Spain in the Malaspina Expedition of 1789–1794. It sailed vast areas of the Pacific, from Cape Horn to Alaska, Guam and the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, and the South Pacific.
Growing imperialism during the 19th century resulted in the occupation of much of Oceania by other European powers, and later, Japan and the United States. Significant contributions to oceanographic knowledge were made by the voyages of HMS Beagle in the 1830s, with Charles Darwin aboard; HMS Challenger during the 1870s; the USS Tuscarora (1873–76); and the German Gazelle (1874–76).

However, by the end of that war, Japan was defeated and the U.S. Pacific Fleet was the virtual master of the ocean. Since the end of World War II, many former colonies in the Pacific have become independent states.

==Geography==

The Pacific separates Asia and Australia from the Americas. It may be further subdivided by the equator into northern (North Pacific) and southern (South Pacific) portions. It extends from the Antarctic region in the South to the Arctic in the north. The Pacific Ocean encompasses approximately one-third of the Earth's surface, having an area of 165.2 million square kilometres (63.8 million square miles) —significantly larger than Earth's entire landmass of some 150 million square kilometres (58 million square miles)."Area of Earth's Land Surface", The Physics Factbook. Retrieved 9 June 2013.
Extending approximately 15,500 kilometres (9,600 mi) from the Bering Sea in the Arctic to the northern extent of the circumpolar Southern Ocean at 60°S (older definitions extend it to Antarctica's Ross Sea), the Pacific reaches its greatest east-west width at about 5°N latitude, where it stretches approximately 19,800 kilometres (12,300 mi) from Indonesia to the coast of Colombia – halfway across the world, and more than five times the diameter of the Moon.[tpl]cite book|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|title=Encyclopedia of the Arctic: A-F|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LcucDSk4w3YC&pg=PA1461|accessdate=10 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-57958-436-8|page=1461[/tpl] The lowest known point on Earth—the Mariana Trench—lies 10,911 metres (35,797 ft or 5,966 fathoms) below sea level.

Islands in the Pacific Ocean are of four basic types: continental islands, high islands, coral reefs, and uplifted coral platforms. Continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include New Guinea, the islands of New Zealand, and the Philippines. Some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are Bougainville, Hawaii, and the Solomon Islands.[tpl]cite book|last1=Gillespie|first1=Rosemary G.|last2=Clague|first2=David A.|title=Encyclopedia of Islands|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g9ZogGs_fz8C&pg=PA706|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25649-1|page=706[/tpl]
The Coral reefs of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface. One of the most dramatic is the Great Barrier Reef off northeastern Australia with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands.

The volume of the Pacific Ocean, representing about 50.1 percent of the world's oceanic water, has been estimated at some 714 million cubic kilometers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwlf.org/pacific.htm|title=PWLF.org - The Pacific WildLife Foundation - The Pacific Ocean|accessdate=23 August 2013[/tpl] Surface water temperatures in the Pacific can vary from [tpl]convert|-1.4|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl], the freezing point of sea water, in the poleward areas to about [tpl]convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] near the equator.[tpl]cite book|last=Mongillo|first=John F.|title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ozAN5vLbssgC&pg=PA255|accessdate=9 June 2013|year=2000|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-57356-147-1|pages=255–[/tpl] Salinity also varies latitudinally reaching a maximum of 37 parts per thousand in the southeastern area. The water near the equator, which can have a salinity as low as 34 parts per thousand, is less salty than that found in the mid-latitudes because of abundant equatorial precipitation throughout the year. The lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas."Pacific Ocean: Salinity", Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 9 June 2013. The motion of Pacific waters is generally clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (the North Pacific gyre) and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

Its southern arm becomes the chilled slow, south-flowing California Current."Aleutian Current", Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 9 June 2013. 
The South Equatorial Current, flowing west along the equator, swings southward east of New Guinea, turns east at about 50°S, and joins the main westerly circulation of the Southern Pacific, which includes the Earth-circling Antarctic Circumpolar Current. As it approaches the Chilean coast, the South Equatorial Current divides; one branch flows around Cape Horn and the other turns north to form the Peru or Humboldt Current."South Equatorial Current", Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 9 June 2013.

==Climate==

The weather systems in the Northern and Southern hemispheres generally mirror each other. The trade winds in the southern and eastern Pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the North Pacific are far more varied with, for example, cold winter temperatures on the east coast of Russia contrasting with the milder weather off British Columbia during the winter months."Pacific Ocean: Islands", Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 13 June 2013. 
Cyclones are liable to form south of Mexico, striking Central America between June and October, as well as in southeast and east Asia from May to December, especially in August and September. In the western Pacific, monsoons in the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the Asian landmass. In the equatorial Pacific, El Niño, a band of warm ocean temperatures, affects weather conditions in the western Pacific. In the far north, icing from October to May can present a hazard for shipping while persistent fog occurs from June to December."Pacific Ocean", World Factbook, CIA. Retrieved 13 June 2013.

The dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the Andes Cordillera along South America to Mexico, returning then to the islands off California. Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, New Guinea, and New Zealand lie outside the andesite line.
Within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs, submerged volcanic mountains, and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the Pacific basin. Here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs, chains, and clusters. Outside the andesite line, volcanism is of the explosive type, and the Pacific Ring of Fire is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism. The Ring of Fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones.
The Pacific Ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones. Only the Antarctic and Australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones.

===Geological history===

The Pacific Ocean developed from the Panthalassa following the breakup of Pangaea. There is no firm date for when the changeover occurred, as the replacement of the sea bed is a continuous process, though reconstruction maps often change the name from Panthalassic to Pacific around the time the Atlantic Ocean began to open.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G102/102prot2.htm |title=GEOL 102 The Proterozoic Eon II: Rodinia and Pannotia |publisher=Geol.umd.edu |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl] The Panthalassic Ocean first opened 750 million years ago at the breakup of Rodinia, but the oldest Pacific Ocean floor is only around 180 Ma old.[tpl]cite book|last1=Mussett|first1=Alan E.|last2=Khan|first2=M.

===Seamount chains===

The Pacific Ocean contains several long seamount chains, formed by hotspot volcanism. These include the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain and the Louisville seamount chain.

==Economy==

The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths. In shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, petroleum and natural gas are extracted, and pearls are harvested along the coasts of Australia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Philippines, although in sharply declining volume in some cases."Pacific Ocean: Fisheries", Encyclopædia Britannica.

===Fishing===

Fish are an important economic asset in the Pacific. The shallower shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield herring, salmon, sardines, snapper, swordfish, and tuna, as well as shellfish."Pacific Ocean: Commerce and Shipping", The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th edition. Retrieved 14 June 2013. Overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas.
