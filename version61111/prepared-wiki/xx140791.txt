==History==

The recorded history of Milton State Park begins in 1762 when Marcus Huling Jr. made a claim on the island in the West Branch Susquehanna River.  Huling planted an apple orchard on what was to become known as Montgomery Island.
Ownership of the island eventually transferred to the Straub Family. The Straubs built a dam across part of the river in 1824. The Straubs ran a sawmill and gristmill on the island and built a bridge between the island to the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. In time, the mills closed and the land was used for farming. The island was no longer used for farming by the early 1900s.  
Over the next 60 years the island was divided among several owners and used as a picnic ground with several athletic fields. The Milton Rotary Club and the Borough of Milton worked together to consolidate the deeds and transferred ownership of Montgomery Island to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1966.
Hurricane Agnes wiped out the newly created Milton State Park in 1972. The island and much of Pennsylvania in the Susquehanna River watershed was flooded extensively by the hurricane. The park was eventually rebuilt with federal disaster relief funds.
