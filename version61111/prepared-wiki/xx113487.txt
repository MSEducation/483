The Grey-headed Dove (Leptotila plumbeiceps) is a large New World tropical dove. It is a resident breeder from eastern Mexico to western Panama. It was formerly considered conspecific with the Grey-fronted Dove, L. rufaxilla, of South America and the Grenada Dove, L. wellsi, of Grenada.
The Grey-headed Dove inhabits the understory of forests, old second growth, scrubby woodland and cacao plantations. It builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Incubation is about 14 days, and fledging another 15.
