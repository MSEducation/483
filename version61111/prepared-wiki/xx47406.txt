The Grammy Hall of Fame Award is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have "qualitative or historical significance". The award honors recordings (singles and albums) in all genres, including classical, rock, country, Hip hop music, R&B, opera, theatre and film, from the turn of the 20th century through the current eligibility cutoff date. To date (2012), there are 906 Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients out of perhaps hundreds of thousands of albums and singles that have been recorded since 1900. A complete list of recordings awarded this title appear below, divided into four sections.
