There are 114 counties and one independent city in the U.S. state of Missouri. Following the Louisiana Purchase and the admittance of Louisiana into the United States in 1812, five counties were formed out of the Missouri Territory at the first general assembly. Most subsequent counties were apportioned from these five original counties. Six more counties were added through the 1836 Platte Purchase, the acquired lands of which formed the northwest tip of the state and consisted of Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Holt, Nodaway, and Platte counties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/history/timeline/timeline1.asp|title=Timeline of Missouri History: 1673-1799|accessdate=October 10, 2009|publisher=Missouri State Government Web[/tpl]
In Missouri, the county level of government comes between those of the city and the state. Its primary responsibilities include maintaining roads, providing security, prosecuting criminals, and collecting taxes. Elected officials at this level include a sheriff, prosecuting attorney, and assessor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mo.gov/mo/county.htm|title=County Government Links|accessdate=October 10, 2009|publisher=Missouri State Government Web[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Most of the counties in Missouri are named after politicians. One such county, Cass, was originally named Van Buren County after President Martin Van Buren, and was changed to its present name in support of Van Buren's Democratic opponent Lewis Cass during the presidential election of 1848. Other counties are named after war heroes, natural resources, explorers, and former U.S. territories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/history/counties.asp|title=What are the Origins of Missouri Counties?|accessdate=September 17, 2009|publisher=Missouri State Government Web[/tpl]
The city of St. Louis is an independent city, and is not within the limits of a county. Its residents voted to secede from St. Louis County in 1876. Throughout the United States, St. Louis is one of three independent cities outside the state of Virginia (the other two are Baltimore, Maryland and Carson City, Nevada).[tpl]cite web|url=http://stlouis.missouri.org/about/government.html|title=About St. Louis: Government|publisher=City of St. Louis|accessdate=October 12, 2009[/tpl]

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties, and is provided for each entry. These codes link to the United States Census Bureau's "quick facts" for each county. To distinguish from counties in other states, one must use Missouri’s FIPS code, 29. For example, Adair County's unique nationwide identifier is 29001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/mo.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency [/tpl]
