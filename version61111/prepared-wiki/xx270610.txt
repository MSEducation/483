FV Lauda is a German association football club from the city of Lauda-Königshofen, Baden-Württemberg, established on 28 March 1913. It briefly became part of Turnverein Lauda in 1920 before becoming independent again on 5 June 1923.

==History==

Throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s, FV fielded strong sides in the Verbandsliga Baden (V) and managed to break through to play as part of the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg (IV) on three separate occasions in 1981, 1985, and 1997. Grüne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklopädie des deutschen Ligafußballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. ISBN 978-3-89784-147-5.
Following their 1980 Baden Cup win, Lauda made its only appearance in play for the DFB Pokal (German Cup), where they were put out in the opening round by VfB Oldenburg (1:2).
The team's longest turn in Oberliga play was from 1997-2006, which included a second place finish in 2000. The club struggled on being relegated to the Verbandsliga in 2006, earning only lower table finishes there, and was sent down to the Landesliga Odenwald (VII) after a 15th place result in 2011.
