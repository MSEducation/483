==Biography==

Bulloch was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England. In a career spanning over half a century, he is most famous for his role in Boba Fett's costume in the Star Wars films The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (the voice was provided by Jason Wingreen originally and in the updated versions Temuera Morrison). Additionally, he plays a minor role as an Imperial officer in The Empire Strikes Back, his only non-masked appearance in the original Star Wars films. Bulloch returned as Boba Fett for the fan film mocumentary: Return of the Ewok. He also has minor roles in three James Bond films, twice playing Smithers, an assistant to Q. In 1962, he starred alongside Cliff Richard in the musical film Summer Holiday.
Bulloch was more popularly introduced to British audiences in the television series The Newcomers (Oct '65â€“ Dec '67), playing the elder brother to the ravishing debut performance of Judy Geeson. He also appeared in two Doctor Who stories, The Space Museum and The Time Warrior. In recent years, due to the release of the new Star Wars films, he is frequently invited to science fiction conventions throughout the world, and was inducted as an Honorary Member of the 501st Legion costuming organization in May 2002. Later, in November 2009, he actually joined the 501st as a costume-wearing member making appearances with the group as Boba Fett.
In 2004, Bulloch published a limited edition memoir, Flying Solo, which is a humorous account of his personal and professional life, interspersed with tales from the convention circuit. In 2005, he once again made an appearance in a Star Wars film, this time playing Captain Colton in Revenge of the Sith. In 2005, he played the role of "Chairman Skellon" in a stage production of The Trial of Davros. Recently, Bulloch played a small cameo role in Star Wars fan films Order of the Sith: Vengeance and its sequel Downfall - Order of the Sith - alongside David Prowse and Michael Sheard. These fan films were made in England in support of Save the Children.
Bulloch has three sons, ten grandchildren, and lives in London with his wife, Maureen. His half-brother is Robert Watts, who was a producer on two original Star Wars films.
