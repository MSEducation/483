William Allen Miller FRS (17 December 1817 – 30 September 1870) was a British scientist.
He was born in Ipswich, Suffolk and educated at Ackworth School and King's College London.
On the death of John Frederic Daniell he succeeded to the Chair of Chemistry at King's. Although primarily a chemist, the scientific contributions for which Miller is mainly remembered today are in spectroscopy and astrochemistry, new fields in his time.
Miller won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867 jointly with William Huggins, for their spectroscopic study of the composition of stars. In 1845, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=7&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27miller%27%29 |title= Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 30 January 2011[/tpl]
