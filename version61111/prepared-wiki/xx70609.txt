[[Unmanned combat air vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Unmanned military aircraft

An unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), also known as a combat drone or drone, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is usually armed. Aircraft of this type have no onboard human pilot.[tpl]cite web|last=dowd|first=alan|title=Drone wars: risks and warnings|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=DA-SORT&inPS=true&prodId=AONE&userGroupName=jcl_jccc&tabID=T002&searchId=R3&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=12&contentSet=GALE%7CA335069990&&docId=GALE[tpl]![/tpl]A335069990&docType=GALE&role=|accessdate=03/04/2014[/tpl]   Drones are usually under real-time human control, with "the human's role in UCAV system varying according to levels of autonomy of UCAV and data communication requirements".[tpl]cite web|title=The Simulation of the Human-Machine Partnership in UCAV Operation |url=http://www.icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE_CD1998-2010/ICAS2008/PAPERS/281.PDF |publisher=College of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China |accessdate=7 February 2013[/tpl]
Equipment necessary for a human pilot (such as the cockpit, armor, ejection seat, flight controls, and environmental controls for pressure and oxygen) are not needed, as the operator runs the vehicle from a remote terminal, resulting in a lower weight and size than a manned aircraft. Common UAVs that rely on a single propeller engine are slower and less maneuverable than manned high performance aircraft, but are less expensive.[tpl]cite web|last=ugur|first=Ozdemir|title=Design of commercial Hybird VTOL systems|accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl]

==History==

One of the earliest explorations of the concept of the combat drone was by Dr. Lee De Forest, an early inventor of radio devices, and U. A. Sanabria, a TV engineer. They presented their idea in an article in a 1940 publication of Popular Mechanics."Robot Television Bomber" Popular Mechanics June 1940 The modern military drone as known today was the brainchild of John Stuart Foster Jr., a nuclear physicist and former head of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (then called the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515806/the-world-as-free-fire-zone/ |title=The World as Free-Fire Zone |work=MIT Technology Review |author=Fred Kaplan |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013[/tpl] In 1971, Foster was a model airplane hobbyist and had the idea this hobby could be applied to building weapons. He drew up plans and by 1973 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) built two prototypes called "Praeire" and "Calere", they were powered by a modified lawn-mower engine and could stay aloft for two hours while carrying 28-pounds of load.
In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used unarmed U.S. Ryan Firebee target drones to spur Egypt into firing its entire arsenal of anti-aircraft missiles. This mission was accomplished with no injuries to Israeli pilots, who soon exploited the depleted Egyptian defenses. In the late 1970s and 80s, Israel developed the Scout and the Pioneer, which represented a shift toward the lighter, glider-type model of UAV in use today. Israel pioneered the use of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for real-time surveillance, electronic warfare, and decoys. The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses in Operation Mole Cricket 19 at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.
In the late 1980s, Iran deployed a drone armed with six RPG-7 rounds in the Iran–Iraq War. This was the first time an armed drone was used in war.[tpl]citation |first=Fariborz |last=Haghshenass |title=Iran's Asymmetric Naval Warfare |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus87.pdf |work=Policy Focus |issue=87 |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=September 2008 |page=17[/tpl]
Impressed by Israel's success, the US quickly acquired a number of UAVs, and its Hunter and Pioneer systems are direct derivatives of Israeli models. The first 'UAV war' was the first Gulf War: according to a May 1991 Department of the Navy report: "At least one UAV was airborne at all times during Desert Storm." After the Gulf War successfully demonstrated their utility, global militaries invested widely in the domestic development of combat UAVs.
In recent years the U.S. has increased its use of drone strikes in Pakistan as part of the War on Terrorism.

==Future models==

===Overview===

Note: Some of these are not aircraft prototypes but technology demonstrators (TD) that are not expected to enter service.
Various Chinese UCAV concepts have also materialized.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] WZ-2000, UCAV versions of the Xianglong high altitude are long endurance UAV. Also, dedicated UCAV's Shenyang's Dark Sword (Anjian), and also revealed at Zhuhai 2008 was a model of a stealth strike UCAV with forward swept wings, filling a similar niche to U.S. X-45 called the Warrior Eagle.

===BAE Taranis===

Taranis is a British demonstrator programme for unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) technology. It is part of the UK's Strategic Unmanned Air Vehicle (Experimental) programme (SUAVE). BAE describes Taranis's role in this context as following: "This £124m four year programme is part of the UK Government's Strategic Unmanned Air Vehicle Experiment (SUAVE) and will result in a UCAV demonstrator with fully integrated autonomous systems and low observable features." The Taranis demonstrator will have an MTOW (Maximum Takeoff Weight) of about 8000 kilograms and be of comparable size to the BAE Hawk – making it one of the world's largest UAVs. It will be stealthy, fast, and able to deploy a range of munitions over a number of targets, as well as being capable of defending itself against manned and other unmanned enemy aircraft. The first steel was cut in September 2007 and ground testing started in early 2009. The first flight of the Taranis took place in August 2013 in Woomera, Australia.Farmer, Ben (6 February 2014) Successful test flight for Taranis stealth drone Daily Telegraph, Page 12 The demonstrator will have two internal weapons bays. With the inclusion of "full autonomy" the intention is thus for this platform to be able to "think for itself" for a large part of the mission.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===J-UCAS===

Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems, or J-UCAS, was the name for the joint U.S. Navy/U.S. Air Force unmanned combat air vehicle procurement project. J-UCAS was managed by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, the J-UCAS program was terminated."Pentagon Sets Plan For New Bomber, Terminates J-UCAS Program", by Jason Sherman, GlobalSecurity.org, 13 January 2006 The program would have used stealth technologies and allowed UCAVs to be armed with precision-guided weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or precision miniature munitions, such as the Small-Diameter Bomb, which are used to suppress enemy air defenses. Controllers could have used real-time data sources, including satellites, to plan for and respond to changes on and around the battlefield.
The program was later revitalized into UCAS-D, a United States Navy program designed to develop a carrier-based unmanned aircraft."Carrier UCAVs: The Return of UCAS", Defense Industry Daily, 7 February 2010

===N-UCAS===

UCAS-D and Northrop Grumman X-47B are the U.S. Navy-only successors to the J-UCAS, which was cancelled in 2006. Boeing is also working on the X-45N in this sector.
In a New Year 2011 editorial titled "China's Naval Ambitions", The New York Times said "the Pentagon must accelerate efforts to make American naval forces in Asia less vulnerable to Chinese missile threats by giving them the means to project their deterrent power from further offshore. Cutting back purchases of the Navy's DDG-1000 destroyer (with its deficient missile defense system) was a first step. A bigger one would be to reduce the Navy's reliance on short-range manned strike aircraft like the F-18 and the F-35, in favor of the carrier-launched N-UCAS ...."Editorial, The New York Times, January 1, 2011 (January 2, 2011 p. WK7 NY ed.). Retrieved 2011-01-02.
On 6 January 2011, the DOD announced that this would be one area of additional investment in the 2012 budget request.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov//News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=62351 |title=Gates Reveals Budget Efficiencies, Reinvestment Possibilities |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22[/tpl]

===USAF Hunter-Killer===

The United States Air Force has shifted its UCAV program from medium-range tactical strike aircraft to long-range strategic bombers. The technology of the Long Range Strike program is based on the Lockheed Martin Polecat demonstrator.

===Sagem Sperwer===

The Sagem Sperwer B is a long endurance tactical UAV capable of surveillance and armed combat missions. The Sperwer B improves on its predecessor, the Sperwer A, with twice the payload capacity and twice the endurance, offering a 100 kg payload and 12 hours of sustained flight. It can be outfitted with electro-optic/infrared sensors, electronic and communications intelligence (ELINT/COMINT), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as weapons payloads such as the Rafael Spike-LR anti-tank missile and the Bonus munition from Nexter/BAE Systems Bofors.[tpl]cite web|title=Sperwer Tactical Unmanned Air Vehicle, France|url=http://www.army-technology.com/projects/sperwer-uav/|publisher=army-technology.com|accessdate=2/7/13[/tpl] All ground facilities of the Sperwer A (used by France, Netherlands, Sweden, Greece, Canada and Denmark) are compatible with the Sperwer B.

===Elbit Hermes 450===

The Israeli Air Force, which operates a squadron of Hermes 450s out of Palmachim Airbase south of Tel Aviv, has adapted the Hermes 450 for use as an assault UAV, reportedly equipping it with two Hellfire missiles or, according to various sources, two Rafael-made missiles. According to Israeli, Palestinian, Lebanese and independent reports, the Israeli assault UAV has seen extensive service in the Gaza Strip and was used intensively in the Second Lebanon War. Israel has not denied this capability, but to date, its policy has been not to officially confirm it either.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===F-16===

In 2013 Boeing retrofitted retired multiple Lockheed Martin F-16s (re-designated QF-16) with UAV technology. The company demonstrated combat maneuvers including barrel rolls and a "split S" (where the aircraft turns upside down and flies a descending half-loop, reversing direction) and a perfect center line landing. During the test flight, the plane cruised at [tpl]convert|40000|ft[/tpl] and reached speeds of Mach 1.47. The aircraft reached 7Gs of acceleration, but was expected to operate at 9Gs. The existing six QF-16s will be augmented in 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/news/international/21586601-eradicating-extreme-poverty-no-longer-pipe-dream-first-governments-must-agree |title=Poverty: Growth or safety net? |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]

Countries with known operational armed drones:

==Laws and ethics of war==

The international laws of war (such as the Geneva Conventions) govern the conduct of participants in war (and also define combatants). These laws place a burden upon participants to limit civilian deaths and injuries through proper identification of targets and distinction between combatants and non-combatants. The use of completely autonomous weapon systems is problematic, however, because of the difficulty in assigning accountability to a person. Therefore, current designs still incorporate an element of human control (a "man in the loop") – meaning that a ground controller must authorize weapons release.
Concerns also include the human controller's role, because if he is a civilian and not a member of the military (which is quite possible with developmental and highly sophisticated weapons systems) he would be considered a combatant under international law which carries a distinct set of responsibilities and consequences. It is for this reason that the "man in the loop" should ideally be a member of the military that understands and accepts his role as combatant.Legal Implications of the Uninhabited Combat Aerial Vehicle – Air & Space Power Journal
Controllers can also experience psychological stress from the combat they are involved in. A few may even experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/18/nation/la-na-drone-stress-20120318/2 |title=Stress of combat reaches drone crews |date=March 18, 2012 |author=David Zucchino |newspaper=Los Angeles Times[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/12/19/143926857/report-high-levels-of-burnout-in-u-s-drone-pilots |title=Report: High Levels Of 'Burnout' In U.S. Drone Pilots |author=Rachel Martin |publisher=NPR |date=Dec 19, 2011[/tpl]
Professor Shannon E. French, the director of the Center for Ethics and Excellence at Case Western Reserve University and a former professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, wonders if the PTSD may be rooted in a suspicion that something else was at stake. According to Professor French, the author of the 2003 book The Code of the Warrior (ISBN 0847697568):[tpl]cite news| title= Two enemies discover a 'higher call' in battle| first=John |last=Blake| date= March 9, 2013 | url= http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/09/living/higher-call-military-chivalry/ | publisher= CNN | accessdate=2013-03-09[/tpl]

On 28 October 2009, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, presented a report to the Third Committee (social, humanitarian and cultural) of the General Assembly arguing that the use of unmanned combat air vehicles for targeted killings should be regarded as a breach of international law unless the United States can demonstrate appropriate precautions and accountability mechanisms are in place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32764&Cr=alston&Cr1= |title=UN News Centre, "UN rights expert voices concern over use of unmanned drones by United States", 28 October 2009 |publisher=Un.org |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2013-09-22[/tpl]

==Political and personal effects==

As a new weapon, drones are having unforeseen political effects. Some scholars have argued that the extensive use of drones will undermine the popular legitimacy of local governments, which are blamed for permitting the strikes. The case study for this analysis is Yemen, where drone strikes seem to be increasing resentment against the Yemeni government as well as against the U.S.[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Jordan Michael|title=Drone "blowback" is real A new analysis finds five ways drone strikes in Yemen are hurting American interests|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/09/05/drone_blowback_is_real/|accessdate=8 September 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=5 September 2012[/tpl]
Some leaders worry about the effect drone warfare will have on soldiers' psychology. Keith Shurtleff, an army chaplain at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, worries "that as war becomes safer and easier, as soldiers are removed from the horrors of war and see the enemy not as humans but as blips on a screen, there is very real danger of losing the deterrent that such horrors provide".Cole, Jim and Chris Wright. "Drone Wars UK". January 2010. http://dronewarsuk.wordpress.com/aboutdrone/ Similar worries surfaced when "smart" bombs began to be used extensively in the First Gulf War.
Mark Bowden has disputed this viewpoint saying in his The Atlantic article, "But flying a drone, pilot sees the carnage close-up, in real time—the blood and severed body parts, the arrival of emergency responders, the anguish of friends and family. Often he’s been watching the people he kills for a long time before pulling the trigger. Drone pilots become familiar with their victims. They see them in the ordinary rhythms of their lives—with their wives and friends, with their children. War by remote control turns out to be intimate and disturbing. Pilots are sometimes shaken."[tpl]cite web|author=Mark Bowden |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/09/the-killing-machines-how-to-think-about-drones/309434/ |title=The Killing Machines - Mark Bowden |publisher=The Atlantic |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22[/tpl]

==Public opinion summary==

In February 2013, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll conducted a study to measure U.S. public opinion on the use of drones. The study was conducted nationwide, and it asked registered voters whether they "approve or disapprove of the U.S. Military using drones to carry out attacks abroad on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.?" The results showed that three in every four (75%) of voters approved of the U.S. Military using drones to carry out attacks, while (13%) disapproved.Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (February 7, 2013). Public says it's illegal to target Americans abroad as some question CIA drone attacks (press release)
