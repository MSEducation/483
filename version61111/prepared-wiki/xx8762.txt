New Mexico ([tpl]lang-es|Nuevo México[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-es|ˈnweβo ˈmexiko|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-nv|Yootó Hahoodzo[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-nv|jo:tó haho:dzo|[/tpl]) is a state located in the southwest and western regions of the United States. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is the 5th most extensive, the 36th most populous, and the 6th least densely populated of the 50 United States.
Inhabited by indigenous peoples of the Americas for many centuries before European exploration, New Mexico was subsequently part of the Imperial Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain, then part of Mexico, and a U.S. territory before attaining statehood. Among U.S. states, New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics, including descendants of Spanish colonists and recent immigrants from Latin America. It also has the second-highest percentage of Native Americans after Alaska, and the fourth-highest total number of Native Americans after California, Oklahoma, and Arizona.[tpl]cite web | last1=Norris | first=Tina | last2=Vines | first2=Paula L. | last3=Hoeffel | first3=Elizabeth M. | date = February 2012| url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf | title= The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | work=Census 2010 Brief | accessdate=May 1, 2012[/tpl] The tribes in the state consist of mostly Navajo and Pueblo and the Apache peoples. As a result, the demographics and culture of the state are unique for their strong Hispanic and Native-American influences, both of which are reflected in the state flag. The red and gold colors of the New Mexico flag are taken from the flag of Spain, along with the ancient sun symbol of the Zia, a Pueblo-related tribe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/nm_flag.htm |title=New Mexico State Flag – About the New Mexico Flag, its adoption and history from |publisher=Netstate.Com |accessdate=June 10, 2012[/tpl]
New Mexico, or [tpl]lang|es|Nuevo México[/tpl] in Spanish, is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico. However, New Mexico was given its name in 1563, and again in 1581, by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy Indian cultures similar to those of the Mexica (Aztec) Empire.[tpl]cite book |first=David J. |last=Weber |title=The Spanish Frontier in North America |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |year=1992 |page=79 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Sanchez |title=The Rio Abajo Frontier, 1540–1692: A History of Early Colonial New Mexico |location=Albuquerque |publisher=Museum of Albuquerque History Monograph Series |year=1987 |page=51 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R.

The two developed as neighboring Spanish speaking communities, with relatively independent histories.

==Geography==

The state's total area is [tpl]convert|121412|sqmi|km2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://weather.nmsu.edu/News/climate-in-NM.htm|title=CLIMATE OF NEW MEXICO|publisher=New Mexico State University|accessdate=March 20, 2010[/tpl] The eastern border of New Mexico lies along 103° W longitude with the state of Oklahoma, and three miles (5 km) west of 103° W longitude with Texas.[tpl]Failed verification|date=July 2011[/tpl] On the southern border, Texas makes up the eastern two-thirds, while the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora make up the western third, with Chihuahua making up about 90% of that. The western border with Arizona runs along the 109° 03' W longitude. The southwestern corner of the state is known as the Bootheel. The 37° N latitude parallel forms the northern boundary with Colorado. The states New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah come together at the Four Corners in the northwestern corner of New Mexico. New Mexico, although a large state, has little water. Its surface water area is about [tpl]convert|250|sqmi|km2[/tpl].
The New Mexican landscape ranges from wide, rose-colored deserts to broken mesas to high, snow-capped peaks. Despite New Mexico's arid image, heavily forested mountain wildernesses cover a significant portion of the state, especially towards the north. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost part of the Rocky Mountains, run roughly north-south along the east side of the Rio Grande in the rugged, pastoral north. The most important of New Mexico's rivers are the Rio Grande, Pecos, Canadian, San Juan, and Gila. The Rio Grande is tied for the fourth longest river in the U.S.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/riversofworld.html|title=Rivers of the World|publisher=USGS|accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]
The U.S. government protects millions of acres of New Mexico as national forests including:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/map/state_list.shtml#NewMexico|title=Find a Forest by State|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=March 20, 2010[/tpl]

Visitors also frequent the surviving native pueblos of New Mexico. Tourists visiting these sites bring significant money to the state. Other areas of geographical and scenic interest include Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument and the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The Gila Wilderness lies in the southwest of the state.

===Climate===

The climate of New Mexico is generally semi-arid to arid, though there are areas of continental and alpine climates, and its territory is mostly covered by mountains, high plains, and desert. The Great Plains (High Plains) are located in the eastern portion of the state, similar to the Colorado high plains in eastern Colorado. The two states share similar terrain, with both having plains, mountains, basins, mesas, and desert lands. New Mexico's average precipitation rate is [tpl]convert|13.9|in|mm[/tpl] a year. The average annual temperatures can range from [tpl]convert|64|°F|°C[/tpl] in the southeast to below [tpl]convert|40|°F|°C[/tpl] in the northern mountains. During the summer months, daytime temperatures can often exceed [tpl]convert|100|°F|°C[/tpl] at elevations below [tpl]convert|5000|ft|m[/tpl], the average high temperature in July ranges from [tpl]convert|97|°F|°C[/tpl] at the lower elevations to the upper 70s (°F, up to 26 °C) at the higher elevations. Many cities in New Mexico can have temperature lows in the teens. The highest temperature recorded in New Mexico was [tpl]convert|122|°F|°C[/tpl] at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Loving on June 27, 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|-50|°F|°C[/tpl] at Gavilan on February 1, 1951.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?forwhat=st&elem=ALL&state=NM |title=All-Time Climate Extremes for NM |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |publisher=National Climatic Data Center [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Flora and fauna===

New Mexico contains extensive habitat for many plants and animals, especially in desert areas and pinon-juniper woodlands. Creosote bush, mesquite, cacti, yucca, and desert grasses, including black grama, purple three-awn, tobosa, and burrograss, cover the broad, semiarid plains that cover the southern portion of the state. The northern portion of the state is home to many tree species such as ponderosa pine, aspen, cottonwood, spruce, fir, and Russian olive, which is an invasive species. Native birds include the greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus)[tpl]cite book|first=Florence|last=Merriam Bailey|year=1928|title=Birds of New Mexico|publisher=The University of Michigan[/tpl] and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).[tpl]cite web | first=C.

==History==

The first known inhabitants of New Mexico were members of the Clovis culture of Paleo-Indians.[tpl]Rp|19[/tpl]
Later inhabitants include American Indians of the Mogollon and Ancestral Pueblo peoples cultures.[tpl]Rp|52[/tpl]
By the time of European contact in the 16th century, the region was settled by the villages of the Pueblo peoples and groups of Navajo, Apache and Ute.[tpl]Rp|6,48[/tpl]
Francisco Vásquez de Coronado assembled an enormous expedition at Compostela in 1540–1542 to explore and find the mystical Seven Golden Cities of Cibola as described by Fray Marcos de Niza.[tpl]Rp|19–24[/tpl] The name Nuevo México was first used by a seeker of gold mines named Francisco de Ibarra who explored far to the north of Mexico in 1563 and reported his findings as being in "a New Mexico".[tpl]cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R.

After the death of the Pueblo leader Popé, Diego de Vargas restored the area to Spanish rule.[tpl]Rp|68–75[/tpl] While developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded Albuquerque in 1706 from existing surrounding communities,[tpl]Rp|84[/tpl] naming it for the viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque.
As a part of New Spain, the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to independent Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence.[tpl]Rp|109[/tpl] The Republic of Texas claimed the portion east of the Rio Grande when it seceded from Mexico in 1836, when it incorrectly assumed the older Hispanic settlements of the upper Rio Grande were the same as the newly established Mexican settlements of Texas. Texas' only attempt to establish a presence or control in the claimed territory was the failed Texas Santa Fe Expedition, when their entire army was captured and jailed by Hispanic New Mexico militia.
The extreme northeastern part of New Mexico was owned by France, and sold to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.[tpl]cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/maps/lapurchase/essay1e_lg.html |title=Boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase as Recognized Today |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |date=December 2001 |work=Louisiana: European Explorations and the Louisiana Purchase |publisher=Library of Congress [/tpl] By 1800 the Spanish population had reached 25,000, but Apache and Comanche raids on Hispanic settlers were common until well into the period of U.S. occupation.New Mexico (state).

Following the Mexican-American War, from 1846–1848 and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, Mexico ceded its mostly unsettled northern holdings, today known as the American Southwest and California, to the United States of America.[tpl]Rp|132[/tpl] In the Compromise of 1850 Texas ceded its claims to the area lying east of the Rio Grande in exchange for ten million dollars[tpl]Rp|135[/tpl] and the US government established the New Mexico Territory on September 9, 1850, including most of the present-day states of Arizona and New Mexico, and part of Colorado. The United States acquired the southwestern boot heel of the state and southern Arizona below the Gila river in the mostly desert Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which was related to the construction by the US of a transcontinental railroad.[tpl]Rp|136[/tpl]
The compromise of 1850 created the current boundary between New Mexico and Texas. It is also considered during this time a surveyor's error awarded the Permian Basin to the State of Texas, which included the city of El Paso. Claims to the Permian were initially dropped by New Mexico in a bid to gain statehood in 1911.
New Mexico played a role in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Both Confederate and Union governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over New Mexico Territory. In 1861 the Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own Arizona Territory and waged the ambitious New Mexico Campaign in an attempt to control the American Southwest and open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the Battle of Glorieta Pass in 1862. However, the Confederate territorial government continued to operate out of Texas, and Confederate troops marched under the Arizona flag until the end of the war. Additionally, over 8,000 troops from New Mexico Territory served the Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civilwardata.com/dbstatus.html |title=American Civil War Research Database statistics |publisher=Civilwardata.com |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2012[/tpl]

===Race and ancestry===

New Mexico, along with Hawaii, California and Texas, is ethnically a minority-majority state, that is, a state where non-Hispanic whites represent less than half of the population.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the racial composition of the population in 2012 was:
Ethnically, 47.0% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race).

===Oil and gas production===

New Mexico is the third leading crude oil and natural gas producer in the United States. The Permian Basin (part of the Mid-Continent Oil Field) and San Juan Basin lie partly in New Mexico. In 2006 New Mexico accounted for 3.4% of the crude oil, 8.5% of the dry natural gas, and 10.2% of the natural gas liquids produced in the United States.
In 2000 the value of oil and gas produced was $8.2 billion.

===Federal government===

Federal government spending is a major driver of the New Mexico economy. In 2005 the federal government spent $2.03 on New Mexico for every dollar of tax revenue collected from the state. This rate of return is higher than any other state in the Union.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/266.html |title=Federal Spending Received Per Dollar of Taxes Paid by State, 2005 |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |publisher=Tax Foundation |date=October 9, 2007 [/tpl]
Many of the federal jobs relate to the military; the state hosts three air force bases (Kirtland Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, and Cannon Air Force Base); a testing range (White Sands Missile Range); and an army proving ground and maneuver range (Fort Bliss – McGregor Range). A May 2005 estimate by New Mexico State University is that 11.65% of the state's total employment arises directly or indirectly from military spending.
Other federal installations include the technology labs of Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.

===Economic incentives===

New Mexico provides a number of economic incentives to businesses operating in the state, including various types of tax credits and tax exemptions. Most of the incentives are based on job creation.
New Mexico law allows governments to provide land, buildings, and infrastructure to businesses to promote job creation. Several municipalities have imposed an Economic Development Gross Receipts Tax (a form of Municipal Infrastructure GRT) that is used to pay for these infrastructure improvements and for marketing their areas.
The state provides financial incentives for film production.[tpl]cite web | date = March 4, 2002 | title = Governor Signs Film Production Tax Incentives | publisher=New Mexico Economic Development Department | url = http://www.nmpartnership.com/press-releases/article.php?id=1022&title=Governor+Signs+Film+Production+Tax+Incentives | accessdate =September 12, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061114192754/http://www.nmpartnership.com/press-releases/article.php?id=1022&title=Governor+Signs+Film+Production+Tax+Incentives |archivedate = November 14, 2006[/tpl][ref]

===State taxes===

Since 2008, personal income tax rates for New Mexico have ranged from 1.7% to 4.9%, within four income brackets.[ref]

New Mexico imposes a Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on many transactions, which may even include some governmental receipts. This resembles a sales tax but, unlike the sales taxes in many states, it applies to services as well as tangible goods. Normally, the provider or seller passes the tax on to the purchaser, however legal incidence and burden apply to the business, as an excise tax. GRT is imposed by the state and there may an additional locality component to produce a total tax rate.[ref]

Property tax is imposed on real property by the state, by counties, and by school districts. In general, personal-use personal property is not subject to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is 1/3 of the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 mills is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property and 29.80 for non-residential property. Assessed values of residences cannot be increased by more than 3% per year unless the residence is remodeled or sold. Property tax deductions are available for military veterans and heads of household.[ref]

==Transportation==

New Mexico has long been an important corridor for trade and migration. The builders of the ruins at Chaco Canyon also created a radiating network of roads from the mysterious settlement.Chaco Canyon[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] Chaco Canyon's trade function shifted to Casas Grandes in the present-day Mexican state of Chihuahua, however, north-south trade continued. The pre-Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the Rio Grande. Present-day New Mexico's pre-Columbian trade is especially remarkable for being undertaken on foot. The north-south trade route later became a path for colonists with horses arriving from New Spain as well as trade and communication. The route was called El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/story2.php?catid=727|title=Indigenous trade|last=Suina|first=Kim|work=Digital History Project—Book of Migrations|publisher=New Mexico Office of the State Historian|accessdate=March 31, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails but brought on a population boom. Early transcontinental auto trails later crossed the state bringing more migrants. Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's Interstate Highways approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.

===Road===

New Mexico has had a problem with drunk driving, but that has lessened. According to the Los Angeles Times, for years the state had the highest alcohol-related crash rates in the U.S., but ranked 25th in alcohol-related fatal crash rates, [tpl]as of|lc=y|2009|07[/tpl].Los Angeles Times, New Mexico turns a corner on drunk driving, July 7, 2009, by Kate Linthicum, http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/07/nation/na-new-mexico-dwi7
The automobile changed the character of New Mexico, marking the start of large scale immigration to the state from elsewhere in the United States. Settlers moving West during the Great Depression and post-World War II American culture immortalized the National Old Trails Highway, later U.S. Route 66. Today, the automobile is heavily relied upon in New Mexico for transportation.

===Urban mass transit===

The New Mexico Rail Runner Express is a commuter rail system serving the metropolitan area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It began operation on July 14, 2006. The system runs from Belen to downtown Santa Fe. Larger cities in New Mexico typically have some form of public transportation by road; ABQ RIDE is the largest such system in the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/transit/index.html|title=ABQ RIDE – City of Albuquerque|publisher=City of Albuquerque|accessdate=April 12, 2010[/tpl]

There were 2,354 route miles of railroads in the year 2000, this number increased with the opening of the Rail Runner's extension to Santa Fe.U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics,Table 1-9: Freight Railroads in New Mexico and the United States: 2000 http://www.bts.gov/publications/state_transportation_statistics/new_mexico/html/table_01_09.html In addition to local railroads and other tourist lines, the state jointly owns and operates a heritage narrow-gauge steam railroad, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway, with the state of Colorado.

Passenger train service once connected nine of New Mexico's present ten most populous cities (the exception is Rio Rancho), while today passenger train service connects two: Albuquerque and Santa Fe. With the decline of most intercity rail service in the United States in the late 1960s, New Mexico was left with minimal services. No less than six daily long-distance roundtrip trains supplemented by many branch line and local trains served New Mexico in the early 1960s. Declines in passenger revenue, but not necessarily ridership, prompted many railroads to turn over their passenger services in truncated form to Amtrak, a state owned enterprise. Amtrak, also known as the National Passenger Railroad Corporation, began operating the two extant long-distance routes in May 1971. Resurrection of passenger rail service from Denver to El Paso, a route once plied in part by the ATSF's El Pasoan[tpl]Rp|37[/tpl], has been proposed over the years. As early as the 1980s former Governor Toney Anaya proposed building a high-speed rail line connecting the two cities with New Mexico's major cities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.observer-online.com/articles/2008/12/21/news/doc494d4df4b3d01455138411.txt|title=Media and politicians enjoy inaugural ride, public opening met with delays|last=Herron|first=Gary|date=December 22, 2008|work=The Observer |location=UK|accessdate=February 2, 2009[/tpl] Front Range Commuter Rail is a project to connect Wyoming and New Mexico with high-speed rail.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2005/05/16/story2.html | first=Cathy | last=Proctor | title=Idea floated for Front Range rail line | date=May 15, 2005[/tpl]

==Government and politics==

===Government===

The governmental structure of New Mexico is established by the Constitution of New Mexico. The executive is composed of the Governor, several other statewide elected officials including the Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Auditor, State Treasurer, and Commissioner of Public Lands, as well as the Governor's cabinet. The New Mexico Legislature consists of the House of Representatives and Senate. The judiciary is composed of the New Mexico Supreme Court and lower courts. There is also local government, consisting of counties, municipalities and special districts.

===Politics===

Current Governor Susana Martinez and Lieutenant Governor John Sanchez, both Republicans, were elected in 2010. Their terms expire in January 2015. Governors serve a term of four years and may seek re-election for one additional term (limit of two terms). Other constitutional officers, all of whose terms also expire in January 2015, include Secretary of State Dianna Duran,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.nm.us |title=NM Secretary of State's Office official web site |publisher=Sos.state.nm.us |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] Attorney General Gary King,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ago.state.nm.us |title=NM Attorney General's Office official web site |publisher=Ago.state.nm.us |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] State Auditor Hector Balderas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saonm.org |title=NM State Auditor's Office official web site |publisher=Saonm.org |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] State Land Commissioner Ray Powell,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nmstatelands.org |title=NM State Lands official web site |publisher=Nmstatelands.org |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] and State Treasurer James B. Lewis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stonm.org |title=NM State Treasurer's Office official web site |publisher=Stonm.org |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] King, Balderas, Lewis, and Powell are Democrats. Duran is a Republican.
Currently, both houses of the New Mexico State Legislature have Democratic majorities (27 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the Senate. 36 Democrats, 33 Republicans, and 1 independent caucusing with Democrats in the House of Representatives).
New Mexico's members of the United States Senate are Democrats Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall. Democrats Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Ben R. Luján represent the first and third congressional districts, respectively, and Republican Steve Pearce represents the second congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. See New Mexico congressional map.
New Mexico is considered a swing state, whose population has favored both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in the past. The current governor is Susana Martinez (R), who succeeded Bill Richardson (D) on January 1, 2011 after he served two terms as governor from 2003 to 2011. Prior to Richardson, Gary Johnson served as governor from 1995 to 2003. Johnson served as a Republican, but in 2012 he ran for President from the Libertarian Party. Governors in New Mexico are limited to two terms. In previous presidential elections, Al Gore carried the state (by 366 votes) in 2000; George W. Bush won New Mexico's five electoral votes in 2004, and the state's electoral votes were won by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Since achieving statehood in 1912, New Mexico has been carried by the victor in every presidential election except 1976 and 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.270towin.com/states/new+mexico |title=New Mexico Presidential Election Voting History |publisher=270towin.com |accessdate=2014-04-21[/tpl]
Democratic strongholds in the state include the Santa Fe Area, various areas of the Albuquerque Metro Area (such as the southeast and central areas, including the affluent Nob Hill neighborhood and the vicinity of the University of New Mexico), Northern and West Central New Mexico, and most of the Native American reservations, particularly the Navajo Nation. Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the Farmington area, Rio Rancho, and Albuquerque's Northeast Heights and the newly developed areas in the Northwest mesa. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have historically favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels.
On major political issues, New Mexico abolished its death penalty statute, though not retroactively, effective July 1, 2009. This means individuals currently on New Mexico's Death Row can still be executed, and those convicted of capital crimes prior to July 1, 2009 may still be sentenced to capital punishment under the pre-existing death penalty statute. On March 18, 2009, then Governor Bill Richardson signed the law abolishing the death penalty (although the repeal is not retroactive to capital crimes committed before it took effect) in New Mexico following the assembly and senate vote the week before, thus becoming the 15th U.S. state to abolish the penalty.Le Nouveau-Mexique abolit la peine de mort archive in Le Monde of March 19, 2009
On gun control, New Mexico arguably has some of the least restrictive firearms laws in the country.  State law pre-empts all local gun control ordinances. Unlike states with strong gun control laws, a New Mexico resident may purchase any firearm deemed legal under federal law. There are no waiting periods under state law for picking up a firearm after it has been purchased, and there are no restrictions on magazine capacity. Additionally, New Mexico allows open carry of a loaded firearm without a permit, and is "shall-issue" for concealed carry permits.
Prior to December 2013, New Mexico law did not explicitly allow nor prohibit same-sex marriage.  Policy concerning the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level; that is, some county clerks issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while others did not.  In December 2013, the New Mexico Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage at the statewide level.

==Education==

==Culture==

With a Native American population of 134,000 in 1990, New Mexico still ranks as an important center of Native American culture. Both the Navajo and Apache share Athabaskan origin. The Apache and some Ute live on federal reservations within the state. With 16 million acres (6,500,000 ha), mostly in neighboring Arizona, the reservation of the Navajo Nation ranks as the largest in the United States. The prehistorically agricultural Pueblo Indians live in pueblos scattered throughout the state.
Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin; many are descendants of colonial settlers. They settled in the northern portion of the state. Most of the Mexican immigrants reside in the southern part of the state. Also 10-15% of the population, mainly in the north, may contain Hispanic Jewish ancestry.
There are many New Mexicans who also speak a unique dialect of Spanish. New Mexican Spanish has vocabulary often unknown to other Spanish speakers. Because of the historical isolation of New Mexico from other speakers of the Spanish language, the local dialect preserves some late medieval Castilian vocabulary considered archaic elsewhere, adopts numerous Native American words for local features, and contains much Anglicized vocabulary for American concepts and modern inventions.
Albuquerque has the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the National Hispanic Cultural Center, and the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, as well as hosts the famed annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta every fall.

===Art and literature===

The earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose stunning black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced prior to the year 1130.
