Minogue received much criticism during series 6 of The X Factor. Controversy began after the first live show on 10 October, after Minogue commented on press reports stating that Danyl Johnson was bisexual. After his performance of "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", in which he had changed the gender of the person being addressed in the song from male to female, Minogue remarked to Johnson on air that he didn't need to change the gender if the press was to be believed. Minogue's remarks sparked an online backlash.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unrealityshout.com/blogs/dannii-minogue-outing-danyl-johnson-gay |title=Dannii Minogue outing Danyl Johnson as gay |publisher=Unreality Shout |accessdate=11 October 2009[/tpl] Minogue's comments received some media coverage[tpl]cite news|first=Lizzie |last=Smith |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1219517/X-Factor-Cheryl-Coles-fury-Simon-Cowells-stripper-insult--Dannii-Minogues-bisexual-jibe-nearly-costs-job.html |title=X Factor: Cheryl Cole's fury at Simon Cowell's stripper insult... while Dannii Minogue's bisexual jibe nearly costs her job |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2009[/tpl] resulting in Minogue releasing a statement on the issue:
 
 "I want to clear up exactly what happened on last night's X Factor show and post my sincere apologies to anyone who took offence. I made a comment about Danyl changing the lyrics of his song. It was meant to be a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song. An openly bisexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'. Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show. I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention. I spoke to Danyl straight after the show last night and he wasn't offended or upset by my comments, and knew exactly what I was saying."[tpl]cite web|url=http://danniiminogueofficial.blogspot.com/2009/10/official-statement-dannii-minogue-danyl_11.html |title=OFFICIAL STATEMENT: Dannii Minogue & Danyl Johnson  |publisher=Danniiminogueofficial.blogspot.com |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2009[/tpl]

===Media portrayal and other activities===

Throughout her career, Minogue has often been compared with her more successful sister, Kylie. Referring to the comparison, Minogue said: "It is hard to be compared all the time to Kylie. On the other hand, however, people will always try to compare you to somebody. Look at Britney and Christina."Timmermans, Arjan "Interview with Dannii Minogue". ArjanWrites.com. 17 December 2003. Retrieved 5 April 2007. In an interview with Elle in April 2009, Kylie criticised X Factor judge Louis Walsh for his jibes at her sister: "I'm so proud of my sister and it annoys the hell out of me when comparisons between us are made. In England you lot don't know where she came from. She was on TV every week from 7-years-old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes – one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true." She also denied rumours that she did not get on with Cheryl Cole or former judge Sharon Osbourne as "so cheap".
