In 1627 Barbary Pirates from the Republic of Salé occupied Lundy for five years. The North African invaders, under the command of Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon, flew an Ottoman flag over the island. Some captured Europeans were held on Lundy before being sent to Algiers as slaves.http://www.amazon.co.uk/White-Gold-Forgotten-Africas-European/dp/0340895098 | WWhite Gold: The Forgotten Story of North Africa's One Million European Slaves" by Giles Milton[tpl]Cite news| title=Pirates who got away with it | work=Study of sails on pirate ships | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article1449736.ece | accessdate=25 November 2007 | location=London | date=28 February 2007 | first=Simon | last=de Bruxelles[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| title=Piracy: the complete history | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&pg=PA91 | accessdate=15 April 2011 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | isbn=978-1-84603-240-0 | last=Konstam |first=Angus | year=2008 |page=91[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| title=Europe: A History | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&pg=PA561 | accessdate=25 November 2007 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-820171-7 | last=Davies |first=Norman | year=1996 |page=561[/tpl] From 1628 to 1634 the island was plagued by pirate ships of French, Basque, English, and Spanish origin.

===Civil war===

In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, rebuilding Marisco Castle and garrisoning the island at his own expense. He was a friend of Francis Bacon, a strong supporter of the Royalist cause and an expert on mining and coining. It was the last Royalist territory held between the first and second civil wars. After receiving permission from Charles I, Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes, representing General Fairfax.[tpl]Cite book|last=Boundy  |first=Wyndham Sydney |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bushell and Harman of Lundy |year=1961 |publisher=Gazette Printing Service |location=Bideford |isbn= [/tpl] In 1656, the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/localstudies/110578/1.html |title=Lundy Community Page |accessdate=6 September 2007 |work=Devon County Libraries [/tpl]

===18th and 19th centuries===

The late 18th and early 19th centuries were years of lawlessness on Lundy, particularly during the ownership of Thomas Benson, a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom he was supposed to be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, Lord Gower, at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lerwill-life.org.uk/history/lundy.htm |title=Lundy, the Mariscos and Benson. |accessdate=6 September 2007 [/tpl]
Sir Aubrey Vere Hunt of Curraghchase purchased the island from John Cleveland in 1802 for £5,270. Sir Vere Hunt planted in the island a small, self-contained Irish colony with its
own constitution and divorce laws, coinage and stamps. He failed in his attempt to sell the Island to the British Government as a base for troops, and his son Sir Aubrey Thomas de Vere also had great difficulty in securing any profit from the property. The tenants came from Sir Vere Hunt's Irish estate and they experienced agricultural difficulties while on the island. This led Sir Vere Hunt to seek someone who would take the island off his hands. In the 1820s John Benison agreed to purchase the Island for £4,500 but then refused to complete sale as he felt that Aubrey could not make out a good title in respect of the sale terms, namely that the Island was free from tithes and taxes.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/Tools/Search/?cx=011573740689929430170%3Abzoybyvdyy0&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8&q=de+vere&sa=Go&siteurl=www.limerick.ie%252FCollectionLists%252FCollectionListsinPDF%252F|title= Limerick City Archives, P22, De Vere Papers|accessdate=25 June 2010[/tpl]
William Hudson Heaven purchased Lundy in 1834, as a summer retreat and for the shooting, at a cost of 9,400 guineas (£9,870). He claimed it to be a "free island", and successfully resisted the jurisdiction of the mainland magistrates. Lundy was in consequence sometimes referred to as "the kingdom of Heaven". It belongs in fact to the county of Devon, and has always been part of the hundred of Braunton. Many of the buildings on the island today, including Saint Helena's Church, designed by the architect John Norton, and Millcombe House (originally known simply as The Villa), date from the Heaven period. The Georgian-style Villa was built in 1836.[tpl]Cite web| title=Millcombe House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91982 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl]  However, the expense of building the road from the beach (no financial assistance being provided by Trinity House, despite their regular use of the road following the construction of the lighthouses), the Villa and the general cost of running the island had a ruinous effect on the family's finances, which had been damaged by reduced profits from their sugar plantations in Jamaica.
In 1957 a message in a bottle from one of the seamen of the HMS Caledonia was washed ashore between Babbacombe and Peppercombe in Devon. The letter, dated 15 August 1843 read: "Dear Brother, Please e God i be with y against Michaelmas. Prepare y search Lundy for y Jenny ivories. Adiue William, Odessa". The bottle and letter are on display at the Portledge Hotel at Fairy Cross, in Devon, England. The Jenny was a three-masted schooner reputed to be carrying ivory and gold dust that was wrecked on Lundy (at a place thereafter called Jenny's Cove) on 20 February 1797. The ivory was apparently recovered some years later but the leather bags supposed to contain gold dust were never found.Page, John Lloyd Warden, The coasts of Devon and Lundy Island: their towns, villages, scenery, antiquities and legends.

===20th and 21st centuries===

William Heaven was succeeded by his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's ambition of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building.[tpl]Cite web| title=Church of St Helena | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91976 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] He is said to have been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Hudson Heaven died in 1916, and was succeeded by his nephew, Walter Charles Hudson Heaven.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/Flags/gb-en-lu.html |title=Lundy Island |accessdate=6 September 2007 |work=Flags of the World |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050124161206/http://www.fotw.net/Flags/gb-en-lu.html |archivedate = 24 January 2005[/tpl]  With the outbreak of World War I, matters deteriorated seriously, and in 1918 the family sold Lundy to Augustus Langham Christie. In 1924, the Christie family sold the island along with the mail contract and the MV Lerina to Martin Coles Harman, who proclaimed himself a king. Harman issued two coins of Half Puffin and One Puffin denominations in 1929, nominally equivalent to the British halfpenny and penny, resulting in his prosecution under the United Kingdom's Coinage Act of 1870. The House of Lords found him guilty in 1931, and he was fined £5 with fifteen guineas expenses. The coins were withdrawn and became collectors' items. In 1965 a "fantasy" restrike four-coin set, a few in gold, was issued to commemorate 40 years since Harman purchased the island.[tpl]Cite book|last=Bruce |first=Colin R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Unusual World Coins. 2nd. Edition |year=1988 |publisher=KP Books |location= |isbn=0-87341-116-1 [/tpl] Harman's son, John Pennington Harman was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in Kohima, India in 1944. There is a memorial to him at the VC Quarry on Lundy. Martin Coles Harman died in 1954.
Residents did not pay taxes to the United Kingdom and had to pass through customs when they travelled to and from Lundy Island. Although the island was ruled as a virtual fiefdom, its owner never claimed to be independent of the United Kingdom, in contrast to later territorial "micronations". 
Following the death of Harman's son Albion in 1968,"Island owner dies after air lift" (source unknown). 24 June 1968 Lundy was put up for sale in 1969. Jack Hayward, a British millionaire, purchased the island for £150,000 and gave it to the National Trust, who leased it to the Landmark Trust. The Landmark Trust has managed the island since then, deriving its income from arranging day trips, letting out holiday cottages and from donations.
The island is visited by over 20,000 day-trippers a year, but during September 2007 had to be closed for several weeks owing to an outbreak of Norovirus.[tpl]Cite news|first=Simon |last=de Bruxelles |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Island closes down after stomach bug |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2500379.ece |work=Times Online |publisher= |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2007 | location=London[/tpl]

====Wreck of Battleship Montagu====

A naval footnote in the history of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00 a.m. on 30 May 1906.[tpl]Cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

thumb|right|HMS Montagu during the failed salvage attempts of the summer of 1906Strenuous efforts by the Royal Navy to salvage the badly damaged battleship during the summer of 1906 failed, and in 1907 it was decided to give up and sell her for scrap. Montagu was scrapped at the scene over the next fifteen years. Diving clubs still visit the site, where armour plate and live 12-inch (305-millimetre) shells remain on the seabed.

====Remains of a German Heinkel 111H bomber====

During World War II two German Heinkel He 111 bombers crash landed on the island in 1941. The first was on 3 March, when all the crew survived and were taken prisoner. The second was on 1 April when the pilot was killed and the other crew members were taken prisoner.[tpl]cite book|last=Gade|first=Mary | coauthors= Harman, Michael|title=Lundy's War|year=1995|publisher=Mary Gade|location=Appledore|isbn=978-0-9525602-0-3[/tpl]  The plane had bombed a British ship and one engine was damaged by anti aircraft fire, forcing it to crash land. A few remains can be found on the crash site. Reportedly to avoid reprisals the crew concocted a story that they were on a reconnaissance mission.[tpl]Cite web|title=Heinkel He-111 3911 - Lundy|url=http://members.multimania.co.uk/daveswrecks/photoalbum16.html|publisher=AIRCRAFT WRECKS in the UK & Ireland|accessdate=3 September 2010[/tpl]

==Geography==

The island of Lundy is [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] long from north to south by about [tpl]convert|0.75|mi|km|1[/tpl] wide, with an area of [tpl]convert|1099|acre|ha|abbr=off[/tpl]. The highest point on Lundy is at [tpl]convert|142|m|ft[/tpl]. A few metres off the northeastern coast is Seal's Rock which is so called after the seals which rest on and inhabit the islet."LUNDY ISLAND" in A Handbook for Travellers in Devonshire (9th ed.), London, J. Murray, (1879).Dive Sites around Lundy at www.lundy.org.uk It is less than [tpl]convert|50|m|yards[/tpl] wide. Near the jetty is a small pocket beach.

===Geology===

The island is primarily composed of granite of 50±3 to 54±2 million years[tpl]cite book|title=British Regional Geology, South-West England|year=1975|publisher=British Geological Survey|edition=4th|author= E. A. Edmonds, M. C. McKeown & M.

This was given the name Lundyite in 1914, although the term – never precisely defined – has since fallen into disuse.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Hall |first=T. C.

===Climate===

Lundy Island lies on the borderline where the North Atlantic Ocean and the Bristol Channel meet, so it has quite a mild climate. Lundy has cool, wet winters and mild, wet summers. It is often windy on the coast.

==Ecology==

===Flora===

There is one endemic plant species, the Lundy Cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species of primitive brassica.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lundy.org.uk/inf/cabbage.html |title=What is a Lundy Cabbage and why is it important? |accessdate=5 September 2007 |work=Lundy.org [/tpl]
By the 1980s the eastern side of the island had become overgrown by rhododendrons (Rhododendron ponticum) which had spread from a few specimens planted in the garden of Millcombe House in Victorian times, but eradication of this non-native plant has been undertaken by volunteers over the past fifteen years in an operation known on the island as "rhody-bashing". The vegetation on the plateau is mainly dry heath, with an area of waved Calluna heath towards the northern end of the island, which is also rich in lichens, such as Teloschistes flavicans and several species of Cladonia and Parmelia. Other areas are either a dry heath/acidic grassland mosaic, characterised by heaths and Western Gorse (Ulex gallii), or semi-improved acidic grassland in which Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus) is abundant. Tussocky (Thrift) (Holcus/Armeria) communities occur mainly on the western side, and some patches of Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) on the eastern side.

===Fauna===

Until 2006 the Lundy Cabbage was thought to support two endemic species of beetle. The beetles are now known not to be unique to Lundy, but an endemic weevil, the Lundy cabbage flea beetle, (Psylliodes luridipennis) has been discovered. The island is also home to the purseweb spider (Atypus affinis), the only British member of the bird-eating spider family.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/virtualtours/Lundy/Lundy_wildlife.htm |title=Lundy island, virtual tour — wildlife |accessdate=5 September 2007 |work=Natural England [/tpl]

====Birds====

The number of puffins (Fratercula arctica), which may have given the island its name, declined in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the 2005 breeding population estimated to be only two or three pairs, as a consequence of depredations by brown and black rats (Rattus rattus) (which have now been eliminated) and possibly also as a result of commercial fishing for sand eels, the puffins' principal prey. Since 2005, the breeding numbers have been slowly increasing. Adults were seen taking fish into four burrows in 2007,Saunders, Nicola (2007 in press): Lundy Warden's Report for 2007 Annual Report of the Lundy Field Society 58 and six burrows in 2008.Saunders, Nicola (personal communication)
As an isolated island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life and is a popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do Razorbill (Alca torda), Guillemot (Uria aalge), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus), Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Meadow Pipit (Anthus pratensis), Common Blackbird (Turdus merula), Robin (Erithacus rubecula) and Linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Raven (Corvus corax).
Lundy has attracted many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species.Davis, Tim & Tim Jones (2007), The Birds of Lundy ISBN 0-9540088-7-1 This has included the following species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient Murrelet, Eastern Phoebe and Eastern Towhee. Records of Bimaculated Lark, American Robin and Common Yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American Robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's Warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an Eastern Bonelli's Warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a Black-faced Bunting in 2001 Britain's third.
Other British Birds rarities that have been sighted (single records unless otherwise indicated) are: Little Bittern, Glossy Ibis, Gyrfalcon (3 records), Little and Baillon's crakes, Collared Pratincole, Semipalmated (5 records), Least (2 records), White-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's Phalarope, Laughing Gull, Bridled Tern, Pallas's Sandgrouse, Great Spotted, Black-billed and Yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European Roller, Olive-backed Pipit, Citrine Wagtail, Alpine Accentor, Thrush Nightingale, Red-flanked Bluetail, Black-eared (2 records) and Desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and Grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and Western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and Lesser Grey shrikes, Red-eyed Vireo (7 records), Two-barred Crossbill, Yellow-rumped and Blackpoll warblers, Yellow-breasted (2 records) and Black-headed (3 records) buntings, Rose-breasted Grosbeak (2 records), Bobolink and Baltimore Oriole (2 records).

====Mammals====

Lundy is home to an unusual range of mammals, almost all introduced, including a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy Pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides were the only two places in the UK where the Black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hows.org.uk/inter/birds/exotics/gbm.htm|title=British Isles Exotic and Introduced Mammals | publisher=World of European Exotic and Introduced Species|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by Brown Rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/272.shtml | title=Black rat, ship rat, roof rat, house rat | publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/00Ref/MiscellaneousContents/B341DMacdonald_BritishMammals/4_rodentia.htm#Blackrat | title=Black Rat | publisher=Twycross Zoo|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] It has since been eradicated on the island, in order to protect the nesting seabirds.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.brc.ac.uk/gbnn_admin/index.php?q=node/67 | title=Rattus rattus | publisher=Biological Records Centre | accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] Other species which have made the island their home include the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika Deer (Cervus nippon), Pygmy Shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay Sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Hopewell |first=L |authorlink= |coauthors=R.

====Marine habitat====

In 1971 a proposal was made by the Lundy Field Society to establish a marine reserve. Provision for the establishment of statutory Marine Nature Reserves was included in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and on 21 November 1986 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the designation of a statutory reserve at Lundy.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lundy.org.uk/inf/zone.html |title=Lundy Island Marine Nature Reserve |accessdate=5 September 2007 |work=Lundy.org [/tpl]

==Transport==

===To the island===

There are two ways to get to Lundy, depending on the time of year. In the summer months (April to October) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust's own vessel, MS Oldenburg, which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe. Sailings are usually three days a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August. The voyage takes on average two hours, depending on ports, tides and weather. The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen, Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://captainsvoyage.7.forumer.com/a/ms-oldenburg_post2232.html|title=MS Oldenburg at captainsvoyage|accessdate=8 June 2009[/tpl]
In the winter months (November to March), the Oldenburg is out of service, and the island is served by a scheduled helicopter service from Hartland Point. The helicopter operates on Mondays and Fridays, with flights between 12 noon and 2 pm. The heliport is a field at the top of Hartland Point, not far from the Beacon.
A grass runway of [tpl]convert|400|by|28|m|ft|0[/tpl] is available, allowing access to small STOL aircraft skilfully piloted.UK VFR flight guide, 2003 edition, ISBN 1-874783-62-4
Properly equipped and experienced canoeists can kayak to the island from Hartland Point or Lee Bay. This takes 4 to 6 hours depending on wind and tides.
Entrance to Lundy is free for anyone arriving by scheduled transport. Visitors arriving by non-scheduled transport are charged a small entrance fee, currently (June 2013) £5.00, with an additional charge payable by those using light aircraft. Anyone arriving on Lundy by non-scheduled transport is also subject to an additional fee for transporting luggage to the top of the island.

In 2007, Derek Green, Lundy's general manager, launched an appeal to raise £250,000 to save the mile-long Beach Road, which had been damaged by heavy rain and high seas. The road was built in the first half of the 19th century to provide people and goods with safe access to the top of the island, [tpl]convert|120|m|ft|0[/tpl] above the only jetty.[tpl]Cite news|first=Steven|last=Morris |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=£250,000 plea to save remote island's lifeline |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/05/3 |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=5 September 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2007 | location=London[/tpl] The fund-raising was completed on 10 March 2009.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/news/index.htm#Lundyappealcomplete|title=Lundy road appeal completed|publisher=The Landmark Trust|accessdate=17 March 2009[/tpl]

===Lighthouses===

Foundations for a lighthouse on Lundy were laid in 1787, but the first lighthouse (now known as the Old Light) was not built until Trinity House obtained a 999-year lease in 1819. The [tpl]convert|96|ft|m|0[/tpl] granite tower, on the summit of Chapel Hill, was designed by Daniel Asher Alexander, and built by Joseph Nelson at a cost of £36,000.[tpl]Cite web| title=Disused lighthouse and keeper's house. | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91983 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] Because the site is [tpl]convert|407|ft|m|0[/tpl] above sea level, the highest base for a lighthouse in Britain, the light was often obscured by fog. To counter this problem, the Fog Signal Battery[tpl]Cite web| title=Fog Signal Battery | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91987 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] was built about 1861.
The lighthouse had two lights; the lower a fixed white light and the upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes detectable. This may have contributed to the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12 year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Josephine de Beauharnais.[tpl]Cite web|title=The history of Devon's lighthouses|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2008/07/10/devon_lighthouses_feature.shtml|work=Local history|publisher=BBC Devon|accessdate=9 September 2010[/tpl]
Owing to the ongoing complaints about the difficulty of sighting the light in fog, the lighthouse was abandoned in 1897 when the North[tpl]Cite web| title=Lundy North Lighthouse incl Engine House and Accom block | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91978 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] and South[tpl]Cite web| title=Lundy South Lighthouse incl. Engine House and Accom block  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=91979 | accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] Lundy lighthouses were built.

The current North Lundy and South Lundy lighthouses were built in 1897 at the extremities of the island to replace the old lighthouse. Both lighthouses are painted white and are run and maintained by Trinity House.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/lundy.html|title=Lundy North & South Lighthouses|publisher=Trinity House|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
The North lighthouse is 17 metres tall, slightly taller than the south one, and has a focal plane of [tpl]convert|48|m|ft[/tpl]. It produces a quick white flash every 15 seconds, and was originally lit by a 75mm petroleum vapour burner. Oil was lifted up from a small quay using a sled and winch, and then transported using a small railway (again winch-powered). The remains of this can be still seen, but it was abandoned in 1971 and the lighthouse now uses a discharge bulb fed from the island's main supply. In 1985 the northern light was modernised; it was automated six years later and was converted to solar power.
The South lighthouse has a focal length of [tpl]convert|53|m|ft[/tpl] and a quick white flash every 5 seconds. It can be seen as a small white dot from Hartland Point, 11 miles to the south east. It was automated and converted to solar power in 1994.

==Electricity supply==

There is a small power station comprising three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply to most of the island buildings. Waste heat from the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe. (cf. cogeneration.) There are also plans to collect the waste heat from the engine exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Staying on the island==

Lundy has 23 holiday properties, sleeping between one and 14 people. These include a lighthouse, a castle and a Victorian mansion. Many of the buildings are constructed from the island's granite.
The island also has a campsite, at the south of the island in the field next to the shop. It has hot and cold running water, with showers and toilets, in an adjacent building.

==Administration==

The island is an unparished area of Torridge district of the English county of Devon.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/core_strategy_evidence_base-2.pdf|title=North Devon District Council & Torridge District Council Core Strategy DPDs: Evidence Base|work=Community Appraisals and Parish Plans in Torridge|publisher=North Devon Council|pages=15–16|accessdate=27 December 2009[/tpl] It belongs to the ward of Clovelly Bay.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/uksi_19992472_en.pdf |title=The District of Torridge (Electoral Changes) Order 1999 |accessdate=5 September 2007 |format=PDF |work=UK Statutory Instruments [/tpl] It is part of the constituency electing the Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon and the South West England constituency for the European Parliament.

===Stamps===

Owing to a decline in population and lack of interest in the mail contract, the GPO ended its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.stampingonlundy.co.uk/ |title=Lundy Island Postage Stamps |accessdate=28 September 2007 |format= |work=stampingonlundy.co.uk[/tpl] For the next two years Harman handled the mail to and from the island without charge. On 1 November 1929, he decided to offset the expense by issuing two postage stamps (1/2 puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue). One puffin is equivalent to one English penny. The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this day and they are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office, located in the Lundy shop at the south end of the island. One used to have to stick Lundy stamps on the back of the envelope; but Royal Mail now allows their use on the front of the envelope, but placed on the left side, with the right side reserved for the Royal Mail postage stamp or stamps. Lundy stamps are cancelled by a circular Lundy handstamp. The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the mainland for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world. A meter cancel is applied in Bideford. The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford. Lundy Island stamps (sometimes called Puffins) are a type of postage stamp known to philatelists as "local carriage labels" or "local stamps". Issues of increasing value were made over the years, including air mail, featuring a variety of people. Many are now highly sought-after by collectors.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.philatel2.com/jubilee/id312.htm |title=Lundy Island Cinderella |accessdate=28 September 2007 |work=King George V Silver Jubilee [/tpl] The market value of the early issues has risen substantially over the years. For the many thousands of annual visitors Lundy stamps have become part of the collection of the many British Local Posts collectors. The first catalogues of these stamps included Gerald Rosen's 1970 Catalogue of British Local Stamps. Later specialist catalogues include Stamps of Lundy Island by Stanley Newman, first published in 1984, Phillips Modern British Locals CD Catalogue, published since 2003, and Labbe's Specialized Guide to Lundy Island Stamps. There is a comprehensive collection of these stamps in the Chinchen Collection, donated by Barry Chinchen[ref]
, [tpl]BLCAT|X.512/621[/tpl][/ref] to the British Library Philatelic Collections in 1977 and now held by the British Library. This is also the home of the Landmark Trust Lundy Island Philatelic Archive which includes artwork, texts and essays as well as postmarking devices and issued stamps.Philatelic Research at the British Library by David Beech

==In Popular Culture==

Lundy island is prominently featured in John Bellair's juvenile gothic mystery, "The Secret of the Underground Room."  The plot highlights several geographical and historical points of interest, including the (De) Marisco family. The book was first published in 1990.http://www.bellairsia.com
