Edmund Gerald "Jerry" Brown, Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician who currently serves as the 39th Governor of California since 2011; he previously served as California's 34th Governor[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_5 |title=California Constitution, Article V, Section II |accessdate=2011-01-10[/tpl] from 1975 to 1983. Both before and after his original two terms as Governor, Brown served in numerous state, local, and party positions. He was a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees (1969–1971), Secretary of State of California (1971–1975), chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989–1991), Mayor of Oakland (1999–2007) and Attorney General of California (2007–2011).
Brown sought the Democratic nominations for President of the United States in 1976, 1980, and 1992, and was the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in California in 1982, but was unsuccessful in those attempts. He is the son of Pat Brown, the 32nd Governor of California. On October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in California history measured by cumulative service.
As a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms, Brown has been both the sixth-youngest California governor (and the youngest since the 1860s) and the oldest California governor in history.

==Early life, education, and career==

Brown was born in San Francisco, California, as the only son of four siblings born to Bernice Layne Brown, and District Attorney of San Francisco and later Governor of California, Edmund Gerald "Pat" Brown, Sr.[tpl]cite book |title = California after Arnold | last=Cummings, Reddy| first=Stephen, Patrick| publisher = Algora Publishing |date = September 14, 2009| page = 179| isbn=978-0-87586-739-7 [/tpl] His father was of half Irish and half German descent.[tpl]harvnb|Rarick|2006|pp=8, 30[/tpl] He was a member of the California Cadet Corps at St. Ignatius High School, where he graduated in 1955.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
In 1955, Brown entered Santa Clara University for a year, and left to attend Sacred Heart Novitiate, a Jesuit seminary, intent on becoming a Catholic priest. Brown left the seminary after three years,http://gov.ca.gov/m_about.php enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley in 1960, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1961. Brown went on to Yale Law School and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1964. After law school, Brown worked as a law clerk for California Supreme Court Justice Mathew Tobriner.
Returning to California, Brown took the state bar exam and passed on his second attempt.[tpl]cite news |title=A High Bar for Lawyers |first=Maura |last=Dolan |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=3 |date=February 21, 2006 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/21/local/me-bar21 |accessdate=March 11, 2010[/tpl] Brown then settled in Los Angeles and joined the law firm of Tuttle & Taylor. In 1969, Brown ran for the newly created Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees, which oversaw community colleges in the city, and placed first in a field of 124.

==Secretary of State (1971–1975)==

In 1970, Brown was elected California Secretary of State. Brown argued before the California Supreme Court and won cases against Standard Oil of California, International Telephone and Telegraph, Gulf Oil, and Mobil for election law violations. In addition, he forced legislators to comply with campaign disclosure laws. While holding this office, he discovered the use of falsely notarized documents to earn a tax deduction by then-President Richard Nixon. Brown also drafted and helped to pass the California Political Reform Act of 1974, Proposition 9, passed by 70% of California's voters in June, 1974. Among other provisions, it established the California Fair Political Practices Commission.

==Governor of California (1975–1983)==

===First term===

In 1974, Brown ran in a highly contested Democratic primary for Governor of California against Speaker of the California Assembly Bob Moretti, San Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto, Representative Jerome R. Waldie, and others. Brown won the primary with the name recognition of his father, Pat Brown, whom many people admired for his progressive administration.[tpl]cite news|last=Kotkin |first=Joel |url=http://blogs.forbes.com/joelkotkin/2011/01/03/californias-third-brown-era/ |title=California’s Third Brown Era – Joel Kotkin – New Geographer|work=Forbes |date=December 30, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-21[/tpl] In the General Election on November 5, 1974, Brown was elected Governor of California over California State Controller Houston I. Flournoy; Republicans ascribed the loss to anti-Republican feelings from Watergate, the election being held only ninety days after President Richard Nixon resigned from office. Brown succeeded Republican Governor Ronald Reagan, who had planned on retiring from office after serving two terms.
After taking office, Brown gained a reputation as a fiscal conservative.[tpl]cite news |title=Gov.

As governor, Brown held a strong interest in environmental issues. He appointed J. Baldwin to work in the newly created California Office of Appropriate Technology, Sim Van der Ryn as State Architect, Stewart Brand as Special Advisor, John Bryson as chairman of the California State Water Board. Brown also reorganized the California Arts Council, boosting its funding by 1300 percent and appointing artists to the council[tpl]cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/ag/brown.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091119094345/http://ag.ca.gov/ag/brown.php|archivedate=2009-11-19|title=Edmund G.

Nixon.The decisive vote against the allowance was cast in the California State Senate by the usually pro-business Republican Senator Robert S. Stevens. Shell claimed that Stevens had promised him that he would support keeping the allowance: "He had shaken my hand and told me he was with me."  Brown later rewarded Stevens with a judicial appointment, but Stevens was driven from the bench for making salacious telephone calls.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.sacbee.com/walters/story/844451.html | title = For Joe Shell, character trumped ideology in California politics | last=Walters | first=Dan|date=April 8, 2008|work=The Sacramento Bee | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423035846/http://www.sacbee.com/walters/story/844451.html|archivedate=April 23, 2008[/tpl]
Like his father, Brown strongly opposed the death penalty and vetoed it as Governor, which the legislature overrode in 1977.  He also appointed judges who opposed capital punishment. One of these appointments, Rose Bird as the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, was recalled by voters after a strong campaign financed  by business interests upset by her "pro-labor" and "pro-free speech" rulings. The death penalty was only "a trumped-up excuse"http://www.cschs.org/02_history/images/CSCHS_2007-Brown.pdf Tom Wicker, In the Nation; A Naked Power Grab (New York Times, Sept. 14, 1986),Sec. 4; Page 25. to use against her, even though the Bird Court consistently upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty.[tpl]cite news |title=Jerry Brown and the Rose Bird factor |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2010/03/02/jerry-brown-and-rose-bird-factor |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |date= March 2, 2010| author =Redmond, Tim [/tpl]  In 1960, he lobbied his father, then Governor, to spare the life of Caryl Chessman and reportedly won a 60-day stay for him.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/02/BAGOTJ685P1.DTL |title=Brown's rivals question commitment to death penalty|last=Zamora|first=Jim Herron|date=2006-06-02|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/books/he-was-their-last-resort.html|title=He Was Their Last Resort|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|date=1989-08-20|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-11-19[/tpl]
Brown was both in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment and opposed to Proposition 13, the latter of which would decrease property taxes and greatly reduce revenue to cities and counties.[tpl]cite news |title=The parable of 'Jerry Jarvis' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/04/local/la-me-cap4-2010mar04 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= March 4, 2010| author =Skelton, George [/tpl]  When Proposition 13 passed in June 1978, he heavily cut state spending, and along with the Legislature, spent much of the $5 billion surplus to meet the proposition's requirements and help offset the revenue losses which made cities, counties, and schools more dependent on the state.  His actions in response to the proposition earned him praise from Proposition 13 author Howard Jarvis who went as far to make a television commercial for Brown just before his successful reelection bid in 1978.[tpl]cite news |title=  |url= |publisher= NBC News |date= October 10, 1978| author =Harris, Don |authorlink= Don Harris (journalist) [/tpl] The controversial proposition immediately cut tax revenues and required a two-thirds supermajority to raise taxes.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/us/14calif.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jesse | last=McKinley | title=A Candidate Finds Much Changed, and Little | date=March 13, 2010[/tpl] Proposition 13 "effectively destroyed the funding base of local governments and school districts, which thereafter depended largely on Sacramento for their revenue".Meyerson, Harold (May 28, 2009) "How the Golden State Got Tarnished."

Max Neiman, a professor at the Institute of Government Studies at University of California, Berkeley, credited Brown for "bailing out local government and school districts" but felt it was harmful "because it made it easier for people to believe that Proposition 13 wasn't harmful."

===Second term===

Brown won re-election in 1978 against Republican state Attorney General Evelle J. Younger. Brown appointed the first openly gay judge in the United States when he named Stephen Lachs to serve on the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1979.[tpl]Cite book | last1=Clendinen | first1=Dudley | last2=Nagourney | first2=Adam | title=Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America | date= | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location= | isbn=978-0-684-81091-1 | pages=411–412[/tpl] In 1981, he also appointed the first openly lesbian judge in the United States, Mary C. Morgan to the San Francisco Municipal Court.Jim Schroeder, Twenty-five years of courtroom trauma The Advocate (August 23, 1994).  Brown completed his second term having appointed a total of five gay judges, including Rand Schrader and Jerold Krieger.Tracy Wilkinson, Municipal Court Judge Faces Challenge of AIDS – Disease, The Los Angeles Times (November 25, 1991).Myrna Oliver, Judge Jerold Krieger, 58; Activist Helped Open Gay-Lesbian Temple, The Los Angeles Times (February 20, 2002).  Through his first term as Governor, Brown had not appointed any openly gay people to any position, but he cited the failed 1978 Briggs Initiative, which sought to ban homosexuals from working in California's public schools, for his increased support of gay rights.
In 1981, California Governor Jerry Brown, who had established a reputation as a strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious medfly infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.
Ultimately the infestation was eradicated, but both the Governor's delay and the scale of the action has remained controversial ever since. Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown's chief of staff, B. T. Collins, staged a news conference during which he publicly drank a glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been very toxic to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint.
Brown proposed the establishment of a state space academy and the purchasing of a satellite that would be launched into orbit to provide emergency communications for the state—a proposal similar to one that was indeed eventually adopted. In 1979, an out-of-state columnist, Mike Royko, at the Chicago Sun-Times, picked up on the nickname from Brown's girlfriend at the time, Linda Ronstadt, who was quoted in a 1978 Rolling Stone magazine interview humorously calling him "Moonbeam".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zach-friend/california-governors-race_b_611344.html |title=Zach Friend: California Governor's Race: Why Moonbeam Will Win |work=Huffington Post |date= June 14, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=OUR LATEST EXPORT: GOV.

Brown chose not to run for a third term in 1982, and instead ran for the United States Senate, but lost to San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson. He was succeeded as Governor by George Deukmejian, then state Attorney General, on January 3, 1983.

==Senate defeat and public life==

In 1982, Brown chose not to seek a third term as governor, instead, Brown ran for the United States Senate for the seat being vacated by Republican S.I. Hayakawa. He was defeated by Republican San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson by a margin of 52% to 45%. After his Senate defeat, Brown was left with few political options.[tpl]cite news|title=Brown beaten in Senate bid|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PccUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5798,434388&dq=jerry-brown+pete-wilson&hl=en|accessdate=October 6, 2010|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=November 2, 1982|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] Republican George Deukmejian, a Brown critic, narrowly won the governorship in 1982, succeeding Brown, and was reelected overwhelmingly in 1986. After his Senate defeat in 1982, many considered Brown's political career to be over.
Brown traveled to Japan to study Buddhism, studying with Christian/Zen practitioner Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle under Yamada Koun-roshi. In an interview he explained, "Since politics is based on illusions, zazen definitely provides new insights for a politician. I then come back into the world of California and politics, with critical distance from some of my more comfortable assumptions."[tpl]cite web|last=Branfman |first=Fred |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/1996/06/03/interview960603/ |title=The SALON Interview: Jerry Brown |work=Salon |date=June 3, 1996 |accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] He also visited Mother Teresa in Calcutta, India, where he ministered to the sick in one of her hospices.[tpl]cite news|title=Jerry Brown: On a quest for change|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9OUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SyQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6799,1076438&dq=jerry-brown+mother-teresa&hl=en|accessdate=October 6, 2010|newspaper=The Times-News|date=March 6, 1992|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] He explained, "Politics is a power struggle to get to the top of the heap. Calcutta and Mother Teresa are about working with those who are at the bottom of the heap. And to see them as no different than yourself, and their needs as important as your needs. And you're there to serve them, and doing that you are attaining as great a state of being as you can."
Upon his return from abroad in 1988, Brown announced that he would stand as a candidate to become chairman of the California Democratic Party, and won against investment banker Steve Westly.[tpl]cite news|title=JERRY BROWN WINS STATE PARTY POST|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA071EF8395D0C708DDDAB0894D1484D81|accessdate=October 6, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 13, 1989[/tpl] Although Brown greatly expanded the party's donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on grassroots organizing and get out the vote drives, he was criticized for not spending enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990. In early 1991, Brown abruptly resigned his post and announced that he would run for the Senate seat held by the retiring Alan Cranston. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for a third time.
In 1995, with Brown’s political career at a low point, in the motion picture Jade, the fictional Governor of California tells an assistant district attorney to drop a case, “unless you want as much of a future in this state as Jerry Brown.”  The assistant DA responds “Who’s Jerry Brown?”

==Presidential bids==

===1976===

Brown first ran for the Democratic nomination for President in March 1976, after the primary season had begun, and over a year after some candidates had started campaigning. Brown declared, "The country is rich, but not so rich as we have been led to believe. The choice to do one thing may preclude another. In short, we are entering an era of limits."[tpl]cite news|last=Nolte|first=Carl|title=California rides the wave|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/1999/05/30/SC48827.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=June 28, 2010|date=May 30, 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Schmalz|first=Jeffrey|title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record; Brown Firm on What He Believes, But What He Believes Often Shifts|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/us/1992-campaign-candidate-s-record-brown-firm-what-he-believes-but-what-he.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 28, 2010|date=March 30, 1992[/tpl]
Brown's name began appearing on primary ballots in May and he won in Maryland, Nevada, and his home state of California.View archival news footage of Brown's campaign speech in Union Square, San Francisco on May 25, 1976: http://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/189401. He missed the deadline in Oregon, but he ran as a write-in candidate and finished in third behind Jimmy Carter and Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Brown is often credited with winning the New Jersey and Rhode Island primaries, but in reality, uncommitted slates of delegates that Brown advocated in those states finished first. With support from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, Brown won a majority of delegates at the Louisiana delegate selection convention; thus Louisiana was the only southern state to not support Southerners Carter or Alabama Governor George Wallace. Despite this success, he was unable to stall Carter's momentum, and his rival was nominated on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National Convention. Brown finished third with roughly 300 delegate votes, narrowly behind Congressman Morris Udall and Carter.

===1980===

In 1980, Brown challenged Carter for renomination. His candidacy had been anticipated by the press ever since he won re-election as governor in 1978 over the Republican Evelle Younger by the largest margin in California history, 1.3 million votes. But Brown had trouble gaining traction in both fundraising and polling for the presidential nomination. This was widely believed to be the result of the more prominent candidate Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Brown's 1980 platform, which he declared to be the natural result of combining Buckminster Fuller's visions of the future and E. F. Schumacher's theory of "Buddhist economics", was much expanded from 1976. His "era of limits" slogan was replaced by a promise to, in his words, "Protect the Earth, serve the people, and explore the universe."
Three main planks of his platform were a call for a constitutional convention to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment, a promise to increase funds for the space program as a "first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space satellite to provide solar energy for this planet,"[tpl]cite news|last=Rood|first=W.B.|date=September 26, 1979|title=Brown proposes $2 billion revival of space program|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=B9|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/651211032.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI|quote=He called it the 'first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space satellite to provide solar energy for this planet.'[/tpl] and, in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, opposition to nuclear power. On the subject of the 1979 energy crisis, Brown decried the "Faustian bargain" that he claimed Carter had entered into with the oil industry, and declared that he would greatly increase federal funding of research into solar power. He endorsed the idea of mandatory non-military national service for the nation's youth, and suggested that the Defense Department cut back on support troops while beefing up the number of combat troops.
Brown opposed Kennedy's call for universal national health insurance and opposed Carter's call for an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance.[tpl]cite news|last=Kempster|first=Norman|date=November 11, 1979|title=Brown calls opponents' health insurance programs part of a 'medical arms race'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=A4|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/647930002.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI|quote=As an alternative, the governor suggested a program of tax credits as a 'wellness incentive' for people who do not smoke or otherwise damage their own health.

Brown also called for expanding the use of acupuncture and midwifery.
As his campaign began to attract more members of what some more conservative commentators described as "the fringe", including activists like Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, and Jesse Jackson, however his polling numbers began to suffer. Brown received only 10 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, and he was soon forced to announce that his decision to remain in the race would depend on a good showing in the Wisconsin primary. Although he had polled well there throughout the primary season, an attempt to film a live speech in Madison, the state's capital, into a special effects-filled, 30-minute commercial (produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola) was disastrous.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LoQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4PoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3829,2892425&dq=jerry-brown+francis-ford-coppola+commercial&hl=en |title= Jerry Brown Francis Ford Coppola Comercial|publisher= Google News|format = Search Result|accessdate=2010-11-18[/tpl]

===1992===

When Brown announced his intention to run for president against President George H.W. Bush, many in the media and his own party dismissed his campaign as having little chance of gaining significant support. Ignoring them, Brown embarked on a grassroots campaign to, in his own words, "take back America from the confederacy of corruption, careerism, and campaign consulting in Washington".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dr2FAAAAMAAJ |title=The CQ guide to current American government, Volume 49 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=2010-11-18[/tpl] In his stump speech, first used while officially announcing his candidacy on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Brown told listeners that he would only be accepting campaign contributions from individuals and that he would not accept over $100.[tpl]cite news|author=Chase Davis, California Watch |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/10/09/MN7E1FOJK7.DTL |title=List reveals who had Jerry Brown's ear in '79 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date= October 13, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] Continuing with his populist reform theme, he assailed what he dubbed "the bipartisan Incumbent Party in Washington" and called for term limits for members of Congress. Citing various recent scandals on Capitol Hill, particularly the recent House banking scandal and the large congressional pay-raises from 1990, he promised to put an end to Congress being a "Stop-and-Shop for the moneyed special interests".
As Brown campaigned in various primary states, he would eventually expand his platform beyond a policy of strict campaign finance reform. Although he focused on a variety of issues throughout the campaign, he highlighted his endorsement of living wage laws and opposition to free trade agreements such as NAFTA; he mostly concentrated on his tax policy, which had been created specifically for him by Arthur Laffer, the famous supporter of supply-side economics who created the Laffer curve. This plan, which called for the replacement of the progressive income tax with a flat tax and a value added tax, both at a fixed 13 percent rate, was decried by his opponents as regressive. Nevertheless, it was endorsed by The New York Times, The New Republic, and Forbes, and its raising of taxes on corporations and elimination of various loopholes which tended to favor the very wealthy, proved to be popular with voters. This was, perhaps, not surprising, as various opinion polls taken at the time found that as many as three-quarters of all Americans believed the current tax code to be unfairly biased toward the wealthy. He "seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field... calling for term limits, a flat tax, and the abolition of the Department of Education."Walker, Jesse (2009-11-01) Five Faces of Jerry Brown, The American Conservative Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.
Due to his limited budget, Brown began to use a mixture of alternative media and unusual fund raising techniques. Unable to pay for actual commercials, he used frequent cable television and talk radio interviews as a form of free media to get his message to voters. In order to raise funds, he purchased a toll-free telephone number, which adorned all of his campaign stances. During the campaign, Brown's repetition of this number combined with the moralistic language used, led some to describe him as a "political televangelist" with an "anti-politics gospel"."Brown Enters Race as Leader Against 'Corrupt Politics'", Associated Press, Oct 22, 1991. Page A3.
Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon managed to win narrow victories in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Alaska, and Vermont, but he continued to be considered a small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and frontrunner Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender in the eyes of the press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly-fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: he announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate.[tpl]cite news|last=Dowd |first=Maureen |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10614F839540C708CDDAD0894DA494D81 |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN – Brown – Candidate Is Tripped Up Over Alliance With Jackson |location=New York State |work=The New York Times |date=April 3, 1992 |accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general and New York City's Jews in particular while running for president in 1984, was still despised in Jewish communities. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, who said Judaism was a "gutter religion," and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).
Although Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Although overwhelmingly outspent, Brown won upset victories in seven states and his votes won to money raised ratio was by far the best of any candidate in the race.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-lux/a-modern-populist-movemen_b_639408.html |title=Mike Lux: A Modern Populist Movement |work=Huffington Post |date= July 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] He still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would deprive Clinton of sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination, possibly bringing about a brokered convention. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in this final primary by a margin of 48% to 41%. Although Brown did not win the nomination, he was able to boast of one accomplishment: At the following month's Democratic National Convention, he received the votes of 596 delegates on the first ballot, more than any other candidate but Clinton. He spoke at the convention, and to the national viewing audience, yet without endorsing Clinton, through the device of seconding his own nomination. There was animosity between the Brown and Clinton campaigns, and Brown was the first political figure to criticize Bill Clinton over what became the Whitewater controversy.[tpl]cite news |title=The OTHER Big Problem With Hillary's Notorious Remarks |first=William |last=Bradley |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=May 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 11, 2010 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/the-other-big-problem-wit_b_103478.html[/tpl]

==Mayor of Oakland (1999–2007)==

What would become Brown's re-emergence into politics after six years was in Oakland, California, an "overwhelmingly minority city of 400,000."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15916879?nclick_check=1 |title=Jerry Brown's years as Oakland mayor set stage for political comeback|work=San Jose Mercury News |date=August 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13[/tpl] Brown ran as an independent "having left the Democratic Party, blasting what he called the 'deeply corrupted' two-party system." Prior to taking office, Brown campaigned to get the approval of the electorate to convert Oakland's weak mayor political structure, which structured the mayor as chairman of the city council and official greeter, to a strong mayor structure, where the mayor would act as chief executive over the nonpolitical city manager and thus the various city departments, and break tie votes on the Oakland City Council. He won with 59% of the vote in a field of ten candidates. The political left had hoped for some of the more progressive politics from Brown's earlier governorship, but found Brown "more pragmatic than progressive, more interested in downtown redevelopment and economic growth than political ideology".[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-10-07/bay-area/17397166_1_dellums-oakland-mayor-mayoral-candidate |title=City awaits word from Dellums – SFGate |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 7, 2005 |accessdate=2010-10-13 | first=Chip | last=Johnson[/tpl]  As mayor, he invited the U.S. Marine Corps to use Oakland harbor lands for mock military exercises as part of Operation Urban Warrior.[tpl]cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Henry K. |last2=Hamburg |first2=Laura |title=War Games Come Ashore In East Bay / Chanting protesters greet Marines and helicopters |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/War-Games-Come-Ashore-In-East-Bay-Chanting-2941929.php |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 16, 1999[/tpl]
The city was rapidly losing residents and businesses, and Brown is credited with starting the revitalization of the city using his connections and experience to lessen the economic downturn, while attracting $1 billion of investments, including refurbishing the Fox Theatre, the Port of Oakland, and Jack London Square. The downtown district  was losing retailers, restaurateurs and residential developers, and Brown sought to attract thousands of new residents with disposable income to revitalize the area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-02-19/bay-area/17282981_1_affordable-housing-mixed-income-market-rate-housing |title=CAMPAIGN 2006: Oakland Mayor / Candidates agree on increasing housing / They differ on how to assist middle-, low-income families – SFGate |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 19, 2006 |accessdate=2010-10-13 | first=Christopher | last=Heredia[/tpl] Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris's public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/news/inflating_the_numbers/Content?oid=323334|title=Inflating the Numbers, The Brown administration came very close on the 10K Plan.

It has resulted in redevelopment projects in the Jack London District, where Brown purchased and later sold an industrial warehouse which he used as a personal residence, and in the Lakeside Apartments District near Lake Merritt. The 10k plan has touched the historic Old Oakland district, the Chinatown district, the Uptown district, and Downtown. Brown surpassed the stated goal of attracting 10,000 residents according to city records, and built more affordable housing than previous mayoral administrations.
Brown had campaigned on fixing Oakland's schools, but "bureaucratic battles" dampened his efforts. He concedes he never had control of the schools, and his reform efforts were "largely a bust". He focused instead on the creation of two charter schools, the Oakland School for the Arts and the Oakland Military Institute. Another area of disappointment was overall crime. Brown sponsored nearly two dozen crime initiatives to reduce the crime rate,[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-09/bay-area/18381607_1_jerry-brown-pat-brown-cure-social-ills |title=Jerry Brown is ex-mayor, not Gov.

==Attorney General of California (2007–2011)==

In 2004, Brown expressed interest to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General of California in the 2006 election, and in May 2004, he formally filed to run. He defeated his Democratic primary opponent Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo 63% to 37%. In the general election, Brown defeated Republican State Senator Charles Poochigian 56.3% to 38.2%, one of the largest margins of victory in any statewide California race.[tpl]cite web|last=McPherson|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce McPherson|url=http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/complete_sov.pdf|title="Statement of Vote", 2006|format=PDF|work=Elections & Voter Information|publisher=California Secretary of State's Office|accessdate=2007-06-12[/tpl] In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, Brown's eligibility to run for Attorney General was challenged in what Brown called a "political stunt by a Republican office seeker" (Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee chairman and state GOP vice-chair candidate Tom Del Beccaro). Plaintiffs claimed Brown did not meet eligibility according to California Government Code §12503, "No person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney General unless he shall have been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the state for a period of at least five years immediately preceding his election or appointment to such office." Legal analysts called the lawsuit frivolous because Brown was admitted to practice law in the State of California on June 14, 1965, and had been so admitted to practice ever since. Although ineligible to practice law because of his voluntary inactive status in the State Bar of California from January 1, 1997 to May 1, 2003, he was nevertheless still admitted to practice. Because of this difference the case was eventually thrown out.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/editorial102006.htm|title=Editorial: GOP Volunteers Disgrace Party by Opposition to Kennard, Suit Against Brown|work=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|page=6|date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Josh|last=Richman|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/search/ci_5201111|title=Judge dismisses suit against Brown|work=Oakland Tribune|date=February 10, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-12[/tpl]

Beginning in 1995, Brown hosted a daily call-in talk show on the local Pacifica Radio station, KPFA-FM, in Berkeley broadcast to major US markets. Both the radio program and Brown's political action organization, based in Oakland, were called We the People. His programs, usually featuring invited guests, generally explored alternative views on a wide range of social and political issues, from education and health care to spirituality and the death penalty.
The official gubernatorial portrait of Jerry Brown, commemorating his first period as Governor of California was painted by Don Bachardy and unveiled in 1984.

Brown has a long-term friendship with Jacques Barzaghi, his aide-de-camp, whom he met in the early 1970s and put on his payroll.
