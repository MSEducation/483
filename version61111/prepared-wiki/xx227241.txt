==History==

Chini Ka Rauza was built in the reign of Shah Jahan. Allama Afzal Khan Mullah of Shiraz, was a scholar and poet who went on to become the Prime Minister of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.

==Architecture==

Chini-ka-Rauza is considered a milestone in Indo-Persian architecture, as it is the very first building in India that has been exclusively decorated by the glazed tile works. The most distinctive feature of the tomb is the colorful tiles or chini, from which the mausoleum gets its name. the tomb is rectangular in shape and is constructed mainly of brown stone. The walls of the tomb are adorned with inscriptions and colored tiles that give a distinctive look to the structure.
As one moves towards the central chamber of the Chini ka Rauza which has octagonal shape and boasts of 8 curved recesses, there are 4 square chambers that are linked with the halls in the corner and outside porches. However, perhaps the most significant feature of the tomb is the Afghan-style rounded dome that is adorned with inscriptions from Islamic texts.
