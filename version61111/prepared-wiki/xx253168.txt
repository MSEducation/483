When entering a war zone Charles Henderson pretends to be a farmer. It turns out that Farmers are not allowed in, so the Officer at the entrance writes him down as a translator. After a couple of weeks of working as a translator, Henderson manages to get Marc a job too. The story ends with the group arriving in England and meeting Eileen McAfferty.

===Secret Army===

At the beginning of the book, Marc has an operation to remove the fragmented root of the tooth that was pulled out by the Gestapo at a dentist in London. Afterwards, Henderson forgets to collect him and he is forced to find his way back to Henderson's gentleman club by himself, where he finds Henderson drunk. That night, German bombers drop incendiary bombs on the club, and Marc battles his way through the smoke to rescue an old man who is trapped, suffering smoke inhalation. This brings him to the attention of an Admiral, who gives Marc a present and offers to help the struggling unit secure a spot on a training exercise.
He returns to campus for a few days, before travelling with the rest of Group A for a parachute training course. Marc discovers that he has a fear for heights, and feels too scared to jump out of a plane the first time around. He is depressed afterwards, but is offered a second chance and, after encouragement from Paul, performs his jump near-perfectly. He then travels north to Scotland with the rest of the CHERUB team on a training exercise to try and capture an anti-aircraft gun, where he helps steal and transport the gun to London's King's Cross Station.
