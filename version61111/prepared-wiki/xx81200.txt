Having debuted as a voice actor in 1988 with his role as Murai from Be-Bop High School and often called Mr. Perfect, Hikaru Midorikawa is one of the most well-known and prolific voice actors in Japan, having more than 200 anime credits[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=546|work=Anime News Network[/tpl] and up to 70 game credits in his two-decade career. He is known for his distinctly cool voice, suited for bishounen characters, which often lands him roles like Lancer in Fate/Zero, Eiichi Ootori in Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love 2000%, Rukawa Kaede in Slam Dunk, Ayato Sakamaki in Diabolik Lovers,[tpl]cite news|title=Diabolik Lovers anime - cast announcement|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-02-17/diabolik-lovers-franchise-of-6-vampire-brothers-gets-anime|date=2013-02-17[/tpl] and Edgar Ashenbert in Earl and Fairy.
Aside from his voice acting activities, he is also a J-Pop artist and has been a part of bands such as Zero Phoenix and E.M.U (Entertainment Music Unit) in the mid 1990s until early 2000s. E.M.U was formed by five voice actors from the radio drama Sotsugyou M (Male Graduation). The other members are Nobutoshi Canna (previously Hayashi), Ryōtarō Okiayu, Hideo Ishikawa, and Daisuke Sakaguchi. During their run from 1995 to 2000, the group released 8 CDs and four singles. Shortly before E.M.U disbanded, he joined with his fellow voice actor and friend, Nobutoshi Canna, to create a new group, Zero Phoenix. The duo only released one CD, titled "Kirameki".
His voice ranges between E2 and A4(slightly B4). While singing, he ranges between C or D.[tpl]cite web|title=Vocal range|url=http://www.aoni.co.jp/actor/ma/midorikawa-hikaru.html[/tpl]
He also manages his blog and is an avid gamer. He is a big fan of Super Robot Wars, having a blog entry on the SRW site; he is one of a handful of people to have a blog on Banpresto's "Supalog" website. As a SRW fan, Midorikawa does extra lines for his characters for free and usually acts as a beta tester for new games in the franchise. Usually the characters he is cast to play turn into one-man armies, namely Heero and Masaki in Super Robot Wars and Xingke in Code Geass.
