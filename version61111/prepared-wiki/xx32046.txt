[[Toad of Toad Hall]]

CATEGORIES: Plays by A. A. Milne, British plays, Literature featuring anthropomorphic characters, Incidental music, Compositions by Harold Fraser-Simson

Toad of Toad Hall is the first of several dramatisations of Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows.  It was written by A. A. Milne, with incidental music by Harold Fraser-Simson.
Milne extracted the adventures of Mr. Toad (which form only about half of the original book) because they lent themselves most easily to being staged.  Milne loved Grahame's book, which is one of the reasons he decided to adapt it.  The play has four main characters: Rat, Badger, Mole, and Toad.  Toad's caravan and car adventures are included, as well as his imprisonment, escape, and subsequent fight with the weasels and stoats to regain his home with the help of his friends.  Although not a musical, the play contains six songs.
Its first production was at the Lyric Theatre, London on 17 December 1929.
In Season 2, Episode 2 of Downton Abbey, the Dowager Countess says to Lady Edith Crawley, "Edith! You're a lady, not Toad of Toad Hall!," after Lady Edith announces at dinner that she has volunteered to operate a tractor at a nearby farm because the men who normally operate it are away fighting in World War One.
