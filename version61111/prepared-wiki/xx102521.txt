The suckermouthed catfish (Hypostomus punctatus) is a tropical fish known as a Plecostomus belonging to the armored suckermouth catfish family (Loricariidae). Hypostomus punctatus is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as the Common Pleco by aquarists.

==Appearance and anatomy==

Suckermouthed catfish is a species of Loricariidae. Like other members of this family, it has a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. These fish grow to about [tpl]convert|30|cm|in[/tpl] TL.
Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as common pleco. This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (the last part of its scientific name, punctatus, means "spotted"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the Spotted Hypostomus. There is no striping pattern. Also, they are lighter than H. plecostomus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/cotm/cotm.php?article_id=64|title=PlanetCatfish::Catfish of the Month::July 1998|publisher=PlanetCatfish.com|date=2006-08-18|accessdate=2007-05-18[/tpl]

==Habitat and ecology==

It is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. This stream-dweller's preferred water temperature is 22–28°C, pH range is 5–8, and dH range 0.5–25.[tpl]FishBase species|genus=Hypostomus|species=punctatus|year=2011|month=December[/tpl] The Suckermouthed catfish is mainly herbivorous and feeds on algae, detritus as well as plants and roots.

==In the aquarium==

The suckermouthed catfish is a moderately hardy fish. In the aquarium, it is suitable for an appropriately sized community tank, being peaceful to most other fish. However, large individuals of this fish are territorial and may be somewhat aggressive to its own kind.
The suckermouthed catfish has not been reported to spawn and breed in aquarium; it is thought to spawn in mud burrows dug into the side of riverbanks in its natural habitat.
