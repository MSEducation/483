==Early and personal life==

Chris Carter was born on 4 May 1952, and brought up in the Auckland suburb of Panmure. He was educated at St Peter's College, Auckland and at the University of Auckland where he received an MA(Hons) in history.
Before entering politics, Carter had served as a teacher and as a poultry farmer. His partner is Peter Kaiser, a headmaster, and they have been together for over 30 years. On February 10, 2007, Carter and Kaiser were joined[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10423319|title=Minister to marry in gay union|last1=McNaughton|first1=Maggie|last2=Perry|first2=Keith|date=10 February 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl] in the first civil union for a Cabinet Minister or Member of Parliament since civil unions in New Zealand were introduced after legislation was passed in December 2004.

==Member of Parliament==

Carter was the first openly gay man ever appointed as a New Zealand Cabinet minister. He has been a strong advocate of gay equality for some time, and has continued this role since entering Parliament. He also started one of the first branches of New Zealand Rainbow Labour for centre-left lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgendered people (LGBT) and others during the 1996â€“1999 term, after having lost the newly created Waipareira electorate to National's Brian Neeson by just 107 votes,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1996/pdf/6.1%20Waipareira%2053.pdf |title=Electorate Candidate and Party Votes Recorded at Each Polling Place - Waipareira |accessdate=6 July 2013 |format=PDF[/tpl] and not having been placed on the Labour list for the election.[tpl]cite web |title=Part III - Party Lists of Successful Registered Parties |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1996/pdf/3.3%20Party%20Lists%20of%20Successful%20Registered%20Parties.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=14 June 2013 |format=PDF[/tpl]
At the [tpl]NZ election link|2005[/tpl], Carter was re-elected to his seat with 59.4% of the vote, a majority of 10,447.
Labour lost power in the [tpl]NZ election link|2008[/tpl]. Carter was re-elected, but his majority was almost halved to 5,298.Te Atatu results 2008.
On 14 June 2010, 4 days after the release of ministerial credit card records, Carter along with two other MPs Shane Jones MP and Mita Ririnui MP (Lab - Lists) were demoted by Opposition Leader Phil Goff MP ([tpl]NZ electorate link|Mount Roskill[/tpl]) for misuse of such credit cards. In the case of Carter, he was accused of purchasing personal items with the card, which was outside the rules for Ministerial expenditure as a minister under the former Clark government over a six-year period. Carter has since repaid the money in full. Carter's demotion included removal from the front bench, and loss of the shadow portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Carter subsequently speculated publicly about whether he would continue as a Member of Parliament.
As a cabinet minister, Carter was entitled to the title of The Honourable and became The Hon.

==Removal from caucus==

On 29 July 2010 Carter was suspended from the Labour Party caucus for allegedly being behind an anonymous letter sent around the Press Gallery claiming there was a leadership challenge against Phil Goff; a charge he has since admitted. On 17 August 2010, Speaker Lockwood Smith announced that Chris Carter was officially an independent MP.

==Post-parliamentary career==

In early September 2011 Carter was appointed as director of the Governance Unit of the United Nations mission in Kabul, Afghanistan, with responsibility in assisting the Afghan government in fighting corruption.[tpl]cite news |title=MP Carter leaves Te Atatu for UN job in Afghanistan |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10748665 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2011[/tpl] His parliamentary seat remained vacant until the 26 November [tpl]NZ election link|2011[/tpl] as there is no requirement to hold a by-election when there is less than six months to a general election.
On 18 October 2013, Carter was waiting for a colleague to leave his compound in Kabul when a suicide bomber attacked a passing military convoy on the street some [tpl]convert|25|m[/tpl] away; he was separated from the blast by a glass wall. If his Australian colleague had not been late, they could have been the victims of the attack themselves. Carter considered it a "close shave".[tpl]cite news |last=Forbes |first=Michael |title=Taliban bomb explodes close to ex-NZ MP |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/9305785/Taliban-bomb-explodes-close-to-ex-NZ-MP |accessdate=26 October 2013 |newspaper=The Dominion Post |date=21 October 2013[/tpl]
