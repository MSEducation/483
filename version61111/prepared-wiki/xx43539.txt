He was commissioned by CBS to illustrate a preview magazine featuring the network's new TV programming in fall 1963. One of the programs was Candid Camera, and Hirschfeld's caricature of the show's host Allen Funt outraged Funt so much he threatened to leave the network if the magazine were issued. Hirschfeld prepared a slightly different likeness, perhaps more flattering, but he and the network pointed out to Funt that the artwork prepared for newspapers and some other print media had been long in preparation and it was too late to withdraw it. Funt relented but insisted that what could be changed would have to be. Newsweek ran a squib on the controversy.

===Broadway, film, and more===

Hirschfeld started young and continued drawing to the end of his life, thus chronicling nearly all the major entertainment figures of the 20th century. During Hirschfeld's nearly eight-decade career, he gained fame by illustrating the actors, singers, and dancers of various Broadway plays, which would appear in advance in The New York Times to herald the play's opening. Though "Theater" was Hirschfeld's best known field of interest, according to his long-time art dealer Margo Feiden, he actually drew more for the movies than he did for live plays. "By the ripe old age of 17, while his contemporaries were learning how to sharpen pencils, Hirschfeld became an art director at Selznick Pictures. He held the position for about four years, and then in 1924 Hirschfeld moved to Paris to work and lead the Bohemian life. Hirschfeld also grew a beard, necessitated by the exigencies of living in a cold-water flat. This he retained—the beard, not the flat—for the next 75 years, presumably because "you never know when your oil burner will go on the fritz."Show Business is No Business (1983). New York: Da Capo Press, pp. Endnotes, ISBN=10:0306762218  
In addition to Broadway and film, Hirschfeld also drew politicians, TV stars, and celebrities of all stripes from Cole Porter and the Nicholas Brothers to the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Hirschfeld also caricatured jazz musicians— Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald—and rockers The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, and Mick Jagger.[tpl]cite web|title=Al Hirschfeld/Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd.|url=http://www.alhirschfeld.com[/tpl]  In 1977 Hirschfeld drew the cover of Aerosmith's Draw the Line album.
Hirschfeld drew many original movie posters, which include posters for Charlie Chaplin's films, as well as The Wizard of Oz (1939). The "Rhapsody in Blue" segment in the Disney film Fantasia 2000 was inspired by his designs and Hirschfeld became an artistic consultant for the segment; the segment's director, Eric Goldberg, is a longtime fan of his work. Further evidence of Goldberg's admiration for Hirschfeld can be found in Goldberg's character design and animation of the genie in Aladdin (1992). He was the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary film, The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story (1996).

===Nina===

In 1943, Hirschfeld married one of Europe's most famous actresses, Dolly Haas. They were married for more than 50 years, and in addition, they produced a daughter, Nina.   
Hirschfeld is known for hiding Nina's name in most of the drawings he produced after her birth. The name would appear in a sleeve, in a hairdo, or somewhere in the background. As Margo Feiden described it, Hirschfeld engaged in the “harmless insanity,” as he called it, of hiding her name Nina at least once in each of his drawings. The number of NINAs concealed is shown by an Arabic numeral to the right of his signature. Generally, if no number is to be found, either NINA appears once or the drawing was executed before she was born. 
For the first few months after Nina was born, Hirschfeld intended the hidden NINAs to appeal to his circle of friends. But to Hirschfeld's complete surprise, what he hadn't realized, was that the population at large was beginning to spot them, too. When Hirschfeld thought the "gag" was wearing thin among his friends and stopped concealing NINAs in his drawings, Letters to the New York Times, ranging from "curious" to "furious" pressured Hirschfeld to begin hiding them again. Hirschfeld said it was easier to hide the NINAs than it was to answer all the mail. From time to time Hirschfeld lamented that the gimmick had overshadowed his art. Nina herself was reportedly ambivalent about all the attention the hidden NINAs it brought her.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In Hirschfeld's book Show Business is No Business, his art dealer, Margo Feiden, recounts the following story to illustrate what Hirschfeld meant when he referred to the "NINA counting" a harmless insanity: "The NINA-counting mania was well illuminated when in 1973 an NYU student kept coming back to my Gallery to stare at the same drawing each day for more than a week. The drawing was Hirschfeld's whimsical portrayal of New York's Central Park. When curiosity finally got the best of me, I asked, “What is so riveting about that one drawing that keeps you here for hours, day after day?” She answered that she had found only 11 of 39 NINAs and would not give up until all were located. I replied that the "39" next to Hirschfeld's signature was the year. Nina was born in 1945."  
In an interview with The Comics Journal, Hirschfeld confirmed the urban legend that the U.S. Army had used his drawings to train bomber pilots by assigning soldiers to spot the NINAs much as they would spot their targets. Hirschfeld told the magazine he found the idea repulsive, saying he felt his cartoons were being used to help kill people.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In his 1966 anthology The World of Hirschfeld, he included a drawing of Nina which he titled "Nina's Revenge." That drawing contained no NINAs. There were, however, two ALs and two DOLLYs ("the names of her wayward parents").[tpl]cite book|last=Hirschfeld|first=Al|title=The World of Hirschfeld|year=1970|publisher=Harry N.

Or, Around the World in 80 Clichés, a satirical look at the duo's travels on assignment for Holiday magazine.

The collection included drawings of Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Edgar Bergen (with Charlie McCarthy), Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Bud Abbott, and Lou Costello. He followed that with a collection of silent film stars including Rudolph Valentino, ZaSu Pitts and Buster Keaton. The Postal Service allowed him to include Nina's name in his drawings, waiving their own rule forbidding hidden messages in United States stamp designs.
Hirschfeld expanded his audience by contributing to Patrick F. McManus' humor column in Outdoor Life magazine for a number of years.
