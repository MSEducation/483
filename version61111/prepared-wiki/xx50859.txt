[[Fume hood]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment, Ventilation

A fume hood or fume cupboard is a type of local"Study of Factors Affecting Fume Hood Energy Consumption1".pdf by American AutoMatrix ventilation device that is designed to limit exposure to hazardous or toxic fumes, vapors or dusts. A fume hood is typically a large piece of equipment enclosing five sides of a work area, the bottom of which is most commonly located at a standing work height.
Two main types exist, ducted and recirculating (aka ductless). The principle is the same for both types: air is drawn in from the front (open) side of the cabinet, and either expelled outside the building or made safe through filtration and fed back into the room.
Other related types of local ventilation devices include: clean benches, biosafety cabinets, glove boxes and snorkel exhausts. All these devices address the need to control airborne hazards or irritants that are typically generated or released within the local ventilation device. All local ventilation devices are designed to address one or more of three primary goals:
Secondary functions of these devices may include explosion protection, spill containment, and other functions necessary to the work being done within the device.
A general but non-specific term for some of these local ventilation devices is Laminar flow cabinet. This category may include clean benches, biosafety cabinets and other devices characterized simply by the laminar nature of their airflow. The term laminar flow cabinet, however, is insufficient to identify their actual design and use - some will protect the product but not the user, and others will protect both. Terminology for local ventilation devices has been, and remains, unclear and  non-specific, and the reader is advised to take special care in selection and specification based upon which of the three primary goals (listed above) are to be met.
Fume hoods typically protect only the user, and are most commonly used in laboratories where hazardous or noxious chemicals are released during testing, research, development or teaching. They are also used in industrial applications or other activities where hazardous or noxious vapors, gases or dusts are generated or released.
Because one side (the front) of a fume hood is open to the room occupied by the user, and the air within the fume hood is potentially contaminated, the proper flow of air from the room into the hood is critical to its function. Much of fume hood design and operation is focused on maximizing the proper containment of the air and fumes within the fume hood.
As most fume hoods are designed to connect to exhaust systems that expel the air directly to the exterior of a building, large quantities of energy are required to run fans that exhaust the air, and to heat, cool, filter, control and move the air that will replace the air exhausted. Significant recent efforts in fume hood and ventilation system design have focused on reducing the energy used to operate fume hoods and their supporting ventilation systems.

==Design features==

Fume hoods were originally manufactured from timber, but during the seventies and eighties epoxy powder coated steel became the norm. During the nineties wood pulp derivatives treated with phenolic resin (plastic laminates and solid grade laminates) for chemical resistance and flame spread retardency started to become widely accepted. Fume hoods (fume cupboards) are generally available in 5 different widths; 1000 mm, 1200 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm and 2000 mm.[tpl]cite book|last=Pickard|first=Quentin|title=The Architects' Handbook|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford, England|isbn=1-4051-3505-0|page=228|chapter=Laboratories[/tpl] The depth varies between 700 mm and 900 mm, and the height between 1900 mm and 2700 mm. These can accommodate from one to three operators. Fume hoods are generally set back against the walls and are often fitted with infills above, to cover up the exhaust ductwork. Because of their shape they are generally dim inside, so many have internal lights with vapor-proof covers. The front is a sash window, usually in glass, able to move up and down on a counterbalance mechanism. On educational versions, the sides of the unit are often also glass, so that several pupils can look into a fume hood at once. Low air flow alarm control panels are common, see below.

==Sash counterbalance systems==

==Fume hood liners==

==Control panels==

Most fume hoods are fitted with a mains-powered control panel. Typically, they perform one or more of the following functions:
Specific extra functions can be added, for example, a switch to turn a waterwash system on or off.

==Types==

===Ducted fume hoods===

Most fume hoods for industrial purposes are ducted. A large variety of ducted fume hoods exist. In most designs, conditioned (i.e. heated or cooled) air is drawn from the lab space into the fume hood and then dispersed via ducts into the atmosphere.
The fume hood is only one piece of the lab ventilation system.  As the recirculation of lab air to the rest of the facility is not permitted, air handling units serving the non-laboratory areas are kept segregated from the laboratory units. As a means of improving indoor air quality, some laboratories also utilize single-pass air handling systems, where air that is heated or cooled is used only once prior to discharge. Many laboratories continue to utilize return air systems to the laboratory areas to minimize energy and running costs, while still providing adequate ventilation rates for acceptable working conditions. The fume hoods serve to evacuate hazardous levels of contaminant.
To reduce lab ventilation costs, variable air volume (VAV) systems are employed, which reduce the volume of the air exhausted as the fume hood sash is closed. This product is often enhanced by an automatic sash closing device, which will close the fume hood sash when the user leaves the fume hood face. The result is that the hoods are operating at the minimum exhaust volume whenever no one is actually working in front of them.
Since the typical fume hood in US climates uses 3.5-times as much energy as a home,[tpl]cite journal|last=Mills|first=Evan|coauthors=Dale Sartor|title=Energy Use and Savings Potential for Laboratory Fume Hoods|journal=LBNL 55400|date=April 2006|url=http://evanmills.lbl.gov/pubs/pdf/fh_energy_full_report.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl] the reduction or minimization of exhaust volume is particularly beneficial in reducing facility energy costs as well as minimizing the impact on the facility infrastructure and the environment. Particular attention must be paid to the discharge location, so as not to risk public safety, or to pull the exhaust air back into the building supply air system.

===Auxiliary air===

This method is outdated technology. The premise was to bring non-conditioned outside air directly in front of the hood so that this was the air exhausted to the outside. This method does not work well when the climate changes as it pours frigid or hot and humid air over the user making it very uncomfortable to work or affecting the procedure inside the hood. This system also uses additional ductwork which can be costly.

===Constant air volume (CAV) ducted hoods===

In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, Lab Manager Magazine found that approximately 43% of fume hoods are conventional CAV fume hoods.[tpl]cite news|title=Shopping for a Fume Hood?

====Non-bypass CAV ducted hoods====

Closing the sash on a non-bybass CAV hood will increase face velocity (“pull"), which is a function of the total volume divided by the area of the sash opening. Thus, a conventional hood’s performance (from a safety perspective) depends primarily on sash position, with safety increasing as the hood is drawn closed.[tpl]cite news|last=McLeod|first=Vince|title=CAV, RAV & VAV|url=http://www.labmanager.com/?articles.view/articleNo/3463/|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Lab Manager Magazine|date=October 7, 2009|author2=Glenn Ketcham[/tpl] To address this issue, many conventional CAV hoods specify a maximum height that the fume hood can be open in order to maintain safe airflow levels.
A major drawback of conventional CAV hoods is that when the sash is closed, velocities can increase to the point where they disturb instrumentation and delicate apparatuses, cool hot plates, slow reactions, and/or create turbulence that can force contaminants into the room.[tpl]cite news|last=McLeod|first=Vince|title=CAV, RAV & VAV|url=http://www.labmanager.com/?articles.view/articleNo/3463/|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Lab Manager Magazine|date=October 7, 2009|author2=Glenn Ketcham[/tpl]

====Bypass CAV ducted hoods====

Bypass CAV hoods (which are sometimes also referred to as conventional hoods) were developed to overcome the high velocity issues that affect conventional fume hoods. These hood allows air to be pulled through a "bypass" opening from above as the sash closes. The bypass is located so that as the user closes the sash, the bypass opening gets larger. The air going through the hood maintains a constant volume no matter where the sash is positioned and without changing fan speeds. As a result, the energy consumed by CAV fume hoods (or rather, the energy consumed by the building HVAC system and the energy consumed by the hood's exhaust fan) remains constant, or near constant, regardless of sash position.[tpl]cite web|title=Lab Fume Hoods|url=http://www.colorado.edu/FacMan/about/conservation/FumeHoods.html|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder Facilities Management|accessdate=22 October 2012[/tpl]

=====Low flow/high performance bypass CAV ducted hoods=====

"High-performance" or "low-flow" bypass CAV hoods are the newest type of bypass CAV hoods and typically display improved containment, safety, and energy conservation features. Low-flow/high performance CAV hoods generally have one or more of the following features: sash stops or horizontal-sliding sashes to limit the openings; sash position and airflow sensors that can control mechanical baffles; small fans to create an air-curtain barrier in the operator’s breathing zone; refined aerodynamic designs and variable dual-baffle systems to maintain laminar (undisturbed, nonturbulent) flow through the hood. Although the initial cost of a high-performance hood is typically more than that of a conventional bypass hood, the improved containment and flow characteristics allow these hoods to operate at a face velocity as low as 60 fpm, which can translate into $2,000 per year or more in energy savings, depending on hood size and sash settings.[tpl]cite web|title=Lab Fume Hoods|url=http://www.colorado.edu/FacMan/about/conservation/FumeHoods.html|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder Facilities Management|accessdate=22 October 2012[/tpl]

===Reduced air volume (RAV) ducted hoods===

Reduced air volume hoods (a variation of low-flow/high performance hoods) incorporate a bypass block to partially close off the bypass, reducing the air volume and thus conserving energy. Usually, the block is combined with a sash stop to limit the height of the sash opening, ensuring a safe face velocity during normal operation while lowering the hood’s air volume. By reducing the air volume, the RAV hood can operate with a smaller blower, which is another cost-saving advantage.
Since RAV hoods have restricted sash movement and reduced air volume, these hoods are less flexible in what they can be used for and can only be used for certain tasks. Another drawback to RAV hoods is that users can in theory override or disengage the sash stop. If this occurs, the face velocity could drop to an unsafe level. To counter this condition, operators must be trained never to override the sash stop while in use, and only to do so when loading or cleaning the hood.[tpl]cite web|title=Lab Fume Hoods|url=http://www.colorado.edu/FacMan/about/conservation/FumeHoods.html|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder Facilities Management|accessdate=22 October 2012[/tpl]

===Variable air volume (VAV) ducted hoods===

VAV hoods, the newest generations of laboratory fume hoods, vary the volume of room air exhausted while maintaining the face velocity at a set level. Different VAV hoods change the exhaust volume using different methods, such as a damper or valve in the exhaust duct that opens and closes based on sash position, or a blower that changes speed to meet air-volume demands. Most VAV hoods integrate a modified bypass-block system that ensures adequate airflow at all sash positions. VAV hoods are connected electronically to the laboratory building’s HVAC, so hood exhaust and room supply are balanced. In addition, VAV hoods feature monitors and/or alarms that warn the operator of unsafe hood-airflow conditions.
Although VAV hoods are much more complex than traditional constant-volume hoods, and correspondingly have higher initial costs, they can provide considerable energy savings by reducing the total volume of conditioned air exhausted from the laboratory. Since most hoods are operated the entire time a laboratory is open, this can quickly add up to significant cost savings. This savings are, however, completely contingent on user behavior: the less the hoods are open (both in terms of height and in terms of time), the greater the energy savings. For example, if the laboratory's ventilation system uses 100% once-through outside air and the value of conditioned air is assumed to be $7 per CFM per year (this value would increase with very hot, cold or humid climates), a 6-foot VAV fume hood at full open for experiment set up 10% of the time (2.4 hours per day), at 18 inch working opening 25% of the time (6 hours per day), and completely closed 65% of the time (15.6 hours per day) would save approximately $6,000 every year compared to a hood that is fully open 100% of the time.[tpl]cite news|title=Fume Hood Sash  Stickers Increases Laboratory Safety  and Efficiency at  Minimal Cost: Success at two University  of California Campuses|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/sash_stickers_cs.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=U.S. Department of Energy|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wesolowski|first=Daniel|coauthors=Elsa Olivetti, Amanda Graham, Steve Lanou, Peter Cooper, Jim Doughty, Rich Wilk and Leon Glicksman|title=The use of feedback in lab energy conservation: fume hoods at MIT|journal=International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education|date=10 Feb 2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=217–235|doi=10.1108/14676371011058523|url=http://web.mit.edu/~slanou/www/shared_documents/The%20use%20of%20feedback%20in%20lab%20energy%20conservation.pdf[/tpl]
Potential behavioral savings from VAV fume hoods are highest when fume hood density (number of fume hoods per square foot of lab space) is high. This is because fume hoods contribute to the achievement of lab spaces' required air exchange rates. Put another way, savings from closing fume hoods can only be achieved when fume hood exhaust rates are greater than the air exchange rate needed to achieve the required ventilation rate in the lab room. For example, if you have a lab room with a required air exchange rate of 2000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), and that room has just one fume hood, which vents air at a rate of 1000 square feet per minute, closing the sash on the fume hood will simply cause the lab room's air handler to increase from 1000 CFM to 2000 CFM, thus resulting in no net reduction in air exhaust rates, and thus no net reduction in energy consumption.[tpl]cite news|title=Fume Hood Sash  Stickers Increases Laboratory Safety  and Efficiency at  Minimal Cost: Success at two University  of California Campuses|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/sash_stickers_cs.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=U.S. Department of Energy|date=March 2012[/tpl]
In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, Lab Manager Magazine found that approximately 12% of fume hoods are VAV fume hoods.[tpl]cite news|title=Shopping for a Fume Hood?

===Canopy fume hoods===

Canopy fume hoods, also called exhaust canopies, are similar to the range hoods found over stoves in commercial and some residential kitchens. They have only a canopy (and no enclosure and no sash) and are designed for venting non-toxic materials such as non-toxic smoke, steam, heat, and odors. In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, Lab Manager Magazine found that approximately 13% of fume hoods are ducted canopy fume hoods.[tpl]cite news|title=Shopping for a Fume Hood?

==Ductless (recirculating) fume hoods==

Mainly for educational or testing use, these units generally have a fan mounted on the top (soffit) of the hood, or beneath the worktop. Air is sucked through the front opening of the hood and through a filter, before passing through the fan and being fed back into the workplace. With a ductless fume hood it is essential that the filter medium be able to remove the particular hazardous or noxious material being used. As different filters are required for different materials, recirculating fume hoods should only be used when the hazard is well known and does not change.
Air filtration of ductless fume hoods is typically broken into two segments:
Ductless fume hoods are often not appropriate for research applications where the activity, and the materials used or generated, may change or be unknown. As a result of this and other drawbacks, some research organizations, including the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,[tpl]cite web|title=UW Milwaukee Ductless Fume Hood Policy|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/usa/safety/laboratory_safety/ductless_fumehoods.cfm[/tpl] Columbia University,[tpl]cite web|title=Columbia University Chemical Fume Hood Policy|url=http://ehs.columbia.edu/fhPolicy.html|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl] Princeton University,[tpl]cite web|title=Princeton University Laboratory Safety Manual, Section 6B: Controlling Chemical Exposures|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/labsafetymanual/sec6b.htm[/tpl] the University of New Hampshire,[tpl]cite web|title=University of New Hampshire Fume Hood Program|url=http://www.unh.edu/research/sites/unh.edu.research/files/docs/EHS/UNH-Fume-Hood-Program.pdf|publisher=University of New Hampshire Office of Environmental Health and Safety|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl] and the University of Colorado, Boulder[tpl]cite web|title=Fume Hood Questions & Answers|url=http://www.colorado.edu/ehs/pdf/ECIH.FumeHoodQandA11_08.pdf|publisher=University of Colorado - Boulder Department of Environmental Health and Safety|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl] either discourage or prohibit the use of ductless fume hoods.
A benefit of ductless fume hoods is that they are mobile, easy to install since they require no ductwork, and can be plugged into a 110 volt or 220 volt outlet.
In a survey of 247 lab professionals conducted in 2010, Lab Manager Magazine found that approximately 22% of fume hoods are ductless fume hoods.[tpl]cite news|title=Shopping for a Fume Hood?

==Specialty hood types==

===Acid digestion hood===

These units are typically constructed of polypropylene in order to resist the corrosive effects of acids at high concentrations. If hydrofluoric acid is being used in the hood, the hood's glass sash should be constructed of polycarbonate which resists etching. Hood ductwork should be lined with polypropylene or coated with PTFE (Teflon).

===Downflow fume hoods===

Downflow fume hoods, also called downflow work stations, are typically ductless fume hoods designed to protect the user and the environment from hazardous vapors generated on the work surface. A downward air flow is generated and hazardous vapors are collected through slits in the work surface.

===Perchloric acid hood===

These units feature a waterwash system in the ductwork.  Because perchloric acid fumes settle, and form explosive crystals, it is vital that the ductwork is cleaned internally with a series of sprays.

===Radioisotope hood===

This fume hood is made with a coved stainless steel liner and coved integral stainless steel countertop that is reinforced to handle the weight of lead bricks or blocks.

===Scrubber===

This type of fume hood absorbs the fumes through a chamber filled with plastic shapes, which are doused with water.  The chemicals are washed into a sump, which is often filled with a neutralizing liquid.  The fumes are then dispersed, or disposed of, in the conventional manner.

===Waterwash===

These fume hoods have an internal wash system that cleans the interior of the unit, to prevent a build-up of dangerous chemicals.

==Energy consumption==

Because fume hoods constantly remove very large volumes of conditioned (heated or cooled) air from lab spaces, they are responsible for the consumption of large amounts of energy. Key statistics laid out in a 2006 article by Evan Mills et al.:[tpl]cite journal|last=Mills|first=Evan|coauthors=Dale Sartor|title=Energy Use and Savings Potential for Laboratory Fume Hoods|journal=LBNL 55400|date=April 2006|url=http://evanmills.lbl.gov/pubs/pdf/fh_energy_full_report.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl]
The bulk of the energy that fume hoods are responsible for is the energy needed to heat and/or cool air delivered to the lab space. Depending on the type of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system installed, this energy can be electricity, natural gas, heating oil, coal, or other energy types. Additional electricity is consumed by fans in the HVAC system and fans in the fume hood exhaust system.[tpl]cite web|title=Lab Fume Hoods|url=http://www.colorado.edu/FacMan/about/conservation/FumeHoods.html|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder Facilities Management|accessdate=22 October 2012[/tpl]

==Behavioral programs to reduce fume hood energy use==

A number of colleges, universities, and other research institutions run or have run programs to encourage lab users to reduce fume hood energy consumption by keeping VAV sashes closed as much as possible. These programs typically use social marketing tactics such as placing stickers or magnets on VAV fume hoods to prompt users to keep them closed, providing feedback to lab users on the amount of energy consumed by fume hoods, and running competitions in which labs compete to see which building or lab can achieve the largest percent reduction in fume hood height or energy consumption. Organizations that have run behavior programs to reduce reduce fume hood energy use include:

==Calculating fume hood energy consumption==

Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has developed a Laboratory Fume Hood Energy Model that estimates annual fume hood energy use and costs for user-specified climates and assumptions about operation and equipment efficiencies.

==Maintenance==

Fume hood maintenance can involve daily, periodic, and annual inspections.
Exhaust fan maintenance, (i.e.,lubrication, belt tension, fan blade deterioration and rpm), shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation or as adjusted for appropriate hood function.
