Joseph "Erap" Ejército Estrada (born José Marcelo Ejército; April 19, 1937) is a Filipino politician who served as the thirteenth President of the Philippines from 1998 until 2001. Estrada was the first person in the present Fifth Republican period to be elected both President and Vice-President. He is currently the Mayor of the City of Manila, the country's capital, after the 2013 mid-term elections.http://www.philstar.com/election-2013/2013/05/14/942004/erap-wins-manila-mayoralty-race
Estrada gained popularity as a film actor, playing the lead role in over a hundred films in an acting career spanning some three decades. He used his popularity as an actor to make gains in politics, serving as mayor of San Juan for sixteen years, as Senator for one term, then as Vice-President under President Fidel V. Ramos.
Estrada was elected President in 1998 with a wide margin of votes separating him from the other challengers, and was sworn into the presidency on June 30, 1998. In 2000 he declared an "all-out-war" against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and captured its headquarters and other camps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |title=Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters |work=People's Daily |date=July 10, 2000 |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://hdn.org.ph/speech-of-former-president-estrada-on-the-grp-moro-conflict/ |title=Speech of Former President Estrada on the GRP-MORO Conflict – Philippine Human Development Network |publisher=Hdn.org.ph |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl] However, allegations of corruption spawned an impeachment trial in the Senate, and in 2001 Estrada was ousted by "People Power 2" after the prosecution walked out of the impeachment court when the Senator Judges voted no in the opening of the second envelope. The EDSA 2 protests resulted from the concerted efforts of political, business, military, and church elites who were displeased by Estrada's policies that included removal of sovereign guarantees on government contracts.President Joseph Ejercito Estrada.

Former First Gentleman Mike Arroyo also admitted in an interview with Nick Joaquin that he and then-Ilocos Sur Gov. Chavit Singson and certain military officials plotted plans to oust Estrada in January 2001, with the alternative plan B being violent "with orders to shoot.

In 2007, he was sentenced by the special division of the Sandiganbayan to reclusión perpetua for plunder, but was later granted pardon by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He ran for president again in the 2010 presidential election, but placed second behind Senator Benigno Aquino III.

==Early life and career==

Joseph Ejército Estrada was born on April 19, 1937 in Tondo, an urban district of Manila. His family later moved to the wealthy suburb of San Juan.[tpl]cite web|author=Biography |url=http://erap.ph/409/about-erap/ |title=Joseph "Erap" Ejercito Estrada – The Official Webpage of Joseph Ejercito Estrada » Biography |publisher=Erap.ph |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl] He belonged to an upper-middle-class family, and was the eighth of ten children of Emilio Ejército and his wife, María Marcelo.[tpl]cite book |title=...So Help Us God: The Vice Presidents of the Philippines and Their Inaugural Addresses |last=Malaya |first=J. Eduardo |coauthors=Nathan E. Malaya |year=2004 |publisher=Anvil Publishing |location=Pasig City |isbn=971-27-1487-X |pages=277–299 [/tpl] He was expelled during his primary studies at the Ateneo de Manila University and subsequently enrolled in an engineering course at the Mapúa Institute of Technology in an effort to please his father, but dropped out.
In his twenties, he began a career as a drama actor. He adopted the stage name "Joseph Estrada", as his mother objected to his chosen career and his decision to quit schooling. He also acquired the nickname "Erap" (a play on the Tagalog slang "pare", meaning 'buddy') from his friend, fellow actor Fernando Poe, Jr..

==Personal life==

Joseph Estrada is the first President to have previously worked in the entertainment industry, and for being the first to sport any sort of facial hair during his term, specifically his mustaches.

===Family===

Estrada is married to the former First Lady-turned-senator Dr. Luísa "Loi" Pimentel, whom he met while she was working at the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) in Mandaluyong City and has three children with her:
He also has nine children from several extramarital relationships:[ref]

===Other relatives===

Several of Ejercito's relatives became prominent figures in politics and showbiz.

===Film===

He played the lead role in more than 100 movies, and produced more than 70 films. He was the first FAMAS Hall of Fame recipient for Best Actor (1981) and also became a Hall of Fame award-winner as a producer (1983). He often played heroes of the lower classes, making him popular among several impoverished citizens. This proved advantageous to his political career.
In 1974 he founded the Movie Workers Welfare Foundation (Mowelfund), which helps filmmakers through medical reimbursements, hospitalization, surgery and death benefits, livelihood, and alternative income opportunities and housing. Its educational arm, the Mowelfund Film Institute, has produced some of the most skilled and respected producers, filmmakers, writers and performers in both the independent and mainstream sectors of the industry since its inception in 1979.Martinez-Belen, Crispina.

==Early political career==

===Mayor of San Juan===

Estrada entered politics in 1967 when he ran for mayor of San Juan, then a municipality of Metro Manila, and succeeded in only 1969 after winning an electoral protest against Braulio Sto. Domingo. His administration was marked by unequaled accomplishments in infrastructure development. These included the establishment of the first Municipal High School, the Agora complex, a modern slaughterhouse, a sprawling government center with a post office, a mini-park and the concreting of 98 percent of the town's roads and alleys.
As mayor, he paid particular attention to the elementary education of children by improving and renovating school buildings and constructing additional school structures, health centers, barangay halls and playgrounds in all the barangays and providing artesian wells to areas with low water supply. He relocated some 1,800 squatter families out of San Juan to Taytay, Rizal, at no cost. He was also the first mayor to computerize assessment of the Real Estate Tax in the Municipal Assessor’s Office.President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, A Biography[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] When Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986, all elected officials of the local government were forcibly removed and replaced by appointed officers-in-charge, including Estrada[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl].

===Senator of the Philippines===

The following year, he won a seat in the Senate under the Grand Alliance for Democracy (GAD) placing 16th in the elections (out of 24 winners). In 1987, he set his sights on a Senate run and handily garnered a seat. He was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Public Works. He was Vice-Chairman of the Committees on Health, Natural Resources and Ecology and Urban Planning.
In the Senate, Estrada was credited with the passage of, among other major pieces of legislation, the bills on irrigation project and the protection and propagation of carabaos, the beast of burden in the rural areas.
As a senator, he was one of the so-called “Magnificent 12” who voted to terminate the RP-US Military Bases Agreement leading to the withdrawal of American servicemen from the Clark Air Base in Pampanga and the Subic Naval Base in Zambales.
In 1989, the Free Press cited him as one of the Three Outstanding Senators of the Year. He was conferred the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa by the Bicol University in April 1997, and the University of Pangasinan in 1990.

==Vice-Presidency==

In 1992, Joseph Estrada initially ran for president with Vicente Rivera, Jr. as his running mate but he withdrew his bid and instead ran for vice-president as the running mate of Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. under the Nationalist People's Coalition. Though Cojuangco lost to former National Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, Estrada won the vice-presidency garnering more votes than his closest opponent, Ramon Mitra, Jr.'s running mate, Marcelo Fernan.
As Vice-President, Estrada he was the chairman of President Ramos' Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC). Estrada arrested criminal warlords and kidnapping syndicates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yehey.com/news/Article.aspx?id=181710 |title=The rise and fall of Joseph Estrada – Yehey!

In the same year Estrada, together with former President Corazon Aquino, Cardinal Jaime Sin, Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and other political leaders, led an anti-charter change rally brought in an estimated half a million people to Rizal Park against the charter change moves by Ramos and his supporters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/113427/Gloria-and-cha-cha |title=– Gloria and cha-cha – Research – Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs – Latest Philippine News – BETA |publisher=Gmanews.tv |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl]

==Presidency==

Estrada was inaugurated on June 30, 1998 in the historical town of Malolos in Bulacan province in paying tribute to the cradle of the First Philippine Republic. That afternoon the new president delivered his inaugural address at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta. He assumed office amid the Asian Financial Crisis and with agricultural problems due to poor weather conditions, thereby slowing the economic growth to −0.6% in 1998 from a 5.2% in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200020&Itemid=26 |title=Philippines : Gov.Ph : The Official Government Portal of the Republic of the Philippines – General Information |publisher=Gov.Ph |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl] The economy recovered by 3.4% in 1999 and 4% in 2000.Abaya, Antonio.

However, allegations of corruption spawned a railroaded impeachment trial in the Senate courtesy of house speaker Manuel Villar, and in 2001 Estrada was ousted from a coup after the trial was aborted.
In his Inaugural Address, Estrada said:

By the end of Estrada's administration, debt supposedly reached P 2.1 trillion in 1999. Domestic debt supposedly amounted to P 986.7 billion while foreign debt stood at US$ 52.2 billion.

===War against the MILF===

During the Ramos administration a cessation of hostilities agreement was signed between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in July 1997. This was continued by a series of peace talks and negotiations in Estrada administration. The MILF, an Islamic group formed in 1977, seeks to be an independent Islamic State from the Philippines, and, despite the agreements, a sequence of terrorist attacks on the Philippine military and civilians still continued. It was later divulged in a Senate Hearing by then Lt. (now Senator) Antonio Trillanes that the Military was behind these terrorist attacks to justify the "all-out-war" policy of the government which was masterminded by Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl], and which included the kidnapping a foreign priest, namely Father Luciano Benedetti; the destruction by arson of Talayan, Maguindanao's municipal hall; the takeover of the Kauswagan Municipal Hall; the bombing of the Lady of Mediatrix boat at Ozamiz City; and the takeover of the Narciso Ramos Highway[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]. By doing so, they inflicted severe damage on the country's image abroad, and scared much-needed investments away. For this reason, on
March 21, 2000, Estrada declared an "all-out-war" against the MILF. During the war the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) asked Estrada to negotiate a cease-fire with MILF, but Estrada opposed the idea arguing that a cease-fire would cause more terrorist attacks. For the next three months of the war, Camp Abubakar, headquarters of the MILF, fell along with other 13 major camps and 43 minor camps, and then all of which became under controlled by the government. The MILF leader Hashim Salamat fled to Malaysia. The MILF later declared a Jihad on the government. On July 10 of the same year, the President went to Minadanao and raised the Philippine flag symbolizing victory. After the war the President said, "... will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and lasting peace and development in Mindanao". In the middle of July the president ordered the military to arrest top MILF leaders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |title=Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters |work=People's Daily  |date=July 10, 2000 |accessdate=March 23, 2009[/tpl]
In his state of the nation address, popularly called "SONA", the president highlighted his vision for Mindanao:
In addition to this the president said his administration can move with more speed in transforming Mindanao into a progressive economic center. High on the list of priorities was the plight of MILF guerrillas who were tired of fighting and had no camps left to which to report. On October 5, 2000 the first massive surrender of 669 MILF mujahideen led by the renegade vice mayor of Marugong, Lanao del Sur Malupandi Cosandi Sarip and seven other battalion commanders, surrendered to President Estrada at the 4th ID headquarters in Camp Edilberto Evangelista, Bgy. Patag, Cagayan de Oro City. They were followed shortly by a second batch of 855 surrenderees led by MILF Commander Sayben Ampaso on December 29, 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/8068 |title=American Chronicle, "AFP-MILF 2000 War in Mindanao Remembered" |publisher=Americanchronicle.com |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl]

===Controversies===

===Corruption charges and impeachment===

In October 2000, Ilocos Sur governor Luis "Chavit" Singson, a close friend of the President, alleged that he had personally given Estrada P400 million as payoff from jueteng, a grassroots-based numbers game, hidden in a bank account known as "Jose Velarde" , as well as P180 million from the government price subsidy for the tobacco farmers' marketing cooperative after Estrada ordered a full blown investigation into Chavit Singson's alleged misuse of millions of pesos in public funds. Singson's allegation caused controversy across the nation, which culminated in the House of Representatives' filing of an impeachment case against Estrada on November 13, 2000. House Speaker Manny Villar fast-tracked the impeachment complaint. The impeachment suit was brought to the Senate and an impeachment court was formed, with Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. as presiding officer. Estrada, pleaded “not guilty”.
This was the first time the Filipino public witnessed, through radio and television, an elected president stand in trial and face possible impeachment with full media coverage. During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses and alleged evidences to the impeachment court regarding Estrada's alleged involvement in jueteng. The existence of secret bank accounts which he allegedly uses for receiving payoffs was also brought to the fore.
In the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Estrada made into the list of the World's All-Time Most Corrupt Leaders in the World. He was listed tenth and he was said to have amassed between $78 million to $80 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004.|accessdate=August 6, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=August 6, 2009[/tpl] Also making it to the list from the Philippines is Ferdinand Marcos,who ended up second in the list as he was said to have embezzled between $5 billion to $10 billion during his 21 years as President from 1965-1986.

===EDSA II===

====Protests====

On the evening of January 16, 2001, the impeachment court voted not to open an envelope that was alleged to contain incriminating evidence against the president simply because it was not part of the impeachment complaint. The final vote was 11–10, in favor of keeping the envelope closed. The prosecution panel (of congressmen and lawyers) walked out of the Impeachment Court in protest of this vote. The 11 senators who voted not to open the envelope are known as the "Craven Eleven." That night, anti-Estrada protesters gathered in front of the EDSA Shrine at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, not too far away from the site of the 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos.
On January 19, 2001, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes, seeing the political upheaval throughout the country, "decided to withdraw his support" from the president and transfer his allegiance to the vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

====Resignation====

The following day, the Supreme Court declared that the seat of presidency was vacant, saying that Estrada had constructively resigned his post. At noon, the Chief Justice swore in Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president of the Philippines. Before Estrada's departure from Malacañang, he issued the following press release:

==Post-Presidency==

Estrada returned to his old home in San Juan. He maintained that he never resigned, implying that Arroyo's government was illegitimate.
The new government created a special court and charged him with plunder and had him arrested in April. Filipino supporters marched to the EDSA Shrine demanding Estrada's release and his reinstatement as president but were dispersed by high-grade teargas and warning shots from automatic rifles. On the morning of May 1, the protesters marched straight to Malacañan Palace. Violence erupted and the government declared a State of Rebellion. Many Filipino protesters were badly injured and arrested, including politicians. The government called out the military and was able to quell the demonstration with teargas and automatic rifles. The bloody uprising came to be known as EDSA III.
Estrada was initially detained at the Veteran's Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City and then transferred to a military facility in Tanay, Rizal, but he was later transferred to a nearby vacation home, virtually in house arrest. Under Philippine law, plunder had a maximum penalty of death, however the death penalty was eventually repealed.

===Trial===

On September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan finally gave its decision, finding Estrada not guilty on his perjury case but guilty of plunder "beyond reasonable doubt." He was sentenced to Reclusión perpetua. He was thus the first Philippine President who was impeached and then convicted."Erap guilty of plunder, sentenced to reclusion perpetua", gmanews.tv, September 12, 2007.
On September 26, 2007, Joseph Estrada appealed by filing a 63-page motion for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan judgment penned by Teresita de Castro (submitting 5 legal grounds).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder |title=Monstersandcritics.com, Philippines' ex-president Estrada appeals conviction for plunder |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6271706.html |title=English.people.com, Convicted Philippine ex-president files reconsideration motion |work=People's Daily  |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl] Estrada alleged that the court erred "when it convicted him by acquitting his alleged co-conspirators."[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90841 |title=Inquirer.net, Estrada asks Sandiganbayan to reverse conviction, Cites acquittal of co-accused |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl]
On October 5, 2007, the Sandiganbayan's Special Division ruled to have set for October 19, oral argument (instead of a defense reply) on Joseph Estrada’s motion for reconsideration.

===Perjury case===

The Sandiganbayan's special division, on June 27, 2008, ordered Estrada to file comment within 10 days, on the motion of the Ombudsman's Special Prosecutor to re-open the trial of his perjury case regarding 1999 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN). The court will also resolve Banco de Oro's (formerly Equitable PCI Bank), plea that it cannot determine "without hazard to itself" who to turn over to the P1.1 billion Jose Velarde assets due to claims by Wellex Group / William Gatchalian and a Bureau of Internal Revenue stay order.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080627-145167/Estrada-told-to-reply-to-request-to-start-perjury-trial |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Estrada told to reply to request to start perjury trial |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl]

===Pardon and release from detention===

On October 22, 2007, Acting Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera stated that Joseph Estrada is seeking a “full, free, and unconditional pardon” from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Estrada's lawyer Jose Flaminiano wrote Arroyo: "The time has come to end President Estrada's fight for justice and vindication before the courts. Today Monday, we filed a withdrawal of his Motion for Reconsideration." Estrada, 70, stressed the "delicate condition" of his mother in asking for pardon.IHT, Ousted Philippine president withdraws appeal for his plunder conviction, seeks pardon[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl]
On October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted executive clemency to Joseph Estrada based on the recommendation by the Department of Justice (DoJ). Acting Executive Secretary and Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye quoted the signed Order: "In view hereof in pursuant of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant Executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua.
