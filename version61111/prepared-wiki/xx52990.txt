[[Zanbatō]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional Japanese swords, Anime and manga weapons

[tpl]nihongo|Zanbatō|斬馬刀[/tpl], an especially large, curved type of fictional sword used by characters in Japanese anime and manga. Books written about nihonto (traditional Japanese swords) make no references to zanbatō as being actual swords used in feudal Japan. The name zanbatō literally translates to "horse-slaying sword" or "horse-chopping saber".  Replicas of zanbatō swords can be found for sale in tourist shops and stands in Japan. Extremely long Zanbatō type swords existed in Japan as in the nodachi or ōdachi; these swords, along with the phonetically similar zhan ma dao Chinese sword, may have been the inspiration for the creation of Zanbatō as an anime and manga weapon.

==Chinese zhǎn mǎ dāo==

A Chinese anti-cavalry weapon of the Song Dynasty written also as 斬馬刀 (zhǎn mǎ dāo) is of similar proportion to a Zanbatō, although it differs in form. Surviving examples include a sword that might resemble a nagamaki in construction; it had a wrapped handle 37 cm (15 in) long, like the Zanbatō. However, the blade differed, having only a slight curve in the last half, whereas the Zanbatō's curve stretches the length of the blade and handle, similar to a katana.

==Zanbatō in modern fiction==

The fictional interpretation of the weapon consists of a large, wide blade attached to an extended, pole-like hilt. The sword, and variations of it, are used by many characters in anime and video games. These interpretations often simply depict the weapon as an oversized sword or being imbued with magical properties. However, the weapon which most closely resembles such instances is the eku, or "wooden oar".
