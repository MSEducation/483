Year 450 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Second year of the decemviri (or, less frequently, year 304 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 450 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
