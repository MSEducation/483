Uarbryichthys ("Uarbry Fish") is a genus of primitive teleost ray-finned fish from fossil beds near the Talbragar River Bed.  It was a genus of lake-dwelling fish that lived during the Upper Jurassic.  When alive, it would have had a superficial resemblance to a very small porgie, or sea bream, but with a heterocercal tail fin.
