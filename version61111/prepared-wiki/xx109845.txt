===Toronto Star===

Zerbisias joined the Toronto Star in 1989. She was assigned to the Montreal bureau in 1991. In 1993, she returned to Toronto and became a media critic. She won the 1996 National Newspaper Award for critical writing for her columns about magazines; the award noting that Zerbisias "is not one to mince with words as she focuses on the subject matter at hand. She proceeds to give us her insights, analysis and critique not only with rhetorical, stylistic and intellectual rigor, but with gusto and passion, a rare commodity in today's bland politically correct journalism." In 1997, she became TV critic and then, in 2003, was appointed media columnist.
Zerbisias' blog for the Star, Azerbic http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/ effectively went on hiatus in August 2006 and ceased publishing the following December. She continued as media critic until June 2007, when she became the social issues and cultural affairs columnist at the Toronto Star. In January 2008, she launched a new blog, with a focus on feminist issues, for The Toronto Star, Broadsides http://thestar.blogs.com/broadsides/.
In April 2010, she ended her regular column to become a feature writer at the Toronto Star.http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/04/21/jonathan-kay-canadas-left-loses-another-radical-voice/

===Disputes===

While focussing on entertainment, media and cultural issues for the bulk of her career[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/authors.zerbisias_antonia.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star[/tpl] Zerbisias has also taken positions in regards to the Middle East including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Iraq War. In 2009, on Twitter, she used Twitter to take issue with former Minister of Justice (Canada) Irwin Cotler who, as a keynote speaker at a Stand With Us event at Israel's Bar-Ilan University, boasted about his children enlisting in the Israeli military and asked "Which country are you loyal to, sir?"Israel on the brain, by Jonathan Kay, National Post, September 22, 2009. In the same year, she mocked Bernie Farber, then CEO of the Canadian Jewish Congress, in her blog for wearing a "Nobody knows I'm gay" t-shirt while marching in Toronto's Pride parade in a protest against the inclusion of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid in the march after he had said that political groups do not belong in the Pride parade.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/article/668141 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=T-shirts and sexual orientation | date=July 18, 2009[/tpl]"Bernie Farber is not gay" by Corvin Russell, Canadian Dimension, July 12, 2009 Zerbisias commented on Farber's decision to march as itself being a political act by sardonically writing on her blog, "Imagine my surprise when I saw Bernie Farber identifying himself as queer by joining a pro-Israel gay rights group in the parade."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/opinion/2009/07/11/gay_blog_post_was_just_not_fair.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star[/tpl] The Canadian Jewish Congress responded by filing a complaint with the Toronto Star against Zerbisias for allegedly "outing" Farber."I’d like to reply to that Editor’s Note", Mark Steyn, Macleans Magazine, May 6, 2010 The Star's public editor, Kathy English, ruled that Zerbisias’ comments “fell short of the Star’s standards of fairness, accuracy and civility,” and promised to rein in journalists who “put the Star in a negative light.” Readers lamented the Toronto Star's sudden lack of humour and appreciation for one of its own columnists. "Imagine if top-notch cartoonist Theo Moudakis had penned a cartoon expressing the same thing. Would the Star have griped? I think not," suggested a Star reader.
English acknowledged that her ruling had elicited widespread criticism and subsequently modified her assessment and criticized Farber and the Canadian Jewish Congress since in their complaint they did not "think to tell me that Farber, along with dozens of others who marched with the Kulanu group, had worn a T-shirt that made its own ironic quip. That's context I sure wish I had known" and conceded that Zerbisias' comment "was intended as sarcastic irony, stock in trade for this columnist and blogger. But I think her attempt at irony failed here; the quip – as published without that context – was ambiguous and could be misunderstood",[tpl]cite news|title=Old principles and new media|url=http://www.thestar.com/opinion/2009/07/18/old_principles_and_new_media.html|accessdate=September 10, 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 18, 2009[/tpl] adding "To be fair to Zerbisias, it should be made clear, though, that she did not 'make things up,' as Farber interpreted it."
Zerbisias was an early advocate of broadcasting by Al-Jazeera in Canada.Let Al-Jazeera Broadcast Here, by Antonia Zerbisias, Toronto Star, August 28, 2003.
