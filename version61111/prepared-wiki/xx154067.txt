Tella ([tpl]lang-om|farso[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ti|suwa[/tpl]) (Ge'ez ሰዋ "säwa")  is a traditional beer from Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is brewed from various grains (typically teff and maize, although in some regions barley, millet, or sorghum may be used) and gesho, a local plant used in a similar manner to hops. Tella is often home-brewed.
