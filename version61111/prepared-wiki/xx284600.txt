Ponte Duca d'Aosta is a bridge that links the Lungotevere Flaminio to Piazza Lauro De Bosis, in Rome (Italy), in the Flaminio and Della Vittoria quarters.

==Description==

The bridge, dedicated to Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy-Aosta, 2nd Duke of Aosta, was designed by architect Vincenzo Fasolo; the building started in 1939 and the inauguration took place in 1942.
The reinforced concrete bridge has a single arch and is 220 m (722 ft) long and 30 m (98 ft) wide; at the two extremities are placed two pairs of shafts, whose façades are decorated with high-relieves by Tuscan sculptor Vico Consorti, illustrating war scenes on the rivers Isonzo, Tagliamento, Sile and Adige.
