Ayres sent the script to Robert Altman and then Hal Ashby. Ayres remembers, "I thought that this was a picture that required a skewed perspective, and that's what Hal had".Biskind 1998, p. 175. Ashby was coming off the disappointing commercial and critical failure of Harold and Maude and was in pre-production on Three Cornered Circle at MGM when Jack Nicholson told him about The Last Detail, his upcoming film at Columbia.Dawson 2009, pp. 136â€“7. The director had actually been sent the script in the fall of 1971 and the reader's report called it "lengthy and unimaginative", but he now found it very appealing.Dawson 2009, p. 136. He wanted to do it but it conflicted with his schedule for Three Cornered Circle. However Ashby pulled out of his deal with MGM and Nicholson suggested that they team up on Last Detail.Dawson 2009, p. 137. Columbia did not like Ashby because he had a reputation of distrusting authority and made little effort to communicate with executives. The budget was low enough, at $2.6 million, for him to get approved.

===Casting===

Nicholson was set to play Buddusky and so the casting of The Last Detail focused mainly on the roles of Mule and Meadows. Bud Cort met with Ashby and begged to play Meadows but the director felt that he was not right for the role.Dawson 2009, p. 139. Casting director Lynn Stalmaster gave Ashby a final selection of actors and the two that stood out were Randy Quaid and John Travolta. As originally written, the character of Meadows was a "helpless little guy", but Ashby wanted to cast Quaid, who was 6'4".[ref]
