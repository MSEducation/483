[[KV42]]

CATEGORIES: 15th-century BC architecture, Valley of the Kings

Tomb KV42 is located in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. It was constructed for Hatshepsut-Meryetre, the wife of Thutmose III, but she was not buried in the tomb. It was reused by Sennefer, a mayor of Thebes during the reign of Amenhotep II, and by several members of his family. The tomb has a cartouche-shaped burial chamber, like other early Eighteenth Dynasty tombs.
