Los Hornos is a distinct neighbourhood ("barrio") of La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Formerly a detached population, it belongs now to the Greater La Plata urban conglomerate. Its name (Spanish for "The Brick Ovens" or "The Furnaces") refers to the several brick factories that were located in the area at the end of the 19th century, and which supplied the bricks for many of the buildings in the nascent city of La Plata. The area was heavily settled by Italian immigrants, and became renowned for its many family orchards. The "barrio" retains until today a distinct personality and atmosphere within La Plata.
Within its jurisdiction over the municipal cemetery, local landmark protection, and the Parish St. Benjamin.
