[[Malicious Software Removal Tool]]

CATEGORIES: Microsoft software, Spyware removal, 2005 software

Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is a freely-distributed virus removal tool developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows operating system. First released on January 13, 2005, it is an on-demand anti-virus tool ("on-demand" meaning it lacks real-time protection) that scans the computer for specific widespread malware and tries to eliminate the infection. It is automatically distributed to Microsoft Windows computers via Windows Update service but can also be separately downloaded.[ref]

The program is usually updated on the second Tuesday of every month and distributed via Windows Update, at which point it runs once automatically in the background and reports if malicious software is found. Alternatively, users can manually download this tool from Microsoft Download Center. It records its results in a log file located at %windir%\debug\mrt.log. To run it manually at other times, users can start "mrt.exe" using the Command Prompt or Run command in the Start Menu. With Windows 2000 going out of support in July 2010, Microsoft stopped distributing the MSRT tool to Windows 2000 users via Windows Update. Download and usage of the current versions up to 4.20 (May 2013) was still possible; however, starting with version 5.1 (June 2013) Windows 2000 is not supported anymore.
As released, the tool is configured to report anonymized data about infections to Microsoft if any are detected. The reporting behavior is disclosed in the tool's EULA, and can be disabled if desired.[ref]

In a June 2006 Microsoft report, the company claimed that the tool had removed 16 million instances of malicious software from 5.7 million of 270 million total unique Windows computers since its release in January 2005. The report also stated that, on average, the tool removes malicious software from 1 in every 311 computers on which it runs. As of [tpl]date|May 19, 2009[/tpl] Microsoft claims that the software has removed password stealer threats from 859,842 machines.[ref]

In August 2013, the Malicious Software Removal Tool deleted old, vulnerable versions of the Tor client, in order to end the spread of the Sefnit botnet (which mined for bitcoins without the host owner's approval and later engaged in click fraud.) Approximately two million hosts had been cleaned by October,[tpl]cite web|last=McHugh |first=Molly |url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/tor-botnet-microsoft-malware-remove/ |title=Microsoft's secret battle against the Tor botnet |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2297027/microsoft-uncovers-sefnit-trojan-return-after-groupon-click-fraud-scam |title=Microsoft uncovers Sefnit Trojan return after Groupon click-fraud scam - IT News from |publisher=V3.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Name |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2014/01/09/tackling-the-sefnit-botnet-tor-hazard.aspx |title=Tackling the Sefnit botnet Tor hazard - Microsoft Malware Protection Center - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl] although this was slightly less than half of the estimated infections, the rest of the suspected machines presumably not having their automatic Windows Updates enabled or manually run.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/news/home/-/blogs/7924054 |title=Microsoft Takes Aim at Tor-Distributed Botnet - Computing Now | Newsfeed - IEEECS |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl]
