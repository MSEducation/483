Pennsylvania Route 27 (PA 27) is a [tpl]convert|65.7|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] state highway located in northwest Pennsylvania. The western terminus of the route is at Park Avenue near U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 19 in Meadville. The eastern terminus is at Pennsylvania Route 69 three miles (5 km) south of Sugar Grove.

==History==

From 1927 to 1928, PA 27 between U.S. Route 322 in Meadville and US 6 in the Pittsfield Township community of Pittsfield was known as the western segment of Pennsylvania Route 47. In 1928, west PA 47 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 27.
In April 2003, the western terminus of the route was moved from US 6 and US 19 to Park Avenue, which had been the western terminus of PA 27 from 1928 to 1974.  However, west of Park Avenue, PA 27 is still signed along North St. Market St., Terrace St and Reynolds Ave. to connect with US 6 and US 19.
