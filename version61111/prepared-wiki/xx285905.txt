Project Phoenix is an upcoming indie game being developed by Creative Intelligence Arts. A squad-based real-time strategy video game combined with strong Japanese role-playing game design influence, the project is being described as Kickstarter's first Japan-based video game project.
The development team, self-described as "featuring AAA talent", includes former Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and Kiyoshi Arai, an artist for Final Fantasy XII and XIV. Violinist Hiroaki Yura will serve as the game's director and producer, while L.A. Noire QA analyst Vaughan Smith will be the game and battle designer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/08/09/project-phoenix-jrpg-to-hit-kickstarter-nobuo-uematsu-composing-soundtrack/|title=Project Phoenix JRPG to hit Kickstarter, Nobuo Uematsu composing soundtrack|publisher=VG247|date=9 August 2013|accessdate=28 August 2013|last=Cook|first=Dave[/tpl] The project was hoping to gather $100,000 through Kickstarter by September 2013, eventually succeeding in raising over ten times this amount.
