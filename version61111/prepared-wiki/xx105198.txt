id Tech 2,  popularly known as the ''Quake II'' engine,id Software Wants To Shorten Dev Cycles - IndustryGamersid Software looking to shorten dev cycles, stop building new engines for every game | Joystiq upgraded from  Quake engine is a game engine developed by id Software for use in their games, most notably Quake II. Since its release, the Quake II engine has been licensed for use in several other games.
One of the engine's most notable features was out-of-the-box support for hardware-accelerated graphics, specifically OpenGL, along with the traditional software renderer.
Another interesting feature was the subdivision of some of the components into dynamic-link libraries. This allowed both software and OpenGL renderers, which were switched between by loading and unloading separate libraries.
Libraries were also used for the game logic, for two reasons:
The level format, as with previous id Software engines, used BSP. The levels were lit through a lightmap method, in which light data for each surface is precalculated (this time, via a radiosity method) and stored as an image in the level file, which is then used to determine how much lighting intensity each model should receive, but not its direction.
