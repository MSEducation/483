Biafra, officially the Republic of Biafra, was a secessionist state in south-eastern Nigeria that existed from 30 May 1967 to 15 January 1970, taking its name from the Bight of Biafra (the Atlantic bay to its south).[tpl]cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites |year=2006 |publisher= McFarland & Company|isbn= 0-7864-2248-3|page=58[/tpl] The inhabitants were mostly the Igbo people who led the secession due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. The creation of the new state that was pushing for recognition was among the causes of the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Nigerian-Biafran War.
The state was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Zambia. Other nations which did not give official recognition but which did provide support and assistance to Biafra included Israel, France, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa and Vatican City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawodu.com/omoigui25.htm|author=Nowa Omoigui|title=Federal Nigerian Army Blunders of the Nigerian Civil War – Part 2|accessdate=15 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080719145355/http://www.dawodu.com/omoigui25.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Biafra also received aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland, Caritas International, MarkPress and U.S. Catholic Relief Services.
After two-and-a-half years of war, during which a million civilians had died in fighting and from famine, Biafran forces agreed to a ceasefire with the Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG), and Biafra was reintegrated into Nigeria.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/596712.stm|author=Barnaby Philips|title=Biafra: Thirty years on|accessdate=9 March 2011|work=BBC News|date=13 January 2000[/tpl]

==History==

===Secession===

In 1960, Nigeria became independent of the United Kingdom. As with many other new African states, the borders of the country did not reflect earlier ethnic boundaries. Thus the northern Sudan and Sahelian Savannah region of the country is made up of Muslim majority, while the southern population was predominantly Christian and Animist. Furthermore, Nigeria's oil, its primary source of income, was located in the south of the country.
Following independence, Nigeria was divided primarily along ethnic lines with Hausa and Fulani in the north, Yoruba in the south-west, Ijaws in the south and Igbo in the south-east.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/596712.stm|title=Biafra: Thirty years on|date=13 January 2000|work=The BBC|author=Barnaby Philips | accessdate=1 January 2010[/tpl] In January 1966, a group of primarily eastern Igbo led a military coup during which 30 political leaders including Nigeria's Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and the Northern premier, Sir Ahmadu Bello were killed. The President who is of Igbo extraction (Nnamdi Azikiwe) and the premier of south-eastern part of the country were not killed.

In July 1966 northern officers and army units staged a counter-coup. Muslim officers named a Christian from a small ethnic group (the Anga) in central Nigeria, General Yakubu "Jack" Gowon, as the head of the Federal Military Government (FMG). The two coups deepened Nigeria's ethnic tensions. In September 1966, approximately 30,000 Igbo were killed in the north, and some Northerners were killed in backlashes in eastern cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/bravo/biafra1967.htm|date=16 December 2000|title=Biafran Secession: Nigeria 1967–1970|work=Armed Conflict Events Database[/tpl]
[tpl]Quote box|quote=Now, therefore, I, Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Military Governor of Eastern Nigeria, by virtue of the authority, and pursuant to the principles, recited above, do hereby solemnly proclaim that the territory and region known as and called Eastern Nigeria together with her continental shelf and territorial waters shall henceforth be an independent sovereign state of the name and title of "The Republic of Biafra".|source=Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citizensfornigeria.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=63|title=Ojukwu's Declaration of Biafra Speech |work=Citizens for Nigeria|accessdate=15 August 2008[/tpl]|width=420px[/tpl]
In January 1967, the military leaders and senior police officials of each region met in Aburi, Ghana and agreed on a loose confederation of regions. The Northerners were at odds with the Aburi Accord; Obafemi Awolowo, the leader of the Western Region warned that if the Eastern Region seceded, the Western Region would also, which persuaded the northerners.
After the federal and eastern governments failed to reconcile, on 26 May the Eastern region voted to secede from Nigeria. On 30 May, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the Eastern Region's military governor, announced the Republic of Biafra, citing the Easterners killed in the post-coup violence. The large amount of oil in the region created conflict, as oil was a major component of the Nigerian economy.[tpl]cite web|work=American University|title=ICE Case Studies|date=November 1997|url=http://www.american.edu/ted/ice/biafra.htm[/tpl] The Eastern region was very ill equipped for war, out-manned, and out-gunned by the military of the remainder of Nigeria.

===War===

The FMG launched "police measures" to annex the Eastern Region on 6 July 1967. The FMG's initial efforts were unsuccessful;
the Biafrans successfully launched their own offensive, occupying areas in the Mid-Western Region in August 1967. By October 1967,
the FMG had regained the land after intense fighting.[tpl]cite news|work=BBC|title=On This Day (30 June)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/30/newsid_3733000/3733321.stm| date=30 June 1969 | accessdate=1 January 2010[/tpl] In September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the "final offensive". Initially the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops. In the latter stages, a Southern FMG offensive managed to break through the fierce resistance.
On 30 June 1969, the Nigerian government banned all Red Cross aid to Biafra; two weeks later it allowed medical supplies through the front line, but restricted food supplies. Later in October 1969, Ojukwu appealed to the United Nations to mediate a cease-fire. The federal government called for Biafra's surrender. In December, the FMG managed to cut Biafra in half, primarily by the efforts of 3 Marine Commando Division of the Nigerian Army, led by then Colonel Benjamin Adekunle, popularly called "The Black Scorpion", and later by Olusegun Obasanjo. Ojukwu fled to Côte d'Ivoire, leaving his chief of staff, Philip Effiong, to act as the "officer administering the government". Effiong called for a cease-fire 12 January and submitted to the FMG. More than one million people had died in battle or from starvation.[ref][tpl]cite news|work=New York Times|title= Few Traces of the Civil War Linger in Biafra |author=James Brooke|date=14 July 1987|accessdate=15 August 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71E39F937A25754C0A961948260[/tpl]

==Geography==

Enclosed in Biafra's borders were over [tpl]convert|29848|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of land;[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: S-Z |first=James |last=Minahan |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=0-313-32384-4 |page=762 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=K94wQ9MF2JsC&pg=PA762[/tpl] the land borders were shared with Nigeria to the north and Cameroon to the east. Its coast was on the Gulf of Guinea in the south.
The former country's southeast borders the Benue Hills and mountains that lead to Cameroon. Two rivers flow from Biafra into the Gulf of Guinea: the Cross River and the Niger River.[tpl]cite web|work=Britannica|title= Nigeria |accessdate=17 August 2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414840/Nigeria#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Nigeria%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080630061900/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414840/Nigeria| archivedate= 30 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Climate===

Biafra has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons, dry and rainy. From April to October the rainy season takes place, with heavy rain and high humidity. The heaviest rain occurs between June and July with up to [tpl]convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain. The temperature of the region on a clear day is 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) high and 22 degrees Celsius (71.6 degrees Fahrenheit) low. The dry season starts in November and ends in April. The lowest rain level [tpl]convert|16|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in February. The temperature at night reaches 20 °C (68 °F) and in the day has a peak temperature of 36 °C (96.8 °F).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.igboguide.org/index.php?l=chapter2|title=Igbo insight guide to Enugu and Igboland's Culture and Language[/tpl]

==Language==

The English language is spoken throughout Nigeria and carried on into the new state of Biafra. 
The predominant language of Biafra was Igbo. Along with Igbo there were a variety of other different languages, including Efik and Ibibio.

==Economy==

An early institution created by the Biafran government was the Bank of Biafra, accomplished under "Decree No. 3 of 1967".[tpl]cite journal|last=Symes|first=Peter|year=1997|title=The Bank Notes of Biafra|journal=International Bank Note Society Journal|volume=36|issue=4|url=http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/biafra.htm |accessdate=17 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080827224301/http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/biafra.htm| archivedate= 27 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The bank carried out all central banking functions including the administration of foreign exchange and the management of the public debt of the Republic. The bank was administered by a governor and four directors; the first governor, who signes on bank notes, was Sylvester Ugoh.[tpl]cite web|last=Ivwurie |first=Dafe |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102280439.html |title=Nigeria: The Men Who May Be President (1) |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl] A second decree, "Decree No. 4 of 1967", modified the Banking Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Republic of Biafra.
The bank was first located in Enugu, but due to the ongoing war, the bank was relocated several times.
Biafra attempted to finance the war through foreign exchange. After Nigeria announced their currency would no longer be legal tender (to make way for a new currency), this effort increased. After the announcement, tons of Nigerian bank notes were transported in an effort to acquire foreign exchange. The currency of Biafra had been the Nigerian pound, until the Bank of Biafra started printing out its own notes, the Biafran pound. The new currency went public on 28 January 1968, and the Nigerian pound was not accepted as an exchange unit. The first issue of the bank notes included only 5 shillings notes and 1 pound notes. The Bank of Nigeria exchanged only 30 pounds for an individual and 300 pounds for enterprises in the second half of 1968.
In 1969 new notes were introduced: £10, £5, £1, 10/- and 5/-.
It is estimated that a total of £115–140 million Biafran pounds were in circulation by the end of the conflict, with a population of about 14 million, approximately £10 per person.

==Military==

At the beginning of the war Biafra had 3,000 soldiers, but at the end of the war the soldiers totaled 30,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canit.se/~griffon/aviation/text/biafra.htm|title=Operation Biafra Babies|accessdate=19 August 2008[/tpl] There was no official support for the Biafran army by another nation throughout the war, although arms were clandestinely acquired. Because of the lack of official support, the Biafrans manufactured many of their weapons locally. A number of Europeans served in the Biafran cause; German born Rolf Steiner was a Lt. Colonel assigned to the 4th Commando Brigade and Welshman Taffy Williams served as a Major until the very end of the conflict."The Last Adventurer" by Steiner, Rolf (Boston:, Little, Brown 1978)
The Biafrans managed to set up a small yet effective air force. The BAF commanders were Chude Sokey and later Godwin Ezeilo, who had trained with the Royal Canadian Air Force.Air Enthusiast No. 65 September–October 1996 pp40-47 article by Vidal, Joao M. Texans in Biafra T-6Gs in use in the Nigerian Civil War Early inventory included two B-25 Mitchells, one  B-26 Invader (piloted by Polish WWII ace Jan Zumbach, known also as John Brown), a converted DC-3 and one Dove.  In 1968 the Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen suggested the MiniCOIN project to General Ojukwu. By the spring of 1969, Biafra had assembled five MFI-9Bs in Gabon, calling them "Biafra Babies". They were coloured green, were able to carry six 68 mm anti-armour rockets under each wing and had simple sights. The six aeroplanes were flown by three Swedish pilots and three Biafran pilots. In September 1969, Biafra acquired four ex-Armee de l'Air North American T-6Gs, which were flown successfully to Biafra the following month, with another aircraft lost on the ferry flight. These aircraft flew missions until January 1970, flown by Portuguese ex-military pilots.

==Legacy==

The international humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières ("Doctors Without Borders") came out of the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.Bortolotti, Dan (2004). Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders, Firefly Books. ISBN 1-55297-865-6.
In their book, Smallpox and its Eradication, Fenner and colleagues describe how vaccine supply shortages during the Biafra smallpox campaign led to the development of the focal vaccination technique, later adopted worldwide by the World Health Organization, which led to the early and cost effective interruption of smallpox transmission in west Africa and elsewhere.
On 29 May 2000, the Lagos Guardian newspaper reported that the now ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo commuted to retirement the dismissal of all military persons who fought for the breakaway state of Biafra during Nigeria's 1967–1970 civil war. In a national broadcast, he said the decision was based on the belief that "justice must at all times be tempered with mercy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://iys.cidi.org/humanitarian//irin/wafrica/00a/0021.html |title=Site cidi.org |publisher=Iys.cidi.org |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]
Violence between Christians and Muslims (usually Hausa or Fulani Muslims and various Christian ethnic groups) has been incessant since the end of the civil war in 1970.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
In July 2006 the Center for World Indigenous Studies reported that government sanctioned killings were taking place in the southeastern city of Onitsha, because of a shoot-to-kill policy directed toward Biafran loyalists, particularly members of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cwis.org/news/index.php?newsdate=biafra1 |title=Emerging Genocide in Nigeria |publisher=Cwis.org |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cwis.org/fweye/fweye-18.htm |title=Chronicles of brutality in Nigeria 2000–2006 |publisher=Cwis.org |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]
In 2010, researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and University of Nigeria, Nsukka, showed that Igbos born in Biafra during the years of the famine were of higher risk of suffering from overweight, hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism compared to controls born a short period after the famine had ended. The findings are in line with the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis suggesting that malnutrition in early life is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes later in life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013582 |title=Hypertension, Diabetes and Overweight: Looming Legacies of the Biafran Famine, PLoS ONE |publisher=Plosone.org |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]Nigeria: Those Born During Biafra Famine Are Susceptible to Obesity, Study Finds.

==Movement to re-secede==

The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) advocates a separate country for the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria. They accuse the state of marginalising the Igbo people. MASSOB says it is a peaceful group and advertises a 25-stage plan to achieve its goal peacefully.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2006/07/12/dream_of_free_biafra_revives_in_southeast_nigeria/|title=Dream of free Biafra revives in southeast Nigeria|author=Estelle Shirbon|date=12 July 2006|agency=Reuters[/tpl] There are two arms to the government, the Biafra Government in Exile and Biafra Shadow Government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://biafra.cwis.org/news20090413.php |title=Biafra News – 04.13.2009 |publisher=Biafra.cwis.org |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl] The Nigerian government accuses MASSOB of violence; MASSOB's leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, was arrested in 2005 and is being detained on treason charges; MASSOB is calling for his release. MASSOB is also championing the release of oil militant Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is facing similar charges. In 2009, The MASSOB launched "the Biafran International Passport" in response to persistent demand by Biafrans in diaspora.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2009/07/01/massob-launches-biafran-intl-passport-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary/comment-page-2/ |title=MASSOB launches "Biafran Int'l Passport" to celebrate 10th anniversary |publisher=Vanguardngr.com |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]

==Meaning of "Biafra" and location==

Little is known about the literal meaning of the word Biafra. It is part of the Igbo language. It is clear that the origin of the word Biafra has a relationship to "Bia", the Igbo word for "Come". The word Biafra most likely derives from the subgroup Biafar or Biafada[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bif|title=Biafada: A language of Guinea-Bissau[/tpl] of the Tenda ethnic group who reside primarily in Guinea-Bissau.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=PU&rop3=101403|title=The Joshua Project: Biafada, Biafar of Guinea-Bissau[/tpl] Manuel Álvares (1526–1583), a Portuguese Jesuit educator, in his work "Ethiopia Minor and a geographical account of the Province of Sierra Leone", writes about the "Biafar heathen" in chapter 13 of the same book.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/AfricaFocus/AfricaFocus-idx?type=article&did=AFRICAFOCUS.ALVARES01.I0019&id=AfricaFocus.Alvares01&isize=M|title=Manuel Álvares, Chapter 13: The Biafar Heathen[/tpl] The word Biafar thus appears to have been a common word in the Portuguese language back in the 16th century.
