As Hays and Raymond were now both dead, emotions were cooler. In May 1867, the “Union of 1867” was signed formally uniting both organizations..." His later tenure as Grand Sovereign Commander of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite was marked by a schism in 1860 which resulted in two competing organizations which both claimed legitimacy. This schism was eventually resolved in 1867, after Raymond's death.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/tabbert2.html | title=FROM A POINT TO A LINE: TWENTY SOVEREIGN GRAND COMMANDERS | author=Tabbert, Mark A. | date=Sep 2003[/tpl]
