Portland Inlet is an inlet of the Pacific Ocean on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, approximately 55 kilometers north of Prince Rupert, British Columbia.  It joins the Chatham Sound opposite the Dixon Entrance.  It is 40 kilometers long and as much as 13 kilometers wide.  It drains the Portland Canal, Nass River, and Khutzeymateen Inlet, among others, and is the site of Pearse Island and Somerville Island.  Other than Nass Bay and the Portland Canal, other major sidewaters of the inlet are Observatory Inlet and its east arm, Alice Arm.
George Vancouver mapped the inlet in 1793 and named it "Brown Inlet," later changing the name to honor the British House of Portland.BCGNIS Geographical Name Details
