Clarke Abel (5 September 1789[tpl]cite web | title = RootsWeb: SUFFOLK-L Poole, Cavell & Abel| url= http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SUFFOLK/2005-08/1123102049 | accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl] â€“ 24 November 1826) was a British surgeon and naturalist.
He accompanied Lord Amherst on his mission to China in 1816-17 as the embassy's chief medical officer and naturalist, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks. The mission was Britain's second unsuccessful attempt to establish diplomatic relations with China and involved travelling to the capital Pekin (Beijing) and the famous botanical gardens of Fa Tee near Canton. While in China, Abel collected specimens and seeds of the plant that carries his name, Abelia chinensis, described by Banks' botanical secretary Robert Brown, "with friendly partiality". However a shipwreck and an attack by pirates on the way back to his home in Britain caused him to lose all of his specimens. Abel's Narrative of a Journey in the Interior of China, 1818, gives a detailed account of the collection's misfortunes. Fortunately, he had left some specimens with sir George Staunton at Canton, who was kind enough to return them to him; living specimens of the Chinese Abelia that we know today were introduced by Robert Fortune in 1844.Alice M.
