Viaweb was a web-based application that allowed users to build and host their own online stores with little effort and technical expertise, directly from their own web browser. The eponymous company was started in July 1995 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell.[tpl]cite book|last= Livingston|first=Jessica |title=Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days|publisher=Apress|date=January 2007|isbn=978-1-59059-714-9|pages=207â€“208[/tpl] Graham claims that Viaweb was the first application service provider.[tpl]cite book|last= Livingston|first=Jessica |title=Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days|publisher=Apress|date=January 2007|isbn=978-1-59059-714-9|page=206[/tpl] Viaweb was also unusual for being partially written in the Lisp programming language.
The software was originally called Webgen;[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://paulgraham.com/vwplan.html|title=Viaweb's First Business Plan|author=Paul Graham|work=paulgraham.com|date=1995-08-24|accessdate=2011-02-16|authorlink=Paul Graham (computer programmer)[/tpl]

In 1998, Yahoo! Inc. bought Viaweb for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at about $49 million, and renamed it Yahoo! Store.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-buys-Viaweb-for-49-million/2100-1001_3-212001.html|title=Yahoo buys Viaweb for $49 million|author=Randy Weston|work=CNET News|date=1998-06-09|accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/company-news-yahoo-buying-viaweb-a-web-marketing-software-maker.html|title=Company news: Yahoo buying Viaweb, a web marketing software maker|work=New York Times|date=1998-06-09|accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl]
Viaweb's example has been influential in Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial culture, largely due to Graham's widely read essays, and his subsequent career as a successful venture capitalist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1108/best-small-companies-10-y-combinator-paul-graham-disruptor.html|author=Christopher Steiner|work=Forbes|title=The Disruptor In The Valley|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl]
