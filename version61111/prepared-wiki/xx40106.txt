==Political career==

Stikker entered politics in 1945, when he was elected to the Senate of the States General. On 23 March 1946, he co-founded the Partij van de Vrijheid (PvdV, Freedom Party), together with some former members of the pre-war Liberale Staatspartij (LSP, Liberal State Party). On 24 January 1948, the PvdV was absorbed by the Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (VVD, Popular Party for Freedom and Democracy), which is [tpl]As of|2004|lc=on[/tpl] the country's most important Liberal party. Stikker was the VVD's first chairman.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===

In 1948, Stikker became minister of foreign affairs in the first government led by Willem Drees, holding that position until 1951. After his party adopted a no-confidence motion over the government's colonial policy in New Guinea, Stikker resigned on 23 January 1951, prompting the cabinet's fall. He returned to that position less than two months later.  The Netherlands played an important role in the creation of NATO and the European Coal and Steel Community during Stikker's time in office as minister of foreign affairs.

===Later political roles===

After his ministerial office, Stikker was ambassador to the United Kingdom (1952–1958) and head of the Dutch Permanent Representation to the North Atlantic council and to the Organization for European Economy Co-operation, the predecessor of the OECD (1958–1961). On 21 April 1961, he succeeded Paul-Henri Spaak, to become the third Secretary General of NATO. He resigned due to poor health on 1 August 1964.
