The Israeli West Bank barrier is a security and separation barrier (see "Names of the barrier") under construction by the State of Israel along and within the West Bank. Upon completion, the barrier's total length will be approximately [tpl]convert|700|km[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/barrier-monitoring-unit?id=908|title=Barrier Monitoring Unit|publisher=unrwa.org|date=February 18, 2011|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] 90% of the length of this barrier is a fence with vehicle-barrier trenches surrounded by an on-average [tpl]convert|60|m[/tpl] wide exclusion area, and 10% of the barrier is an [tpl]convert|8|m[/tpl]-tall concrete wall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zionism-israel.com/hdoc/High_Court_Fence.htm|title=Israel High Court Ruling Docket H.C.J. 7957/04: International Legality of the Security Fence and Sections near Alfei Menashe|accessdate=2007-04-16|date=September 15, 2005|publisher=Supreme Court of Israel[/tpl] As of 2012, [tpl]convert|439.7|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of barrier (62.1%) have been built, [tpl]convert|56.6|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] (8%) are under construction and [tpl]convert|211.7|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] (29.9%) are projected but construction hasn't begun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/separation_barrier/statistics|title=The Seperation Barrier - Statistics|publisher=B'Tselem|date=1 January 2011|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] The barrier is built mainly in the West Bank and partly along the 1949 Armistice line, or "Green Line" between Israel and Palestinian West Bank.[tpl]cite book|last=Barahona|first=Ana|title=Bearing Witness - Eight weeks in Palestine|publisher=Metete|location=London|isbn=978-1-908099-02-0|year=2013|page=39[/tpl] According to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, 8.5% of the West Bank area will after completion be on the Israeli side of the barrier, and 3.4% partly or completely surrounded on the eastern side.
Israel argues that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian terrorism, including the suicide bombing attacks that increased significantly during the Second Intifada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/questions.htm|title=Questions and Answers|accessdate=2007-04-17|date=February 22, 2004|work=Israel's Security Fence|publisher=The State of Israel|quote=[tpl]small|The Security Fence is being built with the sole purpose of saving the lives of the Israeli citizens who continue to be targeted by the terrorist campaign that began in 2000. The fact that over 800 men, women and children have been killed in horrific suicide bombings and other terror attacks clearly justifies the attempt to place a physical barrier in the path of terrorists. It should be noted that terrorism has been defined throughout the international community as a crime against humanity. As such, the State of Israel not only has the right but also the obligation to do everything in its power to lessen the impact and scope of terrorism on the citizens of Israel.[/tpl] [/tpl] There has been a reduced number of incidents of suicide bombings since the construction of the barrier. According to statistics published by the Israeli government, between 2000 and July 2003, when the "first continuous segment" of the barrier was built, 73 Palestinian suicide bombings were carried out from the West Bank, killing 293 Israelis and injuring over 1,900. However, from August 2003 to the end of 2006, only 12 attacks were carried out, killing 64 Israelis and wounding 445.[tpl]cite web|url=http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/web/main/missionhome.asp?MissionID=45187|title=The Anti-Terrorist Fence vs. Terrorism|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040110054951/http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/web/main/missionhome.asp?MissionID=45187|archivedate=2004-01-10|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] Supporters argue that this is indicative of the barrier being effective in preventing such attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/dion_nissenbaum/story/15469.html|title=Death toll of Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians hit a low in 2006|accessdate=2007-04-16|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion|date=January 10, 2007|work=Washington Bureau|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|quote=[tpl]small|Fewer Israeli civilians died in Palestinian attacks in 2006 than in any year since the Palestinian uprising began in 2000. Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000... An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing [tpl]convert|250|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. ... Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line. ... IDF spokeswoman Meir said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning attacks from the West Bank also deserved credit for the drop in Israeli fatalities.[/tpl] [/tpl]
Opponents of the barrier object that the route substantially deviates from the Green Line into the occupied territories captured by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967. They argue that the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Publications/summaries/200512_Under_the_Guise_of_Security.asp|title=Under the Guise of Security: Routing the Separation Barrier to Enable Israeli Settlement Expansion in the West Bank|accessdate=2007-04-16|date=December 2005|work=Publications|publisher=B'Tselem|quote=The fact that the Separation Barrier cuts into the West Bank was and remains the main cause of human rights violations of Palestinians living near the Barrier.

Eventually, it will encircle the town, but already, there is only one gate in and out of Qalquilya. Moving to and from the town is a draining process of waiting in the sunshine while papers are taken away and thought about. You can't take a car from one side to the other. When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi. ... Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the wall threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.…Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people—10 per cent of the population—have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind. ... Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes approximately 3.5 m shekels (£490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.'[/tpl] In a 2004 advisory opinion resulting from a Palestinian-initiated U.N. resolution, the International Court of Justice considered that "Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall". The Court asserted that "the construction of the wall, and its associated régime, are contrary to international law".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imwp/imwpframe.htm|title=Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: Advisory Opinion|accessdate=2007-04-16|date=July 9, 2004|work=Cases|publisher=International Court of Justice|archiveurl=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=71&p1=3&p2=1&case=131&p3=6|archivedate=2004-07-04[/tpl]

==Names of the barrier==

Israelis most commonly refer to the barrier as the "separation (hafrada) fence" ([tpl]Audio|He-Gader_Hahafrada.ogg|גדר ההפרדה[/tpl], Geder HaHafrada) and "security fence" or "anti-terrorist fence", with "seam zone" (קו התפר, Kav HaTefer) referring to the land between the fence and the 1949 armistice lines.
Palestinians most commonly refer to the barrier in Arabic as [tpl]Audio|ArWestBankBarrier.ogg|"jidar al-fasl al-'unsuri"[/tpl], (racial segregation wall), and some opponents of the barrier refer to it in English as the "Apartheid Wall."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=629|title=The Plot of the Eastern Segregation Wall|publisher=poica.org|date=16 July 2005|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Alatout|first=Samer|authorlink=|date=August 2006|title=Towards a bio-territorial conception of power: Territory, population, and environmental narratives in Palestine and Israel|journal=Political Geography|volume=25|issue=6|pages= 602–21|issn=0962-6298|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.03.008|id=|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VG2-4K128YH-1/2/80baad67742cc7d4cf84949479833b67|accessdate=2010-05-08[/tpl]
The International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion on the barrier, wrote it had chosen to use the term "wall" as "the other expressions sometimes employed are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense."
The BBC's style guide for journalists states "The BBC uses the terms barrier, separation barrier or West Bank barrier as acceptable generic descriptions to avoid the political connotations of "security fence" (preferred by the Israeli government) or "apartheid wall" (preferred by the Palestinians)."[tpl]cite news|date=12 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_6040000/newsid_6044000/6044090.stm#barrier|title=Israel and the Palestinians: Key terms|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-03-15|quote=BBC journalists should try to avoid using terminology favoured by one side or another in any dispute.

==Structure==

Most of the barrier (over 95% of total length) consists of a "multi-layered fence system".[tpl]cite book|last=Barahona|first=Ana|title=Bearing Witness - Eight weeks in Palestine|publisher=Metete|location=London|isbn=978-1-908099-02-0|year=2013|page=47[/tpl] The IDF's preferred design has three fences, with pyramid-shaped stacks of barbed wire for the two outer fences and a lighter-weight fence with intrusion detection equipment in the middle. Patrol roads are provided on both sides of the middle fence, an anti-vehicle ditch is located on the West Bank side of the fence, and a smooth dirt strip on the Israeli side for "intrusion tracking".
Some sections (less than 5% of total length) are constructed as a wall made up of concrete slabs up to 8 m in height and 3 m in width.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/operational.htm|title=Operational Concept|publisher=Ministry of Defense (Israel)|author=x|location=Israel|date=January 31, 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18|quote=This particular design is used in a minority of cases- a total of [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in the initial stages of the project (4%). Its main purpose is to prevent sniper fire into Israel and on major highways and roads. In this case, a solid concrete wall resembling a highway sound barrier often used in the US and Europe is erected. This design is used mainly along the new Trans - Israel Highway, in Bat Hefer and Matan, and in densely populated urban areas such as Jerusalem. Once the whole project is completed, the portion of the concrete sections will be 6%, about [tpl]convert|30|km[/tpl].[/tpl] Occasionally, due to topographic conditions other sections of the barrier will reach up to 100 m in width.[tpl]cite web|date=April 2003|url=http://www.nad-plo.org/palisraeli/wall/related/bwall.pdf|title=Behind The Barrier: Human Rights Violations As a Result of Israel's Separation Barrier|format = PDF|publisher=B'Tselem|accessdate=2008-03-15|last=Researched and written by Yehezkel Lein|quote=The average width of the barrier complex is sixty meters. Due to topographic constraints, a narrower barrier will be erected in some areas and will not include all of the elements that support the electronic fence. However, as the state indicated to the High Court of Justice, "in certain cases, the barrier will reach a width of one hundred meters due to the topographic conditions."[/tpl] Wall construction (5%) is more common in urban settings, such as areas near Qalqilyah and Jerusalem, because it is narrower, requires less land, and provides more protection against snipers. In all cases there are regular observation posts, automated sensing devices and other apparatuses. Gates at various points are controlled by Israeli soldiers.

==Stated purposes==

The idea of creating a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations was first proposed in 1992 by then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, following the murder of an Israeli teenage girl in Jerusalem. Rabin said that Israel must "take Gaza out of Tel Aviv", in order to minimize friction between the peoples.Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: from Balfour Promise to Bush Declaration: The Complications and the Road for a Lasting Peace, pp. 325-326. Gabriel G. Tabarani, AuthorHouse, 2008; ISBN 9781467879040How to Build a Fence, pp. 50–64. David Makovsky, Foreign Affairs, volume 83, issue 2, March/April 2004; [tpl]ISSN|00157120[/tpl]; [tpl]doi|10.2307/20033902[/tpl] Following an outbreak of violent incidents in Gaza in October 1994, Rabin said:
 "we have to decide on separation as a philosophy. There has to be a clear border. Without demarcating the lines, whoever wants to swallow 1.8 million Arabs will just bring greater support for Hamas." 
Following an attack on HaSharon Junction, near the city of Netanya, Rabin made his goals more specific:
 "This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism."Routledge Handbook on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, p. 191. Gerald M. Steinberg, Routledge, 2013; ISBN 9780415778626 
The first section of the wall (as slabs of concrete contiguous for miles) that stood as a barrier was constructed during the Oslo accords negotiations in 1994. The section follows the border between Bat Hefer and Tulkarm communities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Story?id=130307&page=1|title=Warring Communities Separated By Wall|publisher=ABCNEWS|author=Sandy Nunez|date=June 6, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110131215345/http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130307&page=1|archivedate=2011-01-31|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]
In early 1995, the Shahal commission was established by Yitzhak Rabin to discuss how to implement a barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, prior to the Camp David 2000 Summit with Yasser Arafat, vowed to build a separation barrier, stating that it is "essential to the Palestinian nation in order to foster its national identity and independence without being dependent on the State of Israel".
Following a Palestinian violence outbreak in 2002, Israel began construction of a barrier that would separate most of the West Bank from areas inside Israel. The Israeli Supreme Court made reference to the conditions and history that led to the building of the barrier. In the September 2005 decision, it described the history of violence against Israeli citizens since the breakout of the Second Intifada and the loss of life that ensued on the Israeli side. The court ruling also cited the attempts Israel had made to defend its citizens, including "military operations" carried out against "terrorist acts", and stated that these actions ...
 ... did not provide a sufficient answer to the immediate need to stop the severe acts of terrorism. ... Despite all these measures, the terror did not come to an end. The attacks did not cease. Innocent people paid with both life and limb. This is the background behind the decision to construct the separation fence (Id., at p. 815) 
Although the Barrier is purported to be a temporary defense against Palestinian attacks, many view it as significant in terms of future negotiations over Israel's final borders. In 2012 it was reported that Israel had presented principles for drawing a border, which essentially propose to turn the West Bank separation barrier into the border with a future Palestinian state.Israel proposes West Bank barrier as border. Dan Perry and Mohammed Daraghmeh, Associated Press, 27 January 2012

===Grassroots effort===

In June 2001, a grass roots organization called "Fence for Life – The Public Movement for The Security Fence" began the grassroots effort for the construction of a continuous security fence. The movement was founded by people from all over Israel following the Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing.
The stated goal of the movement is to encourage the government to construct a security fence along Israel's borders. "Fence for Life" urged the government to build a contiguous fence as speedily as possible, and without any connection to the political future of the areas it separates, with a goal of hermetically sealing off the Palestinian territories from Israeli population centers to prevent the terrorist acts by Palestinians against the people living in Israel.
The "Fence for Life" campaign emphasized that any security fence has no connection whatsoever to the political future of the settlements. The Movement for the Security Fence for Israel included protests, demonstrations, conferences with public figures, media blitzes, lobbying in the Knesset as well as legal battles in the High Court of Justice, both with demands to quickly build the security fence as well as appeals not to cause further delay in construction. The movement does not support any specific path for the barrier, as this is subject to a government decision. "Fence for Life" was of the opinion that "politicization" of the fence by various groups was delaying the completion of the security barrier and is likely to block its construction. At the end of 2002, due to government inaction, several localities who suffered the most from lack of a border barrier had started to build the barrier using their own funds directly on the green-line.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.7th-day.co.il/hayom-hashvie/fence.htm|title=Gilboa towns build DIY separation fence|accessdate=2007-04-16|last=Ratner|first=David|date=February 12, 2002|work=Haaretz|quote=Residents in the Gilboa region waited two years for a separation fence to be built. Now, after having sent repeated entreaties to the government and having received assorted, unfulfilled promises, they have decided to 'take the law into their own hands,' and build the fence themselves.[/tpl]

===Government action===

Although the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was initially hesitant to construct the barrier, he finally embraced the plan. The stated purpose of the barrier is to prevent terrorists from entering Israeli cities, a problem which has plagued Israel since the start of the Second Intifada. A secondary stated purpose of the barrier is to prevent infiltration by Palestinians for economic reasons. The Israeli government says that the high concrete portions are to protect cars and people on the Israeli side from gunfire.
Natan Sharansky, Minister of Housing and Construction at the time, viewed the security fence as an option for Israel to defend itself, because the Palestinian Authority had not become a partner in fighting terror, as it was obliged to do under all the agreements that it signedNatan Sharansky: The Case for Democracy p. 214

==Route and route timeline==

The barrier sometimes runs along or near the 1949 Jordanian-Israeli armistice/Green Line, but it diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Israeli settlements in the West Bank such as East Jerusalem, Ariel, Gush Etzion, Emmanuel, Karnei Shomron, Givat Ze'ev, Oranit, and Maale Adumim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/11/05/mideast/|title=Palestinians: Israel hands out land confiscation notices|publisher=CNN|date=November 7, 2003|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-17|quote=The West Bank barrier generally runs close to the pre-1967 Mideast war border—the so-called Green Line—but dips into the West Bank to include some Jewish settlements. Israel says a new section will extend deep into the West Bank, surrounding several West Bank towns.[/tpl] Most of the barrier is actually set in the West Bank. It diverges from the "Green Line" by anywhere from 200 meters to as much as [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl], with the result that many Israeli settlements in the West Bank remain on the Israeli side of the barrier, and some Palestinian towns are nearly encircled by it. Approximately 20% is actually on the Green Line.Preliminary Analysis of the Humanitarian Implications of February 2005 Barrier Projections. OCHAoPt, 8 March 2005 The proponents of the barrier say that its route is not set in stone, as it was challenged in court and changed several times. They say that the cease-fire line of 1949 was negotiated "without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines" (Art. VI.9).Jordanian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement, April 3, 1949. The Avalon Project Security experts argue that the topography does not permit putting the barrier along the Green Line in some places, because hills or tall buildings on the Palestinian side would make the barrier ineffective against terrorism.Map of Israel Security Barrier ("Wall")- Current Status (2006) MidEastWeb, June 2006 The International Court of Justice has countered that in such cases it is only legal to build the barrier inside Israel.
During important Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington, Prime Minister Ehud Barak approved on 25 December 2000 financing of a [tpl]convert|74|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] fence between the Wadi Ara region and Latrun. The Deputy Defence Minister stated that the barrier did not necessarily delineate the boundaries of a future Palestinian State.UN Division for Palestinian Rights, Monthly media monitoring review, December 2000. See par. 25
As of October 2003, circa [tpl]convert|180|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] was completed. Most of the barrier was built at the northern and western edges of the West Bank, mostly beyond the Green Line and created 9 enclaves, which enclosed [tpl]convert|39000|acres|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. An additional barrier, circa 10 km long, run south of Ramallah.Barrier Route Projections - Update 2: Preliminary Analysis. OCHAoPt, January 2004
In February 2004, the Israeli government said it would review the route of the barrier in response to US and Palestinian concerns. In particular, Israeli cabinet members said modifications would be made to reduce the number of checkpoints Palestinians had to cross, and especially to reduce Palestinian hardship in areas such as the city of Qalqilyah which the barrier completely surrounds.
In a bargain with then Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister Sharon pledged to build an extension of the barrier to the east of the settlement Ariel to be completed before the finish of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. In return, Netanyahu would support the disengagement plan. In June 2004, Israel appropriated Palestinian private land to build upon the fence and started preparations for the construction of the wall to the farthest point inside the West Bank ever, 22 km beyond the Green Line, 3.5 kilometers long, and 100 meters wide.Despite U.S. deal, Israel starts Ariel fence Arnon Regular, Haaretz, 14 June 2004
On June 30, 2004, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that a portion of the barrier west of Jerusalem violated the rights of Palestinians, and ordered [tpl]convert|30|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of existing and planned barrier to be rerouted. However, it did rule that the Barrier is legal in principle and accepted the Israeli government's assertion that it is a security measure.
On July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion that it is a violation of international law. At the beginning of September 2004, Israel started the southern part of the barrier.
Despite the ICJ ruling that the Wall beyond the Green Line is illegal, Ariel Sharon decreed on September 8, 2004 that the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Ma'aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion will be on the Israeli side of the Barrier.

==Effects and consequences==

===Effects on Israeli security===

Israeli statistics indicate that since the construction of the barrier the number of Palestinian infiltrations and suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians in Israel and in Israeli settlements has substantially reduced, and Israeli officials assert that completion of the barrier will make it even more effective in stopping these attacksIsraeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs since "An absolute halt in terrorist activities has been noticed in the West Bank areas where the fence has been constructed".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nclci.org/news/terrorism_news.htm|title=STATS SHOW ANTI-TERRORISM FENCE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE|publisher=National Christian Leadership Conference for Israel: Terrorism News|date=24 February 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081121020554/http://www.nclci.org/News/terrorism_news.htm|archivedate=2008-11-21|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl]
Israeli officers (including the head of the Shin Bet) quoted in the newspaper Maariv have said that in the areas where the barrier was complete, the number of hostile infiltrations has decreased to almost zero. Maariv also stated that Palestinian militants, including a senior member of Islamic Jihad, had confirmed that the barrier made it much harder to conduct attacks inside Israel. Since the completion of the fence in the area of Tulkarm and Qalqilyah in June 2003, there have been no successful attacks from those areas. All attacks were intercepted or the suicide bombers detonated prematurely. In a March 23, 2008 interview, Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Shalah complained to the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq that the separation barrier "limits the ability of the resistance to arrive deep within territory to carry out suicide bombing attacks, but the resistance has not surrendered or become helpless, and is looking for other ways to cope with the requirements of every stage" of the intifada.Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage & Commemoration Center (IICC)
Israeli government sources have stated that since the barrier has been built, Israeli security has improved with regard to suicide bombings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/questions.htm#q26|title=Is the fence effective?|accessdate=2007-04-20|date=February 22, 2004|work=Israel's Security Fence: Questions and Answers|publisher=The State of Israel|quote=Members of Palestinian terror infrastructure caught and questioned disclosed the reality that the existence of the security fence in the Samaria area forces them to find other means to perform terror attacks because their previous entry to Israel is blocked.[/tpl] According to statistics published by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Israel Security Agency, from the beginning of the Second Intifada until the construction of the "first continuous segment" of the barrier in July 2003, 73 Palestinian suicide bombings were carried out from the West Bank, killing 293 Israelis and injuring over 1,900. However, between August 2003 and the end of 2006, only 12 attacks were carried out based in the West Bank, killing 64 Israelis and wounding 445. The trend continued into 2007, and 2008 as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Anti-Israeli+Terrorism+in+2007+and+its+Trends+in+2008-+Overview.htm|title=Anti-Israeli Terrorism in 2007 and its Trends in 2008: Overview|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|date=6/5/2008|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-09-18|quote=[tpl]small|In Judea and Samaria the security forces maintain counterterrorist activity pressure which includes the detention of wanted terrorists, exposing weapons and killing the terrorist operatives who resisted detention.

However, there is debate over how effective the barrier has been in preventing other attacks. A report by the Shin Beit, published in early 2006 says that attacks in 2005 have significantly decreased due to increased pursuing of Palestinian militants by the Israeli army and intelligence organizations, Hamas's increased political activity, and a truce among Palestinian militant groups in the Palestinian Territories. According to Haaretz the report also mentions that "The security fence is no longer mentioned as the major factor in preventing suicide bombings, mainly because the terrorists have found ways to bypass it."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=664916|title=Shin Bet: Palestinian truce main cause for reduced terror|publisher=Haaretz|year=2006|author=Amos Hrel|accessdate=2007-08-11[/tpl] Former Israeli Secretary of Defence Moshe Arens says that the reduction in Palestinian violence is largely due to the IDF's entry into the West Bank in 2002.Moshe Arens: The fence, revisited Haaretz October 28, 2008.
B'Tselem challenged the assumption used as the basis of the decision to erect the barrier, that people who carry out attacks enter via open areas between the checkpoints rather than through the checkpoints themselves. According to Israel's state comptroller's Audit Report on the Seam Area published in July 2002, "IDF documents indicate that most of the suicide terrorists and the car bombs crossed the seam area into Israel through the checkpoints, where they underwent faulty and even shoddy checks."[tpl]cite web|title=Behind the Barrier: Human Rights Violations as a Result of Israel's Separation Barrier|url=http://www.btselem.org/download/200304_behind_the_barrier_eng.pdf|publisher=B'Tselem|page=26|date=March 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=A Contextualized Approach for Understanding Israel's Construction of 'The Wall'|journal=International Journal for Arab Studies|date=July 2010|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.ijasjournal.com/PDF/Article_3.pdf|author=Evan O.

===Effects on demography and asset values===

According to a 2005 report published by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, the barrier being built around Jerusalem may have unintended effects on the city. According to the study, many Jerusalem Palestinians who were living in areas outside the barrier are now moving back into the city, creating housing shortages, increased real estate prices, and the phenomenon of Palestinians moving into traditionally Jewish neighborhoods of the city.Your Financial News Source
Arguments from right wing Israeli circles that the fence will reduce the Jewish population behind it have been countered from the same circles, arguing that attempts to keep Jews out of the land they believe is theirs are no more likely to succeed today than they were in Mandate Palestine, when the British blockaded the shores and issued the White Paper of 1939 to prevent Jews from purchasing land in the Mandate.

===Effects on Palestinians===

The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, reduction of the number of Israel Defense Forces checkpoints, road closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical and educational services in Israel,[tpl]cite journal|issn=1049-023X|volume=22|issue=4|pages=267–268|last=Stratton|first=Samuel|title=Editorial comments--"West Bank barrier decreases access to schools and health services"|journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine: the Official Journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the World Association for Emergency and Disaster Medicine in Association with the Acute Care Foundation|accessdate=2010-05-11|date=August 2007|url=http://pdm.medicine.wisc.edu/Volume_22/issue_4/stratton.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|issn=1049-023X|volume=22|issue=4|pages=263–266|last=Qato|first=Dima|coauthors=Shannon Doocy, Deborah Tsuchida, P Gregg Greenough, Gilbert Burnham|title=West Bank barrier decreases access to schools and health services|journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine: the Official Journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the World Association for Emergency and Disaster Medicine in Association with the Acute Care Foundation|accessdate=2010-05-11|date=August 2007|url=http://pdm.medicine.wisc.edu/Volume_22/issue_4/doocy.pdf[/tpl] restricted access to water sources, and economic effects.[tpl]cite book|last=Barahona|first=Ana|title=Bearing Witness - Eight weeks in Palestine|publisher=Metete|location=London|isbn=978-1-908099-02-0|year=2013[/tpl]

====Reduced freedoms====

In a 2005 report, the United Nations stated that:
An often-quoted example of the effects of the barrier is the Palestinian town of Qalqilyah, a city of around 45,000, which is surrounded on all sides by the barrier. One 8 meter-high concrete section of this wall follows the Green Line between the city and the nearby Trans-Israel Highway. This section, referred to as an "anti-sniper wall," has been said[tpl]by whom|date=October 2012[/tpl] to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists on the Trans-Israel Highway.[tpl]cite news|date=15 September 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3111159.stm|title=Q&A: What is the West Bank barrier?|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-03-15|quote=The solid section around the Palestinian town of Qalqilya is conceived as a "sniper wall" to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists on the nearby Trans-Israel Highway.[/tpl] The city is accessible through a military checkpoint on the main road from the east, and an underground tunnel built in September 2004 on the south side connects Qalqilyah with the adjacent village of Habla. Recently, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to change the route of the barrier in this area to ease movement of Palestinians between Qalqilyah and five surrounding villages. In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention as reasons for this rejection.
In early October 2003, the IDF OC Central Command declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period of time. New directives stated that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the enclaves created in the closed area have to obtain a "permanent resident permit" from the Civil Administration to enable them to continue to live in their homes. Other residents of the West Bank have to obtain special permits to enter the area.

====Fewer checkpoints and roadblocks====

In June 2004, The Washington TimesWashington Times - Mideast security barrier working reported that the reduced Israeli military incursions in Jenin have prompted efforts to rebuild damaged streets and buildings and a gradual return to a semblance of normality, and in a letterThe Israeli Government's Official Website, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated October 25, 2004, from the Israeli mission to Kofi Annan, Israel's government pointed out that a number of restrictions east of the barrier have been lifted as a result of it, including a reduction in checkpoints from 71 to 47 and roadblocks from 197 to 111. The Jerusalem Post reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the Israeli Arab town of Umm el-Fahm (population 42,000) near Jenin, the barrier has "significantly improved their lives" because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom. The report states that the downsides are that the barrier has divided families in half and "damaged Israeli Arabs' solidarity with the Palestinians living on the other side of the Green Line".Variables.theArticle:headline | Jerusalem Post
A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier "replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate and Jerusalem Governorate where the Barrier is under construction." The report says that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also says that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf|format=pdf|title=Special Focus: Closure Count and Analysis|publisher=Humanitarian Update|date=August 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050909092637/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/docs/UN/OCHA/ochaHU0805_En.pdf|archivedate=2005-09-09|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]

====Loss of land====

However, in its current route the barrier is annexing 9.5% of the total area of the West Bank to the Israeli side of the barrier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_barrier_report_july_2009_english_low_res.pdf|title=OCHA oPt Barrier Report July 2009|accessdate=2009-11-22[/tpl]

According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), 15 communities were to be directly affected, numbering approximately 138,593 Palestinians, including 13,450 refugee families, or 67,250 individuals. In addition to loss of land, in the city of Qalqilyah one-third of the city's water wells lie on the other side of the barrier. The Israeli Supreme Court says the Israeli government's rejection of accusations of a de facto annexation of these wells, stating that "the construction of the fence does not affect the implementation of the water agreements determined in the (interim) agreement".
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) estimates that in the north of the West Bank approximately 80 per cent of Palestinians who own land on the other side of the barrier have not received permits from the Israeli authorities, and hence cannot cultivate their fields.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/unescwa/unpan035390.pdf|format=pdf|title=ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION.

In addition, almost a third of West Bank villages will suffer from lack of access to healthcare. After completion, many residents may lose complete access to emergency care at night.

==Legal status==

===United Nations and International Court of Justice===

In 2004, the United Nations passed a number of resolutions and the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion calling for the barrier to be removed, for Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done, and for other states to take action to obtain Israel's compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention. The advisory opinion resulted from a Palestinian-initiated resolution adopted in a special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. The opinion was advisory, rather than binding, because Israel had refused to accept jurisdiction over the issue by the Court.
The Court found both the barrier and the associated regime that had been imposed on the Palestinian inhabitants is illegal, and said that an occupying power cannot claim that the lawful inhabitants of the occupied territory constitute a "foreign" threat for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also explained that necessity may constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under certain very limited circumstances, but that Article 25 of the UN Declaration on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts bars a defense of necessity if the State has contributed to the situation of necessity. The Court cited illegal interference by the government of Israel with the Palestinian's national right to self-determination; and land confiscations, house demolitions, the creation of enclaves, and restrictions on movement and access to water, food, education, health care, work, and an adequate standard of living in violation of Israel's obligations under international law. The Court also said that Israeli settlements had been established and that Palestinians had been displaced in violation of Article 49, paragraph 6, of the Fourth Geneva Convention.International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory", paragraphs 120–137 and 163 http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf; English version On request of the ICJ, Palestine submitted a copious statement.Permanent Observer of Palestine, 30 January 2004, Written statement submitted by Palestine The UN Fact Finding Mission and several UN Rapporteurs subsequently said that in the movement and access policy there has been a violation of the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin.See the report of The UN Fact Finding Mission on Gaza, A/HRC/12/48, 25 September 2009, paragraph 1548
The Anti-Defamation League heavily criticized the ruling, asserting that the outcome was stacked against Israel in advance through the biased wording of the submission. It said that Israel was systematically excluded from any say in the Court's makeup and asserted that an anti-Israel environment prevails at the General Assembly, which "regularly demonizes Israel". According to the ADL, the politicized nature of the process that produced the opinion threatens to undermine the integrity of the Court and contravene constructive efforts to promote peace in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/israel/court_of_justice.asp|title=Decision Dismisses Israel's Arguments, Accepts Palestinian Claims Without Reservation|accessdate=2012-07-16|date=July 9, 2004[/tpl]

===Israeli Supreme Court rulings===

On two occasions the Israeli government has been instructed by the Supreme Court of Israel to alter the route of the barrier to ensure that negative impacts on Palestinians would be minimized and proportional.[ref]HCJ 2056/04, 30 June 2004; B'Tselem, 16 September 2005 High Court in precedent-making decision: Dismantle section of the Separation Barrier;

==Opinions on the barrier==

===International opinions===

====The United Nations====

In October 2003, a United Nations resolution to declare the barrier illegal where it deviates from the green line and should be torn down was vetoed by the US in the United Nations Security Council.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution on Israeli wall|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=October 15, 2003 |accessdate=2007-05-21 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/15/Worldandnation/US_vetoes_UN_resoluti.shtml[/tpl] In December 2003, Resolution ES-10/14 was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in an emergency special session.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/0163EF0C6E99036F85256EB3004E6EBF|title=ES-10/14.

The resolution included a request to the International Court of Justice to urgently render an advisory opinion on the following question.  "What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions?"  The court concluded that the barrier violated international law.Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, July 9, 2004. On 20 July 2004, the UN General Assembly accepted Resolution ES-10/15 condemning the barrier with 150 countries voting for the resolution and 10 abstaining.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F3B95E613518A0AC85256EEB00683444|title=Resolution ES-10/15.

====The Red Cross====

The Red Cross has declared the barrier in violation of the Geneva Convention. On February 18, 2004, The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that the Israeli barrier "causes serious humanitarian and legal problems" and goes "far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power".[tpl]cite news |date=18 February 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3498795.stm |title=Red Cross slams Israel barrier |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-03-17[/tpl]

====Human rights organizations====

Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other Human rights groups have protested both the routing of the wall and the means by which the land to build the wall was obtained.http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/10/isrlpa10290.htm Human Rights Watch The Israeli women of Machsom Watch regularly monitor events at checkpoints and report their findings. In a 2004 report Amnesty International wrote that "The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law."http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde150332004 Amnesty International
They continue:
 Since the summer of 2002 the Israeli army has been destroying large areas of Palestinian agricultural land, as well as other properties, to make way for a fence/wall which it is building in the West Bank.
 In addition to the large areas of particularly fertile Palestinian farmland that have been destroyed, other larger areas have been cut off from the rest of the West Bank by the fence/wall.
The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.

====World Council of Churches====

On February 20, 2004 the World Council of Churches demanded that Israel halt and reverse construction on the barrier and strongly condemned "violations of human rights and humanitarian consequences" that resulted from the construction of the barrier. While acknowledging Israel's serious security concerns and asserting that the construction of the barrier on its own territory would not have been a violation of international law, the statement called on "member Churches, Ecumenical Councils of Churches, Christian World Communions and specialized ministries of churches to condemn the wall as an act of unlawful annexation."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/executive-committee/geneva-february-2004/20-02-04-statement-on-palestineisrael.html|title=Statement on the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel's Annexation of Palestinian territory|publisher=World Council of Churches|date=17–20 February 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060712064444/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/executive-committee/geneva-february-2004/20-02-04-statement-on-palestineisrael.html|archivedate=2006-07-12|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]

====United States opinion====

On May 25, 2005, then-President of the United States George W. Bush said "I think the wall is a problem. And I discussed this with Ariel Sharon. It is very difficult to develop confidence between the Palestinians and Israel with a wall snaking through the West Bank."[tpl]cite press release|date=July 25, 2003|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/07/20030725-6.html|title=President Bush Welcomes Prime Minister Abbas to White House Remarks by President Bush and Prime Minister Abbas|publisher=US White House|accessdate=2008-03-15|author=George Bush[/tpl] The following year, addressing the issue of the barrier as a future border, he said in a letter to Sharon on April 14, 2004 that it "should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities." President Bush reiterated this position during a May 26, 2005 joint press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the Rose Garden.[tpl]cite press release|date=May 26, 2005|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050526.html|title=President Welcomes Palestinian President Abbas to the White House|publisher=US White House|author=George Bush|accessdate=2008-03-15[/tpl]
In 2003, when the Bush administration was considering reducing loan guarantees to Israel to discourage construction of the fence, then Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized the project. He said, "A nation is within its rights to put up a fence if it sees the need for one. However, in the case of the Israeli fence, we are concerned when the fence crosses over onto the land of others."[tpl]cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Powell Criticizes Israeli Fence in West Bank|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,93794,00.html|publisher=Fox News|date=August 5, 2003|accessdate=2010-08-27[/tpl] Response from pro-Israel members of Congress criticized the possible reduction in loan assistance. For example, Senator Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said, "The administration's threat to cut aid to Israel unless it stops construction of a security fence is a heavy-handed tactic." Lieberman criticized the threat as improper between allies, and continued, "The Israeli people have the right to defend themselves from terrorism, and a security fence may be necessary to achieve this."
In 2005, Hillary Rodham Clinton, at the time a U.S. Senator from New York, said she supports the separation fence Israel is building along the edges of the West Bank, and that the onus is on the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism. "This is not against the Palestinian people," she said during a tour of a section of the barrier being built around Jerusalem. "This is against the terrorists. The Palestinian people have to help to prevent terrorism. They have to change the attitudes about terrorism."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=644798|title=Sen.

In 2007, Senator Charles Schumer said: "As long as the Palestinians send terrorists onto school buses and to nightclubs to blow up people, Israel has no choice but to build the Security Wall."

====European Union opinion====

According to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, the EU considers the barrier to be illegal to the extent it is built on Palestinian land.Israel rebukes Ashton for voicing 'concern' on military trial (EUObserver, August 26, 2010)

====Canadian opinion====

The Canadian Government recognizes Israel's right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including through the restriction of access to its territory, and by building a barrier on its own territory for security purposes. However, it opposes the barrier's incursion into and the disruption of occupied territories. Considering the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) to be "occupied territory", the Canadian government considers the barrier to be contrary to international law under the Fourth Geneva Convention. It opposes the barrier and the expropriations and the demolition of houses and economic infrastructure preceding its construction.Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade: [tpl]cite web |date=2007-07-04|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/name-anmo/peace_process-processus_paix/canadian_policy-politique_canadienne.aspx?lang=eng|title=Canadian policy on key issues in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade - Canadian Government|accessdate=2012-12-11[/tpl]

===Israeli opinions===

According to a survey conducted by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research, an academic research institution of Tel Aviv University, there was overwhelming support for the barrier among the Jewish population of Israel: 84% in March 2004 and 78% in June 2004.Peace Index / Most Israelis support the fence, despite Palestinian suffering - Haaretz - Israel News
However, there are some Israelis who oppose the barrier. The Israeli Peace Now movement has stated that while they would support a barrier that follows the 1949 Armistice lines, the "current route of the fence is intended to destroy all chances of a future peace settlement with the Palestinians and to annex as much land as possible from the West Bank" and that the barrier would "only increase the blood to be spilt on both sides and continue the sacrificing of Israeli and Palestinian lives for the settlements."Peace Now : Opinions > Peace Now Positions
Some Israeli left wing activists, such as Anarchists Against the Wall and Gush Shalom, are active in protests against the barrier, especially in the West Bank towns of Bil'in and Jayyous.AATW - Anarchists against the wallGush Shalom - Israeli Peace Bloc
Shaul Arieli, a senior member of the Council for Peace and Security and one of the architects of the Geneva Initiative wrote in Haaretz in March 2009 of the importance "to complete the fence along a route based on security considerations." Arieli found the fence to be justified due to legitimate concerns of Palestinian terrorism and violence, but was critical of the then-government's alleged negligence of completing the fence due to budgetary and political considerations. He called on the public to "demand that the new government complete the fence quickly and along a logical route."Remember the separation fence?, Haaretz By Shaul Arieli

===Palestinian opinions===

The Palestinian population and its leadership are essentially unanimous in opposing the barrier. A significant number of Palestinians have been separated from their own farmlands or their places of work or study, and many more will be separated as the barriers near Jerusalem are completed. Furthermore, because of its planned route as published by the Israeli government, the barrier is perceived as a plan to confine the Palestinian population to specific areas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/09/MNGIP5H0IL1.DTL|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|title=Israeli fence puts 'cage' on villagers / More Palestinians scrambling to keep barrier from going up|first=Matthew|last=Kalman|date=2004-03-09[/tpl]Your Financial News Source They state that Palestinian institutions in Abu Dis will be prevented from providing services to residents in the East Jerusalem suburbs, and that a 10-minute walk has become a 3-hour drive in order to reach a gate, to go (if allowed) through a crowded military checkpoint, and drive back to the destination on the other side.Israel and the Occupied Territories: The place of the fence/wall in international law\n | Amnesty International
More broadly, Palestinian spokespersons, supported by many in the Israeli left wing and other organizations, say that the hardships imposed by the barrier will breed further discontent amongst the affected population and add to the security problem rather than solving it.
On April 14, 2004, American President George W. Bush said "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion.”President Bush Commends Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's Plan In direct reaction to Bush's comments, the leadership of the Palestinian National Authority accused the U.S. of rewarding construction of the barrier and replied, "the US assurances are being made at the expense of the Palestinian people and the Arab world without the knowledge of the legitimate Palestinian leadership. They are rewarding illegal occupation, settlement and the apartheid wall."Bush and Sharon: Much ado about more than nothing - a commented celebrity scrapbook
