==History==

Woolston was anciently part of Lancashire, but after local government reforms of 1974, it became part of Cheshire.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|p=646[/tpl] Up to the last decade of the nineteenth century, Woolston and its immediate area was a township called "Woolston with Martinscroft" in Warrington ancient parish, which was itself part of West Derby Hundred.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|p=214[/tpl] Towards the middle to end of the nineteenth century, it was part of Warrington rural sanitary district and Warrrington poor law union.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|pp=214, 683, 689[/tpl]
In 1894, Woolston with Martinscroft joined the newly formed Warrington Rural District as a civil parish, where it remained until 1933.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|pp=214, 689[/tpl] There was a boundary change to the civil parish in 1885 when the county boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire was adjusted: it gained part of Thelwall civil parish from Cheshire.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|pp=214, 676[/tpl] A complex set of boundary changes occurred in 1933, involving the county boundary with Cheshire: the civil parish gained part of Lymm ancient parish; exchanged areas of land with Grappenhall ancient parish; and exchanged areas of land with Thelwall civil parish, all in Cheshire. Finally, and again in 1933, the civil parish of Woolston with Martinscroft was abolished and parts used to create the civil parishes of Croft and the modern day civil parish of Woolston, both in Lancashire. This new civil parish of Woolston was formed from parts of the old Woolston with Martinscroft civil parish, as explained above, and also part of Culcheth civil parish. It remained in Warrington rural district until the local government reforms of 1974 which created the borough of Warrington which was located in Cheshire.[tpl]Harvtxt|Youngs|1991|pp=42, 214, 646, 677, 689[/tpl] In 1998, when Warrington borough became a unitary authority, it remained in the ceremonial county of Cheshire,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970023_en_2|title=Lieutenancies Act 1997 (c. 23), Schedule 1, page 2|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] This official UK government document clearly implies in part 2 (c) and in the absence of any mention of Cheshire in any of the other sections that the lieutenancy covers the area that was said to be Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1972.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/your_council/idoc.ashx?docid=86cebd1e-5c00-4817-bf81-ac2974316c33&version=-1&ei=UFY-UJfTAcu4hAfgo4HIBw&usg=AFQjCNG9cnURphRvXY-sYeFPa4qXXv2cUg&sig2=5Z2xOf1dksjmjpCPjVGGyA&cad=rja|format=PDF| title=Boundary of the Cheshire Lieutenancy|publisher=www.cheshire.gov.uk|accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl] and continued to be served by Cheshire Police[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cheshirepa.police.uk/files/Northern%20Area_Your%20Policing%202008.pdf|title=Northern Area: Your Policing|publisher=Cheshire Police|accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] and Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cheshirefire.co.uk/aboutus.asp?menuid=215|title=Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service: About Us|publisher=Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service|accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Economy==

A large area of the district is covered by warehousing districts.  The largest by far is the "Grange" this is an area of modern warehousing and light manufacturing built next to the M6 motorway.  This area was home to a large Safeway distribution depot that was taken over by Morrisons in January 2006, and then taken over by Iceland in mid-2006.  In 2007, this was outsourced to DHL, while still continuing to serve Iceland.  Woolston is home to a number of smaller businesses including Big Storage on the main A57 and Paragon Framing http://www.paragonframing.co.uk. There is also an industrial estate to the south called the "New Cut industrial estate", this features a large pipework fabrication business (WH Capper)http://www.whcapper.co.uk and several small offices and small holdings.  The estate gets its name from the canal which borders it and the "new cut" of the River Mersey.

==Geography==

The area has two main natural areas: Woolston Linear Park and the Woolston Eyes Nature Reserve—a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
Woolston is situated in the Mersey Valley and so there is a very slight lowering in height between it and the surrounding areas.  The highest point is on the Woolston Eyes, formerly Thelwall Eyes, (four-man-made areas formed by large embankments for the dispersement of dredging waste).  The lowest point is the marshland formed by the dereliction of the Woolston New Cut Canal and Woolston Old Canal. The Manchester Ship Canal denotes the southerly boundary of the Eyes reserve and can be crossed either via nearby Latchford locks or by the unique penny ferry crossing (11p each way as of October 2009). Woolston has plenty of waterways including the aforementioned canals; the new cut of the River Mersey; and the Manchester Ship Canal.
