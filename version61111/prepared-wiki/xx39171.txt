Claims of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact involve interactions that are supposed to have occurred between indigenous peoples of the Americas, who settled the Americas before 10,000 BC, and peoples of other continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, or Oceania) before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean in 1492.[tpl]cite book|last=Kowtko|first=Stacy|title=Nature and the Environment in Pre-Columbian American Life|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0313334726|page=X[/tpl] Such proposals have usually been based on narrative accounts interpreted to be about trans-ocean voyages, archaeological finds, and cultural comparisons. Claims of contacts (other than the Norse Greenland settlements and the settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/4/ |title=L’Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site |publisher=UNESCO » Culture » World Heritage Centre » The List » World Heritage List |accessdate=March 1, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/index_e.asp |title=L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada (Parks Canada. 2007) |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl]) are generally controversial and debated, in part because of the ambiguous or circumstantial evidence cited by proponents. The scientific responses to such pre-Columbian-contact claims range from occasional consideration in peer-reviewed publications to dismissal as fringe science or pseudoarcheology.

==Confirmed Norse trans-oceanic contact==

Norse, or Viking journeys to North America are supported by both historical and archaeological evidence. A Norse colony in Greenland was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (þing) taking place at Brattahlíð and a bishop located at Garðar. From Greenland to Canada the distance is only 26 kilometres at the narrowest possible crossing, over the Nares Strait to Ellesmere Island. The Vinland sagas and other documents from the pre-Columbian era detail several past expeditions from Greenland to Helluland to the west, Markland and Vínland, the latter being a location farther south with a warmer climate. According to the sagas, explorers included Bjarni Herjólfsson, Leif Ericson, Thorvald Eiriksson, Thorstein Eiriksson, Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir, and Þorfinnr "Karlsefni" Þórðarson who travelled with a larger company of settlers that included Freydís Eiríksdóttir and Tyrker. Snorri Thorfinnsson is reported to have been the first "European" to have been born in America. In written sources Adam of Bremen was the first to mention Vinland in 1070, referencing a conversation with Sweyn II of Denmark.
In 1961, archaeologists Helge and Anne Ingstad uncovered the remains of a Norse settlement at the L'Anse aux Meadows archaeological site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, Canada. A connection is frequently drawn between L'Anse aux Meadows and the Vinland sagas; but it is unlikely that Vínland was Newfoundland. Finds on Baffin Island suggest a Norse presence there after L'Anse aux Meadows was abandoned, although it has also been suggested that these might be indigenous Dorset culture artifacts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/technology/science/Vikings+visited+Canadian+Arctic+research+suggests/1635865/story.html |title="Vikings visited Canadian Arctic" Canada.com May 27, 2009 |publisher=Canada.com |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/2008/809/80912/news/nunavut/80912_1516.html |title=Nunatsiaq News September 12, 2008 |publisher=Nunatsiaqonline.ca |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl]
Few sources describing contact between Native Americans and Norse settlers exist. Contact between the Thule people, ancestors of the modern Inuit, and Norse between the 12th or 13th centuries is known. The Norse Greenlanders called these incoming settlers "skrælingar". Conflict between the Greenlanders and the "skrælings" is recorded in the Icelandic Annals. The Vinland sagas, recorded hundreds of years later, describe trade and conflict with native peoples, who were also termed skrælings, but may have been an entirely different people. Archaeological evidence for contact in Greenland is limited, but seems to indicate that the Norse did not substantially affect indigenous adaptations, technologies, or cultures.

==Possible Polynesian trans-oceanic contact==

===Claims involving sweet potato===

The sweet potato, which is native to the Americas, was widespread in Polynesia when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 AD and spread across Polynesia from there.Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994. Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press It has been suggestedLangdon, Robert. The Bamboo Raft as a Key to the Introduction of the Sweet Potato in Prehistoric Polynesia, The Journal of Pacific History, Vol.36, No.1., 2001 that it was brought by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, or that South Americans brought it to the Pacific. It is unlikely that the plant could successfully float across the ocean by natural means.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Ipomoea/index.html |title=Batatas, Not Potatoes |publisher=Botgard.ucla.edu |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl] Phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis of at least two separate introductions of sweet potatoes from South America into Polynesia, including one before and one after European contact.[tpl]citation|author=Roullier, Caroline, et al.|title=Historical collections reveal patterns of diffusion of sweet potato in Oceania obscured by modern plant movements and recombination|work=PNAS|volume=110|issue=6|date=January 22, 2013|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/6/2205 [/tpl]

===Claims based on linguistics===

Dutch linguists and specialists in Amerindian languages Willem Adelaar and Pieter Muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by Polynesian languages and language of South America. One is the name of the sweet potato, which was domesticated in the New World. Proto-Polynesian *kumala[tpl]cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for KUMALA.1 LO Sweet Potato (Ipomoea)|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kumala1/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010[/tpl] (compare Easter Island kumara, Hawaiian ʻuala, Māori kumāra; apparent cognates outside Eastern Polynesian may be borrowed from Eastern Polynesian languages, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with Quechua and Aymara k’umar ~ k’umara. A possible second is the word for 'stone axe', Easter Island toki, Mapuche toki, and further afield, Yurumangui totoki 'axe'. According to Adelaar and Muysken the similarity in the word for sweet potato, "constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific", though according to Adelaar and Muysken the word for axe is not as convincing. The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but no migrations."Genetic relations of South American Indian languages". In Adelaar & Muysken, eds, The Languages of the Andes. Cambridge University Press, 2004 p. 41. According to POLLEX-Online, Proto-Polynesian *toki "adze, axe"[tpl]cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for TOKI AN Adze, axe|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/toki/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010[/tpl] has an accepted Proto-Austronesian etymology, which implies that the similarities are either accidental, or at most, in some cases, the word was borrowed from Polynesian into South American languages.

===Genetic claims===

Geneticist Erik Thorsby and colleagues have published two studies in  Tissue Antigens that evidence an Amerindian genetic contribution to the Easter Island population, determining that it was probably introduced prior to European discovery of the island.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00717.x |title= Molecular genetic studies of natives on Easter Island: evidence of an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool | year = 2007 | last1 = Lie | first1 = B.

===Proposed sites of contact===

====Araucanía====

In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting a possibility of pre-Columbian contact between the Mapuche people (Araucanians) of south-central Chile and Polynesians. Chicken bones found at the site El Arenal in the Arauco Peninsula, an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of chicken to South America.Storey et al., p. 10335. The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish. Chicken DNA sequences taken were matched to those of chickens in American Samoa and Tonga, and dissimilar to European chicken.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.livescience.com/history/070604_polynesian_chicken.html |title= Chicken Bones Suggest Polynesians Found Americas Before Columbus |journal=Live Science |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |last=Whipps |first=Heather [/tpl][tpl]cite pmid | 17556540[/tpl] However, a later report in the same journal looking at the same mtDNA concluded that the Chilean chicken specimen clusters with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America.[tpl]cite pmid | 18663216|noedit[/tpl]
In December 2007, several human skulls  were found  in a museum in Concepción, Chile.  These skulls  originated from Mocha Island, an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, nowadays inhabited by Mapuche. Professor Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago and José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga of the University of Valparaíso  claim the skulls have "Polynesian features", such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, and they hope  to begin an excavation search for Polynesian remains on the island.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Lawler |first1= Andrew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full |title=Beyond Kon-Tiki: Did Polynesians Sail to South America?|journal=Science|date= June 11, 2010 |pages= 1344–1347 | pmid=20538927 | doi=10.1126/science.328.5984.1344 | volume=328 | issue=5984 [/tpl]

==Other theories==

===Ecuador-East Asia contact===

According to a 2013 genetic study there was contact between Ecuador and East Asia. The study suggests that the contact could have been trans-oceanic or a late-stage coastal migration that did not leave genetic imprints in North America.Roewer, Lutz, Michael Nothnagel, Leonor Gusmão, Veronica Gomes, Miguel González, Daniel Corach, Andrea Sala et al. 2013. Continent-Wide Decoupling of Y-Chromosomal Genetic Variation from Language and Geography in Native South Americans. PLOS Genetics. This contact could explain the alleged similarity between the pottery of the Valdivia culture of Ecuador and the Jōmon culture of Northeast Asia.

===Peruvian mummies===

A team of academics headed by the University of York's Mummy Research Group and BioArch,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/magazine/aprilmag08.pdf |title=28801_April08.indd |publisher=York.ac.uk |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl] while examining a Peruvian mummy at the Bolton Museum, found that it had been embalmed using a tree resin.  Before this it was thought that Peruvian mummies were naturally preserved. The resin, found to be that of an Araucaria conifer related to the 'monkey puzzle tree', was from a variety found only in Oceania and probably New Guinea. "Radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the University of Oxford's radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary, and date to around CE 1200."From the University of York Magazine, page 9, April/May 2008

===Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco===

Traces of coca and nicotine found in some Egyptian mummies have led some[tpl]who|date=April 2014[/tpl] to speculate that Ancient Egyptians may have traveled to the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German toxicologist, Svetlana Balabanova, after examining the mummy of a female priestess called Henut Taui. Follow-up tests of the hair shaft, performed to rule out contamination, gave the same results."http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm" The significance of these findings lies in the fact that both coca and tobacco plants are indigenous to the Americas and were thought not to have existed in Africa until sometime after the voyages of Columbus.Cocaine – Encyclopedia.com (2007)Tobacco – Encyclopedia.com (2007) Subsequent examination of numerous Sudanese mummies undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui."Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997. Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct. Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in Munich disputes this.  Skeptical of Balabanova's findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the Manchester Museum, had similar tests performed on samples taken from the Manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for nicotine.  Sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the Old World are discussed by the British biologist Duncan Edlin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&file=article&sid=45 |title=A look at the Evidence for Cocaine in Mummies |publisher=Thehallofmaat.com |accessdate=November 26, 2013[/tpl]
Mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&file=article&sid=45 |title=The Stoned Age? |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl]Buckland, P.C., Panagiotakopulu, E "Rameses II and the tobacco beetle" Antiquity 75: 549–56 2001 Two attempts to replicate Balabanova's finds of cocaine failed, suggesting "that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine."Counsell, D. C.,  "Intoxicants in Ancient Egypt? Opium, nymphea, coca, and tobacco," in David, Ann Rosalie, ed. Egyptian Mummies and Modern Science, Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-521-86579-1 p.213
A re-examination in the 1970s of the mummy of Ramesses II revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator, Maurice Bucaille, noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and that "it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment."Bucaille, M. Mummies of the Pharaohs: Modern Medical Investigations NY: St. Martin’s Press pp 186-188 Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabnova's research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal  Antiquity suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies "ignored their post-excavation histories" and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.

===Medieval===

====14th- and 15th-century Europe====

Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and feudal baron of Roslin (c. 1345 – c. 1400) was a Scottish nobleman. He is best known today because of a modern legend that he took part in explorations of Greenland and North America almost 100 years before Christopher Columbus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/historicalfigures/henrysinclair/ |title=Earl Henry Sinclair |publisher=Orkneyjar |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl]  Henry was the grandfather of William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, the builder of Rosslyn Chapel (near Edinburgh, Scotland). The authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight believe some carvings in the chapel to be ears of New World corn or maize.Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. The Hiram Key. Fair Winds Press, 2001 ISBN 1-931412-75-8. This crop was unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel's construction, and was not cultivated there until several hundred years later. Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry Sinclair travelled to the Americas well before Columbus. Specialists in medieval architecture interpret these carvings as stylised depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies.Mark Oxbrow & I. Robertson. Rosslyn and the Grail. Mainstream Publishing, 2005 ISBN 1-84596-076-9.Historian Mark Oxbrow, quoted in "The ship of dreams" by Diane MacLean, Scotsman.com, May 13, 2005
Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to Bartolomé de las Casas he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called Thule in 1477. Whether he actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited Bristol in 1476."It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." Bedini, Silvio A. and David Buisseret (1992). The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1, University of Michigan press, republished by Simon & Schuster, ISBN 0-13-142670-2, p. 175 Bristol was also the port from which John Cabot sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498 the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot's discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was "discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found 'Brasil' as your lordship knows".Seaver (1995) p.222 There may be records of expeditions from Bristol to find the "isle of Brazil" in 1480 and 1481.Seaver, K.A.(1995) The Frozen Echo Stanford University Press ISBN 0-8047-3161-6 p.221 Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid 15th century.
Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés records several such legends in his General y natural historia de las Indias of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The ship's pilot, a man called Alonso Sánchez,  and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth.Columbus, Christopher; Cohen, J. M. (translator) (May 5, 1992). The Four Voyages, pp. 27–37. New York: Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-044217-0.
In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476. Larsen claimed that Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst served as captains, while João Vaz Corte-Real and the possibly mythical John Scolvus served as navigators, accompanied by Álvaro Martins.Soren, Larsen. (1925) The Pining voyage: The Discovery of North America Twenty Years Before Columbus. Nothing beyond circumstantial evidence has been found to support Larsen's claims.Thomas L. Hughes, The German Discovery of America: A Review of the Controversy over Didrik Pining’s Voyage of Exploration in 1473 in the North Atlantic in: German Historical Institute Bulletin, No. 33 (Fall 2003)

====Arabic====

Early Chinese accounts of Muslim expeditions state that Muslim sailors reached a region called Mulan Pi (literally "magnolia skin") ([tpl]zh|t=木蘭皮|p=Mùlán Pí|w=Mu-lan-p'i[/tpl]). Mulan Pi is normally identified as Spain, though some fringe theories hold that it is instead some part of the Americas. The sources for this claim are Lingwai Daida (1178) by Zhou Qufei and Zhufan Zhi (1225) by Chao Jukua, together referred to as the "Sung Document".
One supporter of the interpretation of Mulan Pi as part of the Americas was historian Hui-lin Li in 1961,[tpl]Cite book|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China|volume=3|author=Joseph Needham & Colin A.

===Irish and Welsh legend===

The legend of Saint Brendan, an Irish monk, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century.  Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan myth with an early discovery of America. The voyage was recreated in recent times by Tim Severin.
According to British legend, Madoc was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used as justification for British claims to the Americas, based on the notion of a Briton arriving before other European nationalities.Williams, Gwyn A (1979): Madoc: The Making of a Myth. London: Eyre Methuen Local legend holds that Devil's Backbone, a rock formation near Louisville, Kentucky, was used as a citadel by Madoc and his companions.Falls of the Ohio - Legends & Stories  A memorial tablet erected at Fort Morgan in Mobile Bay, Alabama reads: "In memory of Prince Madog, a Welsh explorer, who landed on the shores of Mobile Bay in 1170 and left behind, with the Indians, the Welsh language." One tribe which was said to be Welsh-speaking was the Mandan.
Biologist and controversial amateur epigrapher Barry Fell claims that Irish Ogham writing has been found carved into stones in the Virginias.Sisson, David (September 1984)"Did the Irish discover America?". The Saturday Evening Post. Retrieved July 23, 2006. Linguist David H. Kelley has criticized some of Fell's work but nonetheless argued that genuine Celtic Ogham inscriptions have in fact been discovered in America."I have no personal doubts that some of the inscriptions which have been reported the Americas are genuine Celtic ogham. ... Despite my occasional harsh criticism of Fell's treatment of individual inscriptions, it should be recognized that without Fell's work there would be no American ogham problem to perplex us. We need to ask not only what Fell has done wrong in his epigraphy, but also where we have gone wrong as archaeologists in not recognizing such an extensive European presence in the New World." D. H.

===Romans===

Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of Classical Antiquity – primarily with the Roman Empire, but sometimes also with other cultures of the age – have been based on isolated alleged archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World.
The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble Roman amphora http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&kv=87136&t=objects for over 150 years.

====Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head====

A small terracotta head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 (in the Toluca Valley, 72 kilometres southwest of Mexico City) in a burial offering under three intact floors of a pre-colonial building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist Robert von Heine-Geldern, both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/jhm/arch/calix.htm |title=Roman 'head' found in Mexico |publisher=Econ.ohio-state.edu |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl] If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510)Forbes, Jack D.

According to ASU's Michael E. Smith,"http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/" John Paddock, a leading Mesoamerican scholar, used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried Post-classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.Smith, Michael E., "The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca".

====Others====

Claims of contact have often been based on occurrences of similar motifs in art and decoration, or on depictions in one World of species or objects that are thought to be characteristic of the other World. Famous examples include a Maya statuette claimed to depict a bearded man rowing, a cross in bas-relief at the Temple of the Cross in Palenque.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neara.org/jett/precolumbiantransoceanic.pdf |title=NEARA 36-2 first draft.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=February 3, 2011[/tpl] Nevertheless, most of these finds can be explained as the result of mis-interpretation. The Palenque "cross", for instance, is almost certainly a stylized maize plant.
In 1950 an Italian professor suggested that a depiction of a pineapple was represented among  wall paintings of mediterranean fruits at Pompeii. According to Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine cone from the Umbrella pine tree which is native to the Mediterranean area,[tpl]cite book|last=Jashemski|first=Wilhelmina|title=The natural history of Pompeii|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80054-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3xfjyTqqR7IC&pg=PA81&dq=%22Domenico+Casella%22+pineapple#v=onepage&q=%22Domenico%20Casella%22%20pineapple&f=false|page=81[/tpl]
The Bat Creek inscription and Los Lunas Decalogue Stone have led some to suggest the possibility that Jewish seafarers may have come to America after fleeing the Roman Empire at the time of the Jewish Revolt.Biblical Archaeology Review, July–August 1993.

===Africans===

Proposed claims for an African presence in Mesoamerica rest on attributes of the Olmec culture, the presence of an African plant species in the Americas, and interpretations of certain European and Arabic historical accounts.
The Olmec culture existed from roughly 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. The idea that the Olmecs are related to Africans was suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first colossal head at Hueyapan (now Tres Zapotes) in 1862.Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar, Jose (1869) "Antigüedades mexicanas, notable escultura antigua", in Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística, época 2, vol. 1, pp. 292–297, Mexico, as well as Melgar, Jose (1871) "Estudio sobre la antigüedad y el origen de la Cabeza Colosal de tipo etiópico que existe en Hueyapan del cantón de los Tuxtlas" in Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística, época 2, vol. 3, pp. 104–109; Mexico. More recently, Ivan van Sertima has argued that these statues depict settlers or explorers from Africa, but his views have been the target of severe scholarly criticism."CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Robbing Native Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs," in Current Anthropology, Vol. 38, no. 3 (June 1997), 419-441
