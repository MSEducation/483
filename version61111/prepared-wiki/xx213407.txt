Ecallantide (trade name Kalbitor, investigational name DX-88) is a drug used for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and in the prevention of blood loss in cardiothoracic surgery.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lehmann A |title=Ecallantide (DX-88), a plasma kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of hereditary angioedema and the prevention of blood loss in on-pump cardiothoracic surgery |journal=Expert Opin Biol Ther |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=1187–99 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18613770 |doi=10.1517/14712598.8.8.1187 |url=[/tpl] It is an inhibitor of the protein kallikrein and a 60-amino acid polypeptide which was developed from a Kunitz domain through phage display to mimic antibodies inhibiting kallikrein. On November 27, 2009, ecallantide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema for persons over 16 years of age.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713401 |title=FDA Approves Ecallantide for Hereditary Angioedema |last=Waknine |first=Yael |publisher=Medscape |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-07[/tpl]
If approved for cardiothoracic surgery, it could become a replacement for aprotinin,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] which was withdrawn in 2007 after being shown to cause complications.

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effects are headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. Less common, but observed in more than 5% of patients in clinical trials, are respiratory tract infections, fever, vomiting, itching and upper abdominal pain. Up to 4% of patients showed anaphylaxis, which lead to a black box warning in the US.[tpl]cite web |author=Dyax Corp. |year=2009 |title=Full prescibing information Kalbitor |url=http://www.kalbitor.com/pdf/KalbitorFullPrescribingInformation.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-02[/tpl]

==Interactions==

[tpl]as of|2011[/tpl], no interaction studies have been conducted.

==Mechanism of action==

HAE is caused by a mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene. Defective or missing C1-inhibitor permits activation of kallikrein, a protease that is responsible for liberating bradykinin from its precursor kininogen.[tpl]cite pmid|1313585[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Stefan Offermanns|author2=Walter Rosenthal|title=Encyclopedia of Molecular Pharmacology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iwwo5gx8aX8C&pg=PA673|accessdate=11 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-38916-3|pages=673–[/tpl] An excess of bradykinin leads to fluid leakage from blood vessels, causing swelling of tissues typical of HAE.
Ecallantide suppresses this pathogenetic mechanism by selectively and reversibly inhibiting the activity of plasma kallikrein.
